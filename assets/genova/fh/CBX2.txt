# CBX2

## Overview
CBX2 (chromobox 2) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Polycomb group (PcG) family, which plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. The protein encoded by CBX2 is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), functioning primarily as a transcriptional repressor by recognizing and binding to specific histone modifications, such as trimethylated lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) (van2021Biological). This interaction is crucial for maintaining the repressive chromatin state, thereby influencing processes such as cell differentiation, development, and stem cell pluripotency. CBX2 is also involved in the regulation of neuronal differentiation and has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including disorders of sex development and certain cancers, where its dysregulation can lead to significant pathological outcomes (Gu2018CBX2; Jangal2019Beyond).

## Structure
The CBX2 protein is characterized by several structural features that contribute to its function in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It contains a chromodomain (CD) at the N-terminus, which is crucial for binding to lysine 27-methylated histone H3 (H3K27me3) (Kawaguchi2017Phosphorylation). This domain has a hydrophobic surface and an aromatic cage that accommodates methylated lysine residues, although it binds with lower affinity compared to HP1 homologs (Kaustov2011Recognition). The chromodomain's structure includes a pocket lined with aromatic residues and sometimes acidic side chains (Kaustov2011Recognition).

CBX2 also features a serine-rich (SR) region, which is a major site for phosphorylation by casein kinase II (CK2). This post-translational modification enhances CBX2's specificity for H3K27me3-modified nucleosomes and affects its DNA-binding activity (Kawaguchi2017Phosphorylation). The protein includes an AT-hook motif, which is involved in DNA binding and is influenced by phosphorylation (Kawaguchi2017Phosphorylation).

The C-terminal region of CBX2 contains a polycomb repressor box (PcBox) that mediates interactions with Ring1 family proteins (Kawaguchi2017Phosphorylation). CBX2 can form multimeric complexes, indicating a quaternary structure, although specific details on this aspect are limited in the provided context. Splice variants may result in different isoforms with distinct functions, but specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
CBX2 (chromobox 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which plays a crucial role in maintaining the transcriptional repression of target genes. CBX2 is important for cell differentiation, development, and maintaining stem cell pluripotency. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to chromatin and influences epigenetic modifications.

CBX2 is a part of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which are essential epigenetic regulators that modify the chromatin landscape to repress gene expression. It is involved in the repression of genes to maintain stem cell fates or committed states by recognizing specific histone marks like H3K27me3, which are associated with gene repression (van2021Biological). CBX2 is also involved in the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells and is expressed at elevated levels upon differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). It promotes differentiation by supporting the compaction of nucleosome organization, facilitating the formation of heterochromatin (van2021Biological).

In neuronal development, CBX2 acts as a negative regulator by inhibiting neurite development. It achieves this by interacting with the promoter regions of neuron-specific genes and regulating their expression. CBX2 is a direct target of miR-124, a microRNA that promotes neuronal differentiation, forming a negative feedback loop that regulates neuronal differentiation (Gu2018CBX2). CBX2's role in neuronal differentiation involves the recruitment of PRC1 complexes that catalyze ubiquitylation of histone H2A on lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub), further contributing to gene repression (Gu2018CBX2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the CBX2 gene are associated with several disorders of sex development (DSD) and certain cancers. In the context of DSD, CBX2 mutations can lead to conditions such as 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis, where individuals with a typical male chromosome pattern develop female or ambiguous sexual characteristics. Variants in the CBX2.2 isoform, such as p.Cys132Arg and p.Cys154fs, have been identified in patients with 46,XY DSD, suggesting these mutations impair the regulation of genes crucial for sex development, like EMX2 and HOXA13 (P2020CBX2dependent; Sproll2018Assembling). 

CBX2 is also implicated in ovarian function, with its dysregulation linked to conditions like premature ovarian failure (POF) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The CBX2.1 isoform regulates genes involved in ovarian health, and its dysfunction can lead to ovarian dysgenesis (Bouazzi2019The).

In cancer, CBX2 is often overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in various types, including breast, lung, and prostate cancers. It plays a role in maintaining cancer stem cells and promoting metastasis, making it a potential target for anti-cancer therapies (Jangal2019Beyond).

## Interactions
CBX2 is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. It binds to histone H3 when trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a key interaction that facilitates chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression (Gao2012PCGF). CBX2's chromodomain is crucial for this binding, enhancing its specificity for H3K27me3-modified nucleosomes (Kawaguchi2017Phosphorylation).

CBX2 also interacts with other PRC1 components, such as RING1b, Phc1, and Mel18, to recruit them to mitotic chromosomes. This recruitment is essential for the stable association of PRC1 with chromatin during mitosis (Zhen2014Cbx2). The interaction between CBX2 and RING1b is particularly important, as demonstrated by the failure of a CBX2 mutant lacking the chromobox domain to recruit RING1b (Zhen2014Cbx2).

Phosphorylation of CBX2 by casein kinase II (CK2) modulates its interactions with nucleic acids, inhibiting its DNA-binding activity and enhancing its specificity for H3K27me3 nucleosomes (Kawaguchi2017Phosphorylation). This phosphorylation also prevents CBX2 from binding single-stranded RNA, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for its chromatin interactions (Kawaguchi2017Phosphorylation).
