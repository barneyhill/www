# FZD4

## Overview
FZD4 is a gene that encodes the frizzled class receptor 4, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is integral to the Wnt signaling pathway. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure and plays a pivotal role in both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways, influencing processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Seemab2019Molecular; Xiao2019Familial). The FZD4 protein is particularly significant in retinal vascular development, where it interacts with ligands like Norrin and WNT5A to mediate signal transduction (DeBruine2017Wnt5a; Ye2010The). Mutations in the FZD4 gene are linked to familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), a condition that can lead to severe visual impairment due to abnormal retinal vascularization (Robitaille2002Mutant; Musada2016Mutation). The structural and functional attributes of FZD4 underscore its critical role in cellular signaling and its implications in human disease.

## Structure
The FZD4 protein is a member of the frizzled receptor family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure typical of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Seemab2019Molecular; Xiao2019Familial). It consists of 537 amino acids and includes several key structural domains: an N-terminal extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD), seven transmembrane domains, three extracellular loops, three intracellular loops, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Xiao2019Familial; Musada2016Mutation). The CRD is crucial for ligand recognition and binding, particularly with Wnt ligands and Norrin, and is stabilized by five disulfide bridges (Xiao2019Familial; Shen2015Structural).

The C-terminal region contains conserved PDZ-binding motifs, such as KTXXXW and ETVV, which are essential for recruiting downstream signaling proteins (Musada2016Mutation). The FZD4 protein can form homodimers, a feature that is significant for its function in Wnt signaling (Qian2024Structural). Post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, may occur, and alternative splicing can result in different isoforms of the protein (Seemab2019Molecular). These structural features are critical for FZD4's role in cellular signaling and its involvement in diseases such as familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) (Seemab2019Molecular).

## Function
FZD4 (frizzled class receptor 4) is a G-protein coupled receptor that plays a critical role in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. FZD4 is involved in both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways. In the noncanonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, FZD4 interacts with Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins, particularly Dvl3, to regulate cell polarity and migration. This interaction is crucial for the organization of the arterial network and endothelial cell proliferation, especially in the context of retinal vascular development (Descamps2012Frizzled).

FZD4 is predominantly localized at the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the relocalization and activation of Dvl3, influencing the recruitment of α-tubulin and promoting cell migration and polarization (Descamps2012Frizzled). The receptor's activity is also linked to the repression of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, as it can inhibit β-catenin transcriptional activity, favoring noncanonical signaling pathways (Descamps2012Frizzled).

Structurally, FZD4 can form monomeric and dimeric complexes, with dimerization playing a role in specific signaling contexts, such as Norrin activation (Qian2024Structural). The interaction with Dvl proteins involves specific conserved residues, highlighting a common mechanism across the Frizzled receptor family (Qian2024Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FZD4 gene are associated with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal retinal vascular development. FEVR can lead to complications such as neovascularization and retinal detachment, potentially resulting in blindness (Robitaille2002Mutant; Musada2016Mutation). FZD4 mutations disrupt the Norrin/β-catenin signaling pathway, crucial for retinal vascular development, by impairing the binding of Norrin to the FZD4 receptor. This disruption affects the recruitment of the cytoplasmic effector Dishevelled, leading to aberrant downstream signaling (Xiao2019Familial; Dai2024Identification).

The mutations in FZD4 are diverse, including missense, frameshift, nonsense, insertion, deletion, and splicing mutations, with missense mutations being the most common (Dai2024Identification). These mutations can lead to a loss of function, as seen in the impaired activation of the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, which is evidenced by reduced CAMKII autophosphorylation and PKC translocation (Robitaille2002Mutant). The phenotypic variability in FEVR is linked to the specific mutations in FZD4, with more severe phenotypes associated with mutations that significantly impair protein expression and function (Dai2024Identification).

## Interactions
FZD4, a member of the Frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors, interacts with several proteins and ligands, playing a significant role in the Wnt signaling pathway. It serves as a receptor for the Norrin ligand, which specifically binds to FZD4 with high affinity, activating the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway when co-expressed with the LRP5 coreceptor (Ye2010The; Shen2015Structural). This interaction is crucial for retinal vascular development and is highly specific, as Norrin does not bind to other Frizzled receptors (Ye2010The).

FZD4 also interacts with WNT5A, which promotes the assembly of FZD4 signalosomes by stabilizing the dimerization of its cysteine-rich domains (CRDs). This interaction is facilitated by the binding of palmitoleic acid, which coordinates with two FZD4 CRDs, stabilizing their dimerization and promoting oligomerization (DeBruine2017Wnt5a). Mutations in the palmitoleoyl-binding groove of the FZD4 CRD can disrupt these interactions, affecting WNT5A signaling (DeBruine2017Wnt5a).

Additionally, FZD4 is involved in forming complexes with Dishevelled proteins and LRP5/6 co-receptors, which are essential for Wnt signalosome assembly and subsequent signaling events (DeBruine2017Wnt5a). These interactions highlight FZD4's role in mediating critical signaling pathways involved in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
