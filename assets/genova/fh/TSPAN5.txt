# TSPAN5

## Overview
TSPAN5 is a gene that encodes the protein tetraspanin 5, a member of the tetraspanin family characterized by its four transmembrane domains. Tetraspanin 5 is involved in organizing molecular interactions at the cell membrane, influencing processes such as cell adhesion, signaling, and protein trafficking. It is a part of the TspanC8 subgroup, which is distinguished by having eight cysteine residues in its large extracellular domain, facilitating interactions with proteins like ADAM10, a metalloprotease involved in cellular processes (Haining2012The; Eschenbrenner2019TspanC8). TSPAN5 plays a significant role in modulating cellular signaling pathways, including those related to serotonin biosynthesis and metabolism, and is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including neuronal development and cancer progression (Gupta2016TSPAN5; Juenger2005Tetraspanin‐5).

## Structure
TSPAN5, a member of the tetraspanin family, is characterized by four transmembrane domains, a small extracellular loop, and a large extracellular loop containing conserved cysteine residues. These cysteines are crucial for forming disulfide bonds, which are important for the protein's structural integrity (Haining2012The). TSPAN5 is part of the TspanC8 subgroup, which is distinguished by having eight cysteine residues in the large extracellular domain, unlike other tetraspanins that have fewer cysteines (Haining2012The).

The large extracellular loop (LEL) of TSPAN5 is essential for its interaction with ADAM10, a metalloprotease involved in various cellular processes. Mutations in specific motifs within the LEL can disrupt this interaction, affecting ADAM10's function and retention (Eschenbrenner2019TspanC8). TSPAN5 undergoes palmitoylation, a post-translational modification that is crucial for its function and interaction with ADAM10 (Eschenbrenner2019TspanC8).

TSPAN5 forms part of the tetraspanin web, a network of interactions that organizes molecular interactions at the cell membrane, influencing processes like cell adhesion and signaling (SaintPol2017Regulation). The protein's structure allows it to form complexes with other proteins, impacting cell signaling pathways such as Notch signaling (Xie2021Tspan5).

## Function
TSPAN5, a member of the tetraspanin family, plays a significant role in various cellular processes by forming molecular complexes within the plasma membrane. These complexes are involved in modulating cellular signaling pathways, including those related to serotonin biosynthesis and metabolism. TSPAN5 influences the expression of serotonin pathway enzymes such as TPH1, TPH2, DDC, and MAOA, as well as the serotonin transporter SLC6A4, suggesting its involvement in serotonin regulation (Gupta2016TSPAN5).

TSPAN5 is also implicated in the regulation of ADAM10, a disintegrin and metalloprotease. It promotes ADAM10 endocytosis and affects its maturation and cell surface expression. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and may influence processes like Notch signaling, which is important for cell differentiation and development (Haining2012The; Eschenbrenner2019TspanC8).

In the cerebellum, TSPAN5 expression correlates with neuronal maturation, particularly in Purkinje cells, where it may influence dendritogenesis and synaptogenesis. This suggests a role in neuronal development and differentiation, potentially by interacting with integrins and protein kinase C to facilitate neurite outgrowth and synapse formation (Juenger2005Tetraspanin‐5).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TSPAN5 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and neuropsychiatric disorders. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TSPAN5 expression is significantly associated with tumor progression, including invasive depth and TNM stage. High levels of TSPAN5 are linked to increased tumor invasiveness and later clinical stages, suggesting its role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis through the activation of Notch signaling (Xie2021Tspan5).

In the context of neuropsychiatric disorders, TSPAN5 influences serotonin and kynurenine concentrations, which are critical in conditions such as alcohol use disorder (AUD). TSPAN5 expression is downregulated in response to ethanol and acamprosate treatment, affecting serotonin biosynthesis and metabolism. This downregulation is associated with treatment outcomes in AUD patients, indicating that TSPAN5 may serve as a biomarker for treatment response (Ho2020TSPAN5).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), TSPAN5 is targeted by miR-155, which reduces its expression and contributes to increased stemness and chemoresistance. This interaction suggests that TSPAN5 plays a critical role in regulating cancer cell behavior and could be a potential therapeutic target (Yang2020miR‐155).

## Interactions
TSPAN5 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in synaptic function and protein trafficking. It forms complexes with GluA2 and Stargazin, which are crucial for AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking and exocytosis. These interactions occur in recycling endosomes, where TSPAN5 is associated with Rab11-positive endosomes, indicating its role in directing AMPARs to the plasma membrane (Moretto2023The). TSPAN5 also interacts with the AP4 complex, specifically the AP4σ subunit, which is involved in intracellular trafficking of transmembrane proteins, including AMPARs. This interaction is validated through GST pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Moretto2023The).

In mature neurons, TSPAN5 stabilizes or sorts GluA2 receptors within intracellular vesicles, interacting with MyosinVa, a motor protein involved in the transport of recycling endosomes to the membrane surface (moretto2016tspan5). TSPAN5's interaction with the AP-4 complex is crucial for maintaining the correct amount of GluA2 receptors on the cell surface, highlighting its role in receptor recycling (moretto2016tspan5). These interactions underscore TSPAN5's importance in synaptic plasticity and neuronal function.
