# INO80C

## Overview
The INO80C gene encodes the INO80 complex subunit C, a vital component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex. This complex is integral to various nuclear processes, including transcription, DNA replication, and repair, by modulating chromatin structure. The INO80C protein is involved in nucleosome remodeling, facilitating access to DNA through ATP-dependent mechanisms, which include sliding nucleosomes, replacing histones, or removing them entirely (Conaway2009The). It plays a significant role in DNA repair, particularly in the repair of double-strand breaks and the activation of DNA damage checkpoints (Conaway2009The). Additionally, INO80C is implicated in transcriptional regulation and the eviction of histone variants, which are crucial for gene expression regulation (Poli2017The; Zahedi2023An). The gene's involvement in various cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and its potential implications in disease, particularly cancer.

## Function
The INO80 complex subunit C (INO80C) is a crucial component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating various nuclear processes in healthy human cells. INO80C is involved in the remodeling of nucleosomes, which is essential for facilitating access to DNA during transcription, replication, and repair processes (Conaway2009The). The complex uses ATP hydrolysis to slide nucleosomes along DNA, replace canonical histones with histone variants, or remove histones and nucleosomes from DNA, thereby regulating the accessibility of DNA (Conaway2009The).

In the context of DNA repair, INO80C is involved in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and the activation of DNA damage checkpoints. It is recruited to DSBs and aids in the repair process, potentially through interactions with phosphorylated histone H2AX (Conaway2009The). INO80C also plays a role in transcriptional regulation by promoting transcription at transcription start sites and limiting inappropriate transcription at promoters (Poli2017The). Additionally, it is involved in the eviction of the histone variant H2A.Z from nucleosomes, which is crucial for proper gene expression regulation during cellular quiescence (Zahedi2023An).

## Clinical Significance
The INO80C gene, a subunit of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, has been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the INO80C gene forms a fusion with SETBP1, resulting in the INO80C::SETBP1 fusion gene. This fusion is associated with dysregulated SETBP1 function, contributing to oncogenesis through aberrant upregulation of oncogenes and dysregulation of immune-related pathways (Li2022Identification). 

In the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and other cancers, INO80C is suggested to have a potential tumor suppressor role, especially in the presence of KRAS mutations. However, its exact role remains to be fully characterized, as it may also be involved in tumor-promoting activities (Hasan2019The). 

Alterations in INO80C and other subunits of the INO80 complex are frequently observed in multiple cancers, often co-occurring with disruptions in the mTORC1 pathway, which suggests a link to metabolic dysregulation in tumorigenesis (Hasan2019The). These findings highlight the complex role of INO80C in cancer biology, where it may act as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene depending on the context.

## Interactions
The INO80C protein is a component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription, DNA replication, and repair. INO80C interacts with various protein complexes and nucleic acids to facilitate these processes. It physically interacts with the Mec1-Ddc2 and PAF1C complexes, as demonstrated by chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry studies. These interactions occur in exposed domains suitable for protein-protein contacts, such as the Ino80 helicase SANT-associated (HSA) domain, although a stable trimeric complex is not formed (Poli2016Mec1).

INO80C is also involved in the removal of RNA polymerase II from chromatin during DNA damage and replication stress, requiring interaction with Cdc48, which aids in protein degradation by the 26S proteasome. This interaction is essential for the proteasome-dependent degradation of histones following DNA damage, a process activated by the Mec1-Ddc2 checkpoint kinase (Poli2017The).

The Arp5-Ies6 module within the INO80 complex, which includes INO80C, is crucial for coupling ATPase activity to nucleosome sliding and binds to H2A/H2B dimers, facilitating histone exchange through partial DNA unwrapping around the H2A/H2B interface (Ayala2018Structure).
