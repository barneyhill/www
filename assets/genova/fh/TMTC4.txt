# TMTC4

## Overview
TMTC4 is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane O-mannosyltransferase targeting cadherins 4, which is a crucial component of the O-mannosylation pathway. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a significant role in protein folding and the unfolded protein response. TMTC4 is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are essential for its function in glycosylation processes (Eisenhaber2021Conserved; Graham2020Endoplasmic). The protein's enzymatic activity as a sugar transferase is vital for the modification of cadherins, impacting cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). TMTC4's involvement in calcium dynamics within the ER further underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing physiological processes such as proliferation and apoptosis (Makboul2021Transmembrane).

## Structure
The TMTC4 protein is an integral membrane protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in O-mannosylation. It is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes multiple transmembrane domains and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. TMTC4 contains 10 to 12 transmembrane regions, with the N-terminal segment embedded in the membrane and the C-terminal TPR domains facing the ER lumen (Li2018Deletion; Eisenhaber2021Conserved; Graham2020Endoplasmic).

The protein is composed of 741 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 83 kDa (Li2018Deletion). The TPR motifs, numbering eight, are involved in protein-protein interactions and are thought to form super helical structures that facilitate these interactions (Graham2020Endoplasmic). These motifs are crucial for the protein's function in forming and regulating multiprotein complexes (Li2018Deletion).

TMTC4 is also associated with post-translational modifications, such as N-linked glycosylation, which confirms its residency in the ER (Graham2020Endoplasmic). The protein's involvement in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and its potential role in hearing loss have been noted, highlighting its functional significance in cellular processes (Li2018Deletion).

## Function
TMTC4 is a member of the TMTC family of genes, which encode proteins involved in the O-mannosylation pathway, a process crucial for the modification of cadherin and protocadherin proteins. This pathway is essential for protein stability and cell-cell adhesion (Larsen2019Multiple; Eisenhaber2021Conserved). TMTC4 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a significant role in protein folding and the unfolded protein response, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Makboul2021Transmembrane; Graham2020Endoplasmic).

The protein contains multiple transmembrane segments and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and may aid in substrate recruitment (Larsen2019Multiple; Graham2020Endoplasmic). TMTC4 is suggested to have enzymatic activity as a sugar transferase, facilitating the transfer of sugar moieties to cadherins, thereby influencing cell adhesion and signaling processes (Eisenhaber2021Conserved).

In healthy human cells, TMTC4's function is linked to the regulation of calcium dynamics in the ER, which is vital for various physiological processes, including proliferation and apoptosis (Makboul2021Transmembrane). Its activity in the ER is crucial for proper protein processing and modification, impacting cellular communication and tissue integrity (Graham2020Endoplasmic).

## Clinical Significance
TMTC4 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in protein glycosylation and cellular processes. In prostate cancer, TMTC4 is significantly upregulated, making it a potential diagnostic marker with high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing prostate cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (Makboul2021Transmembrane). The overexpression of TMTC4 in prostate cancer tissues suggests its involvement in cancer cell survival pathways and posttranslational modifications of cadherins, which are crucial in cancer development (Makboul2021Transmembrane).

Conversely, in sarcoma, downregulation of TMTC4 is associated with improved prognosis. Lower expression levels of TMTC4 correlate with better overall survival and disease-specific survival, particularly in patients with high dendritic cell infiltration (Li2024Downregulation). This suggests that TMTC4 expression levels may influence immune cell interactions and tumor progression in sarcoma.

TMTC4 is also part of a family of proteins involved in O-mannosylation, a process essential for the modification of cadherin-like proteins. Mutations or dysregulation in TMTC4 can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, affecting multiple systems and potentially resulting in developmental delays and neurological issues (Eisenhaber2021Conserved).

## Interactions
TMTC4, a member of the transmembrane O-mannosyltransferase family, is involved in the O-mannosylation of cadherins, which are crucial for cell-cell adhesion. This protein is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. TMTC4 is associated with the ER calcium ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) and calnexin, suggesting a role in calcium homeostasis and the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Makboul2021Transmembrane). 

The TMTC4 protein is part of a larger family that includes TMTC1, TMTC2, and TMTC3, all of which are involved in the O-mannosylation of cadherins. These proteins share structural homology with known sugar transferases and are predicted to have similar mechanisms of action, involving conserved sequence motifs that are crucial for ligand binding and catalysis (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). The presence of conserved motifs like SHKSYRP and KET(Q)xxT in TMTC4 suggests its involvement in interactions with ligands and possibly other proteins (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). 

TMTC4's interactions are significant for its function in glycosylation pathways and may influence cellular processes such as adhesion and signaling, although specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available context.
