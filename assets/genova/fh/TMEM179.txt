# TMEM179

## Overview
TMEM179 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 179, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in modulating neurotoxic and protective effects. TMEM179 interacts with protein kinase C beta (PKCβ), influencing apoptotic pathways and cellular responses to oxidative stress. The gene's expression and function have been linked to several health conditions, including arsenic-induced neurotoxicity and Alzheimer's disease, where it may serve as a potential therapeutic target. Additionally, TMEM179 has been associated with microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer and optic nerve axon necrosis, highlighting its significance in both neurological and oncological contexts (Raghavendran2020Stagedifferentiated; Stiemke2020Systems; Dawson2023Locus; He2021NAC).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM179 has been implicated in several health conditions due to its role in cellular processes. Alterations in TMEM179 expression have been associated with arsenic-induced neurotoxicity. Arsenic exposure decreases TMEM179 expression, leading to increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment can counteract these effects by restoring TMEM179 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for arsenic-induced neurotoxicity (He2021NAC).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, TMEM179 has been identified as a modulator of neurodegenerative processes. It is involved in mitochondrial maintenance and apoptotic pathways, potentially inhibiting apoptosis by suppressing protein kinase C β (PKCβ), which is associated with memory and learning (Dawson2023Locus).

TMEM179 mutations have also been linked to microsatellite instability (MSI) in colorectal cancer, a known marker in the disease's progression (Raghavendran2020Stagedifferentiated). Additionally, TMEM179 is part of a quantitative trait locus associated with optic nerve axon necrosis, relevant to glaucoma, although its role may be limited due to its association with photoreceptor segments (Stiemke2020Systems).

## Interactions
TMEM179 is involved in interactions with protein kinase C beta (PKCβ), a protein that plays a significant role in transmembrane signal conduction and is often associated with learning and memory processes. TMEM179 is thought to inhibit apoptosis by suppressing PKCβ activity, which is crucial for its role in modulating neurotoxic and protective effects in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and other neural cells (Dawson2023Locus). 

In the context of arsenic-induced neurotoxicity, TMEM179 interacts with PKCβ to influence the expression of apoptosis-related proteins such as cleaved-PARP, cleaved-CASPASE-3, BAX, and BCL-2. Arsenic exposure increases the expression of phosphorylated PKCβ (p-PKCβ), while overexpression of TMEM179 decreases it, suggesting a regulatory interaction that mitigates oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (He2021NAC). 

These interactions highlight TMEM179's role in cellular protective mechanisms, particularly in the nervous system, where it may influence neurodegenerative processes and cell viability through its modulation of PKCβ and related apoptotic pathways (Dawson2023Locus; He2021NAC).
