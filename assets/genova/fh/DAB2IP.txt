# DAB2IP

## Overview
DAB2IP, or Disabled homolog 2-interacting protein, is a gene that encodes a Ras-GTPase-activating protein involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, and migration. The DAB2IP protein functions as a scaffold protein, coordinating critical signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt and ASK1, which are essential for cell survival and apoptosis (Xie2009DAB2IP). It is characterized by several functional domains, including a C2 domain, a RasGAP domain, a proline-rich domain, and a leucine zipper domain, which facilitate its role in signal transduction and protein interactions (Chen2002Differential). DAB2IP acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression frequently downregulated in various cancers, often due to epigenetic modifications such as promoter methylation (Samadaian2018A). The protein's involvement in maintaining chromosomal stability and modulating oncogenic pathways underscores its significance in cancer biology and therapy resistance (Bellazzo2016Block; Yu2021Mitotic).

## Structure
The DAB2IP protein is a member of the RasGAP gene family and has a predicted molecular weight of 110 kD. It is encoded by a full-length cDNA sequence that translates into a 967-amino-acid protein. The protein structure includes several functional domains: a C2 domain from amino acids 21-110, a RasGAP domain from amino acids 135-438, a proline-rich domain from amino acids 727-736, and a leucine zipper domain from amino acids 842-861 (Chen2002Differential). These domains are crucial for its role in signal transduction and interaction with other proteins.

DAB2IP acts as a scaffold protein, coordinating the PI3K-Akt and ASK1 pathways, which are essential for cell survival and apoptosis. The protein contains a PR domain that is critical for binding to the p85 subunit of PI3K, inhibiting the PI3K-Akt pathway, and activating ASK1 (Xie2009DAB2IP). Phosphorylation at S604 is a key post-translational modification that influences DAB2IP's activity and its interaction with other proteins (Xie2009DAB2IP).

The DAB2IP gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple mRNA splice variants, which may lead to different protein isoforms with distinct functions (Chen2002Differential). The loss of DAB2IP expression, often due to epigenetic regulation, is associated with aggressive prostate cancer and other cancer types (Xie2009DAB2IP).

## Function
DAB2IP, a member of the Ras-GTPase-activating protein family, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, and migration. It is involved in the transduction of TRAF2-induced ASK1-JNK activation, a key signaling pathway in endothelial cells. Upon TNF stimulation, DAB2IP dissociates from TNFR1 and translocates to the cytoplasm, where it forms a complex with TRADD, RIP1, TRAF2, and ASK1, specifically activating the ASK1-JNK pathway while inhibiting the IKK-NF-B signaling pathway (Zhang2004AIP1DAB2IP).

DAB2IP is highly expressed in endothelial cells and is localized on the plasma membrane in a complex with TNFR1 in its inactive form. Upon activation, it translocates to the cytoplasm, where it interacts with TRAF2 and ASK1, enhancing TRAF2-induced ASK1 activation (Zhang2004AIP1DAB2IP). This interaction is critical for directing TRAF2 signaling towards the ASK1-JNK pathway, playing a pro-apoptotic role in TNF signaling (Zhang2004AIP1DAB2IP).

DAB2IP also functions as a tumor suppressor, with its expression being down-regulated in various cancers. It is primarily located in the cytoplasm, suggesting its functional role in regulating cellular signaling pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Liu2012Expression).

## Clinical Significance
DAB2IP is a tumor suppressor gene implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression or mutations. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the downregulation of DAB2IP is associated with resistance to ionizing radiation, poor survival, and therapy resistance. This resistance is linked to enhanced DNA repair mechanisms, as DAB2IP-negative cells exhibit faster double-strand break repair kinetics. The loss of DAB2IP leads to increased PARP-1 protein expression, suggesting a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism (Yun2019Downregulation).

In gastrointestinal cancers, such as gastric and colorectal cancers, DAB2IP exhibits frameshift mutations, particularly in cancers with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H). These mutations result in truncated proteins and are present in a significant percentage of MSI-H cancers, though they do not correlate with specific clinicopathologic features (Son2018DAB2IP).

In medulloblastoma, a common malignant brain tumor in children, DAB2IP is downregulated due to EZH2-induced trimethylation, correlating with poor overall survival. Its reduced expression leads to resistance to stress-induced apoptosis and irradiation-induced cell death (Smits2012EZH2Regulated).

In prostate cancer, DAB2IP downregulation is associated with malignant behavior and resistance to radiation therapy. This downregulation is often due to promoter methylation, which is a prevalent mechanism of inactivation in prostate cancer (Samadaian2018A).

## Interactions
DAB2IP, also known as DOC-2/DAB2 interactive protein, is involved in numerous protein interactions that influence various cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) and stabilizes the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) by binding to its co-activator Cdc20, which is crucial for maintaining the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and chromosomal stability during mitosis (Yu2021Mitotic). DAB2IP is phosphorylated by Cdk1 at Thr531 and Thr546, activating the PLK1-Mps1 signaling pathway and enhancing the stability of the APC/C-MCC complex (Yu2021Mitotic).

DAB2IP also interacts with Plk1, promoting its activation and facilitating the phosphorylation of BubR1, a core component of the mitotic checkpoint complex, which is essential for kinetochore-microtubule attachment and chromosome congression (Yu2016Tumor). The protein binds to the p85 subunit of PI3K through its proline-rich (PR) domain, inhibiting PI3K-Akt signaling and activating the ASK1 pathway (Bellazzo2016Block; Xie2009DAB2IP). DAB2IP also interacts with GSK3β, promoting its activation and counteracting WNT signaling (Bellazzo2016Block). These interactions highlight DAB2IP's role as a modulator of oncogenic pathways and its involvement in maintaining chromosomal stability.
