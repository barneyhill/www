# RGS7

## Overview
RGS7, or Regulator of G protein signaling 7, is a gene that encodes a member of the RGS protein family, which are pivotal modulators of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. The RGS7 protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), specifically targeting Gα subunits to accelerate GTP hydrolysis, thereby inactivating G proteins and terminating signal transduction. This protein is characterized by its modular structure, including an RGS domain, a GGL (G protein gamma-like) domain, and DEP (Disheveled, Egl-10, Pleckstrin) and DHEX (DEP helical extension) domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins such as Gβ5 and R7BP. Predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, RGS7 plays a crucial role in neuronal signaling, influencing processes like vision, learning, and memory. Its involvement in various GPCR systems, such as mGluR and GABA(B), underscores its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts, including mood disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (Liapis2012Subcellular; Shuey1998RGS7; Patil2018Structural).

## Structure
RGS7 is a protein characterized by a modular structure, comprising several distinct domains that contribute to its function in G protein signaling. The primary structure of RGS7 includes the RGS domain, which is responsible for accelerating GTP hydrolysis on Gα protein subunits, acting as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) (Anderson2009The). The secondary structure features a GGL (G protein gamma-like) domain that specifically binds to the Gβ5 subunit, forming a coiled-coil interaction (Anderson2009The). The DEP (Disheveled, Egl-10, Pleckstrin) and DHEX (DEP helical extension) domains form a single functional unit, interacting with membrane proteins such as R7BP (Patil2018Structural).

The tertiary structure of RGS7 reveals a high degree of conformity to an all-helical bundle organization, with the RGS domain stabilizing the Gα subunit in the transition state of GTP hydrolysis (Anderson2009The). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a heterodimer with Gβ5, where the Gβ5 subunit forms the core of the molecule with a typical β-propeller fold, making extensive contacts with RGS7 domains at four main interfaces: the DEP domain, the DHEX-GGL linker, the GGL domain, and the RGS domain (Patil2018Structural). The interaction with R7BP induces long-range conformational changes, crucial for regulating diverse GPCR pathways (Patil2018Structural).

## Function
RGS7 (Regulator of G protein signaling 7) is a critical modulator of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways in healthy human cells. It functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Gα subunits, specifically enhancing the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gαi and Gαo proteins, which leads to the inactivation of these G proteins and termination of the signaling cascade (Shuey1998RGS7). RGS7 is particularly involved in attenuating signal transduction processes mediated by Gαq proteins, which are crucial for various cellular processes, including calcium mobilization (Shuey1998RGS7).

In the central nervous system, RGS7 is predominantly expressed and plays a significant role in neuronal signaling. It is involved in regulating multiple GPCR systems, such as mGluR in the retina and GABA(B) in the hippocampus, influencing processes like vision, learning, memory, and drug addiction (Patil2018Structural). The RGS7 protein forms a complex with the Gβ5 subunit and R7BP, which is essential for its stability and function, affecting its interaction with other components of the G-protein signaling cascade (Patil2018Structural).

RGS7 is primarily localized in cytoplasmic puncta and at the plasma membrane, where it co-localizes with R7BP and Gα subunits, suggesting its involvement in dynamic G protein signaling (Liapis2012Subcellular). This localization pattern indicates that RGS7 may have roles beyond traditional membrane-associated signaling, potentially participating in novel cellular compartments (Liapis2012Subcellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RGS7 gene have been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric conditions. A stop-loss variant in the RGS7 gene has been identified in a patient with a subtype of Alzheimer's disease characterized by abnormal copper levels, known as CuAD. This variant results in the loss of a stop codon, leading to an extended protein sequence, which may affect the protein's function and its role in copper trafficking. Although the data are descriptive, this suggests a potential link between RGS7 mutations and Alzheimer's disease, particularly in subtypes with copper dysregulation (Squitti2023NonCeruloplasmin).

In the context of mood disorders, alterations in RGS7 expression have been associated with depression-related behaviors. Studies using animal models have shown that the absence of RGS7 results in antidepressant-like behaviors and increased resilience to stress. This effect is mediated through the interaction of RGS7 with the orphan receptor GPR158, which modulates G protein signaling pathways involved in mood regulation. The GPR158-RGS7 complex influences cAMP production, a critical factor in mood regulation, suggesting that disruptions in this pathway could contribute to depression and anxiety (Orlandi2018Homeostatic).

## Interactions
RGS7 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for its function in neuronal signaling. It forms a trimeric complex with Gβ5 and R7BP (or R9AP), which is essential for its activity. This complex regulates G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by interacting with G protein substrates and Gα subunits of the G i/o family during GTP hydrolysis (Martemyanov2005R7BP; Anderson2009The). RGS7 also interacts with the intracellular loops of the muscarinic M3 receptor, indicating a role in GPCR signaling (Anderson2009The).

RGS7 binds to snapin, a component of the synaptic fusion complex, suggesting a role in regulating exocytosis (Anderson2009The). It also interacts with polycystin, which protects RGS7 from proteolytic degradation and influences cellular signaling pathways (Kim1999Interaction). The interaction with the 14-3-3 protein inhibits RGS7 activity in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Anderson2009The).

The RGS7-Gβ5 complex can interact with several GPCRs, including the M3 muscarinic receptor and orphan receptors GPR158 and GPR179, potentially facilitating the binding of Ga-GDP (Patil2018Structural). These interactions highlight the versatile nature of RGS7 in modulating various cellular processes.
