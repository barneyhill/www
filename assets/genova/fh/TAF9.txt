# TAF9

## Overview
TAF9 is a gene that encodes the TATA-box binding protein associated factor 9, a crucial component of the transcription machinery in eukaryotic cells. The protein is categorized as a transcription factor and is a part of the TFIID complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. TAF9 plays a significant role in recognizing and binding to the TATA box in gene promoters, facilitating the assembly of the transcription machinery and regulating gene expression (Davidson2005New). Beyond its fundamental role in transcription, TAF9 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, acting as a coactivator of the tumor suppressor protein TP53 (Tsai2022Transcriptomic). Its interactions with other proteins, such as GLI1 and p53, further underscore its importance in modulating transcriptional activity and cellular responses to stress (Yoon2015p53).

## Function
TAF9 (TATA-box binding protein associated factor 9) is a component of the TFIID complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. TFIID is composed of the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs), including TAF9, which play a critical role in recognizing and binding to the TATA box in gene promoters. This binding facilitates the assembly of the transcription machinery, thereby regulating gene expression (Davidson2005New).

TAF9 is involved in various molecular processes, including the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. It acts as a coactivator of TP53, a key tumor suppressor protein, and is involved in stabilizing TP53 by inhibiting its degradation. This stabilization enhances the expression of genes that contribute to apoptosis resistance, such as TRIAP1, which is crucial for cell survival under stress conditions (Tsai2022Transcriptomic).

In the context of retinal ganglion cells, TAF9 is upregulated by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) treatment, which suggests its role in protecting these cells from apoptosis following ischemic injury. This protective effect is mediated through the TP53-TRIAP1-CASP3 pathway, highlighting TAF9's importance in cellular protection mechanisms (Tsai2022Transcriptomic).

## Clinical Significance
TAF9 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in transcriptional regulation and its interactions with various cellular pathways. In esophageal cancer (ESCA), TAF9 is part of a five-gene prognostic model that predicts patient outcomes. High expression levels of TAF9 are associated with shorter survival times in ESCA patients, suggesting its role as a risk-related gene in this cancer type (Wang2021Identification). The study highlights the potential of TAF9 as a prognostic biomarker in ESCA, emphasizing its involvement in cancer-related pathways such as the PI3K/AKT pathway (Wang2021Identification).

TAF9 also plays a significant role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Its expression is decreased in NAFLD induced by a high-fat diet, but can be restored by treatment with danshensu, which promotes fatty acid β-oxidation and reduces lipid droplet accumulation. This suggests that TAF9 could be a therapeutic target for NAFLD, as its overexpression has been shown to attenuate disease progression in experimental models (Wang2021Activation).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of TAF9 in both cancer and metabolic diseases, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
TAF9 is a component of the TFIID and SAGA transcription complexes, playing a crucial role in transcriptional activation. It interacts with the transactivation domains of GLI1 and GLI2, enhancing their transactivating and cell-transforming activities. However, TAF9 does not interact with GLI3. The interaction between TAF9 and GLI1 is essential for the oncogenic activity of GLI1, as demonstrated by the significant reduction in GLI1's ability to transform cells when its TAF9-binding domain is removed (Yoon2015p53).

TAF9 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction is significant because p53 has a greater binding affinity for TAF9 than GLI1, suggesting that p53 can sequester TAF9 from GLI1, thereby modulating GLI1-induced transactivation. This competitive binding results in the down-regulation of GLI-induced transactivation when p53 is co-expressed with GLI1 or GLI2 (Yoon2015p53).

In yeast, the C-terminal conserved region domain (CRD) of TAF9 is necessary for the promoter occupancy of SAGA and TFIID complexes, which are crucial for transcriptional activation. The CRD is essential for the recruitment of transcriptional machinery to gene promoters, thereby promoting transcriptional activation (Saint2014The).
