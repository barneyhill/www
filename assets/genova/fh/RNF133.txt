# RNF133

## Overview
RNF133 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 133, which is a member of the PA-TM-RING family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein is characterized by the presence of a protease-associated (PA) domain, a transmembrane (TM) domain, and a RING-H2 finger domain, which are integral to its function in protein ubiquitination and degradation (Nakamura2011The; Cabana2022From). RNF133 is predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a crucial role in ER-associated protein quality control, particularly during spermatogenesis, where it is highly expressed in male germ cells (Nakamura2011The; Xu2023Loss). The protein is involved in regulatory pathways, such as the PMFBP1-HDAC3 axis, and its expression is critical for normal sperm development, with implications in reproductive health and certain cancers (Yang2021Ubiquitinrelated; Xu2023Loss).

## Structure
RNF133 is a member of the PA-TM-RING family of proteins, characterized by the presence of a protease-associated (PA) domain, a transmembrane (TM) domain, and a RING-H2 finger domain. The RING-H2 domain is notable for its role in facilitating ubiquitination, a process crucial for protein degradation and regulation (Nakamura2011The; Cabana2022From). The PA domain is proposed to function as a protein-protein interaction module, aiding in the recognition and binding of substrate proteins (Nakamura2011The).

RNF133 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in ER-associated protein quality control, particularly during spermatogenesis (Nakamura2011The). It is highly expressed in male germ cells and plays a significant role in spermiogenesis, potentially through an ER-associated degradation pathway (Hou2012New; Xu2023Loss).

The protein is also part of a regulatory pathway involving the PMFBP1-HDAC3 axis, with its expression levels being affected in Pmfbp1 knockout mice, indicating its importance in spermatogenic processes (Xu2023Loss). Specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of RNF133 are not provided in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
RNF133 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RNF133 has been identified as a risk factor within a prognostic signature based on ubiquitin-related gene expression profiles. This suggests a potential role for RNF133 in HCC progression, although it has not been previously reported in this type of cancer (Yang2021Ubiquitinrelated). In Wilms tumor, a common pediatric renal malignancy, RNF133 was included in a study that developed predictive survival models based on RNA expression. These models were correlated with tumor stage and histological classification, indicating the prognostic potential of RNF133 in this context (Liu2021A).

Alterations in RNF133 expression have also been linked to defects in spermatogenesis. In mouse models, RNF133 is downregulated in Pmfbp1 knockout mice, leading to abnormalities in sperm morphology, such as the retention of a cytoplasmic droplet outside the sperm flagellum. This suggests that RNF133 is crucial for normal sperm development and that disruptions in its expression can lead to defects in sperm morphology and function (Xu2023Loss). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of RNF133 in both cancer and reproductive health.

## Interactions
RNF133 is a member of the PA-TM-RING family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, characterized by a protease-associated (PA) domain, a transmembrane domain, and a RING-H2 finger domain. This family of proteins is involved in protein-protein interactions, with the PA domain serving as a module for substrate recognition and binding (Nakamura2011The). RNF133 is highly expressed in male germ cells undergoing spermiogenesis and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in mouse spermatocyte cell lines. It catalyzes self-ubiquitination, suggesting a role in ER protein quality control during spermatogenesis (Nakamura2011The).

The transcription levels of RNF133 are regulated by the PMFBP1-HDAC3 axis, which affects spermatogenesis. In Pmfbp1 knockout mice, RNF133 expression is significantly reduced, leading to abnormalities in sperm, such as the retention of a cytoplasmic droplet outside the flagellum. This indicates that RNF133 is a critical factor in the PMFBP1-HDAC3 regulatory pathway (Xu2023Loss). While specific protein interactions involving RNF133 are not detailed, its role in protein quality control and regulation of spermatogenesis suggests interactions with other proteins in these processes (Nakamura2011The).
