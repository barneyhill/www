# P4HA2

## Overview
P4HA2 is a gene that encodes the prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 2, a critical component of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase enzyme complex. This enzyme is categorized as a hydroxylase and is primarily involved in the post-translational modification of collagen, where it catalyzes the hydroxylation of proline residues, a process essential for the stability and structural integrity of collagen fibers (Jin2023Prolyl). The protein encoded by P4HA2 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a significant role in collagen synthesis and assembly. Beyond its structural role, P4HA2 is implicated in the regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, influencing cell growth and metabolism (Jin2023Prolyl). The gene's expression and activity have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it contributes to tumor progression and metastasis through its involvement in extracellular matrix remodeling and signaling pathways (Gilkes2013Hypoxiainducible; Lin2020P4HA2).

## Function
Prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 2 (P4HA2) is a crucial component of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase enzyme, which plays a significant role in collagen synthesis by catalyzing the hydroxylation of proline residues. This hydroxylation is essential for stabilizing the triple helix structure of collagen, thereby maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues. P4HA2 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells, where it contributes to the proper folding and assembly of collagen molecules (Jin2023Prolyl).

In addition to its role in collagen synthesis, P4HA2 is involved in the regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase signaling pathway. P4HA2 hydroxylates a specific proline residue within the kinase domain of mTOR, enhancing its stability and ability to recognize substrates such as S6K and AKT. This hydroxylation is crucial for mTOR activation, which is a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism (Jin2023Prolyl). The interaction between P4HA2 and mTOR has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, highlighting its importance in cellular processes (Jin2023Prolyl).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the P4HA2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In glioma, P4HA2 is frequently overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and increased tumor grade. Its overexpression promotes glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), processes that are crucial for tumor progression and metastasis. Knockdown of P4HA2 in glioma cell lines has been shown to inhibit these malignant behaviors, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wu2021P4HA2; Lin2020P4HA2).

In breast cancer, P4HA2 is involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling under hypoxic conditions, contributing to tumor fibrosis and cancer cell invasion. This is mediated through the induction of collagen hydroxylase genes, including P4HA2, by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which enhances collagen deposition and fiber formation, creating a stiff microenvironment that facilitates cancer progression (Gilkes2013Hypoxiainducible).

Additionally, gene fusions involving P4HA2, such as the TBCK-P4HA2 fusion, have been identified in soft tissue angiofibroma, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis. These fusions may alter normal gene function, contributing to the development of this type of tumor (Panagopoulos2016Gene).

## Interactions
P4HA2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It is known to bind with Carabin, a protein that negatively regulates B-cell receptor signaling. This interaction leads to the hydroxylation and subsequent degradation of Carabin, which promotes B-cell lymphoma progression by activating the Ras/ERK pathway (Jiang2018Prolyl). P4HA2 also interacts with the beta subunit P4HB to form the active prolyl 4-hydroxylase enzyme complex, which is crucial for collagen synthesis (Jiang2018Prolyl).

In the context of mTOR signaling, P4HA2 directly interacts with mTOR kinase, enhancing its activity through hydroxylation. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of mTOR substrates such as S6K and AKT, which are important for cell growth and proliferation (Jin2024P4HA2). P4HA2 also interacts with KIF7, a key regulator in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. This interaction is mediated through specific domains and is essential for the regulation of the pathway, impacting B-cell lymphoma progression (Li2024P4HA2). These interactions highlight P4HA2's role in modulating critical signaling pathways and cellular functions.
