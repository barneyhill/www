# HNRNPH1

## Overview
HNRNPH1 is a gene that encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (hnRNP H1), a member of the hnRNP family of RNA-binding proteins. These proteins are primarily involved in the processing and transport of pre-mRNA in the nucleus. HnRNP H1 is characterized by its ability to bind RNA through quasi-RNA recognition motifs (qRRMs) and plays a crucial role in the regulation of alternative splicing, particularly by interacting with G-rich RNA sequences and G-quadruplex structures (Vo2022HNRNPH1; Neckles2019HNRNPH1dependent). The protein's function is modulated by its structural domains, including a glycine-tyrosine-arginine-rich (GYR) domain and a carboxy-terminal glycine-rich (GY) domain, which contribute to its RNA-binding specificity (Neckles2019HNRNPH1dependent). HNRNPH1 is implicated in various cellular processes and has been associated with several diseases, including intellectual disabilities and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathology (Liu2021HNRNPH1; Reichert2020HNRNPH1‐related).

## Structure
The HNRNPH1 protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in RNA binding. It contains three quasi-RNA recognition motifs (qRRMs), which are crucial for its interaction with RNA molecules (Neckles2019HNRNPH1dependent). These qRRM domains lack the conserved aromatic residues typically found in RNA-binding proteins and interact with RNA via loops rather than b-sheet surfaces (Vo2022HNRNPH1). The qRRM1-2 domains are particularly important for disrupting G-quadruplex (G4) structures formed by G-rich RNA sequences, which play a role in regulating alternative splicing of oncogenic fusion transcripts (Vo2022HNRNPH1).

HNRNPH1 also includes a glycine-tyrosine-arginine-rich (GYR) domain and a carboxy-terminal glycine-rich (GY) domain, which likely contribute to the protein's structural conformation and RNA-binding specificity (Neckles2019HNRNPH1dependent). The protein's interaction with RNA is both structural- and sequence-dependent, as demonstrated by its ability to bind and destabilize G-quadruplex structures, favoring a non-G4 state (Vo2022HNRNPH1).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination, and methylation are common among hnRNPs, affecting their subcellular localization and function, although specific modifications for HNRNPH1 are not detailed in the provided context (Chaudhury2010Heterogeneous).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HNRNPH1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Pathogenic variants in HNRNPH1 have been linked to a distinct syndromic form of intellectual disability, characterized by unique dysmorphic features, congenital anomalies, and ophthalmological abnormalities. These variants often affect the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the hnRNP H protein, leading to severe clinical phenotypes such as microcephaly, respiratory distress, and hypotonia (Reichert2020HNRNPH1‐related). 

HNRNPH1 is also implicated in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), where it is upregulated and associated with disease progression. Its overexpression affects the PI3K/AKT pathway by binding to the mRNA of PTPN6, a cancer suppressor gene, thereby promoting cell proliferation and survival in CML (Liu2021HNRNPH1). 

In neuropsychiatric disorders, HNRNPH1's splicing activity can be influenced by SNPs associated with conditions like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, potentially impacting neurobiological mechanisms underlying these disorders (Yazdani2015Hnrnph1). 

Additionally, HNRNPH1 has been identified as a potential biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma, with elevated serum exosomal hnRNPH1 mRNA levels correlating with disease presence and progression (Xu2017Serum).

## Interactions
HNRNPH1 is known to participate in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in mRNA processing and splicing regulation. It interacts physically with Fox2, a protein involved in splicing regulation, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation assays. This interaction is independent of RNA, indicating a direct protein-protein interaction. Mutants of hnRNP H1 that retain the ability to interact with Fox2 also maintain some silencing activity on exon IIIc of the FGFR2 gene, highlighting the functional significance of this interaction (Mauger2008hnRNP).

HNRNPH1 also binds specifically to RNA sequences, particularly those containing G-rich motifs. It has been shown to bind to a G-run motif in exon 4i, which is a typical binding site for hnRNPF/H proteins. This binding is sequence-specific and can be competitively inhibited by U1 snRNP, suggesting a competitive interaction between these proteins for binding sites (Turunen2013HnRNPH1H2).

Additionally, HNRNPH1 interacts with exonic splicing silencers (ESS) in the regulation of alternative splicing. It binds specifically to the ESS sequence of the rat beta-tropomyosin gene, a binding that correlates with silencer activity and is crucial for the regulation of exon inclusion (Chen1999Binding).
