# ERI1

## Overview
ERI1 is a gene that encodes the protein exoribonuclease 1, a 3′-5′ exoribonuclease involved in RNA metabolism. This protein is characterized by its ability to cleave 3′ single-stranded RNA overhangs, a function facilitated by its conserved DEDDh motif and the coordination of Mg2+ ions within its catalytic core (Seo2024RNAbinding; Meyer2015Overexpression). Exoribonuclease 1 plays a crucial role in the turnover of replication-dependent histone mRNAs and the 3′-end trimming of 5.8 S rRNA, processes essential for RNA stability and gene expression (Seo2024RNAbinding). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to RNA processing and degradation, and is involved in miRNA regulation, particularly in lymphocytes (RodríguezGalán2020Impaired; Abaturov2022Regulation). Despite its significant role in cellular homeostasis, there are limited reports linking ERI1 to human diseases, including cancer, suggesting an area for further research (Seo2024RNAbinding).

## Structure
ERI1, also known as THEX1 or 3′HEXO, is a human protein characterized by its role as a 3′-5′ exoribonuclease. The protein contains a SAP domain, which is involved in nucleic acid binding, and an exonuclease domain that is crucial for its catalytic activity. The catalytic core of ERI1 is composed of a conserved DEDDh motif, which includes four acidic amino acid residues that coordinate Mg2+ ions, essential for its enzymatic function (Seo2024RNAbinding; Meyer2015Overexpression).

The enzymatic pocket of ERI1 is structured to accommodate only one to two nucleotides, allowing it to efficiently cleave 3′ single-stranded RNA overhangs, while double-stranded RNA is a poor substrate (Seo2024RNAbinding). This specificity is attributed to the structural configuration of the protein, which includes specific secondary structures like alpha helices and beta sheets that contribute to its tertiary conformation.

ERI1's structure is evolutionarily conserved across species, as indicated by the presence of similar domains in homologous proteins in humans, mice, worms, and slime molds (Meyer2015Overexpression). Despite its critical role in RNA processing, there are few reports of ERI1 being associated with human diseases, including cancer (Seo2024RNAbinding).

## Function
ERI1 (exoribonuclease 1) is a 3′-5′ exoribonuclease that plays a significant role in RNA metabolism in healthy human cells. It is involved in the turnover of replication-dependent histone mRNAs and the 3′-end trimming of 5.8 S rRNA, which are crucial processes for maintaining RNA stability and proper gene expression (Seo2024RNAbinding). ERI1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to RNA processing and degradation, which impacts cellular homeostasis (Abaturov2022Regulation).

In the context of miRNA regulation, ERI1 is essential for miRNA homeostasis in lymphocytes. It can trim AGO-associated full-length miRNAs to shorter forms, potentially playing a role in gene silencing under stress conditions (Seo2024RNAbinding). During T-cell activation, ERI1 expression changes, suggesting its involvement in miRNA maturation and cellular reprogramming processes (RodríguezGalán2020Impaired).

ERI1's molecular activity involves a conserved catalytic core that coordinates Mg2+ ions, allowing it to efficiently cleave 3′ single-stranded RNA overhangs (Seo2024RNAbinding). This activity is crucial for its role in RNA processing and degradation, impacting various cellular functions and organismal outcomes.

## Interactions
ERI1, also known as THEX1 or 3′HEXO, is a 3′-5′ exoribonuclease that participates in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is involved in the turnover of replication-dependent histone mRNAs and the 3′-end trimming of 5.8 S rRNA. ERI1 interacts with the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) and forms a complex with Dicer in worms to generate specific classes of endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) (Seo2024RNAbinding). This interaction highlights its role in RNA processing and gene silencing.

ERI1 contains a SAP domain with a conserved catalytic core that coordinates Mg2+ ions, enabling it to efficiently cleave 3′ single-stranded RNA overhangs. In mice, ERI1 regulates miRNA homeostasis in lymphocytes, and its deficiency impairs RNA interference and maturation in NK cells. During T-cell activation, changes in ERI1 expression suggest its involvement in miRNA maturation (Seo2024RNAbinding). ERI1 and other 3′-5′ exoribonucleases can trim AGO-associated full-length miRNAs to shorter tiny RNAs, potentially playing a role in gene silencing under stress or viral infection conditions (Seo2024RNAbinding). Despite its essential role in miRNA biogenesis, there are few reports of ERI1's association with human diseases, including cancer, indicating a need for further research into its role in tumorigenesis (Seo2024RNAbinding).
