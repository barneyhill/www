# LIMK1

## Overview
LIMK1, or LIM domain kinase 1, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton. The LIMK1 protein is characterized by its unique structure, which includes LIM domains, a PDZ domain, and a kinase domain, enabling it to participate in complex protein-protein interactions and signaling pathways (NAGATA1999The; Villalonga2023LIM). As a kinase, LIMK1 plays a pivotal role in actin polymerization by phosphorylating cofilin, thereby modulating actin dynamics essential for cellular processes such as migration, division, and structural integrity (Gorovoy2005LIM; Yang1998Cofilin). LIMK1 is implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts, including neurodevelopmental disorders like Williams Syndrome and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as in cancer progression (Davila2007Expression; Frangiskakis1996LIMkinase1; Cuberos2015Roles). The gene's expression and activity are tightly regulated through interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Manetti2011LIM; Villalonga2023LIM).

## Structure
LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) is characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein contains two amino-terminal LIM domains, a PDZ domain, a serine/proline-rich region, and a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain (Villalonga2023LIM). The LIM domains, composed of two zinc fingers, are involved in protein-protein interactions and act as negative regulators of the kinase activity by interacting with the C-terminal kinase domain (NAGATA1999The). The PDZ domain facilitates protein interactions and contains two leucine-rich nuclear export signals, contributing to the cytoplasmic localization of LIMK1 (Manetti2011LIM).

The kinase domain of LIMK1 is atypical, capable of phosphorylating serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, with a preference for serine and tyrosine (Chatterjee2022Structural). This domain features a unique structural configuration where the αG helix is shifted towards the C terminus, forming a docking interface for substrates (Chatterjee2022Structural). LIMK1 is activated by phosphorylation at Thr508, which stabilizes the kinase in its active conformation (Chatterjee2022Structural).

LIMK1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which influences its activity and interactions with other proteins (Manetti2011LIM). The protein also has several splice variant isoforms, which may differ in their functional roles (Villalonga2023LIM).

## Function
LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cytoskeleton in human endothelial cells. It coordinates microtubule stability and actin polymerization, essential processes for maintaining cell structure and function (Gorovoy2005LIM). LIMK1 regulates actin polymerization by phosphorylating the actin depolymerization factor, cofilin, which inactivates cofilin and leads to the accumulation of actin polymers. This process is crucial for the formation of actin stress fibers and the contractility of cells (Gorovoy2005LIM; Yang1998Cofilin).

LIMK1 is activated by Rho kinase (ROCK), which enhances its ability to phosphorylate cofilin, a process crucial for actin polymerization (Gorovoy2005LIM). It interacts with microtubules via its PDZ domain and is involved in thrombin-induced microtubule destabilization and actin polymerization (Gorovoy2005LIM). LIMK1's activity is necessary for microtubule destabilization and actin stress fiber formation, particularly in response to stimuli like thrombin (Gorovoy2005LIM).

LIMK1 is also involved in cell migration by stimulating lamellipodium formation during the initial stages of cell response, which is essential for cell movement (sayi2008functional). It is expressed in various tissues, with the highest levels found in fetal and neural tissues such as the brain and spinal cord (sayi2008functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LIMK1 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. In Williams Syndrome (WS), a developmental disorder characterized by cognitive deficits and distinct facial features, LIMK1 is located in the critical region on chromosome 7q11.23. Hemizygosity of LIMK1 is implicated in the visuospatial cognitive impairments observed in WS, although the extent of its role is debated due to variability in symptoms among individuals with LIMK1 deletions (Frangiskakis1996LIMkinase1; Hoogenraad2004LIMK1).

LIMK1 is also linked to neurological and psychiatric conditions beyond WS. In Alzheimer's disease, LIMK1 activation contributes to neurodegeneration through cofilin phosphorylation, affecting actin filament remodeling and leading to neuritic dystrophy (Cuberos2015Roles). In Parkinson's disease, interactions between LIMK1 and Parkin suggest a role in actin stabilization, with implications for cytoskeleton defects and impaired vesicle transport (Cuberos2015Roles).

In cancer, particularly prostate cancer, LIMK1 is upregulated and associated with chromosomal instability and tumor progression. Its overexpression is linked to higher Gleason scores and metastasis, indicating a potential oncogenic role (Davila2007Expression). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of LIMK1 in various diseases.

## Interactions
LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) is involved in numerous protein interactions that regulate its activity and function. LIMK1 forms a complex with Nischarin and PAK, leading to its dephosphorylation and inhibition, which reduces cancer cell invasion (Villalonga2023LIM). It interacts with LATS1, which decreases phosphorylated cofilin levels and corrects cytokinesis defects (Villalonga2023LIM). LIMK1 is also dephosphorylated by Slingshot phosphatase (SSH), reducing cofilin phosphorylation (Villalonga2023LIM). 

LIMK1 interacts with β-arrestin and cofilin upon PAR-2 activation, leading to cofilin dephosphorylation (Villalonga2023LIM). It binds to p57 Kip2, increasing cofilin phosphorylation and remodeling the actin cytoskeleton (Villalonga2023LIM). LIMK1 autophosphorylates through homodimerization mediated by Hsp90, which stabilizes the protein (Villalonga2023LIM). 

LIMK1 interacts with the BMP receptor BMPRII, which can either negatively regulate LIMK1 or synergistically activate it during dendritogenesis (Lee-Hoeflich2004Activation; Manetti2011LIM). LIMK1 also interacts with TrkB, leading to its dimerization and increased phospho-cofilin levels (Villalonga2023LIM). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving LIMK1, influencing various cellular processes.
