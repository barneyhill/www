# ATG4B

## Overview
ATG4B is a gene that encodes the protein autophagy related 4B cysteine peptidase, a crucial enzyme in the autophagy pathway. This protein is categorized as a cysteine protease and is involved in the processing and recycling of autophagy-related proteins, particularly those in the Atg8 family, such as LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16. The ATG4B protein plays a vital role in autophagosome formation by cleaving the carboxyl termini of these proteins, which is necessary for their conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (Sugawara2005Structural; Tanida2004HsAtg4BHsApg4BAutophagin1). The activity of ATG4B is regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and oxidation, which modulate its function in response to cellular conditions (Park2022PostTranslational). Dysregulation of ATG4B has been linked to various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Park2022PostTranslational; Zheng2020The).

## Structure
The ATG4B protein is a cysteine protease involved in autophagy, characterized by a classical papain-like fold and a unique short fingers domain. The primary structure of ATG4B consists of 393-474 amino acids, with a catalytic triad composed of Cys-74, Asp-278, and His-280, essential for its proteolytic activity (Park2022PostTranslational; Sugawara2005Structural). The secondary structure includes an α/β-fold with nine α-helices and 13 β-strands, organized around a central antiparallel β-sheet (Sugawara2005Structural).

The tertiary structure of ATG4B reveals an autoinhibited conformation in its free form, where the regulatory loop and Trp-142 cover the catalytic Cys-74, preventing substrate access. Upon binding to LC3, significant conformational changes occur, lifting the regulatory loop and exposing the active site (Maruyama2017Autophagyregulating; Satoo2009The). The protein's quaternary structure involves interactions with LC3, where the ubiquitin core of LC3 binds to the interface between the papain-like domain and the short fingers domain of ATG4B (Satoo2009The).

ATG4B undergoes various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and oxidation, which regulate its activity and autophagic function (Park2022PostTranslational). The protein also contains a C-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif crucial for binding and processing LC3 (Skytte2017ATG4B).

## Function
ATG4B is a cysteine protease that plays a crucial role in the autophagy process in human cells. It is involved in the processing and recycling of autophagy-related proteins, particularly the Atg8 homologs such as LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16. ATG4B cleaves the carboxyl termini of these proteins, exposing a glycine residue necessary for their conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a critical step for autophagosome formation (Sugawara2005Structural; Tanida2004HsAtg4BHsApg4BAutophagin1).

The protein's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and redox modifications, which modulate its function in response to cellular conditions (Park2022PostTranslational; Zheng2020The). ATG4B also delipidates LC3-PE and GABARAP-PE, recycling these proteins for further rounds of autophagy, thus maintaining autophagic flux (Tanida2004HsAtg4BHsApg4BAutophagin1).

ATG4B is active in the cytoplasm and is essential for cellular homeostasis, as it facilitates the degradation and recycling of cellular components through autophagy. This process is vital for responding to stress and maintaining cellular health, with dysregulation of ATG4B being linked to various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Park2022PostTranslational; Zheng2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ATG4B gene are implicated in various diseases. In cancer, ATG4B is often upregulated, contributing to tumor growth and chemoresistance. In colorectal cancer, it is involved in the mTOR-CCND1 signaling pathway, promoting tumor proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy through interactions with noncoding RNAs and miRNAs (Xia2020The). In chronic myeloid leukemia, ATG4B expression is higher in stem/progenitor cells, and its knockdown impairs cell survival and sensitizes cells to treatment, suggesting its role in maintaining cellular integrity and prosurvival mechanisms (Rothe2014The).

In neurodegenerative diseases, ATG4B expression is altered, affecting disease pathology. In Alzheimer's disease, its activity is impaired by amyloid beta peptides, while in Huntington's disease, dopamine affects ATG4B stability, exacerbating neurotoxicity (Xia2020The).

ATG4B also plays a role in inflammatory conditions. In inflammatory bowel disease, its expression is reduced in affected colon areas, correlating with inflammation severity. ATG4B-deficient mice show increased susceptibility to colitis, highlighting its protective role in intestinal homeostasis (Cabrera2013ATG4Bautophagin1). These findings suggest ATG4B as a potential therapeutic target in these diseases.

## Interactions
ATG4B interacts with several proteins, primarily through its C-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which is crucial for binding to mammalian orthologs of yeast ATG8, such as LC3B and GABARAPL1. This interaction involves both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, with specific residues like E389 playing a critical role in binding (Skytte2017ATG4B). The LIR motif also facilitates the stabilization of unlipidated forms of GABARAP and GABARAPL1, preventing their degradation by the proteasome (Skytte2017ATG4B).

ATG4B's interaction with LC3B involves both catalytic site-substrate interactions and LIR-LDS interactions, with residues F80 and L82 in LC3B being crucial for binding (Skytte2017ATG4B). Phosphorylation of ATG4B at residues S383 and S392 enhances its interaction with the lipidated form of LC3, which is important for autophagosome maturation (Yang2015ATG4B).

The ATG4B protein also forms a stable complex with GABARAPL1, with core residues F388 and L391 deeply embedded in hydrophobic pockets, and a salt bridge between E389 of ATG4B and R67 of GABARAPL1 (Skytte2017ATG4B). These interactions are essential for the efficient cleavage and processing of Atg8-family proteins, which are critical for autophagy.
