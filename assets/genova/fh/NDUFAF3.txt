# NDUFAF3

## Overview
NDUFAF3 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex assembly factor 3, which is a mitochondrial assembly factor crucial for the proper assembly and function of complex I, the largest enzyme complex in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein is not an integral membrane protein but associates with the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the ND1 subunit and facilitating the integration of various nuclear-encoded subunits into the complex I structure (Zurita2012Early). NDUFAF3 is essential for the early stages of complex I assembly, acting as a docking site that couples mitochondrial translation to membrane insertion, thereby ensuring the stability and functionality of the electron transport chain (Mckenzie2010Assembly). Mutations in the NDUFAF3 gene can lead to severe mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its critical role in cellular energy production (Fassone2012Complex).

## Function
NDUFAF3, also known as C3orf60, is a crucial assembly factor for mitochondrial complex I (CI), the largest component of the respiratory chain. It plays a significant role in the early stages of CI assembly by stabilizing the ND1 subunit, which is essential for the proper formation of the holoenzyme complex. NDUFAF3 is involved in the assembly of a 400 kDa intermediate containing ND1 and several nuclear-encoded subunits, such as NDUFS2, NDUFA9, and NDUFS3 (Zurita2012Early). 

The protein is not an integral membrane protein but associates with the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it helps dock and stabilize newly synthesized ND1, preventing its rapid degradation and ensuring its integration into the mitochondrial membrane (Zurita2012Early). NDUFAF3 also interacts with other assembly factors like NDUFAF4 to anchor assembly intermediates to the membrane, facilitating their integration with membrane arm intermediates (Mckenzie2010Assembly). 

In healthy human cells, NDUFAF3 is essential for maintaining the integrity and positioning of assembly intermediates, ensuring the correct assembly and function of complex I, which is vital for efficient ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Zurita2012Early; Mckenzie2010Assembly).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFAF3 gene are associated with severe mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which can lead to a range of clinical conditions. These include fatal neonatal mitochondrial disease, characterized by severe complex I enzymatic deficiency due to disrupted assembly of complex I. Patients with homozygous mutations in NDUFAF3 often lack assembly intermediates containing subunits NDUFS2 or ND1, indicating a crucial role for NDUFAF3 in the early stages of complex I assembly (Mckenzie2010Assembly).

Clinical manifestations of NDUFAF3 mutations include fatal infantile lactic acidosis (FILA), characterized by congenital lactic acidosis presenting in the neonatal period or early infancy, often resulting in rapid progression and death (Fassone2012Complex). Specific mutations, such as c.229 G→C and c.365 G→C, have been reported in families, leading to symptoms like lactic acidemia, increased muscle tone, macrocephaly, hypotonia, and myoclonic seizures, with affected infants typically dying within the first few months of life (Diaz2011Mitochondrial).

NDUFAF3 mutations are also linked to severe infantile-onset encephalopathies, highlighting the gene's role in complex I assembly and its impact on mitochondrial function (Fassone2012Complex).

## Interactions
NDUFAF3 is a mitochondrial assembly factor that plays a crucial role in the assembly of complex I, a component of the electron transport chain. It interacts with several other proteins during this process. NDUFAF3 forms a complex with NDUFAF4 and nuclear-encoded subunits such as NDUFS2, NDUFS3, and NDUFA9, which are part of a 200 kDa subcomplex involved in early complex I assembly (Zurita2012Early). This interaction suggests that NDUFAF3 may act as a docking site, coupling mitochondrial translation to membrane insertion and stabilizing assembly intermediates containing the ND1 subunit (Zurita2012Early).

NDUFAF3 is also associated with the Q-module of complex I, interacting with subunits NDUFS2, NDUFS3, NDUFS7, NDUFS8, and NDUFA5, indicating its role in the assembly or stability of this module (Murari2021Dissecting). In Drosophila, knockdown of NDUFAF3 reduces the incorporation of subunits like NDUFS3 and NDUFS5 into complex I, but overexpression of NDUFAF4 can compensate for this defect, suggesting a compensatory interaction between these two assembly factors (Murari2021Dissecting). These interactions highlight the importance of NDUFAF3 in the biogenesis and stabilization of complex I.
