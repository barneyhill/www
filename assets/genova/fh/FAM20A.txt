# FAM20A

## Overview
FAM20A is a gene that encodes the FAM20A golgi associated secretory pathway pseudokinase, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the biomineralization processes of dental and skeletal tissues. Unlike typical kinases, FAM20A is classified as a pseudokinase due to its lack of catalytic activity; however, it functions as an allosteric activator of the casein kinase FAM20C, enhancing its ability to phosphorylate secretory proteins essential for biomineralization (Ohyama2016FAM20A; Cui2017Structure). The protein is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it forms a complex with FAM20C, crucial for the phosphorylation of substrates involved in enamel formation (Siddiqui2024FAM20A). Mutations in the FAM20A gene are linked to several autosomal recessive disorders, including Enamel-Renal Syndrome and Amelogenesis Imperfecta, underscoring its significance in maintaining normal physiological processes (Wang2013FAM20A; de2014Pathognomonic).

## Structure
The FAM20A protein is a pseudokinase with a unique molecular structure characterized by a distinct disulfide bond pattern. Its crystal structure was determined at a resolution of 2.5 Å, revealing a kinase core that is structurally similar to ceFam20, with a root-mean-square difference of 2.1 Å over 322 aligned Ca atoms (Cui2017Structure). The protein features a unique disulfide pattern, with two disulfide bonds tethering the Kb1-Kb2 loop to the Kb6-Kb7 loop, which is evolutionarily conserved and crucial for maintaining structural integrity and function (Cui2017Structure).

FAM20A binds ATP in an inverted orientation compared to other kinases, a novel feature that stabilizes its structure. This binding occurs without the need for divalent cations, unlike its paralog Fam20C (Cui2017Structure). The protein forms a symmetrical, face-to-face dimer in its crystal structure, stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, particularly involving the Kb3-Ka3 loop (Cui2017Structure).

A patient-derived splice variant, Fam20A-Dexon3, lacks the disulfide bonds due to exon skipping, resulting in impaired secretion and function, highlighting the importance of these structural features (Cui2017Structure).

## Function
FAM20A is a pseudokinase that plays a crucial role in the secretory pathway, particularly in the biomineralization processes of dental and skeletal tissues. Although it lacks catalytic activity, FAM20A functions as an allosteric activator of the physiological casein kinase FAM20C, enhancing its ability to phosphorylate secretory proteins essential for biomineralization, including enamel matrix proteins (Ohyama2016FAM20A; Cui2017Structure). This interaction is vital for the proper formation and mineralization of enamel, dentin, and bone (Siddiqui2024FAM20A).

FAM20A is localized in the Golgi apparatus, specifically within the cis-Golgi network, where it forms a complex with FAM20C, enhancing the latter's kinase activity (Siddiqui2024FAM20A; Ohyama2016FAM20A). This complex is important for the phosphorylation of secretory substrates, which are critical for enamel formation (Cui2017Structure). FAM20A's unique structural features, including a distinct disulfide bond pattern and an inverted ATP-binding site, are essential for its function (Cui2017Structure).

Mutations in FAM20A can lead to conditions such as amelogenesis imperfecta, characterized by dental abnormalities, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal physiological processes (Ohyama2016FAM20A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FAM20A gene are associated with several autosomal recessive disorders, primarily affecting dental and renal systems. One of the main conditions linked to FAM20A mutations is Enamel-Renal Syndrome (ERS), characterized by amelogenesis imperfecta, nephrocalcinosis, and gingival fibromatosis (Wang2013FAM20A; de2014Pathognomonic). Amelogenesis imperfecta, specifically the hypoplastic type, results in defective enamel formation, leading to dental anomalies such as hypodontia, unerupted teeth, and large dental follicles (Kantaputra2017Periodontal; Kantaputra2013Enamel‐renal‐gingival).

ERS can also present with renal abnormalities, including nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis, which may not always be detected early, complicating diagnosis (Wang2013FAM20A; de2014Pathognomonic). Another condition associated with FAM20A mutations is Amelogenesis Imperfecta with Gingival Fibromatosis Syndrome (AIGFS), which shares many features with ERS but typically lacks renal calcifications (Wang2013FAM20A).

The FAM20A gene is part of a family that includes FAM20B and FAM20C, which are involved in post-translational modifications of secreted proteins. The absence or dysfunction of FAM20A can lead to ectopic mineralization, affecting tooth eruption and causing calcifications in the gingiva and kidneys (Wang2013FAM20A; Lignon2017FAM20A).

## Interactions
FAM20A is known to interact with FAM20C, forming a complex that enhances the kinase activity of FAM20C. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of secretory proteins involved in biomineralization, such as enamel matrix proteins and SIBLINGs (Siddiqui2024FAM20A; Cui2017Structure). FAM20A binds to FAM20C in a manner that is independent of FAM20C's kinase activity, and this binding is essential for the proper secretion and extracellular localization of FAM20C (Ohyama2016FAM20A; Zhang2024FAM20A:). 

FAM20A forms dimers or oligomers in a concentration-dependent manner, both in solution and in cells, with specific residues such as Val249, Phe251, and Phe254 playing a critical role in these interactions (Cui2017Structure). The interaction between FAM20A and FAM20C is also suggested to be a tetramer, although the exact nature of this complex remains unclear (Cui2017Structure). 

Mutations in FAM20A can disrupt its interaction with FAM20C, leading to conditions such as Amelogenesis Imperfecta, as these mutations impair the secretion and function of FAM20C (Ohyama2016FAM20A; Cui2017Structure). There is no evidence of direct interactions between FAM20A and nucleic acids in the current literature.
