# ALKBH3

## Overview
The ALKBH3 gene encodes the alkB homolog 3, alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase, a member of the AlkB family of non-heme dioxygenases. This enzyme is primarily involved in the repair of alkylation damage in nucleic acids, specifically targeting methylated bases such as 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine in single-stranded DNA and RNA. The protein's structure is characterized by a double-stranded β-helix core, which is essential for its function as an oxidative demethylase (Kanazhevskaya2024The). ALKBH3 plays a critical role in maintaining genomic integrity by reversing potentially mutagenic and cytotoxic methylation damage, and it is implicated in various cellular processes, including RNA metabolism and transcriptional regulation (Aas2003Human). The enzyme's activity is also linked to cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Ueda2017AlkB).

## Structure
The human ALKBH3 protein is a member of the AlkB family of non-heme dioxygenases, characterized by a double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) core, also known as a β-strand 'jellyroll' fold (Kanazhevskaya2024The). This core structure is typical of dioxygenases and is crucial for its function in repairing alkyl lesions in nucleic acids. The DSBH motif includes a highly conserved His1-X-Asp/Glu-Xn-His2 motif, which coordinates a catalytically active iron center, with His191, Asp193, and His257 as key residues (Kanazhevskaya2024The).

The secondary structure of ALKBH3 is predominantly composed of antiparallel β-strands, with a significant portion in right-twisted and relaxed conformations, and a smaller percentage of α-helices (Kanazhevskaya2024The). The protein also contains loop motifs and poorly ordered structures, contributing to its flexible nature (Kanazhevskaya2024The).

Mutations in key residues such as Tyr143, Leu177, and His191 can lead to significant structural rearrangements, affecting the protein's stability and function. These mutations often result in an increase in α-helical content and a decrease in β-strands, altering the geometry of the DNA-binding pocket (Kanazhevskaya2024The).

ALKBH3's structure is suited for acting on single-stranded DNA or RNA, with a shallower binding cleft and shorter loop motifs compared to its bacterial counterpart, AlkB (Kanazhevskaya2024The). The protein's substrate-binding pocket is more polar and positively charged, which influences its substrate specificity (Kanazhevskaya2024The). The absence of a DNA-bound structure of ALKBH3 limits the full understanding of its substrate specificity and structure-function relationships (Kanazhevskaya2024The).

## Function
The human gene ALKBH3 encodes a protein that functions as an oxidative demethylase, playing a crucial role in the repair of alkylation damage in both DNA and RNA. This enzyme specifically removes 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine from single-stranded nucleic acids, with a preference for single-stranded DNA and RNA over double-stranded DNA. This activity is essential for maintaining genome integrity by reversing potentially mutagenic and cytotoxic methylation damage (Aas2003Human).

In healthy human cells, ALKBH3 is involved in the demethylation of aberrant methylbases in RNA, acting as an 'eraser' enzyme to remove these methyl groups, which can affect RNA-protein interactions and secondary structures. This process is crucial for maintaining proper RNA function and integrity, as methylation can interfere with mRNA-tRNA interactions (Wollen2021ALKBH3). ALKBH3 is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, with some presence in the cytoplasm, and is largely excluded from nucleoli, suggesting its role in maintaining nuclear single-stranded DNA and RNA, potentially targeting genes undergoing transcription (Aas2003Human).

The enzyme works in conjunction with ASCC3, a DNA helicase, which facilitates the unwinding and efficient demethylation of 1-methyladenosine and 3-methylcytosine, contributing to the selective removal of aberrant methylbases from the human mRNA pool (Wollen2021ALKBH3).

## Clinical Significance
ALKBH3 is implicated in the progression of various cancers due to its role in RNA and DNA demethylation. Overexpression of ALKBH3 is associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as prostate, non-small-cell lung, pancreatic, and renal cell carcinoma (Ueda2017AlkB). In non-small-cell lung cancer, ALKBH3 contributes to cell survival and tumor growth, with its silencing leading to cell cycle arrest and senescence (Tasaki2011ALKBH3). In pancreatic cancer, ALKBH3 is linked to apoptotic resistance and angiogenesis, with its knockdown resulting in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis (Yamato2012PCA1ALKBH3).

ALKBH3 also influences cancer progression by modulating the stability and expression of specific mRNAs, such as CSF-1 in breast and ovarian cancer cells, where its overexpression increases mRNA stability and protein levels (Woo2019Human). The gene's activity in demethylating tRNA and generating tRNA-derived small RNAs (tDRs) further supports cancer cell proliferation and survival, as seen in cervical cancer and other types (Chen2018Transfer). These findings suggest that ALKBH3 could be a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment due to its significant role in tumor growth and progression.

## Interactions
ALKBH3, a human Fe(II)/2OG-dependent dioxygenase, is involved in DNA repair by interacting with nucleic acids and other proteins. It specifically targets methylated DNA, recognizing and repairing damaged nucleobases through a coordinated mechanism involving key amino acid residues. ALKBH3 interacts with DNA by recognizing methylated bases, such as m3C, and undergoes several conformational transitions to reach a catalytically competent state. This process involves a five-step kinetic mechanism, including the binding of damaged DNA, isomerization of the enzyme-substrate complex, and formation of the demethylated product (Kanazhevskaya2024The).

The protein's interaction with DNA is influenced by its structural features, such as the β-hairpin motif, which determines substrate specificity. ALKBH3 shows a preference for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) over double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) due to the closed 'fist' conformation of this motif, stabilized by a bulky salt bridge (Van2020Structural). ALKBH3 also forms a complex with the protein ASCC3, which assists in sliding over the DNA, suggesting a role in the scanning and repair process (Van2020Structural). These interactions highlight the importance of ALKBH3 in maintaining genomic integrity by repairing alkylation damage in DNA.
