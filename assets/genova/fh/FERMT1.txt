# FERMT1

## Overview
FERMT1 is a gene that encodes the protein FERM domain containing kindlin-1, which is a key component in cellular adhesion and signaling processes. Kindlin-1 is characterized by its FERM domain, which is integral to its function in integrin activation and interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. This protein is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining structural integrity and facilitating cellular processes such as adhesion, spreading, and motility. Mutations in the FERMT1 gene are linked to Kindler syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects skin integrity and increases the risk of skin cancers. The study of FERMT1 and kindlin-1 provides significant insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cell adhesion and the pathogenesis of related disorders (Has2011Kindler; Zhang2024Identification).

## Structure
The FERMT1 gene encodes the kindlin-1 protein, which is characterized by a FERM domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and an F0 domain. The FERM domain is divided into three subdomains: F1, F2, and F3, forming a clover-leaf conformation. The F1 domain has a ubiquitin-like fold and contains a poly-lysine loop important for membrane localization. The F2 domain is primarily α-helical and includes a PH domain, which is involved in membrane localization and protein-protein interactions. The F3 domain resembles PTB, PH, and EVH1 domains and contains a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB)-like region that binds to the NPxY/F motif in integrin β cytoplasmic tails, crucial for integrin activation (Bu2021Emerging).

The F0 domain, preceding the F1 domain, has a ubiquitin-like fold with hydrophobic α helices and a β-sheet, playing a role in binding to negatively charged membranes and targeting focal adhesions (Bu2021Emerging). Kindlin-1 can form oligomers, with kindlin-3 shown to form a trimer through interactions between the PH domain of one protomer and the F3 domain of another (Bu2021Emerging). Mutations in FERMT1 can lead to Kindler syndrome, affecting the protein's structure and function (Maier2016Single).

## Function
The FERMT1 gene encodes the protein kindlin-1, which is a crucial component of focal adhesions in human cells. Kindlin-1 is involved in integrin signaling, where it mediates integrin activation and links the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, essential for cell adhesion (Has2011Kindler; Zhang2024Identification). This protein is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues, including the skin, periodontal tissues, and gastrointestinal tract, where it supports the structural integrity and function of these tissues (Liu2024FERMT1; Zhang2024Identification).

In healthy human cells, kindlin-1 is localized in basal epidermal keratinocytes and exists in both nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms. It acts as a focal adhesion adaptor protein, linking filamentous actin in the cell cortex to membrane proteins, which is vital for maintaining proper cell architecture, polarization, and the boundary between the epidermis and dermis (Has2011Kindler). Kindlin-1 is also involved in cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and directed motility, which are critical for normal skin function and wound healing (Has2011Kindler; Zhang2024Identification). Its role in integrin activation and cytoskeletal interactions underscores its importance in maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FERMT1 gene, which encodes the protein kindlin-1, are primarily associated with Kindler syndrome (KS), a rare autosomal recessive skin disorder. KS is characterized by skin fragility, blistering, photosensitivity, progressive poikiloderma, and extensive skin atrophy. Patients with KS often experience mucosal inflammation and have an increased risk of developing nonmelanoma skin cancers, particularly squamous cell carcinomas in acral skin and the mouth (Has2011Kindler; Youssefian2015The). 

The mutational spectrum of FERMT1 includes nonsense, missense, splice-site, frameshift, and large deletion mutations, which lead to a loss of function of the kindlin-1 protein. These mutations are distributed throughout the gene, with no specific hotspots, and often result in premature termination codons, leading to nonfunctional or absent kindlin-1 (Li2021Novel; Meng2020A). 

Alterations in FERMT1 expression or function can disrupt keratinocyte adhesion, migration, and proliferation, contributing to the clinical manifestations of KS. The genetic homogeneity of KS is supported by the consistent association of FERMT1 mutations with the condition, highlighting the critical role of kindlin-1 in maintaining epithelial integrity (FuchsTelem2014New; Has2014FERMT1).

## Interactions
FERMT1, also known as kindlin-1, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with integrin cytoplasmic tails, enhancing integrin activation and playing a significant role in focal adhesion formation and actin cytoskeleton organization (Has2011Kindler). FERMT1 is part of the intracellular β1 integrin-associated signaling complex, although its role as an activator of β integrins with talin is still debated (Has2011Kindler).

In colon cancer cells, FERMT1 interacts with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction enhances β-catenin transcriptional activity by promoting its nuclear translocation and increasing its transcriptional activity, which is crucial for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis (Liu2016FERMT1). FERMT1 also influences the AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway, affecting the phosphorylation status of β-catenin and GSK-3β, which are critical for the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Liu2016FERMT1).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, FERMT1 interacts with Nod-like receptor family protein 3 (NLRP3), mediating EMT by inhibiting the NF-kB signaling pathway (Li2022FERMT1). This interaction is significant as NF-kB is known to activate potent EMT inducers (Li2022FERMT1).
