# DLST

## Overview
The DLST gene encodes the protein dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase, which is a pivotal enzyme in cellular metabolism. This protein functions as the E2 subunit of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDH), a key component of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle. As a transferase, DLST facilitates the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA, a critical step in energy production within the mitochondria (Buffet2020Germline). The protein's activity is essential for the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, ultimately contributing to ATP formation. DLST's interactions with other mitochondrial proteins underscore its role in amino acid degradation pathways and cellular respiration (Schmiesing2014Interaction). Mutations in the DLST gene have been linked to various diseases, including certain tumors and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Anderson2021Metabolic; Buffet2020Germline).

## Structure
DLST (dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase) is a key component of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, playing a crucial role in the Krebs cycle. The primary structure of DLST consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the foundation for its complex architecture. The secondary structure of DLST includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function.

The tertiary structure of DLST involves the intricate folding of these secondary elements into a three-dimensional shape, essential for its enzymatic activity. This folding allows DLST to interact effectively with other components of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. In terms of quaternary structure, DLST assembles with other proteins within the complex, facilitating its role in catalyzing reactions in the Krebs cycle.

DLST contains specific domains, such as the lipoyl-binding domain, which is critical for its function. This domain enables the binding of lipoic acid, a cofactor necessary for the enzyme's activity. Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, may occur, potentially influencing the protein's function and regulation. Splice variant isoforms of DLST can lead to structural and functional diversity, allowing the protein to adapt to different cellular conditions.

## Function
DLST (dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase) is a critical component of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDH), which plays a vital role in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle. This enzyme complex is essential for cellular respiration, facilitating the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA and CO2, a key step in the TCA cycle that contributes to energy production in cells (Buffet2020Germline). DLST functions as the E2 subunit of the OGDH complex, catalyzing the transfer of succinyl groups from a S-succinyldihydrolipoyl moiety to coenzyme A, which is crucial for the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into carbon dioxide, ultimately leading to ATP formation (Buffet2020Germline).

DLST is active in the mitochondria, where it is involved in maintaining normal enzyme activity and cell proliferation. Its activity is essential for the proper functioning of the TCA cycle, which is a central metabolic pathway that provides energy to cells (Buffet2020Germline). The protein's role in cellular metabolism is underscored by its involvement in the degradation pathway of certain amino acids, such as lysine and tryptophan, through its interaction with other mitochondrial matrix proteins (Schmiesing2014Interaction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DLST gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly certain types of tumors and neurodegenerative conditions. In pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, which are neuroendocrine tumors, DLST mutations such as c.1151C>T, p.(Pro384Leu) and c.1121G>A, p.(Gly374Glu) have been identified. These mutations are associated with reduced enzyme activity and contribute to tumor development through epigenetic modifications, including DNA hypermethylation (Buffet2020Germline). 

In neuroblastoma, a type of cancer common in children, high expression of DLST is linked to poor prognosis and increased tumor aggression. Studies have shown that DLST overexpression promotes tumor growth and metastasis, while its depletion leads to reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis (Anderson2021Metabolic). 

DLST has also been associated with Alzheimer's disease, where lower methylation levels of the DLST promoter are observed in patients, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Chen2018Association). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DLST in various diseases, emphasizing its role in tumor biology and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
DLST, or dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase, is a key component of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHc) and participates in several protein-protein interactions. Within the OGDHc, DLST interacts strongly with the E1o component, with dissociation constants indicating a strong binding affinity. This interaction is facilitated by specific regions in both proteins, including the N-terminal region of E1o and the core and linker regions of DLST (Nemeria2021Toward). 

DLST also interacts with glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH) in the mitochondrial matrix. This interaction is direct and has been confirmed through various experimental methods, including co-precipitation and protein complementation assays. The interaction between DLST and GCDH is significant in the context of lysine and tryptophan degradation pathways (Schmiesing2014Interaction). 

Additionally, DLST forms part of multienzyme complexes with electron transfer flavoprotein beta subunit (ETFB), which is involved in electron transfer processes. The interaction between DLST and ETFB has been demonstrated using techniques such as bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), highlighting the role of DLST in mitochondrial function and architecture (Schmiesing2017Diseasecausing).
