# APOA2

## Overview
The APOA2 gene encodes apolipoprotein A2, a protein primarily associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles in the plasma. As a significant component of HDL, apolipoprotein A2 plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism, influencing cholesterol transport and HDL particle stability. The protein is characterized by its α-helical structure and forms a homodimer, which is essential for its function. Apolipoprotein A2 is involved in modulating the size and structure of HDL particles, interacting with other apolipoproteins such as APOA1 and APOE, and affecting the activity of enzymes like lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and hepatic lipase (HL) (Weng1996Dramatically; Melchior2021Apolipoprotein). Genetic variations in the APOA2 gene have been linked to metabolic conditions, including obesity and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Abaj2022Dietary).

## Structure
Apolipoprotein A2 (APOA2) is a protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) that plays a role in lipid metabolism. The primary structure of APOA2 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids forming a homodimer of two 77-residue-long monomers linked by a disulfide bond at Cys6 (Segrest1992The; Das2015AmyloidForming). The secondary structure is predominantly α-helical, with class-A amphipathic α-helices that have large apolar faces, allowing deep insertion into the phospholipid monolayer and strong binding to HDL (Das2015AmyloidForming). 

In terms of tertiary structure, lipid-free APOA2 resembles a molten globule-like state, characterized by a substantial hydrophobic core and a lack of typical tertiary packing interactions (Gursky1996High‐). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a dimer, which is crucial for its function and stability (Das2015AmyloidForming).

APOA2 can undergo O-glycosylation, and the degree of sialylation affects its distribution among HDL subfractions, influencing its metabolic role (Pirillo2020Impact). The protein's strong association with HDL is thought to protect it from misfolding and amyloid formation (Das2015AmyloidForming).

## Function
Apolipoprotein A2 (APOA2) is a protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in plasma, primarily synthesized in the liver. It plays a significant role in lipid metabolism by stabilizing the structure of HDL particles and influencing cholesterol transport. APOA2 modulates the size and structure of HDL particles, particularly in the presence of Apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1), by disrupting the formation of discrete HDL particle sizes typically created by the APOA1 cage structure (Melchior2021Apolipoprotein). This disruption affects the activity of HDL-modifying factors, such as lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which is inhibited by APOA2 due to its impact on APOA1 alignment (Melchior2021Apolipoprotein).

APOA2 also acts as an endogenous inhibitor of hepatic lipase (HL), influencing HDL particle size and clearance. In the absence of APOA2, there is unopposed HL activity, leading to a decrease in HDL phospholipid pools and affecting HDL synthesis and clearance (Weng1996Dramatically). The protein is involved in lipid binding and transport processes, primarily active in the liver and bloodstream, and plays a role in maintaining normal HDL cholesterol levels and particle size, which may have implications for its function in healthy human cells (Weng1996Dramatically).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the APOA2 gene have been associated with several metabolic conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The APOA2-265 T > C polymorphism, in particular, has been linked to increased risk factors for these conditions. Carriers of the C allele tend to have higher levels of central obesity, body mass index (BMI), and total cholesterol (TC), which may affect triglycerides (TG) and free fatty acids metabolism (Abaj2022Dietary). This polymorphism is also associated with higher concentrations of triglycerides, ghrelin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in C allele carriers compared to TT homozygotes, indicating a potential influence on lipid metabolism and inflammatory markers (Abaj2022Dietary).

The interaction between the APOA2-265 T > C polymorphism and dietary factors, such as dietary acid load (DAL), can exacerbate the risk of T2DM and CVDs. High DAL diets, particularly those high in animal protein and low in fruits and vegetables, may interact with this genetic variation to influence metabolic outcomes, including increased risk of obesity and higher TC levels in CC homozygotes (Abaj2022Dietary). These findings highlight the significance of gene-diet interactions in the clinical implications of APOA2 gene variations.

## Interactions
Apolipoprotein A2 (APOA2) is involved in various interactions with other proteins, particularly within the context of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism. APOA2 interacts with Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) on HDL particles, where it disrupts the formation of discrete HDL particle sizes typically formed by APOA1. This disruption is thought to occur through interference with intermolecular salt-bridge interactions, affecting the rigidity of the APOA1 structure and potentially inhibiting lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity by misaligning APOA1 molecules (Melchior2021Apolipoprotein).

APOA2 also interacts with Apolipoprotein E (APOE), influencing triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism. In the absence of APOA1, APOA2 expression increases plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. However, in mice deficient in both APOA1 and APOE, APOA2 expression significantly reduces these levels, suggesting a functional interaction between APOA2 and APOE that impacts TRL metabolism (Zvintzou2023Apolipoprotein).

Additionally, APOA2 can displace APOA1 from HDL particles, affecting HDL size and composition. This displacement is observed in transgenic mice expressing human APOA2, where it leads to the formation of small HDL particles composed solely of APOA2 (Schultz1992Expression).
