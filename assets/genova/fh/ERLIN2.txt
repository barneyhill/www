# ERLIN2

## Overview
ERLIN2 is a gene that encodes the ER lipid raft associated 2 protein, which is a type II transmembrane protein belonging to the SPFH (stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HflKC) family. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as cholesterol homeostasis and cell cycle regulation. ER lipid raft associated 2 forms hetero-oligomeric complexes with ERLIN1, contributing to the organization of cholesterol-rich domains within the ER membrane. These complexes are involved in scaffolding lipids and proteins, thereby influencing cholesterol distribution and transport within the cell. Additionally, ERLIN2 interacts with microtubules and mitotic regulatory proteins, facilitating cell cycle progression by stabilizing Cyclin B1 during mitosis. Mutations in the ERLIN2 gene have been linked to neurological disorders, including hereditary spastic paraplegia and motor neuron diseases, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2015A; Liu2020Molecular; Veronese2024ERLIN12; Alazami2011A).

## Structure
ERLIN2 is a type II ER membrane protein and a member of the SPFH (stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HflKC) family, characterized by a conserved module of approximately 180-200 amino acids (Veronese2024ERLIN12). The protein structure includes a four-amino-acid-long cytosolic tail, a transmembrane domain, the SPFH domain, and a coiled-coil domain (Veronese2024ERLIN12). The SPFH domain, spanning amino acids 22 to 226, is crucial for interactions with α-tubulin and Cyclin B1, as its deletion abolishes binding activity (Zhang2015A). The oligomerization domain is located between amino acids 228 to 300, and the hydrophobic patch domain spans amino acids 301 to 306 (Zhang2015A).

ERLIN2 forms large ring-shaped hetero-oligomeric complexes with ERLIN1, likely composed of 24 subunits, which are involved in scaffolding lipids and proteins in cholesterol-rich domains of the ER (Veronese2024ERLIN12). These complexes are enriched in detergent-insoluble, buoyant fractions of sucrose gradients, indicating their association with lipid rafts (Browman2006Erlin1). ERLIN2's interaction with microtubules and mitotic regulatory components suggests a role in cell cycle progression (Zhang2015A).

## Function
ERLIN2 is a protein that plays a significant role in cell cycle progression and cholesterol homeostasis in healthy human cells. It is an ER-microtubule-binding protein that stabilizes Cyclin B1, a crucial mitosis-promoting factor, by interacting with α-tubulin through its SPFH domain. This interaction is essential during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, where ERLIN2 complexes with Cyclin B1, Cdk1, and α-tubulin, promoting K63-linked ubiquitination of Cyclin B1. This process stabilizes the Cyclin B1/Cdk1 complex, ensuring proper cell cycle progression and mitotic spindle function (Zhang2015A).

ERLIN2 also forms part of the ER lipid raft-associated proteins, which are involved in regulating cholesterol distribution within cellular membranes. It interacts with RNF170 and TMUB1, playing a role in limiting cholesterol esterification and facilitating cholesterol transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. This regulation is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the Golgi apparatus and proper function of the secretory pathway. The ERLIN complex, which includes ERLIN2, helps maintain cholesterol balance by acting as a scaffold that stabilizes interactions necessary for cholesterol homeostasis (Veronese2024ERLIN12).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ERLIN2 gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders, primarily hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). HSP is characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower extremities. ERLIN2 mutations can lead to both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant forms of HSP, with the recessive form often resulting in a more complicated phenotype that includes intellectual disability, joint contractures, and seizures (Trinchillo2024Expanding; Cioffi2024Hereditary; Alazami2011A). 

In addition to HSP, ERLIN2 mutations have been linked to juvenile primary lateral sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-like syndromes, indicating a broader spectrum of motor neuron diseases (Trinchillo2024Expanding; Srivastava2020Expansion). Some studies have identified novel ERLIN2 variants that suggest potential dominant-negative or gain-of-function effects, particularly in heterozygous missense mutations (Park2020An; Srivastava2020Expansion).

Alterations in ERLIN2 expression have also been implicated in cancer, notably lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Overexpression of ERLIN2 in LUAD is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness, suggesting its role in oncogenic processes (Liu2020Molecular).

## Interactions
ERLIN2, also known as ER lipid raft associated 2, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with α-tubulin through its SPFH domain, which is crucial for its association with microtubules and stabilization of Cyclin B1 during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Zhang2015A). This interaction is important for cell cycle progression and mitosis regulation, as ERLIN2 forms complexes with Cyclin B1 and Cdk1, promoting K63-linked ubiquitination and stabilization of Cyclin B1 (Zhang2015A).

ERLIN2 also interacts with ER-resident proteins such as INSIG1, facilitating the dissociation of the SREBP-SCAP complex, which is crucial for SREBP activation and lipid metabolism in cancer cells (Zhang2012Endoplasmic). In the context of ER-associated degradation (ERAD), ERLIN2 forms a complex with ERLIN1 and the rhomboid protease RHBDL4, aiding in the degradation of aggregation-prone proteins (Bock2019Rhomboid). Additionally, ERLIN2 is part of a protein complex with TM6SF2 and APOB, contributing to the regulation of lipid droplet metabolism (Li2020Disruption).
