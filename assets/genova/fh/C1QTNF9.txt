# C1QTNF9

## Overview
C1QTNF9 is a gene that encodes the protein C1q and tumor necrosis factor-related protein 9 (CTRP9), which is a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family. CTRP9 is a secreted protein that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including metabolism and cardiovascular health. It is primarily involved in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as maintaining systemic energy homeostasis. The protein exerts protective effects in the cardiovascular system by preventing cardiomyocyte death and promoting vascular repair. CTRP9 interacts with receptors such as adiponectin receptor 1 and N-cadherin, influencing signaling pathways that impact cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Due to its involvement in these critical biological processes, CTRP9 is considered a potential therapeutic target for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases (Uemura2012Adipose‐derived; Guan2022C1q/Tumor; Appari2017C1qTNFRelated).

## Function
C1QTNF9, also known as C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein 9 (CTRP9), is a protein that plays a significant role in various molecular processes and cellular functions. It is primarily secreted in its globular form and interacts with adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and N-cadherin, activating signaling pathways that regulate glucose and lipid metabolism, vasodilation, and cell differentiation (Guan2022C1q/Tumor). CTRP9 is involved in maintaining systemic energy homeostasis by inhibiting glucose production in the liver and enhancing fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle (Guan2022C1q/Tumor).

In the cardiovascular system, CTRP9 acts as a protective factor by preventing cardiomyocyte death during ischemia/reperfusion injury and remodeling after myocardial infarction. This protective role is mediated through the activation of AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) and protein kinase A (PKA) (Appari2017C1qTNFRelated). CTRP9 also plays a role in vascular biology by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and promoting vascular repair processes after injury (Uemura2012Adipose‐derived).

CTRP9 is active in the extracellular matrix and influences cell signaling pathways, contributing to processes such as cell adhesion, proliferation, and apoptosis. Its activity impacts organismal outcomes, including immune system function and metabolic homeostasis (Guan2022C1q/Tumor).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the C1QTNF9 gene, also known as CTRP9, have been linked to several metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. In mice, the targeted deletion of CTRP9 results in increased food intake, decreased insulin sensitivity, and the development of hepatic steatosis, indicating its role in metabolic regulation. These mice also exhibit increased body weight and adiposity, particularly when fed a standard chow diet, suggesting that CTRP9 is crucial for maintaining energy balance and metabolic health (Wei2014Targeted).

CTRP9 is also implicated in cardiovascular health, particularly in the context of ischemic heart injury. It is identified as a cardiokine that influences the survival and function of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) in the infarcted heart. CTRP9 enhances the engraftment, proliferation, and migration of ADSCs, promoting cardiac repair and reducing myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis post-myocardial infarction. The combination of CTRP9 with ADSCs has shown synergistic protective effects against cardiac injury, improving survival rates and cardiac function (Yan2017C1qTumor). These findings suggest that CTRP9 could be a potential therapeutic target for metabolic disorders and ischemic heart conditions.
