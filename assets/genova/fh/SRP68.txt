# SRP68

## Overview
The SRP68 gene encodes the signal recognition particle 68 (SRP68) protein, a crucial component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex, which plays a vital role in the co-translational targeting of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotic cells. As part of the SRP complex, SRP68 forms a heterodimer with SRP72, facilitating the recognition and binding of signal peptides and SRP RNA, which is essential for the delivery of nascent proteins to the ER membrane (Faoro2021Noncanonical; Iakhiaeva2009Characterization). Beyond its canonical role in protein targeting, SRP68 is also implicated in transcriptional regulation and chromatin dynamics, interacting with histone H4 and other protein complexes, suggesting a broader functional repertoire (Faoro2021Noncanonical). Mutations in the SRP68 gene have been linked to severe congenital neutropenia and other hematological conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Barbara2020Identification).

## Structure
The SRP68 protein is a component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex, essential for targeting proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. It forms a heterodimer with SRP72, which is crucial for SRP function. The primary structure of SRP68 includes an arginine-rich motif (ARM) that plays a significant role in binding to SRP RNA, specifically at the three-way junction of helices 5, 6, and 8, and the 5f-loop, causing a 20° bending of helix 5 (Wild2019Structure).

The secondary structure of SRP68 is characterized by α-solenoidal folds, which are important for its interaction with SRP RNA and SRP72. The N-terminal region of SRP68 contains a specific RNA-binding domain (RBD) crucial for its function (Wild2019Structure). The C-terminal region of SRP68 interacts with the N-terminal region of SRP72, which contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs necessary for stable binding (Iakhiaeva2009Characterization).

SRP68 also has splice variant isoforms, with some lacking parts of the RBD, which may affect its RNA-binding capabilities (Wild2019Structure). The protein's quaternary structure involves its interaction with SRP72, forming a stable heterodimer that is essential for the SRP complex's function (Iakhiaeva2009Characterization).

## Function
The SRP68 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the signal recognition particle (SRP), a ribonucleoprotein complex essential for the co-translational targeting of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotic cells. SRP68 forms a stable heterodimer with SRP72, which is crucial for the SRP's function in recognizing signal peptides and binding SRP RNA, facilitating the delivery of nascent proteins to the ER membrane (Faoro2021Noncanonical; Iakhiaeva2009Characterization). 

SRP68 is involved in the recognition of signal sequences of secretory proteins as they emerge from the ribosome, leading to elongation arrest. This process allows the SRP-ribosome complex to move to the SRP receptor on the ER membrane, where the ribosome is handed over to the SEC61 translocon, enabling the translocation of the nascent polypeptide chain into the ER lumen (Kellogg2022Signal). 

Beyond its canonical role, SRP68, in complex with SRP72, is implicated in transcriptional regulation and chromatin dynamics. It interacts with histone H4, suggesting a role in gene expression regulation and chromatin-related functions (Faoro2021Noncanonical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SRP68 gene have been implicated in severe congenital neutropenia (CN), a condition characterized by profound and chronic neutropenia. A study identified biallelic pathogenic variants of SRP68 in a Caucasian boy with severe neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The variants included an intronic point substitution affecting the splice donor site of exon 1 and a deletion of exon 1, leading to a loss-of-function effect. This resulted in reduced protein expression and impaired granulocyte proliferation, highlighting the role of SRP68 in granulocytic differentiation. The study suggests that defects in SRP68 can lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response, ultimately affecting granulocytic cell survival (Barbara2020Identification).

Other mutations in SRP68, such as A50Ffs p 52, are associated with congenital neutropenia and protein targeting problems. Additionally, the F590L mutation has been observed in cancer and is known to inhibit protein targeting to the ER (Kellogg2022Signal). These findings suggest that SRP68 mutations can disrupt normal protein targeting and contribute to disease pathogenesis, particularly in hematological conditions.

## Interactions
SRP68 is a component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) and forms a stable heterodimer with SRP72, which is essential for the SRP's function in protein targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum. This heterodimer binds to the SRP RNA, specifically interacting with the internal bulge-loops of helix 5 and the three-way junction between helices 5, 6, and 8 of the S domain in the SRP RNA. The SRP68 protein introduces an arginine-rich motif into the major groove of the 5f-loop of the SRP RNA, causing RNA bending and remodeling, which is crucial for the SRP-RNC (ribosome-nascent chain complex) contact (Wild2019Structure).

The SRP68/72 heterodimer also interacts with histone proteins, particularly binding to the tail of histone H4 in a methylation-sensitive manner, indicating a role in chromatin dynamics and transcription regulation (Faoro2021Noncanonical). SRP68 is involved in noncanonical functions, such as transcriptional regulation, by interacting with various protein complexes, including the CASC3-containing exon junction RNP complex and the TRAPPC2 trafficking complex, suggesting its involvement in RNA processing and transport (Faoro2021Noncanonical). The interaction with SRP72 is facilitated by tetratricopeptide repeat motifs in SRP72, which form a groove accommodating SRP68 residues, with specific amino acids like D585 being critical for this interaction (Iakhiaeva2009Characterization).
