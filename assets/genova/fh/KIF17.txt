# KIF17

## Overview
KIF17 is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 17, a motor protein belonging to the kinesin-2 family. This protein plays a pivotal role in intracellular transport, particularly in the movement of cargo along microtubules toward their plus ends. Kinesin family member 17 is characterized by its conserved N-terminal motor domain, which facilitates ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding, and a C-terminal tail domain that is crucial for cargo interaction. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of actin and microtubule dynamics at epithelial cell-cell adhesions and the transport of NMDA receptor subunits in neurons, which are essential for synaptic function and cognitive processes. KIF17's interactions with proteins such as EB1, APC, and importin α family members underscore its role in microtubule stabilization and ciliary entry. Mutations in the KIF17 gene have been linked to neurological and developmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Acharya2016KIF17; Funabashi2017Ciliary; Tarabeux2010De; Hirokawa2008Intracellular).

## Structure
KIF17 is a kinesin-2 family motor protein characterized by a conserved N-terminal motor domain responsible for ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding, facilitating its movement toward the plus-end of microtubules (Milic2017Intraflagellar; Hirokawa2008Intracellular). The protein is a homodimer, composed of identical polypeptide chains, each with a coiled-coil stalk domain that enables dimerization (Milic2017Intraflagellar). The C-terminal tail domain of KIF17 is crucial for cargo binding, interacting with specific proteins such as mLin-10, which is part of a complex involved in neuronal transport (Setou2000Kinesin).

KIF17's structure includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in its C-terminal region, which is essential for its entry into cilia and interaction with importin proteins (Funabashi2017Ciliary). The protein also contains a conserved sequence upstream of the NLS that is critical for binding to the IFT-B complex, specifically the IFT46-IFT56 dimer (Funabashi2017Ciliary). Phosphorylation at Ser-1029 in the COOH-terminal tail domain regulates KIF17's interaction with its binding partners, affecting its transport function (Hirokawa2008Intracellular). These structural features enable KIF17 to perform its roles in intracellular transport and ciliary entry.

## Function
KIF17 is a kinesin motor protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of actin and microtubule dynamics at epithelial cell-cell adhesions. It localizes at microtubule plus-ends and cell-cell contacts, where it colocalizes with E-cadherin and actin, contributing to the stability of the apical junctional complex (AJC) and epithelial polarization (Acharya2016KIF17). KIF17 influences actin dynamics through RhoA signaling, which affects the balance between actin polymerization and depolymerization, enhancing the incorporation of actin at cell-cell contacts independently of microtubule binding (Acharya2016KIF17).

KIF17 also plays a role in stabilizing E-cadherin at the plasma membrane, thereby strengthening intercellular adhesion. Its motor domain is essential for its localization at junctions and for triggering RhoA signaling, which reduces cofilin-mediated severing of junctional actin (Acharya2016KIF17). In addition to its role in epithelial cells, KIF17 is involved in the transport of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit 2B in dendrites, which is essential for synaptic function and cognitive processes such as learning and memory (Hirokawa2015Kinesin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KIF17 gene have been implicated in several neurological and developmental disorders. A de novo truncating mutation in KIF17 has been associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). This mutation results in a truncated protein that disrupts KIF17's function, leading to potential synaptic dysfunction. The pathogenic nature of this mutation was validated using zebrafish models, which showed developmental deficits similar to those observed in humans with the mutation (Tarabeux2010De). 

In addition to schizophrenia, KIF17 mutations have been linked to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The R869C mutation in KIF17 is associated with DLB, particularly in individuals who also carry the GBA-N370S mutation. This mutation affects the protein's structure and stability, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis (Goldstein2021R869C).

KIF17 is also involved in ocular development. Biallelic variants in KIF17 have been identified in individuals with congenital microphthalmia and coloboma, conditions within the microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma (MAC) spectrum. These findings suggest a role for KIF17 in eye development (Riva2021Biallelic).

## Interactions
KIF17, a kinesin motor protein, interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It binds to EB1 via its kinesin motor domain, specifically targeting the C terminus of EB1. This interaction is selective, as other kinesin family members do not exhibit the same binding affinity with EB1. The interaction between KIF17 and EB1 is crucial for targeting KIF17 to microtubule (MT) plus ends, contributing to MT stabilization (Jaulin2010KIF17).

KIF17 also interacts with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein independently of EB1. This interaction is mediated by KIF17's stalk domain and is essential for APC's localization at MT plus ends, influencing MT dynamics and stabilization (Jaulin2010KIF17).

In addition to its interactions with EB1 and APC, KIF17 binds to importin α family proteins, specifically KPNA1 and KPNA6, through its nuclear localization signal (NLS). This interaction is abolished when the NLS is mutated, indicating specificity in its interactions with importin α proteins (Funabashi2017Ciliary).

KIF17 also interacts with the IFT46-IFT56 dimer in the IFT-B complex, which is crucial for its entry into cilia, although not necessary for intraciliary trafficking (Funabashi2017Ciliary).
