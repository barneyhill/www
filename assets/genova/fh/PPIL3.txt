# PPIL3

## Overview
PPIL3, or peptidylprolyl isomerase like 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cyclophilin family, characterized by its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. The protein, also referred to as a minimal cyclophilin, plays a crucial role in the splicing of pre-mRNA within the spliceosome, a complex essential for RNA processing in eukaryotic cells (Adams2015Nuclear; Mesa2008Spliceosomal). Structurally, PPIL3 consists of a single isomerase domain and is involved in protein folding and function through its isomerization activity (Rajiv2018Structural; Davis2010Structural). It is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Zhou2001Molecular). PPIL3's interactions with proteins such as Apoptin and its involvement in viral processes, including SARS-CoV-2 replication, highlight its significance in both normal cellular function and disease contexts (Huo2008Interaction; Yang2024SARS‐CoV‐2).

## Structure
PPIL3, also known as peptidylprolyl isomerase like 3, is a member of the cyclophilin family characterized by its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. The protein consists of a single isomerase domain spanning its entire length of 161 amino acids, as indicated by its UniProt accession number Q9H2H8 (Rajiv2018Structural). Structurally, PPIL3 is described as a minimal cyclophilin, initially referred to as CypJ, with its isomerase domain structure solved through crystallography. Both its apo form and its form bound to cyclosporine are available in the Protein Data Bank (Rajiv2018Structural).

The protein features a central closed barrel type beta fold, typical of cyclophilins, with ordered loops and small helices (Rajiv2018Structural). Notably, PPIL3 has a shorter a1-b3 loop compared to other cyclophilins, which may influence its protein interactions and substrate specificity (Davis2010Structural). The S2 pocket, a key feature in substrate specificity, is uniform across cyclophilins but is controlled by gatekeeper residues, with PPIL3 having asparagine at position 103 (Davis2010Structural). PPIL3 may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, potentially affecting its structure and function.

## Function
PPIL3, a member of the cyclophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, plays a significant role in the splicing of pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. It is part of the spliceosome, a complex assembly involved in RNA processing, and interacts with splicing factors to facilitate the splicing process (Adams2015Nuclear; Mesa2008Spliceosomal). PPIL3 is ubiquitously expressed in adult human tissues, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Zhou2001Molecular).

PPIL3 is involved in the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues, a crucial step in protein folding and function. This activity is essential for the proper folding of proteins and may also influence protein-protein interactions within the spliceosome (Davis2010Structural; Thapar2015Roles). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular homeostasis and function (Huo2008Interaction).

In the context of the spliceosome, PPIL3 is associated with the B2 complex and is likely bound to the U2 snRNP, although its specific role in splicing remains to be fully elucidated (Mesa2008Spliceosomal; Thapar2015Roles). Its involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining efficient gene expression and cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PPIL3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer. PPIL3 has been associated with estrogen receptor-negative (ER-negative) breast cancer. Specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 2q33 region, where PPIL3 is located, have shown significant associations with ER-negative breast cancer risk. These SNPs are linked to PPIL3 expression, suggesting that modulation of its expression may contribute to breast cancer susceptibility, especially among BRCA1 mutation carriers (Couch2016Identification).

In the context of viral infections, PPIL3 plays a role in the replication and splicing regulation of SARS-CoV-2. Knockout of PPIL3 in A549 cells significantly reduced the entry efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, indicating its involvement in viral entry processes. Transcriptome analysis of PPIL3 knockout cells revealed changes in gene expression related to the immune response, suggesting that PPIL3 may influence viral infection processes through its role in RNA splicing (Yang2024SARS‐CoV‐2).

PPIL3 also interacts with Apoptin, a protein that induces apoptosis in cancer cells. This interaction affects the localization of Apoptin, potentially influencing its proapoptotic activity in tumor cells (Huo2008Interaction).

## Interactions
PPIL3, a member of the cyclophilin family, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function and localization. One significant interaction is with Apoptin, a protein known for its proapoptotic activity in tumor cells. PPIL3 binds directly to Apoptin, affecting its subcellular localization. In tumor cells, PPIL3 holds Apoptin in the cytoplasm, which is crucial for Apoptin's function, as it typically migrates to the nucleus in cancer cells to induce apoptosis. This interaction suggests that PPIL3 plays a role in the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of Apoptin, potentially through its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization function (Huo2008Interaction).

PPIL3 is also a component of the human spliceosome, specifically associated with the B2 complex, and is absent in the B1, U5 snRNP, and U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complexes. This suggests its involvement in the U2 snRNP complex, although the specific protein interactions within the spliceosome are not fully detailed (Mesa2008Spliceosomal). Despite its presence in spliceosomal complexes, PPIL3's interactions have not been visualized in structural studies, leaving some aspects of its role in splicing unclear (Rajiv2018Structural).
