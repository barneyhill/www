# TGDS

## Overview
The TGDS gene encodes the enzyme TDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This enzyme plays a crucial role in nucleotide sugar metabolism, although its specific function in humans remains to be fully elucidated. The TGDS protein is evolutionarily conserved and shares structural similarities with its bacterial orthologs, despite differences in substrate specificity, such as the absence of rhamnose in humans (Ehmke2014Homozygous). Mutations in the TGDS gene have been implicated in Catel-Manzke syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities (Boschann2019TGDS; Ehmke2014Homozygous). The study of TGDS and its associated protein continues to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this syndrome and the broader implications of nucleotide sugar metabolism in human health (Pferdehirt2015Catel–Manzke).

## Structure
The TGDS protein, or TDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, is a 350 amino acid enzyme that belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. It is evolutionarily conserved and shares a 35% sequence identity with its E. coli ortholog, which is involved in the rhamnose pathway, although rhamnose does not exist in humans (Ehmke2014Homozygous).

The secondary structure of TGDS typically consists of a central beta sheet flanked by three alpha helices on each side, a common feature among SDR family proteins. This structure is highly conserved, although variations exist in the loops involved in substrate binding (Ehmke2014Homozygous).

TGDS contains several predicted domains, including an active site, a NADP binding site, a substrate binding site, and a homodimer interface. Specific amino acid changes, such as p.Ala100Ser and p.Phe98Leu, are located in the NAD binding domain, while p.Asn298Asp is in the substrate binding site. These mutations are presumed to impair the functions of the respective domains (Ehmke2014Homozygous).

The closest paralog of TGDS in humans is UXS1, which shares a 27% identity at the protein level and is involved in the synthesis of UDP-xylose from UDP-glucoronate (Ehmke2014Homozygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TGDS gene are associated with Catel-Manzke syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by Pierre Robin sequence, bilateral hyperphalangy, and clinodactyly of the index finger. This syndrome is linked to homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in TGDS, which encodes a protein involved in nucleotide sugar metabolism (Boschann2019TGDS; Ehmke2014Homozygous). The condition presents with features such as micrognathia, airway obstruction, cleft palate, and orthopedic abnormalities like Manzke dysostosis (Pferdehirt2015Catel–Manzke). 

Several specific mutations in TGDS have been identified, including c.892A>G (p.Asn298Asp), c.270_271del (p.Lys91Asnfs*22), c.298G>T (p.Ala100Ser), c.294T>G (p.Phe98Leu), and c.269A>G (p.Glu90Gly), all of which are predicted to be disease-causing (Ehmke2014Homozygous). The p.Ala100Ser variant is noted as the most common pathogenic variant (Pferdehirt2015Catel–Manzke). 

The clinical presentation of Catel-Manzke syndrome can vary significantly, with some patients experiencing severe respiratory complications and failure to thrive (Pferdehirt2015Catel–Manzke). Recent studies have expanded the phenotypic spectrum of TGDS-associated Catel-Manzke syndrome to include cases without hyperphalangy, highlighting the variability in clinical manifestations (Boschann2019TGDS).
