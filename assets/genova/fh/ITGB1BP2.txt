# ITGB1BP2

## Overview
The ITGB1BP2 gene encodes the protein integrin subunit beta 1 binding protein 2, commonly known as melusin, which is a muscle-specific chaperone protein. Melusin is characterized by its interaction with the integrin β1 subunit, playing a pivotal role in muscle tissue, particularly in response to mechanical stress. It is categorized as a chaperone protein due to its involvement in protein folding and stabilization, facilitated by its interaction with the Hsp90 protein. The protein's structure includes CHORD domains and a CS domain, which are essential for its function in muscle fiber maturation and cardiac adaptation. Melusin's role in the integrin-signaling pathway is crucial for muscle regeneration and myoblast fusion, highlighting its importance in muscle and cardiac health (Brancaccio2002Melusin; Ruppert2013Identification; Dean2021Human).

## Structure
The ITGB1BP2 gene encodes the protein melusin, which is a muscle-specific chaperone interacting with the integrin β1 subunit. Melusin is composed of 347 amino acid residues and features a distinct domain organization. It contains two tandemly arranged CHORD (cysteine-and histidine-rich domains) domains, which are 60-amino acid Zn2+ binding domains characterized by unique cysteine-and histidine-rich sequence patterns separated by a spacer region (Ruppert2013Identification). The carboxy-terminal portion of melusin includes the integrin binding site, characterized by a CS (CHORD-containing protein and Sgt) domain, followed by a linker segment and a stretch of 28 residues rich in glutamic and aspartic acids, which are capable of low-affinity binding to Ca2+ (Ruppert2013Identification).

Melusin is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions. The protein also has multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its functional properties (Palumbo2009Melusin). The specific tertiary and quaternary structures of melusin have not been fully elucidated, but its domain organization suggests a complex structure that facilitates its role in muscle tissue, particularly in response to mechanical stress (Brancaccio2002Melusin).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ITGB1BP2 gene, which encodes the protein melusin, have been implicated in certain cardiac conditions. A study identified a missense mutation in this gene in a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). This mutation, a hemizygous C>G substitution in exon 11, results in an alanine to glycine change at position 313 (p.A313G). It was found in a patient with heart failure and sensorineural hearing loss, as well as in the patient's sister, who had borderline DCM. The mutation was absent in other family members and a control group of 300 healthy individuals, suggesting a potential but unclear association with DCM (Ruppert2013Identification).

Melusin, the protein encoded by ITGB1BP2, plays a role in cardiac function, particularly in response to mechanical stress. Studies in melusin-null mice have shown that the absence of melusin leads to impaired cardiac adaptation under chronic pressure overload, resulting in cardiac dilation and dysfunction. This suggests that melusin is crucial for preventing cardiac failure under stress conditions, and alterations in its expression or function could contribute to heart failure or other cardiac conditions (Brancaccio2002Melusin).

## Interactions
ITGB1BP2, also known as melusin, is known to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of β1 integrin, a membrane receptor that plays a crucial role in anchoring sarcomeres to the plasma membrane in muscle tissues. This interaction is significant for muscle fiber maturation and the compensatory hypertrophy response in pressure-overloaded hearts (Palumbo2009Melusin; Jaka2017FRZB). Melusin also binds directly to β1 integrins, which are essential for myoblast fusion and muscle fiber maturation, particularly in the context of Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2A (LGMD2A) (Jaka2017FRZB).

In addition to its interaction with integrins, ITGB1BP2 is part of a group of cochaperones that interact with the Hsp90 protein, which is involved in protein folding and stabilization. This interaction suggests a role for ITGB1BP2 in muscle-specific functions, although the exact nature of these interactions remains unspecified (Dean2021Human). ITGB1BP2 is also involved in the integrin-signaling pathway, which is crucial for muscle regeneration and myoblast fusion, indicating its role in the organization of the integrin complex essential for muscle fiber maturation (Jaka2017FRZB).
