# MBD3L1

## Overview
MBD3L1 is a gene that encodes the protein methyl-CpG binding domain protein 3 like 1, which is involved in epigenetic regulation. Although the protein itself does not possess a methyl-CpG binding domain, it plays a crucial role in forming a heterodimer with MBD2b, a protein that does have this domain. This interaction enhances the complex's ability to bind to methylated DNA, particularly in the context of capturing methylated CpG islands (CGIs) for molecular assays. The MBD2b/MBD3L1 complex is instrumental in the methylated-CG island recovery assay (MIRA), which is used to enrich and analyze hypermethylated DNA regions. Through its interaction with MBD2b, MBD3L1 contributes to the specificity and efficacy of DNA methylation studies, underscoring its importance in the field of epigenetics (Acevedo2012Detection).

## Interactions
MBD3L1 is known to form a heterodimer with MBD2b, a protein that possesses a methyl-CpG binding domain. This interaction results in a protein complex with increased affinity for methylated DNA, making it effective for capturing methylated CpG islands (CGIs). The MBD2b/MBD3L1 heterodimer is utilized in the methylated-CG island recovery assay (MIRA), which is designed to enrich CGI regions and facilitate downstream molecular detection. This complex is particularly effective in capturing hypermethylated DNA when coupled to magnetic beads, allowing for the separation of methylated and unmethylated DNA fragments (Acevedo2012Detection).

While MBD3L1 lacks a methyl-CpG binding domain itself, its interaction with MBD2b enhances the binding specificity of the complex for methylated DNA. This specificity is demonstrated in experiments where the MBD2b/MBD3L1 complex captures templates with multiple methylated CpG sites but not those with only a single methylated site (Acevedo2012Detection). MBD3L1's role in this heterodimer highlights its potential involvement in epigenetic regulation through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids.
