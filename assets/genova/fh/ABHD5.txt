# ABHD5

## Overview
The ABHD5 gene encodes the protein abhydrolase domain containing 5, which is a member of the α/β hydrolase fold family. Despite its classification, the ABHD5 protein does not possess intrinsic hydrolase activity due to a substitution in its catalytic triad. Instead, it functions as a coactivator of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), playing a pivotal role in lipid metabolism by facilitating the mobilization of free fatty acids from stored triglycerides. This protein is involved in various physiological processes, including intracellular lipolysis and skin barrier formation, and interacts with perilipin proteins to regulate lipase activity. Mutations in the ABHD5 gene are linked to Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome, a disorder characterized by impaired lipid metabolism and the accumulation of neutral lipids in tissues (Sanders2017Molecular; Cakmak2021Chanarin‐Dorfman; Kien2018ABHD5).

## Structure
The ABHD5 protein, encoded by the ABHD5 gene, is a member of the α/β hydrolase fold family, characterized by a core structure of alternating α-helices and β-strands. Despite its classification, ABHD5 lacks intrinsic hydrolase activity due to a substitution of the conserved serine nucleophile with asparagine (S155N) (Shahoei2022Molecular; Tseng2022Structural). The protein's secondary structure includes six alpha helices and eight beta strands, with additional insertion regions that contribute to its function (Shahoei2022Molecular).

ABHD5 features a unique amphipathic helix that facilitates its binding to lipid membranes, stabilized by interactions between residues such as R116 and E41 (Shahoei2022Molecular). The protein also contains specific binding pockets, including pocket α and pocket θ, which are crucial for its role in lipase activation and lipid droplet targeting (Tseng2022Structural). These pockets are characterized by distinct electrostatic potentials and are involved in interactions with other proteins and ligands (Tseng2022Structural).

The protein's structure is further defined by a lid-like domain, larger than that of other lipases, which regulates interactions and access to binding pockets (Tseng2022Structural). ABHD5's structural features enable its function as a coactivator of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), playing a significant role in lipid metabolism (Shahoei2022Molecular).

## Function
The ABHD5 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by acting as a coactivator for adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), which is essential for intracellular lipolysis. This process involves the mobilization of free fatty acids from stored triglycerides, a key metabolic function in eukaryotic cells (Sanders2017Molecular). In healthy human cells, ABHD5 is vital for the activation of ATGL, particularly in fat and muscle tissues, where it integrates extracellular and intracellular signals to regulate lipolysis (Sanders2017Molecular).

ABHD5 interacts with perilipin proteins on lipid droplets, and its lipase-activating function is repressed by binding to perilipin 1 (PLIN1). Activation of protein kinase A (PKA) leads to phosphorylation of PLIN1 and ABHD5, releasing ABHD5 to activate ATGL (Sanders2017Molecular). Despite being a member of the alpha-beta hydrolase family, ABHD5 lacks hydrolytic activity due to the absence of a serine nucleophile in the catalytic triad (Sanders2017Molecular).

ABHD5 also plays a role in skin physiology by stimulating PNPLA1-dependent synthesis of ω-O-acylceramides, which are crucial for forming a functional skin permeability barrier (Kien2018ABHD5). This function is independent of its role in ATGL activation (Kien2018ABHD5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABHD5 gene, also known as CGI-58, are primarily associated with Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired lipid metabolism leading to the accumulation of neutral lipids in various tissues. Clinical manifestations of CDS include ichthyosis, liver steatosis, myopathy, sensorineural hearing loss, and cataracts (Cakmak2021Chanarin‐Dorfman; Liang2022Case). The presence of ichthyosis and lipid vacuoles in leukocytes, known as Jordan's anomaly, is key for diagnosing CDS (Cakmak2021Chanarin‐Dorfman).

Mutations in ABHD5 disrupt its role as a co-activator of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), leading to the accumulation of triglycerides (TG) due to impaired lipolysis (Lass2006Adipose; Schweiger2009Neutral). These mutations can result in a range of severities, including myopathy, steatosis, cholestasis, mental retardation, and cataracts (Srinivasan2004Steatohepatitis). The ABHD5 gene mutations can also lead to neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis (NLSDI), characterized by ectopic accumulation of triacylglycerols within cytoplasmic lipid droplets (Brown2017Critical). The genetic and clinical variability in CDS is attributed to different mutations in the ABHD5 gene, affecting its interaction with ATGL and other potential lipases (Lass2006Adipose).

## Interactions
ABHD5, also known as CGI-58, is a crucial regulator of lipid metabolism through its interactions with various proteins. It acts as a co-activator of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), enhancing its triacylglycerol hydrolase activity, which is essential for lipolysis. This interaction is vital for the breakdown of triglycerides into diacylglycerol and free fatty acids (Schratter2022ABHD5—A). Specific residues in ABHD5, such as R299, G328, and D334, are critical for activating ATGL lipolysis (Tseng2022Structural).

ABHD5 also interacts with perilipin proteins, particularly PLIN5, which is crucial for lipolysis in oxidative tissues. In the basal state, PLIN5 binds both ATGL and ABHD5, but not simultaneously, and the absence of ABHD5 impairs the targeting of ATGL to PLIN5, reducing lipolysis (Schratter2022ABHD5—A). Long-chain acyl-CoAs act as endogenous ligands that enhance ABHD5's interaction with PLIN proteins, suppressing lipolysis (Schratter2022ABHD5—A).

ABHD5's interaction with ATGL is also significant in the context of hepatitis C virus (HCV) assembly, where it cooperates with ATGL to mobilize lipids necessary for HCV production (Vieyres2020The). The interaction between ABHD5 and ATGL is crucial for the biogenesis of HCV lipo-viro-particles and host lipoproteins (Vieyres2020The).
