# CCT2

## Overview
CCT2, or chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 2, is a gene that encodes a protein subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), also known as the TRiC complex. This complex is a type of molecular chaperone essential for the folding of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin, which are crucial for maintaining cellular structure and function (Minegishi2016CCT2). The CCT complex is composed of eight distinct subunits, including CCT2, which together form a double-ring structure that facilitates the folding of nascent polypeptides within its central cavity through ATP hydrolysis (Willison2018The). CCT2 is involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy and protein aggregation, and plays a significant role in the folding of proteins associated with cell division and retinal development (Pavel2016CCT; Minegishi2016CCT2). Alterations in CCT2 expression or function have been linked to several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Leber congenital amaurosis, and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and potential as a therapeutic target (Ma2023Multiomics; Liu2021Molecular; Minegishi2016CCT2).

## Structure
The CCT2 protein is a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), which is essential for protein folding in eukaryotic cells. The CCT complex is composed of eight subunits, each forming a double-ring structure with a central cavity for substrate folding (Willison2018The). Each subunit, including CCT2, consists of three domains: the equatorial domain, which contains the ATP binding site; the intermediate domain; and the apical domain, which is responsible for substrate binding (Willison2018The).

The primary structure of CCT2 is a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-order structures. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these elements, allowing CCT2 to interact with other subunits and substrates effectively. In its quaternary structure, CCT2 assembles with other CCT subunits to form the functional double-ring complex (Cuéllar2019Structural).

CCT2 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions. The protein is involved in the folding of actin and tubulin, crucial for maintaining cellular structure and function (Showalter2020Investigating).

## Function
CCT2, or chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 2, is a critical component of the chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex, also known as the TRiC complex. This complex is essential for the proper folding of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin, which are vital for maintaining cellular structure and function (Minegishi2016CCT2). The CCT complex forms a hetero-octamer ring structure that creates a cavity where nascent proteins are folded into their native conformations with the aid of ATP hydrolysis (Minegishi2016CCT2).

CCT2 is involved in the folding of various proteins, including those associated with cell division control and the Von Hippel-Lindau disease tumor suppressor protein, which is important for retinal development (Minegishi2016CCT2). In retinal cells, CCT2 plays a role in the folding of β-propeller proteins, such as Gβ1, which is crucial for the phototransduction pathway (Minegishi2016CCT2). The CCT complex, including CCT2, is expressed in retinal ganglion cells and near the connecting cilium in photoreceptor cells, indicating its role in retinal development and maintenance (Minegishi2016CCT2).

CCT2 also plays a significant role in autophagy, a cellular process that degrades and recycles cellular components. The CCT complex is crucial for maintaining autophagic flux and lysosomal function, which are essential for cellular homeostasis (Pavel2016CCT). CCT2 interacts with various autophagic machinery components, suggesting its involvement in modulating autophagy and protein aggregation (Pavel2016CCT).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CCT2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), CCT2 is significantly downregulated in various brain regions, which may contribute to the disease by affecting protein folding and autophagy processes. This downregulation is linked to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, such as β-amyloid and Tau, which are characteristic of AD pathology. CCT2's role in autophagy and protein homeostasis suggests it could be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for AD (Ma2023Multiomics).

In Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a hereditary retinal dystrophy, mutations in the CCT2 gene, specifically T400P and R516H, lead to instability in the chaperone complex. These mutations disrupt the interaction with the CCTγ subunit, resulting in decreased proliferation of patient-derived cells and contributing to severe retinal degeneration. The instability caused by these mutations affects the folding of critical proteins involved in retinal development and function (Minegishi2016CCT2).

CCT2 is also associated with cancer, where its expression is often upregulated. In breast cancer, high CCT2 expression correlates with aggressive tumor subtypes and poor prognosis. It is involved in cell cycle regulation and may serve as a potential target for cancer therapy (Liu2021Molecular; Zheng2023A).

## Interactions
CCT2, a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex, is involved in various protein interactions essential for cellular functions. It interacts with proteins such as MAPK8, HSPH1, and PARK2, which are associated with stress responses and neurodegenerative diseases (Narayanan2016The). CCT2 also binds to huntingtin fragments, polyA stretches, and mutant ATXN3, with these interactions being primarily autophagy-dependent, suggesting a role in regulating protein aggregation through autophagy pathways (Pavel2016CCT).

The CCT complex, including CCT2, is crucial for the folding of actin and tubulin proteins, forming a hetero-octamer ring structure that facilitates protein folding through ATP hydrolysis (Minegishi2016CCT2). CCT2 interacts with other chaperone systems like Hsp70, indicating a functional interplay involving CCT, Hsc/p70, and prefoldin (Narayanan2016The). It is also involved in the folding of proteins related to cell cycle progression, such as Cdc20p and Cdh1p, and interacts with components of the TOR signaling pathway (Dekker2008The).

CCT2's interactions extend to the retina, where it colocalizes with CCTγ and regulates the expression of Gβ1, a protein involved in phototransduction signaling (Minegishi2016CCT2). These interactions highlight CCT2's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases like Alzheimer's and Leber congenital amaurosis.
