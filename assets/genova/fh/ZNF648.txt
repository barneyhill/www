# ZNF648

## Overview
ZNF648 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 648, which is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation within the nucleus. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in interacting with DNA and other nuclear proteins to influence gene expression. Zinc finger protein 648 is implicated in chromatin remodeling, particularly through histone modification processes such as H3K4me3, which is crucial for regulating DNA accessibility for transcriptional activities in adipose tissue (Lazarenko2022Comprehensive). The gene is associated with lipid metabolism and may play a role in regulating toxicity processes, as it is predicted to create binding sites for transcription factors related to nuclear receptors in these pathways (Lazarenko2022Comprehensive). Additionally, ZNF648 has been linked to various cardiometabolic traits through genome-wide association studies, suggesting its involvement in cellular differentiation and development (Ballantyne2016Genomewide). Despite these associations, the precise molecular functions and organismal impacts of ZNF648 in healthy human cells remain to be fully understood.

## Function
ZNF648 (zinc finger protein 648) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily active in the nucleus where it interacts with DNA and other nuclear proteins. This protein is implicated in chromatin remodeling through histone modification, particularly H3K4me3, which regulates DNA access for transcriptional regulation in adipose tissue (Lazarenko2022Comprehensive). The ZNF648 gene is associated with lipid metabolism and potentially in the regulation of toxicity processes, as it is predicted to create binding sites for transcription factors enriched with the term 'nuclear receptors in lipid metabolism and toxicity' (Lazarenko2022Comprehensive).

In the context of cardiometabolic traits, ZNF648 has been linked to various genetic associations through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), although specific functions in healthy human cells are not detailed (Ballantyne2016Genomewide). The gene's involvement in these processes suggests a role in cellular differentiation and development by modulating the activity of specific genes. However, the precise molecular activities and organismal outcomes of ZNF648 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF648 has been implicated in several diseases through its genetic variations and potential regulatory roles. In a genome-wide association study focused on peripheral neuropathy in patients undergoing d-drug-containing regimens for AIDS, a polymorphism in the ZNF648 gene was identified with the lowest P value in Black patients with grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, suggesting a potential association, although it was not genome-wide significant (Leger2014Genomewide).

In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-coding somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in regulatory regions of ZNF648 were detected, indicating a potential functional role in ALL. These SNVs were located in a hotspot region, suggesting they may have a regulatory impact, although the specific clinical significance of ZNF648 mutations in ALL remains unclear (Sayyab2021Mutational).

ZNF648 has also been associated with lipid traits, specifically high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, through genome-wide association studies. This association highlights the gene's potential involvement in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease, although the clinical significance of ZNF648 mutations in these contexts is not fully established (Ganesh2013Genetics).
