# OR4C3

## Overview
OR4C3 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily C member 3, which is a part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the olfactory system by detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. The OR4C3 gene is characterized by significant copy-number variation among individuals, which can complicate its mapping to the reference genome due to duplications at separate chromosome locations in non-reference genomes (Veilleux2023Human; Waszak2010Systematic). This genetic variability is thought to contribute to individual differences in olfactory perception, underscoring the importance of understanding OR4C3's genetic diversity for functional studies (Waszak2010Systematic). While the clinical significance of OR4C3 remains to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in various conditions, including familial von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and aggressive glioblastoma, suggesting potential roles in disease processes (Khan2023Identification; Zhou2021WholeExome).

## Function
OR4C3 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR4C3 is primarily active in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants. Upon binding, it triggers neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Veilleux2023Human).

The gene exhibits significant copy-number variation among individuals, with duplications being common. This variability can complicate mapping to the reference genome, as OR4C3, along with OR4C4P and OR4C5, is duplicated at a separate chromosome location in non-reference genomes (Veilleux2023Human; Waszak2010Systematic). These duplications suggest potential mis-assembly in the reference genome, which may affect the study of its function and genetic diversity (Waszak2010Systematic).

The diversity in OR4C3 and other olfactory receptor genes is thought to influence individual differences in smell perception, highlighting the importance of understanding its genetic variability for functional studies (Waszak2010Systematic).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR4C3 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been explored in various studies, though its specific role in disease remains unclear. In the context of familial von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, OR4C3 was identified among 34 mutation sites across 21 genes in patients with central nervous system hemangioblastoma, suggesting a potential involvement in the condition, although the direct impact of OR4C3 mutations was not detailed (Zhou2021WholeExome). In osteosarcoma, OR4C3 was noted to have five coding region single nucleotide variants not present in control tissue, indicating a possible association with cancer processes, though the clinical significance of these mutations was not specified (Reimann2014Whole).

In studies on gastroschisis, OR4C3 was mentioned in the context of genetic variants co-segregating with the condition, but its specific clinical implications were not detailed (SalinasTorres2019Bioinformatic; Salinas‐Torres2020Whole). In aggressive glioblastoma, OR4C3 was among the top ten genes with the highest number of mutations, yet the clinical significance of these mutations remains to be fully understood (Khan2023Identification). Overall, while OR4C3 mutations have been identified in various conditions, further research is needed to establish their direct clinical significance.
