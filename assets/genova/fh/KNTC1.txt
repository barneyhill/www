# KNTC1

## Overview
KNTC1, or kinetochore associated 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the function of the Rod-Zw10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex, which is crucial for the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and kinetochore activities during mitosis. The protein encoded by KNTC1 is involved in maintaining SAC arrest by anchoring the Mad1-Mad2 complex to kinetochores, thereby ensuring accurate chromosome alignment and segregation. As a component of the RZZ complex, KNTC1 plays a pivotal role in recruiting dynein-dynactin to kinetochores, which is essential for mitotic spindle function and chromosome alignment (Rodriguez-Rodriguez2018Distinct; Gama2017Molecular). Additionally, KNTC1 is implicated in the formation of the fibrous corona at kinetochores, a structure necessary for kinetochore expansion and efficient chromosome alignment (Rodriguez-Rodriguez2018Distinct). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various cancers, where it is often upregulated, correlating with tumor progression and poor prognosis (Liu2022KNTC1; Tong2023Silencing).

## Function
The KNTC1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the Rod-Zw10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex, which plays a significant role in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and kinetochore function during mitosis. KNTC1 is essential for maintaining SAC arrest by tethering the Mad1-Mad2 complex to kinetochores, ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation (Rodriguez-Rodriguez2018Distinct). The RZZ complex, including KNTC1, is involved in the recruitment of dynein-dynactin to kinetochores, which is crucial for mitotic spindle function and chromosome alignment (Gama2017Molecular).

KNTC1 is also implicated in the formation of the fibrous corona at kinetochores, a structure necessary for kinetochore expansion and efficient chromosome alignment (Rodriguez-Rodriguez2018Distinct). The phosphorylation of the Rod subunit by Mps1 kinase is necessary for kinetochore expansion, highlighting KNTC1's role in maintaining kinetochore architecture (Rodriguez-Rodriguez2018Distinct). In the absence of KNTC1, cells exhibit premature exit from mitosis when spindle function is compromised, indicating its importance in maintaining mitotic arrest in response to spindle damage (Rodriguez-Rodriguez2018Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
KNTC1 (kinetochore associated 1) has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromosome segregation during cell division. Altered expression of KNTC1 is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in several cancer types. In pancreatic cancer, KNTC1 is significantly upregulated, and its high expression correlates with poor survival outcomes, suggesting its role as a potential oncogene (Liu2022KNTC1). Similarly, in colon cancer, KNTC1 is overexpressed, and its knockdown results in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating its involvement in tumor progression (Zhengxiang2021KNTC1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KNTC1 is highly expressed and linked to poor prognosis. Silencing KNTC1 in HCC cells leads to decreased proliferation and migration, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tong2023Silencing). KNTC1 is also overexpressed in gallbladder carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis (Jia2023KNTC1). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, KNTC1 is identified as a hub gene involved in tumorigenesis, although these findings are primarily based on bioinformatics analyses (Liu2019Bioinformatics).

## Interactions
KNTC1, also known as kinetochore associated 1, is a component of the Rod-Zw10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex, which plays a critical role in spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) signaling and kinetochore expansion. The RZZ complex is essential for the formation of the fibrous corona at kinetochores, a structure that promotes lateral microtubule attachment and enhances SAC signaling (Rodriguez-Rodriguez2018Distinct). KNTC1 interacts with the Mad1-Mad2 complex, tethering it to kinetochores, which is crucial for maintaining SAC arrest (Rodriguez-Rodriguez2018Distinct).

KNTC1 is also involved in the recruitment of dynein to kinetochores through its interaction with the RZZ complex and Spindly. This interaction is important for the proper functioning of the kinetochore and chromosome segregation (Gama2017Molecular). The phosphorylation of KNTC1 by Mps1 kinase is necessary for kinetochore expansion, specifically through the phosphorylation of the N terminus of Rod, a component of the RZZ complex (Rodriguez-Rodriguez2018Distinct).

In cancer, KNTC1 has been implicated in various malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it interacts with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation and survival (Liu2022shRNA‑mediated; Tong2023Silencing).
