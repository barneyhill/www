# ZDHHC1

## Overview
ZDHHC1 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger DHHC-type containing 1, which functions as a palmitoyltransferase enzyme. This enzyme is integral to the post-translational modification process known as palmitoylation, where it facilitates the attachment of palmitic acid to specific cysteine residues on target proteins. This modification is crucial for regulating protein localization, stability, and function, particularly within the Golgi apparatus. The protein encoded by ZDHHC1 is involved in several key cellular processes, including the regulation of the p53 signaling pathway and immune responses, through its interactions with proteins such as p53 and IFITM3. These interactions underscore its role in cellular signaling, tumor suppression, and antiviral defense mechanisms (Wang2020p53; Tang2021Cancer; Gadalla2019Toward).

## Function
ZDHHC1 is a gene encoding a palmitoyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through palmitoylation. This process involves the addition of palmitic acid to cysteine residues, which affects protein localization, stability, and function. ZDHHC1 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking (Gadalla2019Toward).

In healthy human cells, ZDHHC1 is ubiquitously expressed and is involved in the regulation of the p53 signaling pathway. It facilitates the palmitoylation of p53, a tumor suppressor protein, which is essential for its nuclear translocation and activation. This modification enhances p53's ability to function as a transcription factor, promoting the expression of target genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Tang2021Cancer). ZDHHC1 also plays a role in the palmitoylation of IFITM3, a protein involved in immune responses, indicating its involvement in the p53-ZDHHC1-IFITM3 regulatory pathway (Wang2020p53).

The activity of ZDHHC1 is regulated by p53, which can upregulate its expression, suggesting a feedback mechanism that maintains cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Wang2020p53).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZDHHC1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. ZDHHC1 is frequently silenced in various cancers due to promoter methylation, which is a common mechanism for tumor suppressor gene inactivation. This silencing is observed in cancers such as colon, hepatocellular, nasopharyngeal, gastric, breast, and lung tumors (Le2020DNA). The downregulation of ZDHHC1 is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its re-expression can suppress these processes and induce apoptosis (Le2020DNA).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), low expression of ZDHHC1 correlates with poor prognosis. ZDHHC1 inhibits CRC progression by downregulating LIPG, a key player in CRC cell growth, through the palmitoylation of IGF2BP1 (Zhang2024ZDHHC1). In cancers with wild-type p53, ZDHHC1 is involved in the palmitoylation of p53, a modification necessary for its tumor-suppressing activity. The epigenetic silencing of ZDHHC1 can disrupt this process, contributing to cancer progression (Tang2021Cancer).

These findings suggest that ZDHHC1 could serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment, particularly in cancers with wild-type p53 and CRC (Le2020DNA; Tang2021Cancer).

## Interactions
ZDHHC1, a palmitoyltransferase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, mediating its palmitoylation at specific cysteine residues (C135, C176, and C275). This modification is crucial for p53's nuclear translocation and its role in tumor suppression. The interaction between ZDHHC1 and p53 forms part of a negative feedback loop where p53 recruits DNMT3A to the ZDHHC1 promoter, leading to its epigenetic silencing (Tang2021Cancer).

ZDHHC1 also interacts with the interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), promoting its palmitoylation, which is essential for its antiviral activity against the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). This interaction is part of a regulatory pathway involving p53, ZDHHC1, and IFITM3, which restricts JEV replication (Wang2020p53).

These interactions highlight ZDHHC1's role in modulating protein functions through palmitoylation, affecting processes such as antiviral defense and tumor suppression. The protein's ability to interact with key regulatory proteins like p53 and IFITM3 underscores its significance in cellular signaling pathways (Wang2020p53; Tang2021Cancer).
