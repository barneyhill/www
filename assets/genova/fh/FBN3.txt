# FBN3

## Overview
FBN3 is a gene that encodes the protein fibrillin 3, a member of the fibrillin family of large glycoproteins. Fibrillin 3 is primarily involved in the formation of microfibrils, which are critical components of the extracellular matrix in connective tissues. These microfibrils contribute to the structural integrity and elasticity of tissues, particularly during early human development. The protein is characterized by multiple epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains, including calcium-binding EGF domains, which are essential for its structural and functional roles. Fibrillin 3 is also implicated in the regulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) bioavailability, influencing processes such as cell differentiation and tissue remodeling. Although the specific functions of FBN3 are less understood compared to other fibrillin family members, mutations in the FBN3 gene have been associated with a Bardet–Biedl syndrome-like phenotype, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Genovesi2022Case; Davis2012Structure).

## Structure
Fibrillin-3 (FBN3) is a large glycoprotein that plays a role in the formation of microfibrils within the extracellular matrix. The primary structure of FBN3 includes a sequence of amino acids organized into multiple functional domains. These domains prominently feature epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains, with a significant number being calcium-binding EGF (cbEGF) domains, which are crucial for the protein's structural integrity and function (Davis2012Structure; Peeters2022The). FBN3 also contains unique 8-cysteine domains that are thought to interact with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), contributing to the regulation of connective tissue function (Davis2012Structure).

The secondary structure of FBN3 is characterized by the presence of beta-sheets and alpha-helices, typical of EGF-like domains. The tertiary structure involves the overall 3D folding of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with other molecules and its role in microfibril assembly (Davis2012Structure). FBN3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation, which is important for protein folding and stability (Peeters2022The).

FBN3 does not have known functional alternatively spliced isoforms, and it utilizes a single promoter for transcription (Davis2012Structure). The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other fibrillin molecules, although specific interactions of FBN3 with other fibrillins remain largely unknown (Peeters2022The).

## Function
Fibrillin 3 (FBN3) is a protein involved in the formation of microfibrils, which are essential components of the extracellular matrix in connective tissues. These microfibrils provide structural support and contribute to the integrity and elasticity of tissues. FBN3 is particularly important during early human development, with its expression primarily detected in embryonic and fetal tissues, especially in the brain (Davis2012Structure). 

FBN3 is suggested to play a role in the assembly of microfibril cores during early development, as its mRNA is present in embryonic and fetal tissues (Davis2012Structure). The protein is involved in regulating the bioavailability of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), a critical regulator of connective tissue function. Fibrillin proteins, including FBN3, interact with latent TGFβ binding proteins (LTBPs) to sequester TGFβ in the extracellular matrix, impacting processes such as mesenchymal cell differentiation and extracellular matrix formation (Prodoehl2009Genetic; Davis2012Structure).

Despite its involvement in these molecular processes, the specific functions of FBN3 in healthy human cells remain less understood compared to other fibrillin family members, and no diseases are unequivocally associated with FBN3 mutations (Peeters2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FBN3 gene have been implicated in a Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS)-like phenotype. A novel homozygous missense variant, p.Ile1812Val, in the FBN3 gene has been identified in a patient exhibiting symptoms such as developmental delay, cognitive impairment, obesity, dental and genital anomalies, and brachydactyly/syndactyly. This phenotype is similar to BBS but notably lacks polydactyly, a common feature of typical BBS (Genovesi2022Case). The FBN3 gene, less characterized than its counterparts FBN1 and FBN2, is suggested to play a role in the structural and functional integrity of the extracellular matrix, with its expression pattern in the central nervous system potentially explaining the neurodevelopmental disorders observed in affected individuals (Genovesi2022Case).

Despite these findings, the role of FBN3 in other conditions remains unclear. For instance, studies investigating the association between FBN3 and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) found no significant link between FBN3 mutations and PCOS, suggesting that if FBN3 is involved, its role is not evident from current data (Prodoehl2009Genetic). Overall, while FBN3 mutations are associated with a BBS-like phenotype, their broader clinical significance requires further research.

## Interactions
Fibrillin 3 (FBN3) is a member of the fibrillin protein family, which plays a crucial role in the formation of microfibrils within the extracellular matrix. These microfibrils are involved in the regulation of growth factor signaling, particularly through interactions with latent transforming growth factor-beta binding proteins (LTBPs). Fibrillins, including FBN3, are known to sequester TGF-β and BMP complexes, thereby regulating cell differentiation and tissue remodeling (Genovesi2022Case; Charbonneau2004Fine).

FBN3 is suggested to interact with other extracellular matrix molecules, such as fibulin-2, MAGP-1, MAGP-2, elastin, and versican, forming connections between microfibrillar scaffolds and other matrix components. These interactions are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of connective tissues (Charbonneau2004Fine). Although specific interactions of FBN3 with LTBPs are not detailed, it is implied that FBN3 may participate in similar regulatory processes as other fibrillins, influencing the bioavailability of TGF-β (Davis2012Structure).

The precise role of FBN3 in these interactions remains less understood compared to other fibrillins, and further research is needed to clarify its specific contributions to microfibril assembly and growth factor regulation (Davis2012Structure).
