# RPF2

## Overview
RPF2 is a gene that encodes the ribosome production factor 2 homolog, a protein integral to ribosome biogenesis. This protein is categorized as a ribosome assembly factor and is primarily involved in the assembly and maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. The RPF2 protein forms a complex with Rrs1, which is essential for the integration of the 5S ribonucleoprotein (RNP) into preribosomes, a critical step in ribosome assembly (Madru2015Chaperoning; Kharde2015The). The RPF2-Rrs1 complex interacts with various ribosomal components, including 5S rRNA and ribosomal proteins, to ensure the proper incorporation of these elements into the pre-60S ribosomal subunit (Zhang2007Assembly). The activity of RPF2 is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing diseases such as cancer and ribosomopathies, highlighting its significance in cellular biology and potential as a therapeutic target (Madru2015Chaperoning; Panagopoulou2021Deciphering).

## Structure
The RPF2 protein is a component of the Rpf2-Rrs1 complex, which plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis. The protein is characterized by a Brix domain, which is a central feature of its structure. This domain is composed of a central five-stranded β-sheet surrounded by three α-helices, resembling the anticodon-binding domain (ABD) of class IIa aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Kharde2015The). The RPF2 protein is divided into two subdomains, Rpf2-N and Rpf2-C, which are related by pseudo-symmetry. The Rpf2-N subdomain is missing helix α3 of the ABD fold, allowing for tight packing within the Brix domain (Kharde2015The).

The tertiary structure of RPF2 includes a saddle-shaped six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet extended by two parallel β-strands and flanked by three α-helices. The C-terminus of RPF2 is extended by an additional helix and a split strand due to a glycine-proline insertion (Kharde2015The). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a complex with Rrs1, which complements the Rpf2-C subdomain by providing missing structural elements, forming a tight interface that does not dissociate in vitro (Kharde2015The). The Rpf2-Rrs1 complex interacts with 5S rRNA, RpL5, and the ribosome biogenesis factor Rsa4, playing a role in the recruitment of the 5S RNP into the pre-ribosome (Kharde2015The).

## Function
The RPF2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the assembly and maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. RPF2 is involved in the integration of the 5S ribonucleoprotein (RNP) into preribosomes, a process essential for the proper assembly of ribosomal components (Madru2015Chaperoning). The RPF2 protein forms a complex with Rrs1, which acts as a structural hub, binding both RNA and proteins, ensuring that the 5S rRNA and associated proteins are correctly incorporated into the pre-60S ribosomal subunit (Kharde2015The).

The RPF2-Rrs1 complex interacts with the 5S rRNA, ribosomal proteins Rpl5 and Rpl11, and the ribosome assembly factor Rsa4, establishing a network of interactions that guide the 5S RNP's incorporation into preribosomes (Madru2015Chaperoning). This complex is essential for maintaining the fidelity of ribosome assembly by preventing the association of the 5S RNP with malformed preribosomal particles (Madru2015Chaperoning).

RPF2 is active in the nucleolus, where it assists in the structural rearrangements necessary for ribosome assembly, which are crucial for efficient protein synthesis (Micic2020Coupling). The proper function of RPF2 is critical for cellular homeostasis and the prevention of diseases such as cancer and ribosomopathies (Madru2015Chaperoning).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the RPF2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer and ribosomopathies. The RPF2 gene is involved in ribosome biogenesis, and its dysregulation can lead to defects in ribosome assembly, which are associated with various diseases. In cancer, alterations in ribosome biogenesis, including those involving RPF2, can contribute to tumorigenesis by enhancing cellular proliferation and translation (Madru2015Chaperoning; Panagopoulou2021Deciphering). 

Ribosomopathies, such as Diamond Blackfan anemia and 5q syndrome, are linked to defects in ribosome assembly and are associated with the misregulation of the p53 pathway. The 5S ribonucleoprotein (RNP), which involves RPF2, plays a crucial role in stabilizing p53 by inhibiting MDM2, thus regulating energy metabolism and nucleolar stress responses (Madru2015Chaperoning). 

Furthermore, the hypermethylation of the RPF2 gene has been observed in breast cancer, suggesting its potential role in the progression of this disease (Panagopoulou2021Deciphering). These findings highlight the importance of RPF2 in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in diseases related to ribosome biogenesis defects.

## Interactions
RPF2 is a crucial component in ribosome biogenesis, interacting with several proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate the assembly of ribosomal subunits. It forms a stable complex with Rrs1, which is essential for recruiting 5S rRNA and ribosomal proteins RpL5 and RpL11 into nascent ribosomes (Zhang2007Assembly). The Rpf2-Rrs1 complex is involved in the assembly of the pre-60S ribosomal subunit, where it interacts with 5S rRNA, RpL5, and the ribosome biogenesis factor Rsa4 (Kharde2015The). Rpf2 specifically interacts with the 5S rRNA through its Brix domain, stabilizing the RNA structure and facilitating its incorporation into the ribosome (Kharde2015The).

The Rpf2-Rrs1 complex also forms a continuous interaction surface with RpL5 and Rsa4, potentially creating a continuous β-sheet across these proteins, which is important for the restructuring of the pre-60S particle (Kharde2015The). Additionally, Rpf2 interacts with RpL11, and these interactions are crucial for the proper maturation and export of preribosomes (Zhang2007Assembly). The interactions within the Rpf2 subcomplex are supported by yeast two-hybrid assays, which demonstrate pairwise interactions among Rpf2, Rrs1, RpL5, and RpL11 (Zhang2007Assembly).
