# CFAP418

## Overview
CFAP418 is a gene that encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 418, a lipid-binding protein integral to maintaining lipid homeostasis across various cellular membranes. This protein is crucial for the integrity of cellular membranes and the proper morphology and function of mitochondria. CFAP418 binds directly to phosphatidic acid and cardiolipin, which are essential for membrane biogenesis and lipid storage, thereby influencing mitochondrial morphology and function. The protein is associated with intracellular membranes, including those of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria, suggesting its involvement in membrane dynamics and broader cellular processes such as ciliogenesis and vesicular trafficking. Disruption of the CFAP418 gene can lead to significant cellular dysfunction, including abnormal mitochondrial morphology and protein mislocalization, particularly in the retina, contributing to conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod dystrophy, and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (Clark2022Disruption; Belkadi2023Retinal).

## Function
CFAP418 is a lipid-binding protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining lipid homeostasis across various cellular membranes, which is essential for the integrity of cellular membranes and mitochondrial morphology and function (Clark2022Disruption). It binds directly to phosphatidic acid (PA) and cardiolipin (CL), which are important for membrane biogenesis and lipid storage, affecting mitochondrial morphology and function (Clark2022Disruption). CFAP418 is involved in membrane-associated cellular processes, particularly in the retina, where its disruption can lead to changes in membrane lipid composition and mislocalization of proteins in photoreceptors (Clark2022Disruption).

The protein is associated with various intracellular membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondrial outer membranes, suggesting its role in membrane dynamics (Clark2022Disruption). CFAP418's function extends beyond ciliary compartments, indicating its broader role in cellular processes, including ciliogenesis and vesicular trafficking pathways (Clark2022Disruption). The gene's disruption can lead to abnormal mitochondrial morphology and function, as well as disruptions in protein expressions and localizations, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular function (Clark2022Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP418 gene are associated with a range of genetic disorders, particularly syndromic ciliopathies and retinal degenerations. These include conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP), cone-rod dystrophy (CRD), and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) (Clark2022Disruption). BBS is a ciliopathy that affects multiple tissues and is characterized by symptoms such as obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, polydactyly, cognitive impairment, renal anomalies, hypogonadism, and retinal dystrophies (Belkadi2023Retinal).

The CFAP418 gene plays a critical role in maintaining membrane lipid homeostasis, and its disruption leads to abnormal membrane-associated cellular processes. In particular, CFAP418 binds to phosphatidic acid (PA) and cardiolipin (CL) on cell membranes, and its disruption affects mitochondrial morphology and function, as well as photoreceptor outer segment development (Clark2022Disruption). In Cfap418 knockout models, there is a reduction in CL synthase PGS1 and mislocalization of proteins involved in ciliary transport, contributing to retinal degeneration (Clark2022Disruption).

Mutations in CFAP418 can also lead to mislocalization of proteins such as ESCRT-0 complex components and RAB28, affecting membrane-protein associations and ciliary trafficking, which are crucial for photoreceptor function (Clark2022Disruption). These disruptions highlight the gene's significant role in inherited retinal degenerations and syndromic ciliopathies.

## Interactions
CFAP418 primarily interacts with lipids rather than proteins or nucleic acids. It binds directly to phosphatidic acid (PA) and cardiolipin (CL) on cell membranes, which is crucial for maintaining membrane lipid homeostasis and various cellular processes (Clark2022Disruption). Despite its weak direct interaction with proteins, CFAP418 shows a weak interaction with RAB28 in the retina. This interaction is influenced by the GTP/GDP-binding status of RAB28, with GDP-bound RAB28 pulling down more CFAP418 than other forms of RAB28 (Clark2022Disruption). 

CFAP418's disruption affects membrane-protein associations, particularly reducing RAB28 membrane association by approximately 50% in Cfap418 -/- retinas (Clark2022Disruption). Although CFAP418 does not form strong and stable complexes with proteins, it partially colocalizes with proteins such as VPS4B, HGS, and STAM in transfected cells, suggesting indirect associations (Clark2022Disruption). The study highlights that CFAP418's primary interactions are with lipids, and its disruption leads to changes in membrane lipid composition and affects mitochondrial morphology and function (Clark2022Disruption).
