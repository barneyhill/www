# OR51B4

## Overview
The OR51B4 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 51 subfamily B member 4, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. The primary role of the protein encoded by OR51B4 is to detect odorant molecules, thereby contributing to the sense of smell. This olfactory receptor is involved in the initial molecular interactions that lead to the perception of odors, functioning through the binding of specific ligands and subsequent activation of intracellular signaling pathways. The OR51B4 gene is one of many olfactory receptor genes that contribute to the diversity and specificity of olfactory perception in humans.
