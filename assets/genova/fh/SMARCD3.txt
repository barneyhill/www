# SMARCD3

## Overview
SMARCD3 is a gene that encodes the protein SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily d, member 3, also known as BAF60C. This protein is a critical component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. As a chromatin remodeler, SMARCD3 plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including transcription activation, DNA replication, and repair, as well as cell differentiation and apoptosis (Tropée2019The). The protein is particularly significant in cardiac muscle cells, where it is essential for maintaining contractile function (Tropée2019The). Additionally, SMARCD3 is involved in developmental processes, such as the Reelin-DAB1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cerebellar development (Zou2023A). Beyond its developmental roles, SMARCD3 is implicated in cancer biology, influencing tumor progression and metastasis through its interactions with various signaling pathways (Zou2023A; Ferguson2023Smarcd3).

## Function
SMARCD3, also known as BAF60C, is a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure. In healthy human cells, SMARCD3 is involved in chromatin remodeling by displacing histones along or from DNA molecules, facilitating transcription activation, DNA replication, DNA repair, apoptosis, metabolism, and cell differentiation (Tropée2019The). It is particularly important in cardiomyocytes, where it is essential for the contractile function of cardiac cells (Tropée2019The).

SMARCD3 is also involved in the regulation of the Reelin-DAB1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for the migration and positioning of Purkinje cells during cerebellar development. This pathway is active during early cerebellar development and is associated with the 'go' and 'stop' signals that orchestrate cell migration (Zou2023A). SMARCD3 expression increases during gestational weeks 13 to 28, then decreases postnatally, remaining low in infants, children, and adults, reflecting its role in early developmental processes (Zou2023A).

In addition to its role in the cerebellum, SMARCD3 is implicated in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer through WNT5A signaling, indicating its broader role in cellular processes beyond the cerebellum (Zou2023A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SMARCD3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance. In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) subtypes, low expression of SMARCD3 is associated with reduced survival rates and poor response to standard treatments, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Tropée2019The). The downregulation of SMARCD3 in breast cancer is often due to promoter methylation and allelic copy number loss, which may contribute to tumor progression (Tropée2019The).

In gastric cancer, SMARCD3 overexpression is linked to increased tumor aggressiveness and progression, particularly in signet ring cell gastric cancer (SRC-GC). This overexpression is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that enhances cancer cell migration and invasion, leading to poorer patient outcomes (Park2024SMARCD3).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), SMARCD3 is enriched in cancer stem cells and is necessary for their growth, indicating its role in supporting tumor progression. Its expression increases from PanIN to PDAC, suggesting an oncogenic role (Ferguson2023Smarcd3).

In medulloblastoma, particularly the Group 3 subtype, high SMARCD3 expression is associated with metastasis and poorer prognosis. It promotes cancer progression through the upregulation of Reelin-DAB1 signaling, enhancing cell migration (Zou2023A).

## Interactions
SMARCD3, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, participates in various protein interactions that influence its function in gene regulation. It is specifically incorporated into the BAF complex and, to some extent, the PBAF complex, where it interacts with other subunits such as SMARCA4 and ARID1A. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activity in cancer cells, particularly in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (Ferguson2023Smarcd3).

SMARCD3 also interacts with transcription factors like FOXA1, coordinating transcriptional programs that include extracellular matrix organization and immune signaling. This interaction is significant in modulating the tumor microenvironment and potentially influencing immunotherapy responses (Ferguson2023Smarcd3). In the context of medulloblastoma (MB), SMARCD3 is involved in the Reelin-DAB1-Src signaling pathway, where it epigenetically regulates DAB1 transcriptional activity by controlling chromatin accessibility and histone modifications (Zou2023A).

Additionally, SMARCD3 acts as a coactivator for nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), interacting with them to facilitate the transcriptional activation of retinoid-inducible genes. This interaction is dependent on the expression of SRC1, a member of the p160 family of coactivators (Flajollet2007The).
