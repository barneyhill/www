# SSU72L4

## Overview
SSU72L4 is a gene that encodes the protein SSU72 like 4, which is a member of the phosphatase family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription and RNA processing. The SSU72 like 4 protein shares structural similarities with other phosphatases, which are enzymes that remove phosphate groups from molecules, a critical function in cellular signaling and metabolism. Although the specific biological roles of SSU72 like 4 are not fully elucidated, it is believed to participate in the modulation of transcriptional machinery and may have implications in certain signaling pathways. Further research is needed to fully understand its interactions and potential clinical significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
