# C8orf90

## Overview
C8orf90 is a gene located on chromosome 8 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 8 open reading frame 90. This protein is categorized as a non-kinase, non-receptor protein, and its specific biological functions remain largely uncharacterized. However, it is implicated in various cellular processes due to its interactions with other proteins and potential involvement in signaling pathways. The gene's expression and the protein's role in cellular mechanisms are subjects of ongoing research, with studies suggesting its participation in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which may have implications in cellular growth and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further investigation is required to fully elucidate the functional significance of C8orf90 and its encoded protein in human health and disease.
