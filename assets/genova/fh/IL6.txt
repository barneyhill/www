# IL6

## Overview
Interleukin 6 (IL6) is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein interleukin 6 (IL-6), which plays a pivotal role in the immune system and inflammatory response. As a multifunctional cytokine, IL-6 is involved in various physiological processes, including the acute phase response, immune regulation, and hematopoiesis. The IL6 gene is expressed in numerous cell types, such as T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, and hepatocytes, and the protein it encodes acts through a receptor complex involving IL-6R and gp130. IL-6 is categorized as a cytokine due to its involvement in cell signaling and immune modulation. The protein's structure is characterized by a four-helix bundle, and it can form a hexameric complex with its receptors, which is essential for its signaling functions (Gelinas2014Crystal; Somers19971.9). Dysregulation of IL6 expression is associated with various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Fishman1998The; Hirano2020IL6).

## Structure
Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a cytokine with a primary structure consisting of a polypeptide chain of 185 amino acids, although the full-length protein includes an N-terminal signal peptide, bringing the total to 212 amino acids (Gelinas2014Crystal). The secondary structure of IL-6 is characterized by a four-helix bundle with an up-up, down-down topology, a common feature among cytokines (Somers19971.9). The helices are designated A through D, with a short fifth helix present in the long loop between helices C and D (Gelinas2014Crystal).

The tertiary structure of IL-6 is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and a few hydrogen bonds, with a network of ordered water molecules contributing to its stability (Somers19971.9). The structure includes a disulfide bond between cysteines 44 and 50, which helps maintain the protein's conformation (Somers19971.9). 

IL-6 can form a hexameric complex with its receptors, IL-6Rα and gp130, which is crucial for its signaling function (Gelinas2014Crystal). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation at Asn45, although this does not influence its biological activity (Fontaine1991Internal).

## Function
Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a crucial role in immune response and inflammation in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of several physiological processes, including the acute phase response, inflammation, immune response, and hematopoiesis. IL-6 is produced by various cells such as T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and hepatocytes, and it acts through a receptor complex involving IL-6R and gp130 (AtaieKachoie2014Gene).

IL-6 signaling occurs via two main pathways: classic signaling and trans-signaling. In classic signaling, IL-6 binds to its membrane-bound receptor IL-6R, forming a complex with gp130, which is associated with anti-inflammatory effects. Trans-signaling involves IL-6 binding to a soluble form of IL-6R, which then interacts with gp130 on other cells, leading to pro-inflammatory effects (Wolf2014Interleukin6; Rose-John2017Interleukin-6).

IL-6 is also involved in the differentiation of B cells, T cell proliferation, and the production of acute phase proteins like C-reactive protein. It facilitates neutrophil trafficking to inflammation sites and regulates T lymphocyte activation and differentiation, promoting B lymphocyte maturation and immunoglobulin synthesis (AtaieKachoie2014Gene).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL6 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. Genetic polymorphisms, such as the G/C polymorphism at position -174 in the IL6 gene's 5' flanking region, affect IL-6 transcription and plasma levels. The -174C allele is linked to lower expression levels and is less frequent in patients with systemic-onset juvenile chronic arthritis (S-JCA), suggesting a protective effect against the disease (Fishman1998The).

Alterations in IL-6 expression levels are implicated in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, as well as cancer. Elevated IL-6 levels are observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple myeloma, and Castleman's disease, correlating with disease severity and poor prognosis (Hirano2020IL6). The IL-6-STAT3 signaling pathway is crucial in these conditions, with IL-6 acting as a major stimulator of STAT3, contributing to chronic inflammation and oncogenesis (Hirano2020IL6).

IL-6 trans-signaling, mediated by the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), expands the range of cells affected by IL-6, contributing to chronic inflammation and diseases like RA and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Hirano2020IL6). This pathway is also implicated in severe COVID-19, where increased sIL-6R levels indicate the importance of trans-signaling in disease progression (Hirano2020IL6).

## Interactions
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that interacts with its specific receptor, IL-6R, and the signal transducer gp130 to form a signaling complex. This interaction is crucial for the activation of downstream signaling pathways. IL-6 binds to IL-6R, and this complex then associates with gp130, forming a hexameric assembly consisting of two molecules each of IL-6, IL-6R, and gp130. This assembly is essential for the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, particularly involving Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (Simpson1997Interleukin‐6:; Rose-John2017Interleukin-6).

IL-6 can also engage in trans-signaling through its interaction with the soluble form of IL-6R (sIL-6R). This complex can activate gp130 on cells that do not express membrane-bound IL-6R, allowing IL-6 to exert its effects on a broader range of cells. The trans-signaling pathway can be selectively inhibited by sgp130Fc, a fusion protein that blocks IL-6 trans-signaling without affecting classic signaling (Wolf2014Interleukin6; Rose-John2017Interleukin-6).

IL-6 also interacts with other proteins in the blood, such as alpha-macroglobulin and complement factors, forming complexes that regulate its activity and protect against overstimulation (Lotz1993Interleukin6).
