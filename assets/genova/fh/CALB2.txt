# CALB2

## Overview
The CALB2 gene encodes calbindin 2, commonly known as calretinin, a calcium-binding protein that belongs to the EF-hand protein family. Calretinin is characterized by its six EF-hand motifs, five of which are capable of binding calcium ions, allowing it to play a crucial role in modulating intracellular calcium signals. This protein is predominantly expressed in neurons, where it contributes to the regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity, as well as in other tissues such as the testis and ovary. Calretinin's ability to buffer calcium levels is essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis and proper cellular function, particularly in the nervous system. Beyond its physiological roles, calretinin is also implicated in various pathological conditions, including malignant mesothelioma, where it influences tumorigenesis and metastasis. Its interactions with other proteins and involvement in cellular pathways underscore its multifaceted role as a calcium sensor and its potential as a therapeutic target (Wörthmüller2018Calretinin; Schwaller2019Cytosolic).

## Function
The CALB2 gene encodes calretinin, a calcium-binding protein that plays a significant role in modulating intracellular calcium signals. Calretinin is part of the EF-hand protein family and contains six EF-hand motifs, five of which can bind calcium ions. This protein is crucial for buffering calcium levels within cells, particularly in neurons, where it helps regulate neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity (Schwaller2019Cytosolic). In the cerebellum, calretinin reduces action potential-associated increases in intracellular calcium concentration, which is essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis and proper neuronal function (Schwaller2019Cytosolic).

Calretinin is expressed in specific neurons and other tissues, such as the testis and ovary, where it may influence cell proliferation and differentiation (GamalEl2023Seminal). In the nervous system, calretinin is involved in the modulation of calcium signals, affecting the amplitude, decay, and spread of these signals, which are critical for various cellular processes (Schwaller2019Cytosolic). The protein's role in calcium signaling is linked to its neuroprotective effects and its involvement in maintaining motor coordination and synaptic plasticity (Schwaller2019Cytosolic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CALB2 gene, which encodes the protein calretinin, have been implicated in several diseases, particularly malignant mesothelioma (MM). Calretinin is essential for the growth and survival of mesothelioma cells, especially in epithelioid and mixed types of MM, where it is highly expressed. Downregulation of calretinin in these cells leads to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for MM (Blum2013Calretinin). The protective role of calretinin against asbestos-induced cytotoxicity has also been noted, with its expression providing resistance to asbestos toxicity through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Henzi2009SV40Induced).

In addition to its role in mesothelioma, calretinin expression is upregulated in reactive mesothelial cells and benign multicystic mesothelioma, potentially aiding in cell survival and contributing to malignant transformation (Henzi2009SV40Induced). The regulation of calretinin expression involves complex interactions, such as the binding of septin 7 to the CALB2 promoter, which may act as a negative transcriptional regulator (Blum2018Regulation). These findings highlight the significance of calretinin in cancer pathogenesis and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Calretinin, encoded by the CALB2 gene, is a calcium-binding protein that participates in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with the pore-forming α1 subunit of the Ca2+ channel CaV2.1, modulating synaptic plasticity and motor control by inhibiting Ca2+-dependent inactivation and enhancing Ca2+-dependent facilitation (Schwaller2014Calretinin:). In malignant mesothelioma (MM) cells, calretinin interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis (Wörthmüller2018Calretinin). It also co-immunoprecipitates with septin 7 and co-localizes with it during cytokinesis, indicating a role in the mitotic process (Wörthmüller2018Calretinin).

Calretinin binds to both wildtype and mutant huntingtin (Htt) proteins, with a preference for the mutant form associated with Huntington's disease, suggesting a protective role against neurodegeneration (Czeredys2013Expression). In neurons, calretinin interacts with cytoskeletal elements such as cytokeratins and α-tubulin, indicating its involvement in maintaining cellular structure and function (Wörthmüller2018Calretinin). These interactions highlight calretinin's multifaceted role as a Ca2+ sensor and its involvement in various cellular pathways.
