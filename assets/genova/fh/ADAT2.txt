# ADAT2

## Overview
The ADAT2 gene encodes the adenosine deaminase tRNA-specific 2 protein, which is a crucial component of the ADAT2/3 complex involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules. This protein functions as a deaminase, catalyzing the conversion of adenosine to inosine at the wobble position of tRNA, a modification essential for the accurate translation of the genetic code into proteins. The ADAT2 protein, characterized by its cytidine deaminase motif, forms a heterodimer with the structurally supportive but catalytically inactive ADAT3 protein. This complex plays a significant role in enhancing the flexibility and fidelity of protein synthesis by allowing tRNA to recognize multiple codons. The activity of the ADAT2/3 complex is vital for cellular protein homeostasis and is implicated in various biological processes, including neurodevelopment. Disruptions in the function of this complex can lead to severe developmental disorders, highlighting the clinical importance of ADAT2 in maintaining proper cellular function (RamosMorales2021The; DelPozoRodriguez2024Neurodevelopmental).

## Structure
The ADAT2 protein is a component of the heterodimeric ADAT2/3 complex, which plays a crucial role in the deamination of adenosine to inosine in tRNA. The primary structure of ADAT2 includes a sequence of amino acids that form a catalytic domain, essential for its enzymatic activity (RamosMorales2021The). The secondary structure of ADAT2 features a central five-stranded β-sheet flanked by several helices, contributing to its catalytic domain (Liu2020Crystal).

In terms of tertiary structure, ADAT2 contains a cytidine deaminase (CDA) motif, which includes residues that coordinate a Zn2+ cation, crucial for its catalytic function (Dolce2022Structural). The active site of ADAT2 is characterized by the coordination of zinc through histidine and cysteine residues, facilitating the deamination reaction (RamosMorales2021The).

The quaternary structure of ADAT2 involves its interaction with ADAT3 to form a functional heterodimeric complex. ADAT3 serves a structural role, with its N-terminal domain contributing to tRNA binding and positioning, although it is catalytically inactive (RamosMorales2021The; Liu2020Crystal). The ADAT2/3 complex requires a full tRNA for its deamination activity, unlike its prokaryotic counterparts (RamosMorales2021The).

## Function
The ADAT2 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex, which is essential for the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules in human cells. This complex catalyzes the deamination of adenosine to inosine at the wobble position of tRNA, a modification crucial for accurate and efficient protein translation (RamosMorales2021The). The ADAT2 protein serves as the catalytic subunit of this complex, while ADAT3, although catalytically inactive, is necessary for the recognition and binding of tRNAs (DelPozoRodriguez2024Neurodevelopmental).

The modification of tRNA wobble inosine by the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex enhances the ability of tRNA to recognize multiple codons, thereby contributing to the fidelity and flexibility of protein synthesis (RamosMorales2021The). This process is vital for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and is implicated in various cellular and developmental processes, including neurodevelopment (RamosMorales2021The). The activity of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex is particularly important in the cytoplasm, where tRNA processing occurs, ensuring the proper decoding of genetic information during protein synthesis (RamosMorales2021The). Disruptions in this complex can lead to severe neurodevelopmental disorders due to impaired neuronal migration and other developmental anomalies (DelPozoRodriguez2024Neurodevelopmental).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADAT2 gene, which is part of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex, have been implicated in various genetic disorders. This complex is crucial for the modification of tRNA molecules, specifically the deamination of adenosine to inosine, which is essential for proper protein synthesis. Although direct associations between ADAT2 mutations and specific diseases are not extensively documented, alterations in the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex can lead to significant cellular and developmental issues. For instance, mutations in the ADAT3 gene, which interacts closely with ADAT2, are linked to intellectual disability and other neurodevelopmental disorders. These mutations result in reduced enzymatic activity and impaired tRNA modification, which are critical for normal cellular function (Ramos2019Formation; Ramos2020Identification).

Research suggests that overexpression of ADAT2 can partially compensate for deficiencies caused by ADAT3 mutations, restoring some enzymatic activity and tRNA modification in affected cells. This indicates a potential therapeutic approach for conditions related to ADAT3 mutations, highlighting the importance of ADAT2 in maintaining the functional integrity of the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex (Ramos2020Identification). The role of ADAT2 in these processes underscores its clinical significance in the context of genetic disorders associated with tRNA modification.

## Interactions
The ADAT2 protein, part of the eukaryotic wobble base deaminase ADAT2/3 complex, interacts with tRNA through its C-terminal region, which includes a conserved, positively charged KR-motif. This motif is essential for tRNA binding and deamination, as it aligns into the major groove of the anticodon loop, providing interactions with the phosphate backbone of the anticodon stem (Dolce2022Sequenceindependent). The ADAT2/3 complex is a heterodimer, with ADAT2 being the active subunit and ADAT3 playing a supportive role in tRNA binding. The ADAT3 N-terminal domain interacts with the D-stem and D-loop of tRNA, which is crucial for the correct insertion of tRNA into the active site (Dolce2022Sequenceindependent; Dolce2022Structural).

The ADAT2/3 complex binds tRNA at the dimer interface between the cytidine deaminase domains of ADAT2 and ADAT3. The anticodon loop of the tRNA undergoes significant remodeling upon binding, with specific interactions such as π-π stacking between the nucleobase of U36 and residue Y205 of ADAT2 (Dolce2022Structural). The complex's ability to accommodate different tRNA sequences is facilitated by the flexibility of the C-terminal region of ADAT2 and the additional RNA-binding domains of ADAT3 (Dolce2022Structural).
