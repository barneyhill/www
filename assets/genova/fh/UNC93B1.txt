# UNC93B1

## Overview
UNC93B1 is a gene that encodes the unc-93 homolog B1, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by regulating Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. This protein is integral to the trafficking of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs, such as TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, from the endoplasmic reticulum to endolysosomes, where they detect viral and bacterial components, thereby initiating immune responses (Lee2013UNC93B1; Pelka2014Cutting). The UNC93B1 protein is characterized by 12 transmembrane helices and contains motifs essential for its function, including a YxxΦ motif that facilitates interactions with clathrin adaptor proteins, crucial for TLR9 endocytosis (Lee2013UNC93B1). Mutations in UNC93B1 can disrupt TLR signaling, leading to increased susceptibility to infections and associations with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (Brinkmann2007The; Wolf2024UNC93B1). The gene's expression is also linked to conditions like acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its broader significance in immune regulation and disease (Li2023Highexpression).

## Structure
The UNC93B1 protein is a transmembrane protein composed of 597 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 66.6 kDa (Kashuba2002hUNC93B1:). It features 12 transmembrane helices, with both the N- and C-termini facing the cytosol (Song2022Nglycosylation; Lee2013UNC93B1). The protein is characterized by multiple membrane-spanning domains and shows structural similarities to bacterial ABC-2 type transporters and ion transporters (Kashuba2002hUNC93B1:).

UNC93B1 contains specific motifs and sites crucial for its function. The YxxΦ motif in its C-terminal cytosolic tail is essential for binding with clathrin adaptor proteins, which is critical for the endocytosis of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) (Lee2013UNC93B1). The protein also has three putative N-glycosylation sites, with Asn251 and Asn272 being glycosylated, which is important for TLR9 signaling (Song2022Nglycosylation).

Alternative splicing events have been noted, which may affect the structure and function of the protein, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context (Kashuba2002hUNC93B1:). The protein's conservation across species suggests its biological importance (Kashuba2002hUNC93B1:).

## Function
The UNC93B1 gene encodes a multipass transmembrane protein that is crucial for the trafficking and signaling of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in human cells. UNC93B1 is primarily involved in the transport of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs, such as TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to endolysosomes, where they play a key role in recognizing viral and bacterial components (Lee2013UNC93B1; Pelka2014Cutting). This transport is essential for the activation of TLRs and the subsequent initiation of immune responses (Maschalidi2017UNC93B1).

The protein contains a conserved tyrosine-based sorting motif (YxxF) that regulates TLR signaling in a receptor- and ligand-specific manner. This motif is crucial for the interaction with adapter protein complexes, which mediate the trafficking of UNC93B1 and associated TLRs to endosomal compartments (Pelka2014Cutting). UNC93B1 also interacts with the calcium sensor STIM1, facilitating calcium flux necessary for efficient antigen cross-presentation in dendritic cells, which is vital for stimulating naive CD8+ T cells (Maschalidi2017UNC93B1).

Mutations in UNC93B1, such as the H412R mutation, can impair TLR signaling by preventing the protein's exit from the ER, leading to increased susceptibility to infections (Brinkmann2007The; Pelka2014Cutting). This highlights the importance of UNC93B1 in maintaining proper immune function through its role in TLR trafficking and signaling.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UNC93B1 gene are associated with several autoimmune and immune-related conditions. Variants such as E92G and R336L have been linked to early-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a condition characterized by overactive TLR7 signaling, which contributes to the autoimmune pathology of SLE (Wolf2024UNC93B1). The E92G variant, in particular, causes instability in the UNC93B1 protein, leading to selective hyperactivation of TLR7 and constitutive type I interferon signaling (Wolf2024UNC93B1). Another mutation, p.R95L, results in hyperactivation of TLR7 and TLR8, further implicating UNC93B1 in SLE (Han2024A).

In addition to autoimmune diseases, high expression of UNC93B1 is associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it correlates with increased immune cell infiltration and poor prognosis (Li2023Highexpression). The gene's expression is linked to immune response pathways and cytokine metabolic processes, suggesting a role in leukemogenesis (Li2023Highexpression).

In dogs, a missense variant in UNC93B1 is associated with exfoliative cutaneous lupus erythematosus (ECLE), indicating a potential role in this condition characterized by skin lesions and hair loss (Leeb2020A). These findings underscore the significance of UNC93B1 in immune regulation and its involvement in various diseases.

## Interactions
UNC93B1 is a crucial protein involved in the regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, interacting with various TLRs and adaptor proteins to facilitate immune responses. It contains a YxxF motif that interacts with adaptor protein (AP) complexes, particularly AP2, and to a lesser extent, AP1 and AP3. This interaction is essential for the proper localization of UNC93B1 within cellular compartments, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and endosomes, and is critical for TLR trafficking (Pelka2014Cutting).

UNC93B1 also interacts with TLR7 and TLR9, mediating their differential trafficking. TLR7 interacts with AP-4μ, while TLR9 relies on AP-2 for endocytosis from the plasma membrane into endosomes. These interactions suggest that UNC93B1 plays a role in directing TLRs to specific endosomal compartments, which may have unique functional properties (Lee2013UNC93B1).

Additionally, UNC93B1 is involved in the plasma membrane localization and signaling of TLR5. It is essential for TLR5 to exit the endoplasmic reticulum and reach the plasma membrane, as demonstrated by colocalization studies (Huh2014UNC93B1). The protein's interactions with TLRs are crucial for their stability and function, impacting immune signaling pathways.
