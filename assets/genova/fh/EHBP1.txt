# EHBP1

## Overview
EHBP1 (EH domain binding protein 1) is a gene that encodes a multidomain protein involved in critical cellular processes such as vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal organization. The protein, EH domain binding protein 1, functions as an adaptor protein, facilitating interactions between endosomes and the actin cytoskeleton, which are essential for processes like endocytic recycling and dendritic arbor formation. It contains several functional domains, including a C2 domain for membrane association, a calponin homology (CH) domain for actin binding, and a bivalent Mical/EHBP Rab binding (bMERB) domain for interactions with Rab GTPases. These domains enable EHBP1 to play a pivotal role in linking endosomal membranes to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby influencing cellular dynamics and structural integrity (Ji2023EHBP1; Rai2020The). The gene's involvement in various diseases, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and cardiovascular conditions, underscores its clinical significance (Liu2022EHBP1; Ma2023Cholesterolassociated).

## Structure
EHBP1 (EH domain binding protein 1) is a multidomain protein involved in various cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking and dendritic arbor formation. The protein contains several key domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal C2 domain is involved in membrane association and lipid binding, specifically interacting with phosphatidylserine in the presence of Ca²⁺ ions and PI(3)P and PI(5)P in a Ca²⁺-independent manner (Rai2020The). The central calponin homology (CH) domain mediates binding to actin filaments and can form intramolecular complexes with the C-terminal bivalent Mical/EHBP Rab binding (bMERB) domain, which autoinhibits efficient F-actin binding (Ji2023EHBP1; Rai2020The).

The bMERB domain is crucial for binding to Rab GTPases, such as Rab8, and contains a C-terminal Rab-binding site characterized by a hydrophobic patch formed by helices 2 and 3 (Rai2020The). The interaction between the CH and bMERB domains involves both hydrophobic and polar interactions, with specific residues playing significant roles in maintaining binding affinity (Rai2020The). EHBP1 also features a CaaX box at the C-terminus, which is important for endosomal localization (Rai2020The).

EHBP1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions. Multiple splice variants of EHBP1 exist, potentially leading to different isoforms with distinct functional roles (Ji2023EHBP1).

## Function
EHBP1 (EH domain binding protein 1) is a crucial adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal organization. In healthy human cells, EHBP1 plays a significant role in linking endosomes to the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for processes such as GLUT4 transport and endocytic vesicle coupling (Rai2020The). It interacts with Rab GTPases, notably Rab8 and Rab10, facilitating the recruitment of these proteins to endosomal membranes and promoting actin filament formation (Wang2016RAB10; Rai2020The).

EHBP1 is involved in the recycling of endosomal membranes, maintaining the structure of endosomal networks, and regulating the recycling of transmembrane proteins internalized by clathrin-independent endocytosis (Wang2016RAB10). The protein's interaction with actin filaments is mediated by its central calponin homology (CH) domain, which is crucial for its function in linking endosomal membranes to the actin cytoskeleton (Wang2016RAB10).

In neurons, EHBP1 is critically involved in dendritic arbor formation, a process essential for neuronal development and function. It interacts with syndapin I, a membrane-shaping protein, to promote dendritic branching and actin filament formation, which are vital for the structural integrity of dendrites (Ji2023EHBP1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EHBP1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), EHBP1 plays a protective role against liver fibrosis. A loss-of-function variant, specifically the rs10496099 T>C SNP, is associated with decreased EHBP1 expression and increased severity of NASH. This variant leads to increased liver fibrosis and cholesterol dysregulation, highlighting the gene's role in cholesterol metabolism and inflammation in NASH (Ma2023Cholesterolassociated).

EHBP1 is also implicated in cardiovascular diseases. Specific haplotypes of EHBP1, such as rs2710642G-rs10496099C, are associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (IS), while others like rs2710642A-rs10496099C are linked to a reduced risk. These genetic variations interact with environmental factors, influencing the risk of IS and potentially coronary artery disease (CAD) (Liu2022EHBP1).

In a case report, a microduplication in the chromosomal region containing EHBP1 was associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in an infant, suggesting a role in the rapid development of PAH through its influence on pulmonary vascular endothelial cells (Wang2023Case).

## Interactions
EHBP1 (EH domain binding protein 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal organization. EHBP1 interacts with members of the Rab8 family, including Rab8a and Rab10, through its C-terminal bMERB domain. This interaction is essential for the release of auto-inhibition of the central calponin homology (CH) domain, allowing it to bind to actin filaments (Rai2020The). The bMERB domain has a high-affinity Rab-binding site, with a dissociation constant (K D) of approximately 0.3 µM for Rab8a (Rai2020The).

The interaction between the CH and bMERB domains is enthalpy-driven, with a dissociation constant (K D) of 1.2 µM, and is regulated by Rab8 binding, which displaces the CH domain from the bMERB domain, facilitating actin interaction (Rai2020The). The CH domain of EHBP1 interacts with actin filaments with a K D value of 9.34 ± 1.86 µM, which is relatively high for a single CH2 domain (Rai2020The).

EHBP1 also forms a trimer complex with Rab10 and EHD2, which is important for lipid droplet engulfment during lipophagy (Liu2022EHBP1). These interactions highlight EHBP1's role in linking endosomes to the actin cytoskeleton and its involvement in endocytic recycling and exocytosis (Rai2020The).
