# ESRP1

## Overview
ESRP1 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as a key regulator of alternative splicing in epithelial cells. The protein is categorized as an RNA-binding protein and is instrumental in maintaining epithelial cell identity by modulating the splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts. ESRP1, along with its paralog ESRP2, is particularly noted for its role in the splicing of the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene, influencing the inclusion of epithelial-specific exons. This regulation is vital for processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is crucial in both developmental biology and disease pathogenesis (Warzecha2009ESRP1). The protein's ability to bind specific RNA motifs allows it to direct the inclusion or exclusion of exons, thereby affecting the expression of various isoforms that are essential for epithelial cell differentiation and function (Warzecha2010An; Bebee2015The).

## Structure


## Function
ESRP1 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1) is a critical regulator of alternative splicing in epithelial cells. It plays a significant role in maintaining epithelial cell identity by directing an epithelial-specific splicing program. ESRP1, along with its paralog ESRP2, regulates the splicing of the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene, promoting the inclusion of exon IIIb, which is specific to epithelial cells, while repressing exon IIIc, which is mesenchymal-specific (Warzecha2009ESRP1). This regulation is crucial for processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is important in development and disease (Warzecha2009ESRP1).

ESRP1 binds to specific RNA motifs, particularly UGG-rich sequences, to influence exon inclusion or skipping. It enhances exon inclusion in certain transcripts by binding to conserved UGG motifs downstream of the exons, while it can also promote exon skipping by binding to motifs in upstream introns or within the exon itself (Warzecha2010An). This splicing regulation impacts the expression of various isoforms critical for epithelial cell differentiation and function, affecting cell adhesion, migration, and tissue development (Bebee2015The). ESRP1 is active in the nucleus, where it modulates these splicing events (Warzecha2009ESRP1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ESRP1 gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In cancer, ESRP1 plays a dual role, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context. In breast cancer, high ESRP1 expression is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cases, where it contributes to endocrine therapy resistance and shorter overall survival (Ashok2021E2F1; Gökmen‐Polar2019Splicing). Conversely, in colorectal and pancreatic cancers, ESRP1 acts as a favorable prognostic factor by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor progression (Jia2020Expression).

In prostate cancer, ESRP1 amplification is linked to early onset aggressive forms of the disease, correlating with advanced cancer histology and poor prognosis (Advani2023Epithelial). ESRP1 is also implicated in developmental disorders; microdeletions in the ESRP1 gene are associated with Nablus mask-like facial syndrome, characterized by craniofacial abnormalities and aortic arch malformations (Jia2020Expression). Additionally, ESRP1 mutations can lead to sensorineural hearing loss due to disrupted cochlear development (Jia2020Expression). In orofacial cleft pathogenesis, ESRP1 is identified as a key candidate gene, with disruptions leading to cleft lip and palate (Caetano2024Functional).

## Interactions
ESRP1 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1) is known to participate in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in alternative splicing regulation. ESRP1 interacts with specific RNA sequences, particularly GU-rich motifs, which are crucial for its function in splicing regulation. This interaction was demonstrated through UV crosslinking experiments, showing ESRP1's binding to the ISE/ISS-3 RNA element (Warzecha2009ESRP1).

ESRP1 also forms complexes with other proteins involved in splicing. It has been shown to interact with CCAR2, a core component of the DBIRD complex, which integrates transcript elongation with the regulation of alternative splicing. This interaction occurs through direct binding or common RNA target binding, contributing to ESRP1's oncogenic function in colorectal cancer cells (Ala2020Proteomics-Based). Despite this interaction, no significant correlation was found between ESRP1 expression and CCAR2 levels, indicating that CCAR2's expression is not regulated by ESRP1 (Ala2020Proteomics-Based).

ESRP1 is also involved in the splicing of the RAC1b isoform in colorectal cancer cells. It binds to a GU-rich sequence upstream of exon 3b of the RAC1 gene, promoting the inclusion of this exon and generating the RAC1b isoform, which is associated with pro-tumorigenic activities (Manco2021The).
