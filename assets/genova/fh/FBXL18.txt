# FBXL18

## Overview
FBXL18 is a gene that encodes the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 18, a member of the F-box protein family. This protein is a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by targeting specific proteins for degradation. FBXL18 is particularly involved in regulating apoptosis and cellular homeostasis by mediating the degradation of the pro-apoptotic protein Fbxl7, thus preventing excessive apoptosis and maintaining cellular balance (Liu2015Fbox). Additionally, FBXL18 interacts with the AKT protein, promoting its ubiquitination and activation, which is crucial for cell proliferation and migration, particularly in cancer cells (Zhang2016The; Zhuang2024FBXL18). The dysregulation of FBXL18 has been implicated in the progression of various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhang2016The; Zhuang2024FBXL18).

## Function
FBXL18 is an F-box protein that plays a critical role in regulating apoptosis and maintaining cellular homeostasis in healthy human cells. It functions as part of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in tagging proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. FBXL18 specifically targets the pro-apoptotic protein Fbxl7 for polyubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This regulation is crucial for controlling the cellular abundance of Fbxl7, which is known to induce mitotic arrest and apoptosis if not properly regulated (Liu2015Fbox).

The interaction between FBXL18 and Fbxl7 involves specific molecular sites, such as the FQ motif within Fbxl7, which serves as a docking site for FBXL18. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of Fbxl7 for degradation, thereby preventing excessive apoptosis and maintaining a balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis, which is vital for tissue repair and regeneration (Liu2015Fbox). In healthy cells, FBXL18 acts as a regulator of apoptosis by modulating the activity of Fbxl7, ensuring cellular homeostasis and preventing sustained tissue injury (Liu2015Fbox).

## Clinical Significance
FBXL18 has been implicated in the progression of several cancers due to its role in promoting cell proliferation and migration through the activation of AKT signaling. In ovarian cancer, high expression levels of FBXL18 are associated with a worse prognosis. Studies have shown that FBXL18 is significantly overexpressed in ovarian cancer tissues compared to normal ovarian tissues. Knockdown of FBXL18 in ovarian cancer cell lines results in decreased cell proliferation and migration, while overexpression enhances these processes. This suggests that FBXL18 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in ovarian cancer (Zhuang2024FBXL18).

In gliomas, particularly glioblastoma multiforme, FBXL18 is also significantly upregulated. Its knockdown in glioma cells leads to suppressed proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating its role in tumor growth. FBXL18 promotes K63-linked ubiquitination of Akt, a key player in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival and proliferation. This interaction suggests that FBXL18 contributes to glioma progression and could be a potential therapeutic target, especially in cases where Akt signaling is dysregulated (Zhang2016The).

## Interactions
FBXL18 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In ovarian cancer cells, FBXL18 interacts with the AKT protein, promoting K63-linked ubiquitination of AKT, which is crucial for activating the AKT signaling pathway. This interaction is essential for ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration (Zhuang2024FBXL18). Co-immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the strong interaction between FBXL18 and AKT, highlighting the importance of this interaction in cancer progression (Zhuang2024FBXL18).

In glioma cells, FBXL18 also interacts with AKT, facilitating its K63-linked poly-ubiquitination, which is necessary for AKT's activation and function in cell survival and proliferation (Zhang2016The). This interaction underscores FBXL18's role in promoting glioma progression through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.

FBXL18 is involved in the polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of the pro-apoptotic protein FBXL7. This interaction is mediated by the FQ motif within FBXL7, which serves as a docking site for FBXL18. The degradation of FBXL7 by FBXL18 regulates apoptosis, as FBXL18 limits the pro-apoptotic effects of FBXL7 by promoting its degradation (Liu2015Fbox).
