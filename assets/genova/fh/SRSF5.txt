# SRSF5

## Overview
SRSF5, or serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 5, is a gene that encodes a member of the SR protein family, which is integral to the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. The SRSF5 protein, also known as SRp40, is characterized by its serine-arginine-rich domains, which facilitate its role in both constitutive and alternative splicing processes. This protein is involved in the assembly of the spliceosome and influences splicing decisions that are critical for various cellular functions, including differentiation and proliferation (Breig2013ProteasomeMediated). SRSF5 is ubiquitously expressed in mammals and is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, which modulate its stability and activity (Chen2018Mutually; Breig2013ProteasomeMediated). The gene's expression and function have been implicated in several pathological conditions, particularly in cancer, where it affects tumor growth and drug resistance through its influence on alternative splicing pathways (Tsoi2023SRSF5; Chen2018Mutually).

## Structure
The SRSF5 protein, also known as SRp40, is a member of the serine-arginine-rich (SR) protein family and plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing. Structurally, SRSF5 consists of two RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) at the N-terminus, a glycine-rich region, and a C-terminal RS domain rich in alternating serine and arginine residues (Breig2013ProteasomeMediated; Li2021SRSF5). The RS domain is essential for splice site selection and interaction with other splicing components, although its role in RNA binding is debated (Li2021SRSF5).

The RS domain undergoes reversible phosphorylation, which is important for the protein's activity and availability. This phosphorylation is mediated by several protein kinase families, including SRPKs, CLKs, and the AKT family (Breig2013ProteasomeMediated). Post-translational modifications such as acetylation and ubiquitination also regulate SRSF5 stability and function. Acetylation at the K125 site, promoted by the acetyltransferase Tip60, stabilizes the protein, while the E3 ligase Smurf1 targets it for degradation through K48-type poly-ubiquitylation (Chen2018Mutually).

SRSF5 is encoded by a unique gene located on chromosome 14 in humans and is ubiquitously expressed in mammals. It exists in different splicing isoforms, although only a 40 kDa protein has been detected (Breig2013ProteasomeMediated).

## Function
SRSF5, also known as serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 5, is a member of the SR protein family that plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing, a fundamental process in gene expression regulation. It is involved in both constitutive and alternative splicing, influencing mRNA diversity and gene expression in healthy human cells (Breig2013ProteasomeMediated). SRSF5 is active in the nucleus, where it participates in spliceosome assembly and modulates splicing decisions, impacting cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation (Breig2013ProteasomeMediated).

SRSF5 specifically enhances exon inclusion in certain contexts, such as in fibronectin mRNA in chondrocytes, and is a major regulator of HIV-1 mRNA splicing, activating a purine-rich exonic splicing enhancer within HIV exon 5 (Breig2013ProteasomeMediated). During erythroid differentiation, SRSF5 mRNA levels increase while the protein level decreases due to proteasome-mediated proteolysis, indicating its role in this process (Breig2013ProteasomeMediated).

The protein also regulates the alternative splicing of DMTF1 pre-mRNA by modulating SF1 binding, which is essential for generating different DMTF1 isoforms, crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions (Li2021SRSF5). SRSF5's ability to bind pre-mRNA is essential for its splicing activity, with its RNA-recognition motifs mediating sequence-specific binding (Breig2013ProteasomeMediated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SRSF5 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In lung cancer, SRSF5 is upregulated, particularly under high glucose conditions, promoting tumor growth through the alternative splicing of the CCAR1 gene. This splicing results in the production of the tumor-promoting CCAR1S isoform, while depletion of SRSF5 leads to a switch to the tumor-suppressing CCAR1L isoform, reducing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis (Chen2018Mutually).

In pancreatic cancer, the CLK1-SRSF5 pathway influences alternative splicing events that affect the expression of METTL14 and Cyclin L2, impacting m6A methylation and cell proliferation. Overexpression of SRSF5 enhances oncogenic behaviors, such as cell proliferation and metastasis, by promoting exon skipping in these genes (Chen2021CLK1SRSF5).

In estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, SRSF5 modulates tamoxifen resistance by regulating the splicing of the NCOR2 gene. Low SRSF5 expression leads to the production of a splice isoform associated with tamoxifen resistance, while high SRSF5 expression correlates with better survival outcomes (Tsoi2023SRSF5).

SRSF5 also plays a role in maintaining blood-tumor barrier integrity, with its stability affecting the expression of tight junction proteins. Alterations in SRSF5 expression can impact conditions related to blood-tumor barrier dysfunction, such as glioma (Zhang2022CPEB2).

## Interactions
SRSF5, also known as serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 5, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function in pre-mRNA splicing. SRSF5 is acetylated by Tip60 at lysine 125, a modification that is crucial for its stability and function. This acetylation prevents SRSF5 from being ubiquitylated and degraded by the ubiquitin ligase Smurf1, highlighting a regulatory mechanism where acetylation and ubiquitylation are mutually exclusive (Chen2018Mutually). 

SRSF5 also interacts with HDAC1, which deacetylates SRSF5 under low glucose conditions, promoting its ubiquitylation and degradation (Chen2018Mutually). In the context of alternative splicing, SRSF5 binds to specific RNA elements in the DMTF1 pre-mRNA, modulating the splicing of its isoforms. This interaction involves displacing SF1 from its binding site, thereby enhancing the production of certain DMTF1 isoforms (Li2021SRSF5). 

In breast cancer, SRSF5 interacts with SRPK1, a kinase that influences its phosphorylation state, affecting its role in tamoxifen resistance by modulating the expression of the BQ323636.1 gene (Tsoi2023SRSF5). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of SRSF5 in splicing regulation and cancer progression.
