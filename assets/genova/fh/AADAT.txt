# AADAT

## Overview
The AADAT gene encodes the enzyme aminoadipate aminotransferase, also known as kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II), which is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent aminotransferase. This enzyme is primarily involved in the lysine degradation pathway and the kynurenine pathway, playing a significant role in both hepatic and neurological functions. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of α-aminoadipate to α-ketoadipate in the lysine degradation pathway and the transamination of kynurenine to kynurenic acid (KYNA) in the kynurenine pathway, with KYNA acting as an endogenous antagonist of the NMDA receptor. AADAT is characterized by its broad substrate specificity and mitochondrial localization, facilitated by a mitochondrial leader cleavage signal. The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining physiological concentrations of KYNA in the brain, which is important for normal neurological function and is implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases (Han2008Substrate; Goh2002Characterization; Leandro2020The).

## Structure
The human AADAT gene encodes the α-aminoadipate aminotransferase enzyme, which is involved in lysine metabolism. The primary structure of the AADAT protein consists of 425 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 50.8 kDa (Goh2002Characterization). The secondary structure includes 37% α-helix and 15% β-sheet, with additional elements such as turns and coils (Nematollahi2016Structure). 

The tertiary structure of AADAT reveals a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent aminotransferase domain, crucial for its enzymatic activity. The PLP co-factor forms an aldimine linkage with Lys263, which is essential for the enzyme's function (Nematollahi2016Structure). The enzyme's active site is located at the homodimeric interface, indicating its quaternary structure as a homodimer (Nematollahi2016Structure). 

The protein also features a mitochondrial leader cleavage signal at amino acid position 27, suggesting its localization to mitochondria (Goh2002Characterization). The enzyme's structure is characterized by a broad substrate specificity, facilitated by a flexible N-terminal region that adapts to different substrate sizes (Han2008Substrate). This structural flexibility is key to its role in transaminating various amino acids and oxo acids (Han2008Substrate).

## Function
The human gene AADAT encodes the enzyme aminoadipate aminotransferase, also known as kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II), which plays a crucial role in the lysine degradation pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of α-aminoadipate to α-ketoadipate, an intermediate step in the breakdown of lysine, primarily occurring in the liver through the saccharopine pathway (Goh2002Characterization). AADAT is also involved in the kynurenine pathway, where it catalyzes the transamination of kynurenine to kynurenic acid (KYNA), a significant process in the central nervous system due to KYNA's role as an endogenous antagonist of the NMDA receptor (Han2008Substrate).

The enzyme exhibits broad substrate specificity, capable of catalyzing the transamination of various amino acids and oxo acids, which suggests its involvement in multiple metabolic pathways (Han2008Substrate). AADAT is primarily localized in the mitochondria, as indicated by its mitochondrial cleavage signal, and its activity has been detected in the mitochondrial fraction of liver and kidney extracts (Leandro2020The). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining physiological concentrations of KYNA in the brain, which is important for normal neurological function and is implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases (Han2008Substrate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the AADAT gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In bacterial meningitis, the rs1480544 polymorphism in the AADAT gene is significantly more frequent among patients. This polymorphism is associated with decreased inflammatory markers and increased immunoglobulin G levels, suggesting an impaired immune response against infections. Elevated levels of kynurenic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid of these patients indicate that this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may lead to increased AADAT mRNA and enhanced KATII enzyme synthesis, affecting immune response and kynurenic acid production (Boros2018Genetic).

In the context of depression, the c.975-7T > C SNP in the AADAT gene has been studied for its potential role in the development of the disorder. The T/T genotype of this SNP is associated with a higher frequency in depressed patients and is linked to poorer outcomes in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment. This suggests that genetic variations in AADAT may influence depression risk and treatment efficacy (Wigner2018Variation).

In EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), AADAT expression is upregulated in response to lysine deprivation, which is linked to increased AKT phosphorylation, a survival mechanism in these cancer cells. Targeting AADAT and the EGFR-AKT signaling pathway may offer a therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Hsu2021Lysine).
