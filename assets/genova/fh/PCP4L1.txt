# PCP4L1

## Overview
PCP4L1 is a gene that encodes the protein Purkinje cell protein 4-like 1, which is a member of the calpacitin family. This family is known for its role in modulating calcium signaling pathways, particularly through interactions with calmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein. Unlike other proteins in the family, such as neurogranin and GAP-43, PCP4L1 does not bind calmodulin in its full-length form due to an auto-inhibitory element in its N-terminal region. This unique regulatory mechanism suggests that PCP4L1 may function as a latent calmodulin inhibitor, with its activity potentially modulated by structural changes or external factors. The protein is highly expressed in the central nervous system, indicating its significant role in neurobiological processes, particularly during development and in specific brain regions (morgan2012pcp4l1).

## Structure
The PCP4L1 protein is characterized by its primary structure, which includes an IQ motif known for its potential to bind calmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein. However, the full-length PCP4L1 does not interact with calmodulin due to an inhibitory element in its N-terminal region, specifically a lysine/glutamic acid-rich (KE) motif. This motif prevents the IQ motif from binding to calmodulin, highlighting a unique regulatory mechanism within the protein (morgan2012pcp4l1).

The secondary and tertiary structures of PCP4L1 are not detailed in the available context, but the presence of the IQ motif suggests potential alpha-helical regions typical of such motifs. The quaternary structure is not described, indicating that PCP4L1 may function as a monomer or that its multimeric state is not yet characterized.

Post-translational modifications or specific structural domains that might influence PCP4L1's function are not explicitly mentioned, but the protein's interaction with calmodulin could be regulated by such modifications or co-factor interactions (morgan2012pcp4l1). The study suggests that PCP4L1 may act as a latent calmodulin inhibitor, with its activity potentially modulated by structural changes or external factors (morgan2012pcp4l1).

## Function
PCP4L1 is a protein that plays a role in calcium signaling pathways, particularly through its interaction with calmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein. The protein contains an IQ motif, a sequence known to bind calmodulin, which is crucial for modulating calcium-dependent processes in cells. However, in its full-length form, PCP4L1 does not bind to calmodulin due to an auto-inhibitory element in its N-terminal region. This element includes a lysine/glutamic acid-rich (KE) motif that suppresses the binding of the IQ motif to calmodulin. Truncating this region or altering specific residues can restore its ability to bind calmodulin, suggesting that PCP4L1 may act as a latent calmodulin inhibitor (morgan2012pcp4l1).

PCP4L1 is part of the calpacitin family, which includes proteins like neurogranin and GAP-43, known for modulating calmodulin's calcium binding kinetics. These proteins are highly expressed in the central nervous system and play significant roles in neurobiology, as evidenced by genetic studies in mice. The developmental expression pattern of PCP4L1 suggests an important function in the mammalian central nervous system, with localization in specific brain regions during development and adulthood (morgan2012pcp4l1).

## Interactions
The human gene PCP4L1 encodes the Purkinje cell protein 4-like 1, which is involved in calcium signaling pathways. Despite its high sequence conservation with other small IQ motif proteins like PEP-19, PCP4L1 does not interact with calmodulin (CaM) in yeast two-hybrid or pulldown experiments when in its full-length form. This is in contrast to PEP-19 and neurogranin, which do bind to CaM under low calcium conditions (morgan2012pcp4l1).

The lack of interaction is attributed to an auto-inhibitory element within PCP4L1, specifically a nine-residue glutamic acid-rich sequence that prevents CaM binding. Deleting or altering this sequence, or substituting a specific isoleucine with phenylalanine, restores the ability of PCP4L1 to bind CaM (morgan2012pcp4l1). Experiments have shown that the N-terminal region of PCP4L1 contains inhibitory sequences, and deletion of 36 amino acids, including a lysine/glutamic acid-rich (KE) motif, restores CaM binding. This KE motif is critical in suppressing CaM binding, and domain swap experiments have demonstrated that replacing the PCP4L1 KE motif with that from PEP-19 confers CaM binding properties onto PCP4L1 (morgan2012pcp4l1).

These findings suggest that PCP4L1 may act as a latent calmodulin inhibitor, potentially regulated by post-translational modifications or co-factor interactions (morgan2012pcp4l1).
