# OR1A2

## Overview
The OR1A2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily A member 2, which is a part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odorants, playing a significant role in the sense of smell by binding specific odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways (Krautwurst2008Human). OR1A2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is known to detect a variety of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes, contributing to the perception of fruity and floral scents (Krautwurst2008Human). Beyond its olfactory functions, OR1A2 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the liver, where it participates in cellular signaling processes, including the regulation of cell growth and proliferation through cAMP-dependent pathways (Maßberg2015Monoterpene; Raka2021Human). This highlights the receptor's potential involvement in broader physiological processes beyond olfactory perception.

## Structure
The OR1A2 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structure is typical of GPCRs, which are involved in signal transduction across cell membranes (Jimenez2021The). The primary structure of OR1A2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function as a receptor. The secondary structure includes alpha helices, which are common in the transmembrane regions of GPCRs, contributing to the receptor's ability to span the cell membrane (Jimenez2021The).

The tertiary structure of OR1A2 involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional shape, which is crucial for its interaction with ligands and subsequent signal transduction. Although specific details about the quaternary structure of OR1A2 are not provided, GPCRs typically function as monomers, and this is likely the case for OR1A2 as well (Jimenez2021The).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, which can influence the receptor's stability, localization, and function. These modifications are common in GPCRs and are likely relevant to OR1A2, although specific modifications for this receptor are not detailed in the available context (Jimenez2021The).

## Function
OR1A2 is an olfactory receptor involved in the detection of odorants, contributing to the sense of smell. It is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in olfactory signaling by binding specific odor molecules and initiating a signal transduction pathway. This receptor is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it detects aliphatic and aromatic, fruity and floral aldehydes (Krautwurst2008Human).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR1A2 is expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the liver, where it may be involved in cellular signaling processes. In hepatocellular cells, OR1A2 is activated by the monoterpene (−)-citronellal, leading to the activation of a cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. This activation results in transient intracellular calcium (Ca2+) elevations, which are significant for regulating physiological processes like cell growth and proliferation (Maßberg2015Monoterpene; Raka2021Human). The receptor's activation in these cells suggests a potential role in regulating cell growth and proliferation, indicating its involvement in broader physiological processes beyond olfactory perception (Raka2021Human).
