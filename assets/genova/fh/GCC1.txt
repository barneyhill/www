# GCC1

## Overview
The GCC1 gene encodes the GRIP and coiled-coil domain containing 1 protein, which is integral to intracellular transport processes, particularly in the targeting and functioning of the Golgi apparatus. This protein is characterized by the presence of a GRIP domain, essential for its Golgi localization, and coiled-coil domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions. These structural features enable the protein to play a crucial role in cellular transport mechanisms. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can modulate its function and interactions within the cell. While the GCC1 gene has been associated with various diseases, including glioma and type 2 diabetes, the precise mechanisms and pathways through which it operates remain an active area of research (Cui2020A; Liu2021Construction; K.2012Type).

## Structure
The GCC1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in intracellular transport, particularly in targeting the Golgi apparatus. The protein structure includes a GRIP domain, which is essential for its localization to the Golgi. This domain is a key feature that facilitates the protein's function in cellular transport processes. Additionally, the protein contains coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that enable protein-protein interactions, crucial for its role in intracellular transport.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in the GCC1 protein. These modifications can influence the protein's function and its interactions with other cellular components, potentially affecting its role in the Golgi apparatus targeting and intracellular transport.

The presence of these domains and potential modifications suggests a complex structure that supports its functional roles within the cell. However, specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of the GCC1 protein are not provided in the available context. Therefore, further research would be necessary to elaborate on these structural aspects.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The GCC1 gene, encoding the GRIP and coiled-coil domain containing 1 protein, has been implicated in various diseases through its altered expression and interactions. In glioma, GCC1 is part of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network that includes four mRNAs, which are associated with glioma prognosis and immune infiltration. However, there are no specific tumor-related reports on GCC1, indicating a gap in understanding its role in gliomas (Liu2021Construction).

In the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D), GCC1 has been identified as a novel locus in a South Asian population through Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). This suggests a potential role for GCC1 in T2D susceptibility, particularly in certain populations, although specific mechanisms remain unclear (K.2012Type).

Additionally, GCC1 is one of the top genes positively correlated with SND1 expression in various cancers, suggesting a potential involvement in cancer pathogenesis through pathways related to RNA metabolism and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (Cui2020A). Despite these associations, further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical significance of GCC1 in these conditions.
