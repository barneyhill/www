# CAVIN3

## Overview
CAVIN3, also known as caveolae associated protein 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of caveolae, which are small, flask-shaped invaginations in the plasma membrane. The protein encoded by CAVIN3 is a member of the cavin family and plays a critical role in modulating the dynamics and stability of caveolae by interacting with other caveolae-associated proteins such as cavin1 and caveolin1 (Mohan2015Cavin3; McMahon2009SRBCcavin3). CAVIN3 is characterized by structural features such as a leucine zipper domain, which facilitates its localization to caveolae and interaction with caveolin-1 (McMahon2009SRBCcavin3). Functionally, CAVIN3 is involved in processes such as membrane tension regulation, signaling, and lipid homeostasis, and it has been implicated in adipogenesis and cellular stress responses (Park2020CaveolaeAssociated; McMahon2019Identification). The gene's expression and regulation have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where it acts as a proapoptotic tumor suppressor, and in mental health, with associations to major depressive disorder (Gupta2014Caveolin; Kovanen2017PRKCDBP).

## Structure
CAVIN3, also known as caveolae associated protein 3, is a member of the cavin family involved in the regulation of caveolae dynamics. The protein is characterized by several structural features that contribute to its function. It contains a leucine zipper (LZ) domain, which is crucial for its interaction with caveolin-1 and localization to caveolae (McMahon2009SRBCcavin3). This domain spans amino acids 20 to 76 and is essential for targeting CAVIN3 to caveolae (McMahon2009SRBCcavin3).

CAVIN3 also has a central region, comprising amino acids 135-200, which is important for binding to the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1. This interaction is influenced by cholesterol levels, with increased binding observed at higher cholesterol concentrations (Mohan2015Cavin3). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may affect its interactions and function (Mohan2015Cavin3).

CAVIN3 can form a stable tetrameric complex with cavin1 trimers, indicating its role in higher-order protein assemblies (Mohan2015Cavin3). The protein is also known to have splice variant isoforms, which can influence its function and localization within cells (McMahon2009SRBCcavin3).

## Function
CAVIN3, also known as caveolae-associated protein 3, plays a crucial role in the regulation of caveolae, which are small invaginations in the plasma membrane involved in various cellular processes. CAVIN3 interacts with cavin1 and caveolin1, influencing the dynamics and stability of caveolae. It is enriched at deeply invaginated caveolae and affects their release from the cell surface, promoting the transition from stable to more dynamic states (Mohan2015Cavin3). This protein is not required for the initial formation of caveolae but modulates their surface dynamics, impacting processes such as membrane tension, signaling, and lipid homeostasis (Mohan2015Cavin3).

CAVIN3 also plays a role in adipogenesis by influencing the expression of adipogenesis-related genes and modulating the shedding of preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1) via the tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE). This process is crucial for adipocyte differentiation, as Pref-1 inhibits this differentiation by maintaining preadipocyte states (Park2020CaveolaeAssociated). Additionally, CAVIN3 is involved in the regulation of caveolae traffic and invagination, affecting the internalization and movement of caveolae within cells (McMahon2009SRBCcavin3). These functions highlight CAVIN3's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications for metabolic health and obesity-related disorders.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAVIN3 gene, also known as caveolae associated protein 3, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. CAVIN3 is frequently downregulated in several cancers, including breast, lung, ovarian, and colorectal cancers, often due to promoter hypermethylation, which leads to gene silencing (Gupta2014Caveolin; McMahon2009SRBCcavin3). This downregulation is associated with reduced cellular sensitivity to stressors and a decreased apoptotic response, contributing to tumor progression (Gupta2014Caveolin). 

In cancer, CAVIN3 acts as a proapoptotic tumor suppressor, and its absence can lead to enhanced cell survival and tumor growth (McMahon2019Identification). The gene's role in apoptosis is linked to its interaction with protein phosphatase 1 alpha (PP1α), where CAVIN3 forms a complex that regulates apoptosis and the DNA damage response (McMahon2019Identification). 

Beyond cancer, genetic variants in CAVIN3, specifically the rs1488864 single-nucleotide polymorphism, have been associated with an increased risk of major depressive disorder, suggesting a broader impact on mental health (Kovanen2017PRKCDBP). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CAVIN3 in both oncological and psychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
CAVIN3, also known as caveolae associated protein 3, interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in the dynamics and function of caveolae. It binds to the N-terminal region of CAVIN1, facilitating its recruitment to caveolae and influencing the oligomerization of caveolin1, which affects the size, shape, and dynamics of caveolae (Mohan2015Cavin3). CAVIN3 competes with CAVIN2 for binding to CAVIN1, suggesting a regulatory mechanism in caveolae dynamics (Mohan2015Cavin3).

CAVIN3 also interacts with protein phosphatase 1 alpha (PP1α), particularly under stress conditions such as UV radiation. This interaction is crucial for regulating apoptosis and DNA damage response, as CAVIN3 modulates the phosphorylation level of γH2AX, a marker of DNA damage, by inhibiting PP1α's phosphatase activity (McMahon2019Identification). The interaction between CAVIN3 and PP1α is proposed to play a role in apoptosis regulation, with CAVIN3 promoting apoptosis in response to stress (McMahon2019Identification).

Additionally, CAVIN3 interacts with BRCA1, a protein involved in DNA repair. This interaction stabilizes BRCA1, facilitating its role in DNA repair processes, and is particularly significant in the context of cellular stress responses (McMahon2021Cavin3).
