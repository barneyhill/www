# SUN1

## Overview
The SUN1 gene encodes the Sad1 and UNC84 domain containing 1 protein, which is a crucial component of the nuclear envelope. This protein is categorized as an integral membrane protein and plays a significant role in the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. SUN1 is primarily located at the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope, facilitating nuclear-cytoskeletal connections, and participating in mRNA export. It interacts with various proteins, including lamin A and nesprins, to form a bridge between the nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton, which is essential for nuclear positioning and movement (Haque2006SUN1). Additionally, SUN1 is implicated in muscle regeneration and gene expression regulation, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Loo2019The). Mutations in the SUN1 gene have been linked to muscular dystrophies, emphasizing its clinical significance in nuclear structure-related conditions (Meinke2014Muscular).

## Structure
SUN1 is a protein integral to the nuclear envelope, characterized by distinct structural domains that facilitate its function. The protein comprises an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD), separated by transmembrane domains. The NTD, which includes residues 1 to 355, is responsible for binding to lamin A and targeting the nuclear envelope (NE), anchoring SUN1 at the inner nuclear membrane (INM) through interaction with the nuclear lamina (Haque2006SUN1). The CTD contains coiled-coil regions and the SUN domain, which interacts with nesprins, forming a bridge across the NE and connecting the nuclear lamina to the cytoskeleton (Gurusaran2023Molecular; Haque2006SUN1).

The luminal region of SUN1 includes a trimeric coiled-coil domain, stabilized by zinc-binding, which contributes to the protein's structural integrity and flexibility (Gurusaran2023Molecular). This region is crucial for forming the LINC complex, which mechanically couples the nuclear contents to the cytoskeleton (Gurusaran2023Molecular). SUN1 may undergo alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that could affect its function and localization (Haque2006SUN1). The protein's structure allows it to play a significant role in nuclear-cytoplasmic communication and positioning.

## Function
SUN1 (Sad1 and UNC84 domain containing 1) is a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope and facilitating nuclear-cytoskeletal connections. It is an integral membrane protein located at the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and is part of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. SUN1 interacts with nuclear lamin A and cytoplasmic nesprins, forming a physical connection between the nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton, which is crucial for nuclear positioning and movement (Haque2006SUN1).

SUN1 is involved in mRNA export, interacting with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) and the nuclear export factor NXF1. It facilitates the transfer of mRNPs to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) for export, playing a significant role in the NXF1-dependent mRNA export pathway (Li2015Inner). SUN1 also interacts with nucleoporins such as Nup153, which is essential for mRNA export (Li2015Inner).

In addition to its role in mRNA export, SUN1 is involved in muscle regeneration by modulating Drosha activity, which is crucial for microRNA processing. This function highlights its role in gene expression regulation and cellular signaling (Loo2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SUN1 gene are associated with several muscular dystrophies, particularly Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). These mutations disrupt nuclear-cytoskeletal connections and myonuclear organization, leading to defects in muscle cell function. Specific SUN1 variants, such as p.G68D, p.G338S, and p.W377C, have been identified as primary causes of these disruptions, which result in impaired microtubule nucleation and organization, contributing to muscle dysfunction (Meinke2014Muscular).

SUN1 mutations can also act as genetic modifiers, exacerbating the severity of diseases when present alongside mutations in other genes like LMNA or EMD. For instance, individuals with both SUN1 and LMNA mutations may experience more severe symptoms, including early-onset cardiac issues and severe muscular dystrophy (Meinke2014Muscular).

Alterations in SUN1 expression levels have been observed in patient myoblasts, where compound heterozygous SUN1 mutations led to increased SUN1 protein levels, suggesting a potential impact on protein stability or degradation. This alteration in expression is linked to disrupted nuclear-cytoskeletal connections and myonuclear organization, relevant to muscular dystrophy (Meinke2014Muscular).

SUN1 variants also influence nucleolar morphology, which may be relevant in understanding diseases like Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome, further highlighting the clinical significance of SUN1 in nuclear structure-related conditions (Satomi2020The).

## Interactions
SUN1, a component of the LINC complex, interacts with various proteins at the nuclear envelope. It binds to KASH domain proteins at the outer nuclear membrane, forming a connection between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton (Kim2015Making). SUN1 interacts with lamin A, providing a physical link between the nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton, although it does not require lamin A/C for its nuclear envelope localization (Haque2006SUN1). The interaction with lamin A is specific, as SUN1 does not bind to type B lamins (Haque2006SUN1).

SUN1 also interacts with emerin and nesprin-2 at the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope. The binding sites for these interactions are located within residues 209-302 of SUN1 (Haque2010Mammalian). These interactions are crucial for maintaining nuclear integrity and are part of a complex involving SUN proteins, lamin A, emerin, and nesprin isoforms (Haque2010Mammalian).

In meiosis, SUN1 interacts with SPDYA, playing a critical role in telomere clustering and chromosome alignment, which are essential for homolog pairing and synapsis (Chen2021The). This interaction is vital for maintaining telomere integrity and proper progression of meiosis prophase I (Chen2021The).
