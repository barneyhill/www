# TRIM24

## Overview
TRIM24, or tripartite motif containing 24, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein belonging to the TRIM/RBCC family, characterized by a conserved tripartite motif. This protein, also known as transcriptional intermediary factor 1α (TIF1α), functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a transcriptional regulator. It plays a critical role in cellular processes by modulating the stability and activity of key proteins such as the tumor suppressor p53, and by influencing chromatin dynamics through its interactions with histone modifications. TRIM24's involvement in transcriptional regulation is mediated through its interactions with nuclear receptors and chromatin, impacting gene expression and cellular responses to stress. The protein's dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers, where it often acts as an oncogene, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Zhu2020TRIM24; Jain2014TRIM24; Kikuchi2009TRIM24).

## Structure
TRIM24, also known as transcriptional intermediary factor 1α (TIF1α), is a member of the TRIM/RBCC protein family, characterized by a conserved tripartite motif. This motif includes a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, which are typical features of TRIM proteins (Jain2014TRIM24; Kikuchi2009TRIM24). The RING domain is crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins such as p53 (Zhu2020TRIM24; Jain2014TRIM24).

TRIM24 also contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger and a bromodomain, which function together as a cooperative unit to recognize specific histone modifications. The PHD finger recognizes unmodified H3K4, while the bromodomain binds to acetylated H3K23, allowing TRIM24 to interact with chromatin and nuclear receptors (Zhang2016Synergistic; Bennett2015Discovery). These domains are involved in chromatin interactions and play a role in transcriptional regulation (Kikuchi2009TRIM24).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, regulate TRIM24's function. Phosphorylation by ATM kinase at serine 768 induces its degradation during DNA damage, highlighting its role in cellular stress responses (Jain2014TRIM24). The protein's structure and modifications enable it to function as a transcriptional regulator and E3 ubiquitin ligase, impacting various cellular processes and disease states.

## Function
TRIM24 is a multifunctional protein that acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, primarily involved in the regulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. In healthy human cells, TRIM24 ubiquitinates p53, promoting its degradation via the proteasome pathway, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to DNA damage (Jain2014TRIM24). This regulation is part of an autoregulatory feedback loop where TRIM24 levels are controlled by p53. During DNA damage, ATM kinase phosphorylates TRIM24, leading to its destabilization and degradation, allowing p53 to accumulate and activate DNA damage response genes (Jain2014TRIM24).

TRIM24 also plays a role in chromatin regulation. It interacts with chromatin and is involved in the recruitment of estrogen receptors to regulatory sites, influencing gene expression (Jain2014TRIM24). TRIM24 modulates chromatin accessibility in a p53-dependent manner, affecting the regulation of p53 target genes. It binds to promoter sites of these genes, and its loss leads to increased expression of certain genes involved in inflammatory response and cell cycle regulation (Isbel2023Readout). TRIM24's activity is localized to specific genomic elements with particular chromatin features, rather than acting broadly within the nucleoplasm (Isbel2023Readout).

## Clinical Significance
TRIM24 is implicated in various cancers due to its role as an oncogene. In colorectal cancer, TRIM24 is upregulated, correlating with shorter patient survival and acting as an independent prognostic factor by influencing cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, potentially through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Yao2024The). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TRIM24 overexpression is found in 71.7% of cases, associated with advanced p-TNM stage, poor differentiation, and increased proliferation. Depleting TRIM24 in lung cell lines inhibits growth and invasion, induces cell cycle arrest, and increases apoptosis, highlighting its role in NSCLC progression (Li2012Overexpression).

In breast cancer, particularly HER2-positive and metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC), TRIM24 overexpression correlates with poor survival and aggressive tumor characteristics. It acts as a chromatin regulator activating estrogen-dependent genes and is associated with the PI3K/mTOR pathways, suggesting potential therapeutic targets (Yao2024The; Shah2021Mammaryspecific). In glioblastoma, TRIM24 functions as an oncogenic transcriptional co-activator of STAT3, crucial for EGFR-driven tumorigenesis, and is necessary for glioma stem cell proliferation (Lv2017TRIM24). These findings underscore TRIM24's clinical significance as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target across various cancer types.

## Interactions
TRIM24, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. It interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), enhancing AR-mediated transcriptional activity. This interaction is partially dependent on the RING finger domain of TRIM24, as a deletion mutant lacking this domain still enhances AR activity, though less effectively (Kikuchi2009TRIM24). TRIM24 also interacts with the histone acetyltransferase TIP60, which further enhances AR-mediated transcriptional activity (Kikuchi2009TRIM24).

TRIM24 is known to physically and functionally interact with bromodomain-containing protein 7 (BRD7), an interaction that does not require the RING finger domain of TRIM24 or the bromodomain of BRD7 (Kikuchi2009TRIM24). In the context of prostate cancer, TRIM28 protects TRIM24 from SPOP-mediated degradation, stabilizing TRIM24 and promoting androgen receptor signaling, which is crucial for prostate cancer progression (Fong2018TRIM28).

TRIM24 also acts as a coactivator of the constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR), enhancing CAR-mediated transcriptional regulation. This interaction involves the ligand-binding domain of CAR and is crucial for the expression of CAR target genes (Kanno2017Tripartite).
