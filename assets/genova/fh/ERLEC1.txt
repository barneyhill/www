# ERLEC1

## Overview
ERLEC1, or endoplasmic reticulum lectin 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the quality control of glycoprotein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The protein, categorized as a molecular chaperone, plays a pivotal role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway by recognizing and binding to specific glycan structures on nascent proteins, thereby facilitating their proper folding and assembly. This function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by preventing the progression of misfolded proteins through the secretory pathway (Fung2023Expression; Lin2023SEL1LHRD1). ERLEC1 is a luminal component of the Hrd1 E3 ligase complex, which is essential for recruiting misfolded substrates for degradation. Beyond its role in protein folding, ERLEC1 is also implicated in the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis, highlighting its broader significance in cellular metabolism (Fung2023Expression).

## Structure


## Function
ERLEC1 (endoplasmic reticulum lectin 1) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the quality control of glycoprotein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It functions as a molecular chaperone, recognizing and binding to specific glycan structures on nascent proteins, which facilitates their proper folding and assembly. This interaction is essential for preventing misfolded proteins from progressing through the secretory pathway, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Fung2023Expression; Lin2023SEL1LHRD1).

ERLEC1 is a luminal component of the Hrd1 E3 ligase complex, which is responsible for recruiting misfolded substrates to the E3 ligase for degradation via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (Fung2023Expression). This process is vital for the degradation of misfolded proteins in the ER, ensuring that only properly folded proteins are transported to their final destinations within the cell (Lin2023SEL1LHRD1).

In addition to its role in protein folding, ERLEC1 is involved in the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis. Studies in transgenic zebrafish have shown that ERLEC1 is implicated in the suppression of hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis, highlighting its broader role in cellular metabolism (Fung2023Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The ERLEC1 gene is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Alterations in ERLEC1 expression have been linked to cancer, particularly lung cancer, where it is associated with cancer invasion and metastasis. ERLEC1, also known as CIM, is overexpressed in certain cancers, including osteosarcomas, and is critical for the metastatic properties of lung cancer cells by influencing their response to hypoxia and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Yanagisawa2010Novel).

In the context of α1-antitrypsin deficiency, ERLEC1 is involved in the degradation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Mutations in ERLEC1 can suppress the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, indicating its role in managing liver stress related to protein misfolding (Fung2023Expression). 

ERLEC1 is also associated with anorexia nervosa, where its expression is influenced by dietary intake and body weight, suggesting a role in the pathophysiology of the disorder (Murray2023Brainbased). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ERLEC1 in various diseases, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ERLEC1, also known as endoplasmic reticulum lectin 1, is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it plays a critical role in recognizing and binding misfolded glycoproteins. ERLEC1 interacts with several proteins within the ERAD complex, including SEL1L and HRD1. The interaction between ERLEC1 and HRD1 is mediated through SEL1L, forming a tight cluster necessary for the functional HRD1 ERAD complex (Lin2024SEL1LHRD1). This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of misfolded substrates to the E3 ligase for degradation (Fung2023Expression).

In human embryonic kidney cells, the knockout of both ERLEC1 and another ER lectin, OS-9, results in the instability of the HRD1 complex, indicating that these proteins have partially redundant roles in maintaining the complex's stability (Fung2023Expression). The SEL1L S658P mutation specifically disrupts the interaction between SEL1L and HRD1 but does not affect SEL1L's interaction with ERLEC1, suggesting that ERLEC1's role in the ERAD complex remains intact despite this mutation (Lin2024SEL1LHRD1). These interactions highlight ERLEC1's significant role in the ERAD pathway, particularly in the processing and degradation of misfolded proteins.
