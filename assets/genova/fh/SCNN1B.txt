# SCNN1B

## Overview
The SCNN1B gene encodes the beta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), a critical transmembrane protein complex involved in sodium ion transport across epithelial cells. This channel is composed of three subunits: alpha, beta, and gamma, and is predominantly expressed in the apical membrane of epithelial cells in organs such as the kidney, lung, and colon. The beta subunit, encoded by SCNN1B, plays a vital role in the assembly and function of ENaC, contributing to the regulation of sodium balance, fluid volume, and blood pressure. The protein's structure includes two transmembrane segments and a large extracellular domain, with specific motifs that facilitate interactions with regulatory proteins, such as ubiquitin-protein ligases, which modulate its activity and stability. Mutations in SCNN1B are linked to disorders like Liddle syndrome and pseudohypoaldosteronism type I, underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining electrolyte homeostasis and its potential impact on disease phenotypes (Lu2022A; Hanukoglu2016Epithelial; Rotin2021Function).

## Structure
The SCNN1B gene encodes the β subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is a crucial component of the heterotrimeric ENaC complex, composed of α, β, and γ subunits. The primary structure of the SCNN1B protein consists of 640 amino acids, with a mass of 72,659 Da (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial). The β subunit features two transmembrane segments, TM1 and TM2, with intracellular N- and C-termini and a large extracellular domain (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial).

The extracellular domain of ENaC subunits, including SCNN1B, is organized into distinct regions known as the palm, thumb, knuckle, finger, and β-ball domains, which are formed by β strands, loops, and α helices (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial). The C-terminus of the β subunit contains sites for protein interactions and regulation by phosphorylation, and it is essential for chloride ion regulation by CFTR (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial).

Post-translational modifications of the β subunit include palmitoylation at C43 and C557, which stabilizes the open state of the channel (LemmensGruber2023The). The β subunit also contains a PY motif in its C-terminal region, which is crucial for interaction with Nedd4-2, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that regulates ENaC internalization and degradation (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial).

## Function
The SCNN1B gene encodes the β subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is essential for sodium ion transport across epithelial cells. ENaC is composed of three subunits: α, β, and γ, and is primarily active in the apical membrane of epithelial cells in the kidney, lung, and colon. This channel plays a critical role in regulating sodium balance, fluid volume, and blood pressure by facilitating sodium reabsorption and maintaining electrolyte homeostasis (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial; Rotin2021Function).

In healthy human cells, the β subunit encoded by SCNN1B is crucial for the proper assembly and function of ENaC. It contains a proline-rich PPPxY motif in its C-terminal region, which is involved in the regulation of channel activity through interactions with ubiquitin-protein ligases like NEDD4-2. This interaction is important for the endocytosis and degradation of ENaC, thereby controlling its activity at the cell surface (LemmensGruber2023The; Rotin2021Function).

The activity of ENaC, including the β subunit, is regulated by hormones such as aldosterone and vasopressin, which modulate sodium reabsorption in the kidney and colon. This regulation is vital for maintaining blood pressure and fluid balance in the body (Rotin2021Function).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCNN1B gene, which encodes the beta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), are associated with several clinical conditions. Liddle syndrome is a notable disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations in SCNN1B, leading to increased sodium reabsorption in the kidneys. This results in early-onset hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, often without elevated aldosterone levels (Lu2022A; Fan2018Liddle). The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and can be effectively managed with ENaC inhibitors like amiloride (Lu2023A).

In contrast, pseudohypoaldosteronism type I (PHA I) is linked to loss-of-function mutations in SCNN1B, resulting in impaired sodium reabsorption and symptoms such as hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and dehydration. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and requires lifelong sodium supplementation (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial; Liu2022Case).

Alterations in SCNN1B expression have also been implicated in lung adenocarcinoma, where reduced expression is associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages (Lu2021Integrative). These findings highlight the gene's role in both hereditary and acquired conditions, emphasizing the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis and treatment.

## Interactions
The SCNN1B gene encodes the beta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which interacts with several proteins and regulatory elements. A key interaction involves the WW domains of the Nedd4 protein, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, which binds to the proline-rich PY motifs in the β and γ subunits of ENaC. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of ENaC activity through ubiquitination, affecting the channel's surface expression and stability. Mutations in these PY motifs, such as those seen in Liddle's syndrome, disrupt Nedd4 binding, leading to increased sodium channel activity (Rotin2000Ubiquitination; Abriel1999Defective; Staub1996WW).

SCNN1B also interacts with the epithelial splicing regulatory protein ESRP2. This interaction influences the expression of an alternative SCNN1B transcript, with ESRP2 binding to specific SNP sites within the gene. The presence of ESRP2 affects the response to amiloride, a measure of ENaC-mediated sodium transport, suggesting its role in modulating ENaC function (Becker2020Genetic). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing SCNN1B and its role in sodium balance and disease phenotypes.
