# OR13A1

## Overview
The OR13A1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 13 subfamily A member 1, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific ligands and initiating a neuronal response that results in the perception of smell. As a transmembrane receptor, it spans the cell membrane and transduces extracellular signals through interaction with G proteins, which subsequently activate intracellular signaling pathways. The olfactory receptor family is one of the largest gene families in the human genome, highlighting the complexity and diversity of olfactory perception (Qiu2020aarFDC).
