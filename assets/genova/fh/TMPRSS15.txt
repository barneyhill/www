# TMPRSS15

## Overview
TMPRSS15 is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane serine protease 15, also known as enteropeptidase. This protein is a type of serine protease, which is primarily expressed on the brush border of epithelial cells in the duodenum and jejunum. It plays a pivotal role in the digestive system by converting trypsinogen into trypsin, thereby facilitating the activation of other pancreatic proteases necessary for protein digestion and nutrient absorption (Prohaska2012Interaction; Wang2020Novel). Beyond its digestive functions, TMPRSS15 is also involved in non-digestive processes, such as epidermal differentiation and potentially in cancer progression, by enhancing the invasiveness of certain cancer cells (Prohaska2012Interaction). Mutations in the TMPRSS15 gene can lead to enterokinase deficiency, a rare condition affecting nutrient absorption (Babcock2022The).

## Structure
TMPRSS15, also known as enteropeptidase, is a serine protease involved in the activation of digestive enzymes. The primary structure of TMPRSS15 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of TMPRSS15 is characterized by the three-dimensional folding typical of serine proteases, including a catalytic domain essential for its enzymatic activity (Wang2020Novel).

TMPRSS15 contains specific domains such as the serine protease domain, which is crucial for its function in activating trypsinogen, a key step in intestinal protein absorption (Wang2020Novel). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can affect its stability and activity. TMPRSS15 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may result in variations in its structure and function (Wang2020Novel).

The quaternary structure of TMPRSS15, if present, would involve the assembly of multiple protein subunits, but specific details on this aspect are not provided in the available context.

## Function
TMPRSS15, also known as enteropeptidase, is a serine protease enzyme primarily expressed on the brush border membrane of epithelial cells in the duodenum and jejunum. It plays a crucial role in the digestive process by converting trypsinogen into trypsin, which is essential for the activation of other pancreatic proteases involved in protein digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine (Prohaska2012Interaction; Wang2020Novel). 

Enteropeptidase is synthesized as a single-chain protein that requires activation by proteolytic cleavage, likely by a trypsin-like enzyme, to become functional (Kitamoto1994Enterokinase). The enzyme's activity is not limited to the digestive system; it is also expressed in keratinocytes during terminal differentiation, suggesting a role in epidermal differentiation and desquamation (Prohaska2012Interaction). 

In addition to its digestive functions, TMPRSS15 has been implicated in various non-digestive contexts, such as enhancing the invasiveness of certain cancer cells, including oral squamous cell carcinoma and prostate cancer cell lines, by activating trypsin (Prohaska2012Interaction). This highlights its potential involvement in cancer progression and other physiological processes beyond digestion.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMPRSS15 gene, which encodes the enzyme enterokinase, are linked to enterokinase deficiency (EKD), a rare condition characterized by chronic malabsorption, failure to thrive, chronic diarrhea, low serum protein, and diffuse edema starting in infancy. This disorder is extremely rare, with only about 20 cases reported. Enterokinase is a transmembrane serine peptidase that activates trypsinogen to trypsin in the duodenum, preventing premature activation of pancreatic enzymes. Histopathology in EKD patients is generally unremarkable, but enzymatic analysis shows low peptidase and enterokinase activity. Known pathogenic variants in TMPRSS15 include nonsense mutations, frameshifts, splice variants, and missense mutations, such as p.Val799Asp and p.Gly1002Arg, which affect the C-terminal serine protease domain. Management of TMPRSS15 deficiency involves replacement of exogenous pancreatic enzymes, although systematic data for therapy is lacking due to the rarity of the disease (Babcock2022The).
