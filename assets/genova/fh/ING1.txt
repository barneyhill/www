# ING1

## Overview
The ING1 gene encodes the inhibitor of growth family member 1 protein, a critical component in cellular processes related to tumor suppression. This protein is categorized as a tumor suppressor and is involved in chromatin remodeling, gene transcription regulation, DNA repair, apoptosis, and cellular senescence. The ING1 protein contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, which allows it to bind specifically to trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3), facilitating its role as a histone code-reader in chromatin remodeling (AguissaTouré2010The; bertschmann2020characterizing). ING1 interacts with various protein complexes, including histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC), to modulate gene expression and maintain genomic stability (Campos2004Biological). The gene's expression is often altered in cancers, such as breast and lung cancer, where its downregulation is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression (Smolle2019The; EZZET2023DNA).

## Structure
The ING1 protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function as a tumor suppressor. It contains a highly conserved C-terminal plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, which is a Cys4-His-Cys3 zinc-binding motif. This domain allows ING1 to act as a histone code-reader, specifically binding to trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3) with high affinity, playing a role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation (bertschmann2020characterizing; AguissaTouré2010The).

The protein also includes a conserved lamin interaction domain (LID) that interacts with lamin A, aiding in nuclear localization (bertschmann2020characterizing). ING1 has a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that is crucial for its transport into the nucleus, where it performs its tumor suppressor functions (AguissaTouré2010The).

ING1 is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including p47ING1a, p33ING1b, p27ING1d, and p24ING1c, each with potentially distinct cellular functions (Cheung2001The; AguissaTouré2010The). These isoforms share an identical C-terminal region containing the PHD finger motif, but differ in their N-terminal sequences, which may influence their specific roles and interactions within the cell (Cheung2001The).

## Function
The ING1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, ING1 is involved in chromatin remodeling, gene transcription regulation, DNA repair, apoptosis, and cellular senescence. It interacts with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes, influencing chromatin structure and gene expression (Campos2004Biological; AguissaTouré2010The). The protein contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) motif, which is essential for chromatin recognition and binding to histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), a marker for active transcription (AguissaTouré2010The; Taheri2022Molecular).

ING1 also cooperates with the tumor suppressor protein p53 to enhance the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, such as p21 and Bax (Campos2004Biological; Shimada1998Cloning). It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in response to DNA damage, facilitating the switch from DNA replication to repair (AguissaTouré2010The). ING1's involvement in these processes underscores its role in preventing tumorigenesis and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Campos2004Biological).

## Clinical Significance
The ING1 gene is a tumor suppressor whose altered expression is implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), ING1 expression is frequently lost, correlating with poor prognosis. This loss is often due to epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation, rather than mutations, which are rare in ING1 (Toyama1999Suppression; EZZET2023DNA). Decreased ING1 mRNA expression is observed in 44% of primary breast cancers and is associated with increased tumor growth and metastasis (Toyama1999Suppression).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ING1 expression is significantly lower compared to healthy lung tissue. This reduction is linked to decreased expression of tumor suppressive genes like p21 and Bax, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Smolle2019The). ING1's interaction with p53 is crucial for its tumor-suppressive functions, and its misregulation can lead to malignant transformation (Guérillon2014The).

Loss of heterozygosity in the 13q34 region, where ING1 is located, has been observed in several cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and esophageal squamous cell cancer, contributing to its downregulation (Guérillon2014The). These findings highlight ING1's potential as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

## Interactions
The ING1 protein interacts with several proteins and complexes, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as apoptosis, DNA repair, and chromatin remodeling. ING1 interacts with karyopherins a2 and b1, which are crucial for its nuclear localization and function in transactivating the p21WAF1 promoter (Russell2008ING1). It also associates with the mSin3-HDAC complex, a Brg-based Swi-Snf complex, and the NuA4/Tip60 complex, indicating its involvement in transcriptional regulation and chromatin modification (Unoki2009ING).

ING1 interacts with the pro-apoptotic protein BAX at the mitochondria, a key interaction for its role in apoptosis (Bose2013ING1). It also binds to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in a UV-inducible manner, which is necessary for its apoptotic function (Bose2013ING1). ING1b, a specific isoform, interacts with p300 acetylase to enhance p53 acetylation, thereby promoting p53's transcriptional activity (Guérillon2013ING1).

The protein also binds to histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes, modulating gene expression in response to stress (Bose2013ING1). ING1's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins leads to its cytoplasmic relocalization, although the significance of this is not fully understood (Bose2013ING1).
