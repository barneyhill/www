# SPATA31C2

## Overview
SPATA31C2 is a gene that encodes the protein SPATA31 subfamily C member 2, which is part of a family of proteins involved in various cellular processes. Although the specific functions of SPATA31 subfamily C member 2 are not fully elucidated, it is categorized as a pseudogene, which suggests it may have regulatory roles or be involved in gene expression modulation (Carron2021Pseudogene). The gene has been studied in the context of several diseases, including cancer and heart disease, where alterations in its expression have been linked to disease progression and patient outcomes (Choueiri2023Integrative; Charles2021Integrated). Its potential involvement in DNA repair and response to UV damage further highlights its significance in maintaining genomic stability (Carron2021Pseudogene).

## Clinical Significance
SPATA31C2 has been implicated in various cancers and other diseases through alterations in its expression and mutations. In head and neck cancer (HNC), SPATA31C2 is one of the most deregulated pseudogenes, particularly in laryngeal cancer, and is associated with UV response and DNA repair, although specific studies in cancer are limited (Carron2021Pseudogene). Its expression is linked to patient survival, suggesting potential prognostic value in HNC (Carron2021Pseudogene).

In advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC), SPATA31C2 is associated with prolonged progression-free survival in patients treated with avelumab plus axitinib, indicating its potential role in predicting treatment response (Choueiri2023Integrative). Germline variants of SPATA31C2 are considered in the classification of tumors, which may influence treatment outcomes (Choueiri2023Integrative).

In lung cancer, SPATA31C2 is identified as a conserved gene in KRAS-mut and NEK subtypes, although its role in lung adenocarcinoma remains underexplored (Freischel2022Evolutionary). Additionally, SPATA31C2 is significantly downregulated in dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting a potential role in heart disease (Charles2021Integrated).
