# MINDY3

## Overview
MINDY3 is a gene that encodes the protein MINDY lysine 48 deubiquitinase 3, which is part of the MINDY family of deubiquitinating enzymes. These enzymes are characterized by their ability to specifically cleave ubiquitin from lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin chains, a process crucial for regulating protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The MINDY3 protein plays a significant role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Its activity is essential for modulating the stability and function of numerous proteins within the cell, thereby influencing diverse biological pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
