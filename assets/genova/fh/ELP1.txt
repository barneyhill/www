# ELP1

## Overview
The ELP1 gene encodes the protein elongator acetyltransferase complex subunit 1, a critical component of the Elongator complex, which is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and tRNA modification. The ELP1 protein, characterized by its WD40 β-propeller and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, serves as a scaffold within the Elongator complex, facilitating interactions with other subunits such as Elp2 and Elp3 (KolajRobin2017Structures; Glatt2013Structural). It plays a pivotal role in transcriptional elongation by associating with RNA polymerase II and is essential for the modification of uridines in the wobble position of tRNA, which is crucial for accurate translation (Kojic2023A; Xu2015Dimerization). ELP1 is also involved in maintaining genomic stability and cytoskeleton regulation, impacting processes such as DNA repair, cell migration, and neuronal development (Cheishvili2011IKAPElp1; Chen2021Elp1). Mutations in the ELP1 gene are linked to familial dysautonomia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by sensory and autonomic dysfunction (Jackson2014A).

## Structure
The ELP1 protein, also known as elongator acetyltransferase complex subunit 1, is the largest subunit of the Elongator complex, with a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa. Its structure includes two WD40 β-propeller domains located at the N-terminus and a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain at the C-terminus (KolajRobin2017Structures; Glatt2013Structural). These domains contribute to the protein's role as a scaffold within the Elongator complex, facilitating interactions with other subunits such as Elp2 and Elp3 (KolajRobin2017Structures).

The C-terminal region of ELP1 is crucial for dimerization, which is essential for the assembly and stability of the Elongator complex (Dauden2017Structural). Despite low sequence identity, the C-terminal domains of human and yeast ELP1 share a similar dimeric structure (Dauden2017Structural). ELP1 is heavily phosphorylated, with phosphorylation sites near the tRNA-binding region playing a significant role in its tRNA modification activity. The phosphorylation of Ser-1209 is particularly important for this function (KolajRobin2017Structures). The protein's phosphorylation state is regulated by kinases and phosphatases, including Kti14 and Sit4 (KolajRobin2017Structures; Glatt2013Structural).

## Function
The ELP1 gene encodes a core subunit of the Elongator complex, which is involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, ELP1 plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation by associating with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. It facilitates the transcription of RNA polymerase II through chromatin in an acetyl-CoA-dependent manner, which is essential for gene expression regulation (Xu2015Dimerization). ELP1 is also crucial for translation regulation through its involvement in tRNA modification, specifically modifying uridines in the wobble position of tRNA species, which is vital for proper translation (Kojic2023A).

ELP1 is essential for maintaining genomic stability by facilitating RAD51-mediated homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks. It enhances the translational efficiency of RAD51, promoting its expression and the formation of RAD51 foci at DNA damage sites, which is crucial for error-free DNA repair (Chen2021Elp1). Additionally, ELP1 is involved in cytoskeleton regulation, influencing microtubule organization and cell adhesion, which are important for normal cell function and structure (Cheishvili2011IKAPElp1). ELP1's activities are critical for processes such as cell migration, oligodendrocyte development, and sensory neuron development (Xu2015Dimerization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ELP1 gene are primarily associated with familial dysautonomia (FD), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by sensory and autonomic dysfunction. This condition is caused by a point mutation in the ELP1 gene, leading to aberrant splicing of exon 20 and resulting in reduced levels of the Elp1 protein. The mutation causes exon 20 skipping, producing transcripts with premature termination codons that are degraded, significantly lowering ELP1 protein levels, particularly in peripheral sensory and sympathetic neurons (Donadon2018Exonspecific; Jackson2014A). The clinical manifestations of FD include progressive neuron loss and physiological impairments, which are present from birth and worsen with age (Jackson2014A).

Alterations in ELP1 expression levels are also linked to transcriptional and cellular defects. Reduced levels of IKAP/hELP1, a subunit of the Elongator complex, impair transcriptional elongation and histone acetylation, affecting genes involved in cell motility. This impairment may contribute to the neuropathology of FD by affecting cell migration and motility in the nervous system (Close2006Transcription). Additionally, IKAP/Elp1 deficiency impacts cytoskeletal regulation, potentially affecting microtubule stability and cell motility, which are crucial for neuronal development (Cheishvili2011IKAPElp1).

## Interactions
The ELP1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the Elongator complex, which is involved in various cellular processes, including tRNA modification and transcriptional elongation. ELP1 interacts with other subunits of the Elongator complex, such as ELP2 and ELP3, forming a stable subcomplex essential for the complex's assembly and function (Xu2015Dimerization). The dimerization of ELP1 is crucial for the stability and assembly of the Elongator complex, as it facilitates the recruitment of ELP2 and ELP3 into the complex (Xu2015Dimerization).

ELP1 also plays a role in binding tRNA, particularly through its C-terminal domain, which contains a conserved lysine/arginine-rich basic region. This region is essential for tRNA wobble uridine modification, a process that is resistant to competition by non-specific polynucleotides (Di2014A). Mutations in this region, such as the Elp1-KR9A variant, lead to defects in tRNA binding and modification, highlighting the importance of this interaction for Elongator function (Di2014A).

In addition to its role in the Elongator complex, ELP1 is involved in maintaining nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling by inhibiting the phosphatase that deactivates the TrkA receptor, which is crucial for neuronal survival and growth (Kaplan2020(H)Elping page 0).
