# ABHD12

## Overview
The ABHD12 gene encodes the protein abhydrolase domain containing 12, lysophospholipase, which is a member of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily. This protein is categorized as an integral membrane enzyme, primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism and endocannabinoid signaling. ABHD12 is involved in the hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylserines and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, contributing to the regulation of lipid homeostasis and neuroinflammatory processes, particularly in the brain and immune cells such as microglia and macrophages (Fiskerstrand2010Mutations; Kamat2015Immunomodulatory). The enzyme's activity is dependent on glycosylation, which is essential for its function (Joshi2018Biochemical). Mutations in the ABHD12 gene are linked to PHARC syndrome, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a range of symptoms including polyneuropathy and hearing loss, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Fiskerstrand2010Mutations; Daneshi2023Genetic).

## Structure
The ABHD12 protein is part of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily and features a conserved α/β-hydrolase fold. Its primary structure includes a nucleophile motif GXSXG (244-GHSLG) with a catalytic serine (Ser246) and an acyltransferase motif HXXXXD (199-HVVTFD) (Kind2018Structural). The secondary structure comprises a core domain and a lid domain, with the lid domain consisting of two α-helices and connecting loops, which may be important for membrane binding and interaction with lipophilic substrates (Kind2018Structural). The tertiary structure is characterized by a catalytic triad (Ser246, Asp333, His372) located in a sharp turn between the β5-strand and the subsequent α-helix (α3) (Kind2018Structural). The N-terminal part of ABHD12 is likely cytosolic, while the C-terminal part is predicted to be on the lumenal/extracellular side of the cell (Kind2018Structural). ABHD12 is a predicted membrane protein, indicating its close contact with the lipid phase (Kind2018Structural). The protein's topology suggests a membrane-associated configuration, although the quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed (Kind2018Structural). ABHD12 undergoes glycosylation, which is necessary for its optimal activity (Joshi2018Biochemical).

## Function
The ABHD12 gene encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylserines (lyso-PS) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), which are important for maintaining lipid homeostasis and endocannabinoid signaling in healthy human cells (Fiskerstrand2010Mutations; Kamat2015Immunomodulatory). ABHD12 is highly expressed in the brain, especially in microglia, and in macrophages, where it contributes to the regulation of neuroinflammatory processes and neurotransmission (Fiskerstrand2010Mutations; Savinainen2011The).

The enzyme is an integral membrane protein localized primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it hydrolyzes very-long-chain (VLC) lipids, including lyso-PS, to prevent their accumulation, which is crucial for normal neurological function (Joshi2018Biochemical). ABHD12's activity is dependent on glycosylation, which is essential for its enzymatic function (Joshi2018Biochemical). The enzyme's role in hydrolyzing 2-AG, although minor compared to monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), is significant in specific cell types, such as microglia, where it helps maintain the balance of endocannabinoid signaling (Fiskerstrand2010Mutations; Savinainen2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABHD12 gene are associated with PHARC syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. PHARC is characterized by polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and cataracts. These symptoms result from the loss of function of the ABHD12 enzyme, which is crucial for lipid metabolism and the endocannabinoid system (Fiskerstrand2010Mutations; Daneshi2023Genetic). The disease is linked to various mutations, including frameshift, nonsense, and missense mutations, which lead to the accumulation of lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) in the brain, causing neuroinflammation and other neurological symptoms (Lerat2017A; Singh2020Mapping).

PHARC syndrome exhibits significant clinical variability, with symptoms often appearing in childhood or adolescence. The disorder is progressive, with symptoms worsening over time, and can be misdiagnosed due to its overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases (Lerat2017A; Daneshi2023Genetic). The ABHD12 gene's role in lipid signaling and its interaction with other enzymes, such as ABHD16A, further complicates the disease's pathophysiology, highlighting the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis and management (Singh2020Mapping; Kind2018Structural).
