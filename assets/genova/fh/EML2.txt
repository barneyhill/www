# EML2

## Overview
EML2, or Echinoderm Microtubule-Associated Protein-Like 2, is a gene that encodes the microtubule-associated protein EMAP-like 2. This protein is a member of the EML protein family, which is characterized by its role in regulating microtubule dynamics within cells. EML2 is primarily involved in microtubule destabilization, influencing microtubule growth rates and promoting catastrophe, a process critical for maintaining cellular architecture and function (Fry2016EML). The protein's structure includes an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal region with WD repeats, facilitating its interaction with microtubules and other proteins (Richards2015Microtubule). EML2 is expressed in various human tissues, including the nervous system, and is implicated in cellular processes such as cell division and intracellular transport. Its potential involvement in diseases like Huntington's disease and cancer underscores its clinical significance (Richards2015Microtubule; Cheng2020Identification).

## Structure
EML2 is a member of the EML protein family, characterized by a conserved structure that includes an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal region with WD (tryptophan-aspartate) repeats. The N-terminal region, approximately 175-200 residues long, is largely unstructured except for a short coiled-coil segment. This coiled-coil domain facilitates trimerization, forming a trimeric coiled-coil structure through hydrophobic interactions and salt-bridges, which is crucial for microtubule binding (Richards2015Microtubule; Fry2016EML).

The C-terminal domain of EML2 consists of approximately 650 residues and includes multiple WD repeats that form beta-sheet structures. These beta-sheets create the blades of two beta-propeller domains, with the first propeller formed from seven WD repeats and the second from six WD repeats and an additional TAPE (tandem atypical propeller in EML) domain. This arrangement results in a planar structure with distinct concave and convex surfaces (Fry2016EML).

EML2 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its structural and functional properties. The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its interaction with microtubules (Adib2018Mitotic).

## Function
EML2 (EMAP-like 2) is a microtubule-associated protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, playing a crucial role in both differentiated and proliferating cells. EML2 functions primarily as a microtubule destabilizer, reducing microtubule growth rates and promoting catastrophe, which is the rapid depolymerization of microtubules (Fry2016EML). This activity is essential for maintaining proper microtubule organization and dynamics within the cell.

The protein contains distinct domains that allow it to bind both polymerized microtubules and soluble α/β-tubulin heterodimers, similar to the chTOG/XMAP215 family of microtubule polymerases. This dual binding capability enables EML2 to influence microtubule growth and stability (Fry2016EML). Structurally, EML2 features a trimerization domain that is crucial for its self-association, forming oligomers necessary for its function in cellular processes that require multimeric protein complexes (Richards2015Microtubule).

EML2 is expressed widely in human tissues, including the nervous system, where it may contribute to maintaining cell architecture or mechanosensory functions (Fry2016EML). Its role in microtubule regulation is vital for cell division and intracellular transport, impacting overall cellular structure and function.

## Clinical Significance
EML2 has been implicated in Huntington's disease (HD) through its potential role in cognitive, sensory, and perceptual systems, which are affected in HD. Dysregulation of EML2 may contribute to these hallmark symptoms, suggesting that deficits in these domains could serve as diagnostic cues for HD (Cheng2020Identification). 

While specific diseases directly associated with mutations or expression changes in EML2 are not detailed, the gene's involvement in microtubule dynamics suggests potential implications in human diseases. EML2 acts as a microtubule destabilizer, influencing cell division and stability, which could contribute to pathological conditions (Fry2016EML). 

The EML family, including EML2, is involved in genetic fusions with tyrosine kinases, such as EML4-ALK in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These fusions lead to constitutive activation of the kinase, resulting in oncogene addiction and potential tumorigenesis (Richards2015Microtubule). Although EML2 itself is not directly linked to specific diseases in the provided context, its role in microtubule regulation and potential involvement in oncogenic processes suggest it may have clinical significance in cancer and other disorders related to cell division and stability.

## Interactions
EML2 (EMAP-like 2) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly in the context of microtubule dynamics during mitosis. EML2 has been identified as interacting with the NIMA family kinase Nek6. This interaction was discovered through immunoprecipitation high-throughput mass spectrometry (IP-HTMS) experiments, where EML2 was one of the microtubule-associated proteins identified as a prey protein when Nek6 was used as bait. This suggests a specific interaction between EML2 and Nek6, which may play a role in regulating microtubule dynamics during mitosis (Ewing2007Large‐scale).

EML2, like other EML proteins, contains a trimerization domain that facilitates self-association. This domain forms an amphipathic α-helix, allowing EML2 to form trimeric structures essential for its function. EML2 can also weakly associate with EML3, indicating some level of interaction within the EML protein family (Richards2015Microtubule).

While specific interactions of EML2 with nucleic acids or other proteins outside the EML family are not detailed, the protein's involvement in microtubule regulation suggests it may participate in broader protein complexes that influence cell cycle processes and chromosomal dynamics (Fry2016EML).
