# EVC2

## Overview
The EVC2 gene encodes the EvC ciliary complex subunit 2, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is crucial for skeletal development and cellular signaling. The EVC2 protein is a component of the EVC-EVC2 complex, which localizes to the EvC zone within primary cilia, acting as a positive modulator of Hh signaling by facilitating the transmission of signals from the Smoothened protein to downstream effectors. This protein is characterized by its transmembrane regions and coiled-coil domains, which are essential for its structural integrity and function. EVC2's interaction with other proteins, such as EVC and EFCAB7, is vital for its localization and function within cilia. Mutations in the EVC2 gene are linked to ciliopathies such as Ellis-van Creveld syndrome and Weyers acrodental dysostosis, underscoring its significance in human health and development (NegreteTorres2023Identification; Blair2011Evc2; Barbeito2023EVCEVC2).

## Structure
The EVC2 protein is a 1220 amino acid transmembrane protein with a predicted signal peptide sequence and a second transmembrane region between amino acids 209-231 (Blair2011Evc2). It features coiled-coil regions beyond these transmembrane sequences, which are important for its structural integrity and function (Blair2011Evc2). The protein's C-terminal region includes a W-peptide, crucial for the EVC-EVC2 complex's accumulation at the EvC zone, with specific motifs such as the FV and RRKKN motifs being essential for targeting and binding to EFCAB7 (Barbeito2023EVCEVC2).

EVC2 is involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway and forms a complex with EVC at the cilia membrane, where it acts as a positive modulator of the pathway (Blair2011Evc2). The protein is also found in the nucleus, suggesting a potential role in nuclear signaling (Blair2011Evc2). Post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and sumoylation, regulate the stability and ciliary targeting of the EVC-EVC2 complex (Barbeito2023EVCEVC2). Mutations in EVC2 can lead to Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, often resulting in truncated proteins that disrupt normal function (NegreteTorres2023Identification).

## Function
The EVC2 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is a crucial component of the EVC-EVC2 complex, which plays a significant role in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for skeletal morphogenesis and the regulation of various stem cell populations. In healthy human cells, the EVC-EVC2 complex localizes to the EvC zone within primary cilia, where it facilitates signal transduction from the Smoothened protein to downstream effectors in the Hh pathway (Yang2012Smoothened; Barbeito2023EVCEVC2).

The EVC2 protein interacts with the EVC protein at the cilia membrane, forming a heterodimeric complex that is necessary for the proper functioning of primary cilia, which act as cellular antennae (Blair2011Evc2). This interaction is crucial for the activation of Gli transcription factors by antagonizing the suppressor of fused (Sufu), thereby promoting Hh signaling (Yang2012Smoothened). The EVC2 protein is also found in the nucleus, suggesting a potential role in nuclear signaling and gene regulation (Blair2011Evc2).

The stability and targeting of the EVC-EVC2 complex are regulated by post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and sumoylation, which influence its accumulation at the EvC zone and its interaction with other proteins like EFCAB7 (Barbeito2023EVCEVC2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EVC2 gene are associated with Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EvCS) and Weyers acrodental dysostosis (WAD), both of which are ciliopathies affecting skeletal development. EvCS is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by short stature, polydactyly, and cardiac malformations. It is often caused by mutations that disrupt the EVC-EVC2 complex's stability and ciliary localization, leading to impaired Hedgehog signaling, which is crucial for bone development (NegreteTorres2023Identification; Barbeito2023EVCEVC2). 

WAD, a milder, dominantly inherited disorder, results from specific deletions in the EVC2 gene's C-terminal tail, affecting the complex's targeting to the EvC zone within cilia. These mutations act as dominant negatives, disrupting Hedgehog signaling and leading to the clinical manifestations of WAD (Ruiz‐Perez2009Ellis–van; Valencia2009Widening). 

The EVC2 gene's role in these conditions highlights its importance in maintaining normal protein function and ciliary targeting. Alterations in EVC2 gene expression, particularly mutations affecting conserved motifs, have significant clinical implications in the context of these ciliopathies (Barbeito2023EVCEVC2).

## Interactions
EVC2, a component of the EVC-EVC2 complex, interacts with several proteins to facilitate its role in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. EVC2 forms a heterodimeric complex with EVC, which is crucial for their localization to the primary cilia and for modulating Hh signaling. This interaction is necessary for the proper functioning of the Hh pathway, as both proteins co-localize at the basal body and cilia membrane (Blair2011Evc2).

The EVC-EVC2 complex is stabilized by its interaction with the IQCE-EFCAB7 complex, which recruits it to the ciliary base. This interaction is mediated by specific motifs within EVC2, such as the FV and RRKKN motifs, which are essential for targeting the complex to the EvC zone within cilia (Barbeito2023EVCEVC2).

EVC2 also interacts with proteins involved in the regulation of the Hh pathway, such as PRKACA, a negative regulator, and USP7, a deubiquitinating enzyme that affects GLI transcription factors. These interactions suggest that EVC2 may undergo ubiquitination, potentially regulated by USP7, influencing its stability and function in Hh signaling (Barbeito2023EVCEVC2).
