# PDCD7

## Overview
PDCD7, or programmed cell death 7, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of apoptosis and is a component of the spliceosome complex, which is crucial for pre-mRNA splicing. The PDCD7 protein plays a significant role in cellular homeostasis by influencing cell cycle progression and apoptosis, primarily within the nucleus. It is implicated in maintaining normal epithelial cell function and acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting E-cadherin expression, which is essential for cell-cell adhesion and the prevention of metastasis. Additionally, PDCD7 interacts with viral components, such as the polymerase acidic subunit of the H9N2 influenza virus, highlighting its role in the cellular response to viral infections (Wang2021Polymerase; Peng2018miR‐134).

## Function
PDCD7 (programmed cell death 7) is a protein involved in the regulation of apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is part of the spliceosome complex, which is essential for pre-mRNA splicing, a critical step in gene expression. PDCD7 is active in the nucleus, where it influences cell cycle progression and apoptosis, contributing to cellular homeostasis and development (Wang2021Polymerase).

In healthy human cells, PDCD7 plays a role in maintaining normal epithelial cell function by promoting the expression of E-cadherin, a protein crucial for cell-cell adhesion. This function is particularly important in preventing neoplastic progression, as E-cadherin helps maintain the structural integrity of epithelial tissues (Peng2018miR‐134). PDCD7's involvement in the regulation of E-cadherin expression suggests its role as a tumor suppressor, as it helps maintain cell adhesion and suppresses metastasis (Peng2018miR‐134).

PDCD7 also interacts with viral components, such as the polymerase acidic subunit of the H9N2 influenza virus, which can induce apoptosis in infected cells. This interaction highlights PDCD7's role in the cellular response to viral infections, although its specific function in healthy cells remains less clear (Wang2021Polymerase).

## Clinical Significance
PDCD7 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer, due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high expression levels of PDCD7 are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Patients with elevated PDCD7 expression have lower complete remission rates, higher relapse rates, and reduced overall survival. Multivariate analysis has identified high PDCD7 expression as an independent risk factor for both relapse-free survival and overall survival in AML patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Abo2019The).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), PDCD7 is targeted by miR-134, which reduces its expression and subsequently decreases E-cadherin levels, promoting cancer progression. This interaction highlights the miR-134-PDCD7-E-cad axis as a significant pathway in OSCC, where PDCD7 acts as a tumor suppressor by maintaining cell adhesion and inhibiting metastasis (Peng2018miR‐134).

PDCD7 also plays a role in viral pathogenesis. The polymerase acidic subunit of the H9N2 influenza virus binds to PDCD7, inducing apoptosis in host cells. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which influenza viruses may exploit PDCD7 to facilitate viral replication and spread (Wang2021Polymerase).

## Interactions
PDCD7, or programmed cell death 7, is known to participate in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes, particularly apoptosis. One significant interaction is with the polymerase acidic (PA) subunit of the H9N2 influenza virus. This interaction was identified through mass spectrometry and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating that PDCD7 binds directly to the PA subunit in A549 lung cells. This binding is not exclusive to the H9N2 virus, as a similar interaction occurs with the PA subunit of the H5N1 virus, suggesting a potential universal mechanism among different influenza viruses (Wang2021Polymerase).

The interaction between PDCD7 and the PA subunit leads to the upregulation of PDCD7 expression, which in turn induces apoptosis by increasing pro-apoptotic proteins like Bax and cleaved caspase-3, while decreasing the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. This apoptotic pathway is mediated by PDCD7, as its knockout via CRISPR/Cas9 reduces the apoptotic effects induced by PA overexpression (Wang2021Polymerase).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), PDCD7 expression is associated with specific genetic mutations, such as FLT3/ITD and NPM1, although direct protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Abo2019The).
