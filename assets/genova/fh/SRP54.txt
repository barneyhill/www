# SRP54

## Overview
The SRP54 gene encodes the signal recognition particle 54 (SRP54) protein, a critical component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex involved in the co-translational targeting of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotic cells. SRP54 is a GTPase that plays a pivotal role in recognizing and binding to the N-terminal signal sequences of nascent polypeptides, facilitating their proper localization to the ER membrane (Faoro2021Noncanonical; Juaire2021Structural). The protein is characterized by a multidomain structure, including the methionine-rich M domain and the NG domain, which are essential for its function in signal peptide recognition and GTP binding, respectively (Egea2008Structures; Juaire2021Structural). Mutations in the SRP54 gene have been linked to various human diseases, such as severe congenital neutropenia and idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein biogenesis (Kellogg2022Signal).

## Structure
The SRP54 protein is a key component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex, featuring a multidomain structure that includes the methionine-rich M domain and the NG domain, which consists of the N-terminal four-helix bundle and the GTPase domain (G domain) (Egea2008Structures; Juaire2021Structural). The M domain is responsible for recognizing signal peptides and binding to SRP RNA, while the NG domain is involved in GTP binding and hydrolysis, essential for forming the targeting complex (Egea2008Structures; Juaire2021Structural).

The crystal structure of the human SRP54M domain reveals a predominantly alpha-helical structure, with seven alpha helices forming a core stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges (Clemons1999Crystal). A deep, elongated hydrophobic groove formed by helices 2, 3, and 4 is suggested to be the site for signal peptide recognition (Clemons1999Crystal). The NG domain, when crystallized, forms a symmetric homodimer primarily through N domain interactions, with structural changes in the G2 and G4 elements upon nucleotide binding, which are crucial for GTPase activity (Juaire2021Structural).

The SRP54 protein's structure is conserved across different species, with variations in the M domain's conformation allowing it to recognize diverse signal sequences (Egea2008Structures). The flexibility of the M domain is important for its function, as it can adopt different conformations to accommodate various signal peptides (Egea2008Structures).

## Function
The SRP54 gene encodes a critical component of the signal recognition particle (SRP), which is essential for the co-translational targeting of secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotic cells. SRP54 recognizes and binds to the N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequences of nascent polypeptides as they emerge from the ribosome. This interaction is crucial for directing the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the ER membrane (Faoro2021Noncanonical; Juaire2021Structural).

At the ER membrane, SRP54 forms a quaternary complex with the SRP receptor, the ribosome-nascent chain complex, and the translocation channel (translocon). This complex facilitates the transfer of the nascent polypeptide chain to the translocon, where it undergoes membrane integration or translocation (Juaire2021Structural). The process is dependent on GTP binding and hydrolysis, with SRP54's GTPase activity playing a key role in the regulation of this targeting process (Römisch2006Human; Faoro2021Noncanonical).

SRP54's function is vital for maintaining protein biogenesis and cellular homeostasis. Disruptions in its function can lead to various human diseases, including severe congenital neutropenia and idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (Kellogg2022Signal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SRP54 gene are associated with several hematological disorders, most notably severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS)-like features. These conditions are characterized by a low neutrophil count, which increases susceptibility to infections (Oyarbide2018SRP54; TURAN2023A). SRP54 mutations lead to defects in the co-translational protein targeting pathway, affecting the synthesis and secretion of proteins crucial for normal cellular function (Weichenrieder2021Cellular; Juaire2021Structural).

Specific mutations, such as T115A, T117del, and G226E, disrupt the GTPase activity of SRP54, impairing its ability to form a stable complex with the SRP receptor, which is essential for protein translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum (Juaire2021Structural). These mutations can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, from mild neutropenia to severe cases requiring medical intervention (Goldberg2020Congenital).

The clinical phenotype of SRP54 mutations can vary significantly, with some mutations causing milder symptoms while others result in more severe conditions, including pancreatic insufficiency and neurodevelopmental defects (Carapito2017Mutations; Juaire2021Structural). The genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of SRP54 mutations underscores the complexity of their clinical significance (Goldberg2020Congenital).

## Interactions
SRP54 is a key component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex, which plays a crucial role in targeting proteins to cellular membranes. It interacts with SRP RNA and other proteins within the SRP complex. The SRP54 protein has a multi-domain structure, including an N-terminal domain, a central GTPase domain, and a methionine-rich C-terminal domain. The NG domain of SRP54 interacts with SRP RNA, forming direct protein-RNA contacts that are essential for its function (Hainzl2007Interaction). This interaction is facilitated by specific structural elements in the RNA, such as the GNRA tetranucleotide loop, which is crucial for the stability of RNA hairpins (Selinger1993Identification).

SRP54 also interacts with the SRP receptor (SR) in a GTP-dependent manner, which is essential for the transfer of the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the membrane's protein-translocating channel (Egea2008Structures). Mutations in the GTPase domain of SRP54 can significantly affect its GTP binding capability and its interaction with the SRP receptor, leading to impaired protein secretion and cell growth (Juaire2021Structural). Additionally, SRP54 can form a translocation complex with the SRP receptor SRa, although certain mutations can prevent the formation of a stable complex (Juaire2021Structural).
