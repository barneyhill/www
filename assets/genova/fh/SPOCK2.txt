# SPOCK2

## Overview
SPOCK2, also known as SPARC (osteonectin), cwcv and kazal like domains proteoglycan 2, is a gene that encodes a secreted proteoglycan involved in the organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell signaling. The protein product, testican-2, is characterized by its complex structure, which includes domains such as a follistatin-like domain, a calcium-binding domain, and a thyroglobulin type-1 domain. These structural features enable SPOCK2 to function as an extracellular proteoglycan, playing significant roles in cell adhesion, migration, and tissue remodeling. Notably, SPOCK2 acts as a decoy receptor, blocking the attachment and entry of pathogens like the influenza virus, thereby contributing to immune responses. Its expression is modulated by interferon, underscoring its role in antiviral defense mechanisms (Jiao2022Clinical; Ahn2019The). Additionally, SPOCK2 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neuropathic pain, where it influences cellular processes through interactions with matrix metalloproteinases and other signaling pathways (Wang2024SPOCK2; Ren2020SPOCK2).

## Structure
The SPOCK2 protein, also known as testican-2, is a secreted proteoglycan with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The core protein of SPOCK2 features a signal peptide at the amino terminal, a cysteine-rich domain homologous to the follistatin (FS) domain, an extracellular calcium-binding (EC) domain with an N-glycosylation site, thyroglobulin (TY) domains with a CWCV motif, and a carboxyl region with two glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding motifs (Ahn2019The). The protein is heavily glycosylated, with N-glycosylated moieties on the EC domain and heparan sulfate chains on the GAG domains (Ahn2019The). 

The molecular weight of the endogenous SPOCK2 core protein is approximately 55 kDa, but it shifts to 70 kDa when treated with PNase F, indicating the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides (Ahn2019The). The sialic acid moiety of SPOCK2 is crucial for its antiviral activity, as it inhibits influenza virus attachment to its receptors (Ahn2019The). The protein's structure allows it to function as a decoy receptor, competing with cell surface receptors for influenza virus binding (Ahn2019The).

## Function
SPOCK2, also known as testican-2, is a proteoglycan involved in the organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell signaling. It plays a significant role in cell adhesion, migration, and tissue remodeling. SPOCK2 is active in various cellular locations, including the extracellular space, where it influences processes such as neural development and immune response (Ahn2019The).

In healthy human cells, SPOCK2 is part of the SPOCK family of proteoglycans, which are known for their involvement in the ECM. The protein contains structural components such as a follistatin-like domain, a calcium-binding domain, and a thyroglobulin type-1 domain, which contribute to its function as an extracellular proteoglycan (Jiao2022Clinical). These domains are crucial for its role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration.

SPOCK2's molecular activities include acting as a decoy receptor, blocking the attachment and entry of pathogens like the influenza virus into host cells. This antiviral activity is attributed to its sialylated glycans and heparan sulfate chains, which prevent effective viral binding (Ahn2019The). The protein's expression is induced by interferon, highlighting its role in immune responses and its potential as a protective barrier against infections (Ahn2019The).

## Clinical Significance
SPOCK2 has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In endometrial cancer, the absence of SPOCK2 protein is significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and its absence is associated with distant metastases and myometrial invasion. Increasing SPOCK2 expression in endometrial cancer cells reduces proliferation, invasion, and promotes apoptosis, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Ren2020SPOCK2).

In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), SPOCK2 expression is upregulated and associated with shorter overall survival, indicating its potential as a diagnostic biomarker (Jiao2022Clinical). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), SPOCK2 is downregulated due to hypermethylation, and its reduced expression correlates with poorer prognosis. Treatment with demethylating agents can restore SPOCK2 expression, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Aghamaliyev2023SPOCK2).

SPOCK2 is also involved in neuropathic pain, where its increased expression in the spinal cord following injury is linked to pain pathogenesis. It interacts with MT1-MMP to regulate MMP-2 activation, influencing astrocytic activation and pain behaviors (Wang2024SPOCK2). In ER-negative breast cancer, SPOCK2 is upregulated in cases that metastasize to the brain, suggesting a role in tumor cell migration and metastasis (Pedrosa2021Differential).

## Interactions
SPOCK2, also known as SPARC (osteonectin), cwcv and kazal like domains proteoglycan 2, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In the context of neuropathic pain, SPOCK2 interacts with membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) to regulate the activation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in astrocytes. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, which are important in the development of neuropathic pain (Wang2024SPOCK2).

SPOCK2 also plays a role in inhibiting influenza virus infection by acting as a decoy receptor. It interacts with viral components through its heparan sulfate chains, which block viral attachment and entry into host cells. The sialic acid moiety of SPOCK2 is particularly important for its antiviral activity, although it can be cleaved by the neuraminidase protein of the influenza virus, allowing the virus to evade SPOCK2's protective effects (Ahn2019The).

In endometrial cancer cells, SPOCK2 influences cellular behavior by interacting with MT1-MMP and MMP-2, affecting cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis (Ren2020SPOCK2).
