# ZNF761

## Overview
ZNF761 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 761, a member of the KRAB zinc-finger protein (KZFP) family, which is the largest family of transcription factors in mammals. The protein is characterized by the presence of Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) and multiple Kruppel-type (C2H2) zinc finger domains, which facilitate its role as a transcriptional repressor. These domains enable the protein to bind specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing gene expression. ZNF761 is involved in early embryonic development and differentiation, with its expression being prominent in embryonic stem cells and decreasing in later developmental stages. The gene is part of a rapidly evolving family, with evidence of recent duplication events and potential functional divergence from its paralogs (Shen2021Conserved; Nowick2010Rapid).

## Structure
ZNF761 is a member of the KRAB-ZNF family of transcription factors, characterized by the presence of Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) and zinc finger (ZNF) domains. The protein structure includes multiple Kruppel-type (C2H2) zinc finger domains, each approximately 28-30 amino acids in length, which coordinate zinc ions to form a 'fingerlike' structure. These domains are crucial for binding specific nucleotides, with binding specificity determined by the amino acids at positions -1, 3, and 6 relative to the alpha helix (Nowick2013A).

The KRAB domain of ZNF761 interacts with KAP1, a co-repressor that recruits histone deacetylases and methyltransferases, leading to chromatin modification and transcriptional repression (Nowick2013A). ZNF761 has undergone recent duplication events, maintaining a significant portion of its sequence similarity with its duplicates, such as ZNF813, suggesting that it retains its functional structure (Nowick2010Rapid).

ZNF761 is also part of a cluster of zinc finger protein genes identified in the 3′-untranslated region, which are involved in adult heart development and bind adenosine triphosphate and ankyrin, indicating potential roles in broader functional categories like ion and metabolite binding (Chen2012Computational).

## Function
ZNF761 is a member of the KRAB zinc-finger protein (KZFP) family, which is the largest family of transcription factors in mammals. These proteins are characterized by a KRAB domain and a C-terminal C2H2 zinc finger array, which confer DNA-binding potential. ZNF761 is involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily acting as a transcriptional repressor by interacting with KAP1, a co-repressor that recruits histone deacetylases and methyltransferases to modify chromatin structure (Nowick2013A).

ZNF761 is expressed in early embryonic development and is implicated in the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). It is part of a gene module highly expressed during early development stages, suggesting its role in cell cycle processes crucial for development and differentiation (Shen2021Conserved). The expression of ZNF761 decreases in later stages of development, indicating its specific involvement in early embryonic processes (Shen2021Conserved).

ZNF761 is also expressed in reproductive organs, including the testes and placenta, although its specific function in these tissues is not detailed (Nowick2013A). The gene is part of a rapidly evolving family, with evidence suggesting potential functional divergence from its paralogs, such as ZNF813 (Nowick2010Rapid).
