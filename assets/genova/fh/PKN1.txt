# PKN1

## Overview
PKN1, or protein kinase N1, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in a wide array of cellular processes. The protein kinase N1 (PKN1) is characterized by its catalytic domain, which is typical of protein kinases, and a regulatory domain that includes a C2-like domain and an HR1 domain. These structural features facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling. PKN1 is implicated in processes such as adipocyte differentiation, glucose metabolism, inflammatory signaling, and lymphocyte trafficking. It acts as a negative regulator of certain inflammatory pathways and is essential for lymphocyte migration. PKN1's interactions with various proteins, including those involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and bacterial ubiquitin ligases, underscore its significance in both cellular homeostasis and host-pathogen interactions. Clinically, alterations in the PKN1 gene are associated with cardiac pathologies, cancer progression, and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in health and disease (Mashud2017Impaired; Kato2008Negative; Keszei2014Structure; Nedden2018Protein; Chang2018Exomewide; Marrocco2019PKC).

## Structure
PKN1 (protein kinase N1) is a serine/threonine kinase characterized by a catalytic domain typical of protein kinases, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein also contains a regulatory domain with a C2-like domain and an HR1 domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions. The HR1 domain is composed of three antiparallel coiled-coil subdomains: HR1a, HR1b, and HR1c. Among these, the HR1b subdomain is identified as both necessary and sufficient for high-affinity interaction with other proteins, such as the bacterial E3 ubiquitin ligase SspH1 (Keszei2014Structure).

The interaction between PKN1 and SspH1 is mediated by the HR1b subdomain, which forms a single coiled coil. This interaction involves hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions, with specific residues such as Arg181 and Arg185 on PKN1 playing a critical role (Keszei2014Structure). PKN1 undergoes post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, which can affect its function. Additionally, PKN1 has splice variant isoforms that may influence its activity and interactions within the cell. The structural insights into PKN1, particularly its interaction with SspH1, highlight its role in cellular signaling and regulation (Keszei2014Structure).

## Function
Protein kinase N1 (PKN1) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including adipocyte differentiation, glucose metabolism, inflammatory signaling, and lymphocyte trafficking. In adipocytes, PKN1 is crucial for the initiation of adipogenesis by regulating the expression of PPARγ, a key transcription factor for adipocyte differentiation. PKN1 also plays a role in insulin-mediated glucose uptake by influencing the phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6kinase, which are components of the insulin signaling pathway (HerreríasGonzález2023PKN1).

PKN1 acts as a negative regulator of the IKK/NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways, which are involved in inflammatory responses. It achieves this by phosphorylating TRAF1, modulating its interaction with TRAF2, and maintaining low basal activity of these pathways, thus contributing to cellular homeostasis and preventing chronic inflammation (Kato2008Negative).

In the context of lymphocyte trafficking, PKN1 is essential for proper lymphocyte migration and egress from secondary lymphoid organs. Its kinase activity is crucial for responding to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid ligand important for lymphocyte movement (Mashud2017Impaired).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PKN1 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In cardiac pathologies, deregulation of PKN1 is associated with conditions such as atrial fibrosis, hibernating myocardium, and dilated cardiomyopathy. PKN1 acts as a cardiomyocyte survival factor after ischemia/reperfusion injury, and its loss can lead to larger infarcts following myocardial infarction, indicating a cardioprotective role (Marrocco2019PKC). 

In cancer, particularly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the rs34309238 variant in PKN1 is linked to increased cancer risk. This variant enhances PKN1 phosphorylation, activating the FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which promotes cancer cell proliferation (Chang2018Exomewide). PKN1 is also involved in the metastatic behavior of androgen-independent prostate cancer and can modulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in melanoma cells, affecting cancer progression (Zeng2020Cyclindependent; James2013Protein).

In the nervous system, PKN1 is crucial for cerebellar development. Knockout studies in mice show that loss of PKN1 leads to cerebellar shrinkage and motor coordination problems, suggesting its role in preventing cerebellar ataxia (Nedden2018Protein). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PKN1 in various diseases through its impact on cellular signaling pathways.

## Interactions
PKN1 (protein kinase N1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It forms a complex with the WNT3A receptor Frizzled 7 (FZD7) and Dishevelled 2 (DVL2) at the plasma membrane, playing a role in the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in melanoma cells (James2013Protein). PKN1 also interacts with the co-receptor LRP6, promoting its internalization and thereby inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling (James2013Protein).

PKN1 is known to interact with AKT, a key player in the Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway. The phosphorylation of PKN1 at the S374 site is crucial for its interaction with AKT, as demonstrated by reduced co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization when a mutant form of PKN1 (S374A) is used (zur2023PKN1).

In the context of bacterial interactions, PKN1 is a substrate for the Salmonella E3 ubiquitin ligase SspH1. The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of SspH1 specifically binds to the HR1b fragment of PKN1, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome (Keszei2014Structure). This interaction highlights PKN1's role in host-pathogen interactions and its potential impact on cellular signaling pathways.
