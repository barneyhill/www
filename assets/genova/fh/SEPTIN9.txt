# SEPTIN9

## Overview
SEPTIN9 is a gene that encodes the protein septin 9, a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins. Septin 9 is involved in a variety of cellular processes, primarily through its role in cytoskeletal organization. It participates in the formation of non-polar rod-like hetero-oligomers and higher-order polymeric structures, which are crucial for maintaining cytoskeletal stability and dynamics. The protein interacts with actin filaments and microtubules, influencing cellular functions such as migration, polarity, and cytokinesis. Septin 9 is also known for its affinity for lipid membranes, which aids in the assembly of septin structures. The gene is expressed in multiple isoforms, each contributing to its diverse functional roles in cellular processes. SEPTIN9 has significant clinical relevance, particularly in cancer, where it is implicated in tumor growth, drug resistance, and as a biomarker for early detection (Ivanov2021Novel; Montagna2015Mammalian; Marcus2019Septin).

## Structure
SEPTIN9 is a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins, characterized by a conserved GTPase domain and variable N- and C-terminal regions (Kuzmić2022Septinmicrotubule). The primary structure of SEPTIN9 includes a GTP-binding domain, which is crucial for its function in cytoskeletal organization (Fischer2022Biochemical). The secondary structure features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its ability to form complex structures (Iv2021Insights).

In terms of tertiary structure, SEPTIN9 folds into a functional protein that can interact with other septins to form hetero-oligomeric complexes, a key aspect of its quaternary structure (Iv2021Insights). These complexes often include other septins such as SEPT2, SEPT6, and SEPT7, forming octameric rods that are essential for higher-order filament assembly (Fischer2022Biochemical).

SEPTIN9 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may influence its interactions and functions (Iv2021Insights). The protein exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, each with distinct N-terminal extensions that contribute to its diverse roles in cellular processes, such as cytokinesis and cancer cell migration (Iv2021Insights). These isoforms can affect SEPTIN9's interaction with actin filaments and microtubules, highlighting its functional versatility (Kuzmić2022Septinmicrotubule).

## Function
SEPTIN9, a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is involved in the assembly of non-polar rod-like hetero-oligomers and higher-order polymeric structures, which are essential for maintaining the stability and dynamics of the cytoskeleton. SEPTIN9 interacts with actin filaments and microtubules, cross-linking actin into long curved bundles and suppressing F-actin disassembly. The SEPT9_i1 splice isoform directly binds to β-tubulin, inducing microtubule bundling, which is vital for cellular functions such as migration and polarity (Ivanov2021Novel).

SEPTIN9 is also a key component in the formation of septin filaments, which are involved in processes like cytokinesis, exocytosis, and synaptic vesicle dynamics. It occupies a terminal position in the native octameric complex, crucial for subunit polymerization and higher-order structure formation. The removal of the SEPT9 N-terminal domain disrupts these structures, leading to cytokinesis failure (Montagna2015Mammalian).

In addition to its structural roles, SEPTIN9 has a high affinity for lipid membranes, influencing membrane organization and aiding in the assembly of septin structures (Ivanov2021Novel). Its interactions and functions underscore its importance in the structural organization and regulation of cytoskeletal elements.

## Clinical Significance
SEPTIN9 is implicated in various cancers, including breast and colorectal cancer, due to its role in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In breast cancer, SEPTIN9 is frequently amplified, with about 20-30% of cases showing genomic amplification and protein overexpression, which correlates with poor prognosis and resistance to microtubule-targeting agents (Marcus2019Septin; Devlin2021Proteomic). SEPTIN9 isoforms, such as SEPT9_v1, promote tumor growth by stabilizing HIF-1α, while others like SEPT9_v4 increase drug resistance (Marcus2019Septin). 

In colorectal cancer, methylated SEPTIN9 (mSEPT9) serves as a biomarker for early detection, with plasma tests distinguishing cancer patients from non-cancer individuals (Connolly2011Septin). mSEPT9 levels correlate with advanced TNM stages and are associated with mutations in genes like BRAF and PIK3CA, affecting cancer-specific survival and time to recurrence (Sun2021Screening).

SEPTIN9 mutations, particularly in the N-terminal domain, are prevalent in intestinal, skin, stomach, and endometrial cancers. These mutations affect interactions with microtubules and proteins like HIF1α, contributing to cancer progression (Angelis2016Septin). SEPTIN9's role in cancer is further complicated by its involvement in chromosomal translocations and genomic instability (Angelis2016Septin).

## Interactions
SEPTIN9, a member of the septin family, participates in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It forms heteromeric complexes with other septins, such as SEPT2, SEPT7, and SEPT8, which are common interactors across its isoforms (Devlin2021Proteomic). SEPT9 also interacts with proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization, such as filamin A (FLNA) and SH3-domain kinase binding protein 1 (SH3KBP1), playing a role in vesicle transport and cell division (Neubauer2017The; Desterke2019Proteinprotein).

SEPT9 isoforms exhibit isoform-specific interactions. For instance, SEPT9_i1 is enriched in cytoskeletal regulators and microtubule-associated proteins, while SEPT9_i4 is more involved in cell signaling, interacting with proteins like AKAP13 and CREBBP (Devlin2021Proteomic). SEPT9_i5 shows a diverse range of partners involved in mRNA splicing and mitophagy (Devlin2021Proteomic).

SEPT9 also interacts with the kinesin motor protein KIF17, affecting the transport of cargo proteins like NR2B in neurons. This interaction is selective and may regulate cargo loading or unloading by interacting with the C-terminal tail of KIF17 (Bai2016Septin). These interactions highlight SEPTIN9's role in cellular organization and transport mechanisms.
