# METTL24

## Overview
The METTL24 gene encodes the protein methyltransferase-like 24, which is part of the methyltransferase enzyme family. These enzymes are responsible for catalyzing the transfer of methyl groups to various substrates, a process crucial for regulating gene expression and protein function. METTL24 has been identified as playing a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. The protein is involved in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment and has been associated with the progression and prognosis of certain cancers, such as kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Its expression levels and interactions with immune cells suggest a potential tumor-suppressive function, making it a subject of interest for further research into cancer therapeutics and prognostics (Jiang2022A; Zhang2021Identification; Zhang2024METTL).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The METTL24 gene has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), METTL24 is significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with advanced tumor stage and grade, and lower METTL24 expression correlates with shorter overall survival, progression-free survival, and disease-specific survival. METTL24 is considered an independent prognostic marker for KIRC, and its expression level is used in a nomogram to predict patient outcomes (Jiang2022A; Zhang2024METTL).

METTL24 also plays a role in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment in KIRC. Its expression is positively correlated with the infiltration of immune cells such as CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and neutrophils, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role. Alterations in METTL24 expression may influence immune cell infiltration and patient prognosis (Jiang2022A; Zhang2024METTL).

In neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), METTL24 is among the genes with a higher prevalence in samples with a high NEPC signature score, indicating its potential involvement in this cancer type (Zhang2021Identification). However, specific clinical significance of METTL24 gene mutations remains less clear.
