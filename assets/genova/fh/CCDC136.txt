# CCDC136

## Overview
CCDC136 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain-containing protein 136, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to maintaining cellular architecture. CCDC136 is expressed predominantly in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cortex and cerebellum, indicating its potential involvement in neurological functions (Adams2017Enrichment). The protein is implicated in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, acting as a negative regulator by enhancing the interaction between adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and β-catenin, thus promoting β-catenin degradation (Wei2016The). Additionally, CCDC136 is associated with acrosome formation in spermatids, highlighting its role in reproductive biology (Geng2016A). Clinically, CCDC136 is considered a potential tumor suppressor, with its expression being downregulated in certain cancers, and it has been linked to conditions such as male infertility and reading disabilities (Xie2019An; Gialluisi2014Genome‐wide).

## Function
CCDC136 encodes a coiled-coil domain-containing protein that is involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, CCDC136 is expressed in the brain, particularly in the cortex and cerebellum, suggesting a role in neurological functions (Adams2017Enrichment). The protein is believed to participate in maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for cell function and organismal development. The coiled-coil domains in CCDC136 are indicative of its potential involvement in structural support and intracellular transport (Wei2016The).

CCDC136 has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor, with its expression being downregulated in certain cancers, such as gastric carcinoma (Gialluisi2014Genome‐wide). This suggests that CCDC136 may play a role in regulating cell growth and preventing tumorigenesis. The gene's expression patterns and its proximity to other genes involved in cytoskeleton remodeling imply a possible role in cell motility and migration (Gialluisi2014Genome‐wide).

In zebrafish, a homolog of CCDC136, known as Ccdc136b, has been shown to regulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for embryonic development and cellular processes (Wei2016The). This regulatory function may also be relevant in human cells, contributing to the gene's role in development and disease prevention.

## Clinical Significance
CCDC136 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in cellular processes and gene regulation. In the context of male fertility, CCDC136 is crucial for acrosome formation during spermatogenesis. Mice deficient in CCDC136 exhibit infertility due to malformed acrosomes, which are essential for fertilization. This suggests that mutations or disruptions in CCDC136 could contribute to male infertility in humans (Geng2016A).

In cancer research, CCDC136 is identified as a putative tumor suppressor. It is commonly deleted in various cancers, including gastric tumors and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The gene negatively regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is associated with cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Alterations in CCDC136 expression have been linked to improved prognosis in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy, as its upregulation is associated with decreased angiogenesis and lower recurrence rates (Xie2019An).

CCDC136 is also associated with reading disabilities. Studies have found an enrichment of rare, potentially damaging variants in the CCDC136 region in individuals with reading disabilities, suggesting a genetic link to these conditions (Adams2017Enrichment). The gene's expression in the brain further supports its potential involvement in neurobiological processes related to reading and language skills (Gialluisi2014Genome‐wide).

## Interactions
The human gene CCDC136 encodes a protein that participates in significant protein-protein interactions, particularly through its coiled-coil domains. CCDC136 has been identified as interacting with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein. This interaction is crucial because APC is a key component of the destruction complex that regulates β-catenin levels in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. CCDC136 enhances the binding affinity between APC and β-catenin, promoting the degradation of β-catenin and acting as a negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This regulation is important for maintaining the cytoplasmic stability and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, which is a critical factor in cellular signaling and development (Wei2016The).

In addition to its role in signaling pathways, CCDC136 is also involved in acrosome formation in spermatids. It colocalizes with SP-56, an acrosome-specific marker, suggesting a physical interaction with components of the acrosome. This interaction is essential for proper acrosome development and function, which are critical for successful fertilization (Geng2016A). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of CCDC136 in cellular processes and development.
