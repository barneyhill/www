# LAP3

## Overview
Leucine aminopeptidase 3 (LAP3) is a gene that encodes the enzyme leucine aminopeptidase 3, a zinc-dependent aminopeptidase involved in protein processing and metabolism. This enzyme plays a critical role in the hydrolysis of leucine residues from the amino termini of peptides and proteins, contributing to protein maturation, degradation, and regulation within the cell. LAP3 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including muscle, liver, and kidney, and is primarily active in the cytoplasm. It is involved in essential cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and maintenance, impacting pathways related to cell cycle progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The enzyme's activity is significant in both physiological and pathological contexts, influencing muscle development and cancer progression, and it has potential implications as a molecular marker in livestock breeding and as a biomarker in diseases such as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, glioma, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (He2015LAP3; Feng2022Cholesterolinduced).

## Function
Leucine aminopeptidase 3 (LAP3) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein processing and metabolism by catalyzing the hydrolysis of leucine residues from the amino termini of protein or peptide substrates. This activity is essential for protein maturation, degradation, and regulation, contributing to cellular protein homeostasis. LAP3 is a zinc-containing enzyme found in various tissues, including muscle, liver, and kidney, and is active in the cytoplasm (He2015LAP3).

In healthy human cells, LAP3 is involved in maintaining cell maintenance by degrading peptides or interacting with peptide-dependent signaling and DNA. Its enzymatic function is critical for regulating cell growth and differentiation, impacting processes such as cell cycle progression and cell adhesion. LAP3 affects the expression of proteins involved in these processes, including CDK2, cyclin D2, β-catenin, N-cadherin, and E-cadherin, which are crucial for cell cycle regulation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (He2015LAP3).

The enzyme's activity is significant in various physiological contexts, influencing muscle development and potentially serving as a molecular marker for breeding and meat production in livestock, as seen in studies on sheep embryonic myoblasts (Ge2022New).

## Clinical Significance
LAP3 (leucine aminopeptidase 3) has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), LAP3 is frequently overexpressed, which is associated with poor prognosis and shorter overall survival. This overexpression promotes tumorigenic functions such as cell growth, proliferation, and migration, and is linked to chemoresistance, as its downregulation enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy (Zhang2014Overexpression). In glioma, LAP3 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal brain tissues, correlating with increased malignancy and poor prognosis. It affects cell cycle progression and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, contributing to tumor proliferation and invasion (He2015LAP3).

In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), LAP3 is upregulated in response to cholesterol, inhibiting autophagy, a process crucial for liver homeostasis. This upregulation is observed in both hepatocytes and serum of NAFLD patients, suggesting LAP3 as a potential biomarker for the disease (Feng2022Cholesterolinduced). In multiple myeloma, LAP3 is highly expressed and involved in drug processing, impacting treatment efficacy and disease progression (Miettinen2021Aminopeptidase).

## Interactions
Leucine aminopeptidase 3 (LAP3) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as migration, invasion, and metastasis in cancer cells. In breast cancer, LAP3 overexpression promotes the expression of fascin and matrix metalloproteinases-2/9 (MMP-2/9), which are crucial for cell motility and extracellular matrix degradation, respectively. This process is mediated through the p38-Hsp27-NF-κB and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, where LAP3 modulates the phosphorylation of Hsp27 and p65, affecting fascin expression (Fang2018Leucine).

LAP3 also interacts with vimentin, a protein associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer cells. This interaction is facilitated through the MEK/Erk1/2 signaling pathway, which enhances the expression of vimentin, MMP-2/9, and fascin, thereby promoting cancer cell migration and invasion (Wang2020Vimentin).

In glioma, LAP3 influences cell cycle regulation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by affecting the expression of proteins such as CDK2, cyclin D2, β-catenin, N-cadherin, and E-cadherin, which are involved in cell proliferation and adhesion (He2015LAP3). These interactions highlight LAP3's role in cancer progression through its involvement in key signaling pathways and protein networks.
