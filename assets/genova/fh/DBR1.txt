# DBR1

## Overview
The DBR1 gene encodes the enzyme debranching RNA lariats 1, a member of the metallophosphoesterase superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in RNA processing within eukaryotic cells. This enzyme is primarily responsible for cleaving the 2'-5' phosphodiester bonds at the branch point of lariat introns, converting them into linear RNA molecules, a critical step in RNA splicing and turnover (Mohanta2021Dbr1; Kataoka2013hDbr1). The DBR1 protein is characterized by a conserved GNHE motif essential for its enzymatic activity, and it functions as a monomer with a molecular weight of approximately 42 kDa (Montemayor2014Structural; Kataoka2013hDbr1). Its activity is crucial for maintaining RNA homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of lariat introns, which can interfere with normal splicing processes (Mohanta2021Dbr1). DBR1's function is vital for cell viability and has implications in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, due to its role in RNA metabolism and homeostasis (Mohanta2021Dbr1; Han2017Human).

## Structure
The human DBR1 protein, encoded by the DBR1 gene, is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling enzyme involved in RNA processing. The primary structure of DBR1 includes a conserved GNHE motif, characteristic of the metallophosphoesterase superfamily, which is crucial for its debranching activity (Kataoka2013hDbr1). This motif binds metal ions, and mutations in the asparagine or histidine residues within this motif abolish the protein's phosphatase activity (Kataoka2013hDbr1).

The secondary structure of DBR1 is not explicitly detailed in the provided context, but the protein is known to contain a bipartite nuclear localization signal near its carboxyl terminus, which is essential for its nuclear localization (Kataoka2013hDbr1). The tertiary structure includes an N-terminal domain belonging to the metallophosphoesterase (MPE) superfamily and a C-terminal domain with no detectable sequence similarity to other proteins (Montemayor2014Structural).

DBR1 functions as a monomer in solution, with a molecular weight of approximately 42 kDa (Montemayor2014Structural). The protein's quaternary structure is not described in the context, indicating it may not form multimeric complexes. The enzyme's activity is selective for 2',5'-phosphodiester linkages, and it lacks activity toward the more common 3',5'-phosphodiester linkages (Montemayor2014Structural).

## Function
The DBR1 gene encodes the RNA lariat debranching enzyme Dbr1, which plays a crucial role in RNA processing in eukaryotic cells. Dbr1 is responsible for cleaving the 2'-5' phosphodiester linkage at the intronic branch point sequence, converting lariat introns into linear molecules. This process is essential for maintaining RNA homeostasis and is highly conserved across species, including humans (Mohanta2021Dbr1). In healthy human cells, DBR1 modulates the recycling of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential for RNA splicing. It facilitates the transition of snRNPs from the post-catalytic splicing state back to the pre-catalytic state, enabling the assembly of new, active splicing complexes (Han2017Human).

DBR1 is also involved in the turnover of introns, preventing the accumulation of lariat introns that can sequester snRNPs and disrupt normal splicing. This function ensures that splicing complexes are available to process pre-mRNAs efficiently, maintaining normal gene expression and cellular function (Mohanta2021Dbr1). The enzyme is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, contributing to RNA metabolism and homeostasis in healthy human cells (Mohanta2021Dbr1). Proper DBR1 function is crucial for cell viability and has implications in preventing diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Mohanta2021Dbr1; Han2017Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DBR1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions due to its role in RNA processing. Bi-allelic mutations in DBR1, such as L13G, Y17H, I120T, and R197X, have been linked to brainstem viral encephalitis. These mutations impair cell-intrinsic immunity, leading to increased susceptibility to viral infections like herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), influenza virus, and norovirus, particularly affecting the brainstem (Zhang2018Inborn). DBR1 mutations result in the accumulation of RNA lariats, which disrupts normal RNA metabolism and increases viral replication rates, contributing to the pathogenesis of viral encephalitis (Zhang2018Inborn).

Alterations in DBR1 expression levels are also implicated in cancer development. Reduced expression of DBR1 affects RNA splicing, leading to increased exon skipping and the accumulation of oncogenic RNA variants. This is associated with increased tumorigenicity and reduced apoptotic activity, particularly in cancers with p53 mutations (Han2017Human). DBR1 expression is generally lower in malignant tissues compared to non-malignant tissues, suggesting its role in tumor suppression (Han2017Human). Additionally, DBR1 is involved in the replication of retroviruses, such as HIV-1, where its inhibition can reduce viral replication, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Mohanta2021Dbr1).

## Interactions
The DBR1 protein interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing. It is involved in the debranching of lariat introns, a crucial step in RNA splicing. DBR1 interacts with spliceosomal factors, particularly within the C complex of the spliceosome, which contains the intron intermediate. These interactions include members of the U5, U2, NTC, and NTR spliceosomal sub-complexes, as well as Cwf19L, the human homolog of yeast Drn1 (Buerer2023The).

DBR1 also interacts with the AQR protein, part of the intron binding complex (IBC), which is suggested to recruit DBR1 to specific lariats for debranching. This interaction may be mediated by nucleic acids, as indicated by co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (Buerer2023The). Additionally, DBR1 interacts with Xab2, a protein involved in transcription-coupled DNA repair and pre-mRNA splicing, although the functional consequences of this interaction are not fully understood (Mohanta2021Dbr1).

The structural basis for DBR1's interaction with lariat RNA involves several conserved residues and structural elements, such as the lariat recognition loop (LRL) and the C-terminal domain (CTD), which are crucial for recognizing and processing lariat RNA structures (Montemayor2014Structural).
