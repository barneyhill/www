# SLC34A2

## Overview
The SLC34A2 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 34 member 2, commonly referred to as NaPi-IIb, which is a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter. This protein is primarily expressed in the lungs, small intestine, and salivary glands, where it plays a crucial role in phosphate homeostasis by facilitating the transport of phosphate ions across cell membranes. NaPi-IIb is characterized by its multiple transmembrane domains, which are essential for its function as a transporter (Forster2013Phosphate; Wagner2013The). The protein's activity is vital for processes such as dietary phosphate absorption in the intestine and surfactant production in the lungs (Marks2018The; Jönsson2022Impaired). Mutations in the SLC34A2 gene are linked to pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis, a rare lung disorder, and its expression levels have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Corut2006Mutations; Zhang2017High).

## Structure
The SLC34A2 gene encodes a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter protein, known as NaPi-IIb, which is primarily expressed in the lungs and small intestine. The protein consists of 689 amino acids and is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains, facilitating the transport of phosphate ions across cell membranes (Forster2013Phosphate; Wagner2013The). The secondary structure of SLC34A2 includes 12 transmembrane domains, with the C-terminal region playing a significant role in targeting, hormonal regulation, and protein-protein interactions (Forster2013Phosphate). 

The protein's structure is further defined by an inverted repeat motif conserved among SLC34 isoforms, which is crucial for the transport pathway (Wagner2013The). Although the complete 3D structure of the protein is not available, computational predictions have been used to model the wild-type and mutant forms of the protein, providing insights into functional changes caused by mutations (Wang2014SLC34A2). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are important for the protein's stability and function (Wagner2013The). The protein may exist as monomers or dimers, although it is assumed to function primarily as a monomer (Forster2013Phosphate).

## Function
The SLC34A2 gene encodes the NaPi-IIb protein, a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter crucial for maintaining phosphate homeostasis in the body. This protein is primarily expressed in the small intestine, lungs, and salivary glands. In the small intestine, NaPi-IIb is localized to the brush border membrane of enterocytes, where it facilitates the active transport of phosphate ions, particularly in the mid-upper regions of the villi. This process is essential for dietary phosphate absorption and is influenced by luminal phosphate concentrations (Marks2018The; Hernando2015Intestinal).

In the lungs, NaPi-IIb is expressed in the apical membrane of alveolar type II cells, playing a significant role in regulating phosphate levels in the fluid lining the alveolar space, which is crucial for surfactant production (Jönsson2022Impaired). The protein uses the sodium electrochemical gradient to mediate the transport of divalent phosphate ions against their concentration gradient, with a transport stoichiometry of 3:1 (Na+:HPO4 2-), resulting in one net positive charge per transport cycle (Jönsson2022Impaired).

NaPi-IIb is also present in the salivary glands, where it is involved in phosphate secretion and reabsorption (Marks2018The). Its expression and function are linked to the maturation of enterocytes and the development of the electrochemical gradient necessary for phosphate absorption (Marks2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC34A2 gene are primarily associated with pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis (PAM), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of calcium phosphate microliths in the alveolar spaces of the lungs. These mutations lead to a loss of function in the type IIb sodium-phosphate cotransporter, disrupting phosphate homeostasis and resulting in microlith formation (Corut2006Mutations; Huqun2007Mutations). The disease is fully penetrant and is not influenced by environmental factors (Corut2006Mutations).

Alterations in SLC34A2 expression have also been implicated in various cancers. In lung adenocarcinoma, a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, SLC34A2 expression levels vary and have been linked to different clinical outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhang2017High). In bladder cancer, SLC34A2 is significantly upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, larger tumor size, and advanced tumor stage. Its overexpression promotes tumor growth by upregulating the oncogene c-Myc, while its depletion suppresses tumor growth (Ye2017Overexpression). These findings indicate that SLC34A2 may serve as a therapeutic target in certain cancers.

## Interactions
SLC34A2, a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter, participates in various interactions with other proteins that influence its function and regulation. In the context of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis in dairy cows, SLC34A2 interacts with proteins such as heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), and specific protein 1 (SP1), which are involved in ion metabolism and transport (Wang2024SLC34A2). It also interacts with protein kinase C beta type (PRKCB) and ferritin light chain (FTL), playing a role in homeostatic processes (Wang2024SLC34A2).

In the small intestine, SLC34A2, encoded by the NaPi-IIb gene, interacts with NHERF1, a protein coexpressed in intestinal epithelia, which is involved in the dietary regulation of NaPi-IIb (Wagner2013The). Myosin VI is also implicated in the membrane retrieval of NaPi-IIb, affecting its downregulation (Wagner2013The).

In colorectal cancer, SLC34A2 is involved in a signaling pathway where it positively regulates HIF-1 DNA binding activity, leading to increased expression of EZH2, a gene associated with cancer progression. This interaction is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which stabilize HIF-1α, facilitating its binding to the EZH2 promoter (Li2019The).
