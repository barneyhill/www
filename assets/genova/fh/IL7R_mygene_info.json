The function of this receptor requires the interleukin 2 receptor, gamma chain (IL2RG), which is a common gamma chain shared by the receptors of various cytokines, including interleukins 2, 4, 7, 9, and 15. This protein has been shown to play a critical role in V(D)J recombination during lymphocyte development. Defects in this gene may be associated with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found.
