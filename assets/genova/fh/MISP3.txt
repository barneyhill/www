# MISP3

## Overview
MISP3, or Mitotic Spindle Positioning 3, is a gene that encodes the protein MISP family member 3, which is involved in cellular processes related to the mitotic spindle. The MISP3 protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein, playing a crucial role in the regulation of spindle orientation and positioning during cell division. This protein is essential for ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and maintaining genomic stability. Dysregulation of MISP3 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, due to its role in cell cycle progression and mitotic fidelity (Qiu2020aarFDC).
