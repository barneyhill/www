# ECSCR

## Overview
The ECSCR gene encodes a transmembrane protein known as the endothelial cell surface expressed chemotaxis and apoptosis regulator. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of endothelial cell functions, including insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. It plays a crucial role in various signaling pathways, such as the Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) pathway, which is vital for insulin delivery into skeletal muscle. ECSCR is highly expressed in adipose tissues and is implicated in energy metabolism, influencing processes like lipolysis and angiogenesis. The protein's interactions, particularly with PTEN, highlight its significance in modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is essential for maintaining metabolic balance and vascular health. Alterations in ECSCR expression have been associated with cardiovascular disorders, underscoring its potential impact on endothelial dysfunction and related diseases (Bhasin2010Bioinformatic; Kilari2015Endothelial; Akakabe2013Ecscr).

## Function
The ECSCR gene encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in regulating endothelial cell functions, particularly in modulating insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. ECSCR is highly expressed in white and brown adipose tissues and is involved in energy metabolism. It influences endothelial cell signaling pathways, notably the Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) pathway, which is crucial for insulin delivery into skeletal muscle (Akakabe2013Ecscr).

In white adipocytes, ECSCR is involved in the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway, which is essential for insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis. ECSCR interacts with PTEN, a lipid phosphatase that negatively regulates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, enhancing insulin-PI3K-AKT suppression of lipolysis. This interaction is sensitive to insulin, suggesting ECSCR's role in regulating lipid metabolism and energy balance (Kilari2015Endothelial).

ECSCR also affects adipose tissue angiogenesis, which is important for maintaining proper vascularization and preventing obesity-related metabolic disorders. The deletion of ECSCR in mice has been shown to improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, protect against diet-induced obesity, and enhance adipose tissue angiogenesis, indicating its potential therapeutic implications for metabolic syndrome and type-2 diabetes (Akakabe2013Ecscr).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ECSCR gene, which is restricted to endothelial cells, have been associated with various cardiovascular disorders. ECSCR is highly expressed in vascular tissues, particularly in the umbilical cord, and its expression patterns suggest a potential role in conditions such as hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases (Bhasin2010Bioinformatic). The gene's involvement in endothelial cell function implies that changes in its expression or function could contribute to endothelial dysfunction, a key factor in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (Bhasin2010Bioinformatic).

While specific diseases directly linked to ECSCR mutations are not detailed, the gene's role in endothelial cell biology suggests it may influence vascular health and disease. The study by Bhasin et al. indicates that endothelial cell-restricted genes, including ECSCR, are significantly enriched in cardiovascular diseases such as ventricular dysfunction, myocardial infarction, and hypertension (Bhasin2010Bioinformatic). This suggests that ECSCR may play a role in the pathogenesis of these conditions through its impact on endothelial cell function and vascular remodeling. The gene's expression and regulation are also influenced by transcription factors and microRNAs, which may further affect its role in disease processes (Bhasin2010Bioinformatic).

## Interactions
ECSCR, or endothelial cell surface expressed chemotaxis and apoptosis regulator, is known to interact with the PTEN protein, a lipid phosphatase involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This interaction is significant in the regulation of lipolysis in white adipocytes. ECSCR can immunoprecipitate PTEN, and this interaction is enhanced by insulin stimulation, suggesting a role in insulin-mediated signaling. The formation of the ECSCR-PTEN complex is sensitive to the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, as demonstrated by the inhibition of complex formation by the PI3 Kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Kilari2015Endothelial).

ECSCR also plays a role in modulating endothelial cell functions, where it interacts with PTEN to regulate insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. This interaction enhances the membrane localization of PTEN, leading to the negative regulation of PI3K/Akt signaling in endothelial cells, which is crucial for angiogenesis and the regulation of insulin sensitivity (Akakabe2013Ecscr).

These interactions highlight ECSCR's involvement in critical cellular processes, including lipolysis regulation and insulin signaling, through its association with PTEN and modulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
