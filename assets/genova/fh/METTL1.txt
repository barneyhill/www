# METTL1

## Overview
METTL1 is a gene that encodes the protein methyltransferase 1, tRNA methylguanosine, which is a member of the methyltransferase enzyme family. This protein is primarily involved in the methylation of tRNA, specifically catalyzing the N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification at position 46 of the tRNA variable loop. The m7G modification is crucial for the stability and function of tRNA, impacting translation efficiency and fidelity (Lin2018Mettl1/Wdr4-Mediated). METTL1 forms a functional complex with the protein WDR4, which is essential for its methyltransferase activity (Jin2023Structural). The activity of METTL1 is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can modulate its role in cellular signaling pathways (Cartlidge2005The). Alterations in METTL1 expression have been linked to various cancers, where it plays a role in oncogenic transformation and tumor progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Orellana2021METTL1-mediated).

## Structure
The METTL1 protein is a methyltransferase involved in the methylation of tRNA, specifically responsible for the m7G modification at position 46 of the tRNA variable loop (Jin2023Structural). The primary structure of METTL1 consists of 276 amino acids (Bahr1999Molecular). The protein adopts a typical SAM-dependent Class I methyltransferase fold, characterized by seven conserved β-strands and six α-helices, which are part of its secondary structure (Jin2023Structural). 

The tertiary structure of METTL1 includes a Rossmann fold, a common feature in methyltransferases, which facilitates the binding of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (Jin2023Structural). METTL1 forms a quaternary structure by interacting with WDR4, creating a complex essential for its methyltransferase activity (Jin2023Structural). 

Post-translational modifications of METTL1 include phosphorylation at Ser27, which inactivates its tRNA methylase activity. This phosphorylation is mediated by PKB and RSK2 and can be reversed by dephosphorylation (Cartlidge2005The). METTL1 also exhibits alternative splicing, resulting in at least three different transcripts, though the biological significance of these variants is not fully understood (Bahr1999Molecular).

## Function
METTL1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the methylation of RNA, specifically catalyzing the N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification in tRNA. This modification is crucial for the stability and function of tRNA, affecting translation efficiency and fidelity (Lin2018Mettl1/Wdr4-Mediated). METTL1, in conjunction with its co-factor WDR4, forms a methyltransferase complex responsible for m7G tRNA modifications, which are essential for the efficient translation of mRNAs involved in cell cycle progression and brain development (Lin2018Mettl1/Wdr4-Mediated).

In human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), METTL1-mediated m7G methylation plays a significant role in maintaining pluripotency and regulating differentiation. Knockdown of METTL1 leads to changes in the global m7G profile, reduced translational efficiency of stem cell marker genes, and decreased pluripotency (Deng2020METTL1mediated). METTL1 also influences the processing of microRNAs, such as let-7, by promoting their maturation through m7G methylation, which is crucial for gene expression regulation (Pandolfini2019METTL1).

METTL1 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences cell growth and differentiation. Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which can inactivate its function, thereby modulating its role in cellular signaling pathways (Cartlidge2005The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the METTL1 gene are significantly associated with various cancers. Overexpression of METTL1 is linked to oncogenic transformation through the m7G modification of tRNAs, particularly affecting the translation of mRNAs involved in cell growth and proliferation. This overexpression is frequently observed in cancers such as glioblastoma multiforme, liposarcoma, melanoma, and acute myeloid leukemia, and is associated with poor patient survival (Orellana2021METTL1-mediated). In glioma, high METTL1 expression correlates with poorer survival outcomes and is linked to pathways involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA replication (Li2021Prognostic).

METTL1 also plays a role in immune response and therapy outcomes. Its expression affects immune cell infiltration and is associated with immune checkpoint blockade therapy response, influencing patient survival in cancers such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and testicular germ cell tumors (Gao2022A). In hepatocellular carcinoma, METTL1, along with WDR4, is implicated in tumor progression and poor prognosis, with its expression affecting drug sensitivity and resistance (Li2023M7G; Zhang2024METTL). These findings suggest METTL1 as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment.

## Interactions
METTL1, a methyltransferase enzyme, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, forming complexes essential for its function. A key interaction is with WDR4, forming a complex that catalyzes the m7G modification in tRNA, crucial for tRNA stability and function (Jin2023Structural; Orellana2021METTL1-mediated). This METTL1-WDR4 complex is vital for maintaining normal METTL1 protein levels and its methyltransferase activity (Jin2023Structural). Structural studies have shown that the interaction involves hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions, with specific residues like WDR4-R170 and METTL1-E183 being critical for the complex's stability and function (Jin2023Structural; Campeanu2021Multiomics).

METTL1 also interacts with other proteins involved in RNA processing, such as CTU2 and XPOT, which are tRNA regulators potentially interconnected with METTL1 in cancer (Campeanu2021Multiomics). These interactions suggest that METTL1 forms a functional network regulating RNA methylation events and pathways, promoting cancer progression (Campeanu2021Multiomics). Additionally, METTL1 is associated with proteins like NSUN2 and TRMT6, which are involved in RNA metabolism, indicating its broader role in RNA modification processes (Campeanu2021Multiomics).
