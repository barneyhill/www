# KIDINS220

## Overview
KIDINS220, also known as ARMS (Ankyrin Repeat-rich Membrane Spanning), is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The protein kinase D interacting substrate 220, encoded by KIDINS220, is a transmembrane protein characterized by its complex structure, which includes ankyrin repeats, transmembrane domains, and phosphorylation sites. This protein plays a pivotal role as a scaffold at the plasma membrane, facilitating interactions with multiple receptors crucial for neuronal development and synaptic plasticity, such as Trk, p75 NTR, and Eph receptors (Cesca2011Kidins220ARMS; Neubrand2012Kidins220ARMS). KIDINS220 is essential for the regulation of microtubule dynamics and cytoskeletal remodeling, impacting neuronal morphogenesis and polarity (Higuero2010Kidins220ARMS). Mutations in the KIDINS220 gene are associated with neurological disorders, including SINO syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodevelopmental processes (Josifova2016HeterozygousKIDINS220ARMSnonsense; Zhang2021SINO).

## Structure
KIDINS220, also known as ARMS, is a protein characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes multiple domains facilitating diverse interactions. The protein is composed of 1,763 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 196,561 kDa (Iglesias2000Identification). Its primary structure features eleven ankyrin repeats in the N-terminal region, which form a concave binding surface for molecular partners (Neubrand2012Kidins220ARMS). The protein also contains four transmembrane domains, suggesting its role as an integral membrane protein with both N- and C-terminal regions exposed to the cytoplasm (Iglesias2000Identification).

The C-terminal half of KIDINS220 is rich in serine and threonine residues, which are potential phosphorylation sites for kinases, including protein kinase D (PKD) (Iglesias2000Identification). Notably, KIDINS220 is phosphorylated at serine 919, a modification that is enhanced by phorbol ester treatment (Iglesias2000Identification). The protein also includes a proline-rich region, a sterile alpha motif (SAM), and a PDZ-binding motif, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Neubrand2012Kidins220ARMS).

KIDINS220 interacts with kinesin light chains through a specific KLC-interacting motif (KIM), facilitating its intracellular transport (Bracale2007Kidins220ARMS). The protein is part of the KAP family of P-loop nucleotide phosphatases, containing Walker A and B motifs involved in nucleotide binding (Neubrand2012Kidins220ARMS). Splice variants of KIDINS220 result in different isoforms, potentially leading to distinct functional roles (Iglesias2000Identification).

## Function
KIDINS220, also known as ARMS, is a crucial protein involved in various signaling pathways, particularly those related to neurotrophin and ephrin signaling. It acts as a scaffold protein at the plasma membrane, facilitating interactions with multiple receptors, including Trk, p75 NTR, Eph, AMPA, NMDA, and VEGFR, which are essential for neuronal development and synaptic plasticity (Cesca2011Kidins220ARMS; Neubrand2012Kidins220ARMS). KIDINS220 is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and cytoskeletal remodeling, which are critical for neuronal morphogenesis and the establishment of neuronal polarity (Neubrand2012Kidins220ARMS; Higuero2010Kidins220ARMS).

In healthy human cells, KIDINS220 plays a significant role in neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic activity. It is essential for the sustained activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity (Neubrand2012Kidins220ARMS). The protein also influences the trafficking and surface expression of AMPA receptors, impacting synaptic strength and plasticity (Neubrand2012Kidins220ARMS). KIDINS220's interactions with kinesin light chains facilitate its role in intracellular trafficking, linking signaling receptors to motor proteins (Schmieg2015Novel). Its expression is predominantly in the nervous system, where it contributes to the regulation of neuronal functions and the maintenance of neurogenesis (del2023Kidins220).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KIDINS220 gene, also known as ARMS, are associated with several neurological and developmental disorders. One of the primary conditions linked to KIDINS220 mutations is SINO syndrome, characterized by spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability, nystagmus, and obesity. This syndrome is often caused by heterozygous nonsense variants in the gene, leading to truncated protein products that disrupt normal neurotrophin signaling pathways (Josifova2016HeterozygousKIDINS220ARMSnonsense; Zhang2021SINO). 

In addition to SINO syndrome, KIDINS220 mutations have been implicated in severe developmental defects when present in a homozygous state. These defects include limb contractures and ventriculomegaly, suggesting an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern for these more severe phenotypes (El‐Dessouky2020Prenatal; Brady2022Pre). 

KIDINS220 is also involved in adipocyte differentiation, and its dysfunction can lead to obesity, as seen in SINO syndrome. The gene regulates adipocyte maturation through the ERK signaling pathway, and mutations may result in uncontrolled adipocyte differentiation (Zhang2021SINO). 

Furthermore, alterations in KIDINS220 expression have been linked to Huntington's disease, where specific isoforms of the protein are differentially regulated, potentially contributing to disease pathology (Sebastián‐Serrano2019Differential).

## Interactions
KIDINS220, also known as ARMS, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. In T cells, KIDINS220 interacts with the T-cell receptor (TCR), and this interaction is modulated by phosphorylation events. The association is reduced upon stimulation with pervanadate, indicating a regulatory mechanism through phosphorylation (Deswal2013Kidins220ARMS). KIDINS220 also binds to B-Raf, promoting sustained Erk activation in T cells, which is crucial for T cell activation and effector functions (Deswal2013Kidins220ARMS).

In neuronal cells, KIDINS220 interacts with the RhoGEF Trio protein, which is important for Rac1-dependent neurite outgrowth. This interaction involves the ankyrin-rich domain of KIDINS220 binding to the spectrin domains of Trio, facilitating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and neurite extension (Neubrand2010Kidins220ARMS).

KIDINS220 also associates with ICAM-3 and caveolin-1 in polarized T cells, localizing at the uropod and participating in cell motility regulation. This interaction is influenced by T-cell polarity and is crucial for the proper localization and function of these proteins (Jean‐Mairet2011The).
