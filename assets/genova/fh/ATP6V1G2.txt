# ATP6V1G2

## Overview
The ATP6V1G2 gene encodes the ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit G2, a component of the vacuolar-type ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is crucial for proton transport across cellular membranes. This gene is particularly significant in the brain, where it encodes a neuron-specific isoform of the G subunit, contributing to the acidification of intracellular compartments necessary for processes such as neurotransmitter release and protein degradation (Duan2018VATPases; Kawamura2015Loss). The G2 protein is part of the peripheral V1 domain of the V-ATPase, which is responsible for ATP hydrolysis, while the V0 domain facilitates proton translocation (Smith2002Molecular). The ATP6V1G2 gene has been implicated in certain health conditions, including susceptibility to hepatitis C virus-related dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its potential role in immune response mechanisms (Mikuz2010Genetic). Despite its specialized function in neurons, studies suggest that the absence of the G2 subunit can be compensated by the upregulation of other isoforms, such as G1, indicating a robust compensatory mechanism within the V-ATPase complex (Kawamura2015Loss).

## Structure
The ATP6V1G2 gene encodes the G2 subunit of the V1 domain of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is involved in proton transport across membranes. The G2 protein is a hydrophilic subunit with no apparent transmembrane segments, suggesting its location in the peripheral V1 domain of the V-ATPase complex (Smith2002Molecular). The G2 isoform is brain-specific and shares 64% identity and 83% similarity with the G1 isoform, and 54% identity and 74% similarity with the G3 isoform (Smith2002Molecular). 

The G subunit forms a rod-shaped structure with the E subunit, acting as a stator that connects the membrane-peripheral V1 and membrane-intrinsic V0 sectors of the V-ATPase (Kawamura2015Loss). This structure is crucial for the reversible dissociation and association of the V1 and V0 sectors, which regulates ATP hydrolysis and proton translocation (Kawamura2015Loss). The G2 subunit is part of the peripheral stalk, which maintains the stability of the V-ATPase complex during catalytic rotation (Duan2018VATPases). The study of G subunits in yeast mutants suggests functional conservation and divergence among isoforms, with the carboxyl terminal region potentially crucial for assembly with other subunits or catalytic activity (SunWada2003Diversity).

## Function
The ATP6V1G2 gene encodes the G2 isoform of the G subunit of the vacuolar-type ATPase (V-ATPase), a proton pump involved in acidifying intracellular compartments, which is essential for various cellular processes such as protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release (Kawamura2015Loss). In healthy human cells, the G2 isoform is neuron-specific, playing a crucial role in neurotransmitter accumulation in secretory vesicles and their release at synapses (Kawamura2015Loss). The V-ATPase complex, to which ATP6V1G2 contributes, is composed of the peripheral V1 component and the membrane-bound V0 component. The V1 component, including the G subunit, is responsible for ATP hydrolysis, while the V0 component facilitates proton translocation across membranes (Duan2018VATPases).

In the brain, the G2 subunit is part of a structure that connects the V1 and V0 sectors, regulating ATP hydrolysis and proton translocation in response to physiological conditions (Kawamura2015Loss). The absence of the G2 subunit in neurons can lead to the upregulation of the ubiquitously expressed G1 isoform, suggesting a compensatory mechanism to maintain V-ATPase activity and ensure acid-ion homeostasis (Kawamura2015Loss).

## Clinical Significance
The ATP6V1G2 gene encodes a subunit of the vacuolar-type ATPase (V-ATPase), which is essential for various cellular functions, including acidification of intracellular compartments. Alterations in ATP6V1G2 expression or function have been implicated in specific health conditions. Notably, ATP6V1G2 is associated with susceptibility to hepatitis C virus-related dilated cardiomyopathy (HCV-DCM). A non-HLA gene block, including ATP6V1G2, is strongly linked to this condition, suggesting its role in the immune response related to HCV-DCM (Mikuz2010Genetic). However, no significant association has been found between this genomic region and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCV-HCM), indicating distinct pathogenic mechanisms (Mikuz2010Genetic).

In the context of neurological function, the ATP6V1G2 gene encodes the G2 subunit of V-ATPase, which is neuron-specific. Studies in mice lacking the G2 subunit showed no apparent developmental or behavioral abnormalities, suggesting a compensatory mechanism through the upregulation of the G1 subunit. This indicates that while the G2 subunit may have specialized functions in the neural system, its loss does not result in obvious phenotypic consequences under the experimental conditions used (Kawamura2015Loss).
