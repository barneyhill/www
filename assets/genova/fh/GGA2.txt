# GGA2

## Overview
GGA2 is a gene that encodes the protein golgi associated, gamma adaptin ear containing, ARF binding protein 2, which is a key adaptor protein involved in intracellular trafficking processes. This protein is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus and plays a significant role in the transport of proteins between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. GGA2 is characterized by its modular structure, which includes domains such as VHS, GAT, and GAE, each contributing to its function in recognizing sorting signals, binding ARF proteins, and interacting with accessory proteins, respectively (Bonifacino2004The). The protein is involved in critical cellular processes, including the stabilization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the recycling of β1-integrins, which are essential for cell growth, proliferation, and motility (Uemura2018GGA2; Sahgal2019GGA2). Additionally, GGA2's interactions with clathrin and the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor underscore its role in lysosomal enzyme sorting and clathrin-coated vesicle formation (Zhu2001Binding). The gene's dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (O’Farrell2019Integrative).

## Structure
GGA2 is a Golgi-localized, γ-adaptin ear-containing, ARF-binding protein involved in vesicular transport. It is characterized by a modular structure with several distinct domains. The protein contains a VHS domain, which is approximately 140 residues long and functions as a recognition module for sorting signals, specifically binding to DXXLL motifs in the cytosolic tails of certain receptors (Bonifacino2004The). The GAT domain, about 150 residues in length, is crucial for binding to ARF proteins, facilitating the recruitment of GGA2 to the trans-Golgi network (Bonifacino2004The). This domain also interacts with Rabaptin-5, a RAB4/RAB5 effector involved in endosomal tethering and fusion events (Bonifacino2004The).

The GAE domain, 124 residues long, is homologous to the ear domain of γ-adaptin subunits of AP-1 and interacts with accessory proteins such as γ-synergin and epsin-related proteins (Bonifacino2004The). The hinge region of GGA2 contains clathrin-box motifs, allowing it to bind clathrin, and is largely unstructured (Bonifacino2004The). Phosphorylation by Casein Kinase 2 (CK2) modulates interactions with the VHS domain, affecting the protein's function (Bonifacino2004The). The protein's structure facilitates its role in trafficking between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. Specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of GGA2 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
GGA2 (golgi associated, gamma adaptin ear containing, ARF binding protein 2) is a crucial adaptor protein involved in the trafficking of proteins between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. It plays a significant role in stabilizing the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by preventing its lysosomal degradation, thereby promoting cell growth and proliferation. This stabilization is achieved through the interaction of GGA2 with the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR, which is essential for maintaining EGFR expression levels in healthy human cells (Uemura2018GGA2).

GGA2 is also involved in the recycling of active β1-integrins, which are important for cell-matrix interactions and cell motility. It facilitates the recycling of these integrins back to the plasma membrane, which is crucial for maintaining cell adhesion and migration capabilities (Sahgal2019GGA2). The protein localizes to early and recycling endosomes, indicating its role in integrin trafficking (Sahgal2019GGA2).

In addition to its role in EGFR and integrin trafficking, GGA2 is involved in the sorting of lysosomal enzymes by interacting with the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, which is essential for proper lysosomal enzyme targeting (Zhu2001Binding).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the GGA2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and colorectal cancer (CRC). In LUAD, GGA2 is frequently overexpressed in tumors with EGFR mutations, where it acts as a cooperative driver of tumorigenesis by stabilizing EGFR levels and enhancing its signaling, which contributes to tumor progression and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (O’Farrell2019Integrative). The overexpression of GGA2 in EGFR mutant LUAD is associated with copy number gains on chromosome 16p, suggesting that GGA2 amplification is a secondary event that enhances the oncogenic potential of EGFR mutations (O’Farrell2019Integrative).

In HCC and CRC, GGA2 is upregulated, supporting tumor growth by stabilizing EGFR expression and promoting cell proliferation. This stabilization occurs through interactions with the EGFR cytoplasmic domain, preventing its degradation and maintaining its activity (Uemura2018GGA2). The role of GGA2 in these cancers highlights its potential as a therapeutic target, as its inhibition could suppress tumor growth and enhance the efficacy of existing cancer treatments (Uemura2021Clathrin).

## Interactions
GGA2 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular trafficking pathways. It binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) through its VHS-GAT domain, specifically interacting with the juxtamembrane region of EGFR. This interaction is dependent on the Asn108 residue in the VHS domain, which is essential for binding to ACLL motifs in cargo proteins. Mutation of this residue reduces EGFR binding, highlighting its importance (Uemura2018GGA2). GGA2 also interacts with clathrin through its hinge region, which contains clathrin-binding motifs LIDLE and LLDLL. These interactions are necessary for GGA2's role in lysosomal enzyme sorting and the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (Zhu2001Binding).

GGA2 is involved in the sorting of lysosomal enzymes by binding to the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) via its COOH-terminal region. This interaction is mediated by the acidic cluster–dileucine motif in the CI-MPR cytoplasmic tail (Zhu2001Binding). Additionally, GGA2 interacts with ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), specifically binding to GTP-bound forms of ARF1, ARF5, and ARF6 through its GGAH domain, which facilitates its recruitment to the trans-Golgi network (TAKATSU2002GGA).
