# TMEM88B

## Overview
TMEM88B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 88B, which is involved in various cellular processes. As a transmembrane protein, TMEM88B is integral to the cellular membrane, playing a role in cell signaling and interaction. The protein is implicated in several biological pathways, including those related to cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Research has highlighted its potential involvement in hepatocellular carcinoma progression, particularly in the context of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as its association with age-related changes in the mouse hippocampus that may influence neurodegenerative conditions (Hymel2022Differential; Graham2023Genetic). Despite these associations, TMEM88B is not currently linked to specific human diseases in major genetic databases, suggesting that its role may be more modulatory rather than causative in disease processes (SchmitzAbe2024Unique).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The TMEM88B gene has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), TMEM88B is noted for its potential role in cell migration and binding, particularly in choline-deficient models. This suggests that changes in TMEM88B expression may contribute to the progression of HCC from NASH, highlighting its significance in cancer biology (Hymel2022Differential).

In the realm of neurodegenerative diseases, TMEM88B is part of an oligodendrocytic module in the mouse hippocampus, which is enriched for myelination and axon ensheathment processes. This module is significantly correlated with age, suggesting that TMEM88B may play a role in age-related signaling pathways that could influence neurodegenerative conditions, although direct links to specific diseases are not established (Graham2023Genetic).

Despite its involvement in these pathways, TMEM88B is categorized as a non-constrained gene, primarily containing recessive genes, and is not directly associated with known human diseases in major genetic databases (SchmitzAbe2024Unique). This indicates that while TMEM88B may influence disease processes, its mutations or expression alterations are not yet conclusively linked to specific clinical conditions.
