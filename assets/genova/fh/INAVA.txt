# INAVA

## Overview
INAVA, also known as C1orf106, is a gene that encodes the protein innate immunity activator, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of innate immune responses. The protein is primarily expressed in peripheral and intestinal myeloid-derived cells and is involved in pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-induced signaling pathways, crucial for immune activation and bacterial clearance (Yan2017An). INAVA functions as a signaling adaptor protein, interacting with key components such as 14-3-3τ, NOD2, and RIP2, to enhance signaling pathways like MAPK and NF-κB, thereby promoting cytokine secretion and immune homeostasis (Yan2017An). Dysregulation of INAVA has been linked to inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and certain cancers, including papillary thyroid cancer, underscoring its clinical significance (Guan2018INAVA; Yan2017An).

## Function
The INAVA gene, also known as C1orf106, encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of innate immune responses in healthy human cells. INAVA is primarily expressed in peripheral and intestinal myeloid-derived cells, where it is involved in pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-induced signaling pathways. These pathways are crucial for the activation of immune responses, including the secretion of cytokines and the clearance of bacteria (Yan2017An).

INAVA interacts with the protein 14-3-3τ, which facilitates the recruitment of a signaling complex that includes phosphorylated ERK, p38, and IκBα. This complex amplifies PRR-induced signaling, leading to enhanced cytokine secretion and bacterial clearance (Yan2017An). The protein is also involved in the regulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, as well as autophagy pathways, which are essential for effective bacterial clearance (Yan2017An).

INAVA's expression is modulated by various factors, including transcription factors like TBP and HOXA5, and miRNA-24 binding in its 3′ UTR. These regulatory mechanisms ensure optimal INAVA expression, which is necessary for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation (Yan2017An).

## Clinical Significance
The INAVA gene, also known as innate immunity activator, has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations and alterations in its expression. One significant association is with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. A specific noncoding variant, rs7554511, in the INAVA gene is linked to an increased risk of IBD. This variant results in decreased expression of INAVA, leading to reduced pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-induced signaling, cytokine secretion, and bacterial clearance in macrophages. These effects contribute to immune dysregulation and impaired bacterial clearance, which are critical in the pathogenesis of IBD (Yan2017An).

INAVA is also associated with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). In PTC, INAVA expression is upregulated, promoting tumor aggressiveness by enhancing cell invasion, migration, and metastasis. This is mediated through the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), a key molecule in cancer cell invasion, and is correlated with fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) levels. These findings suggest that INAVA plays a role in the progression of PTC and may serve as a potential therapeutic target (Guan2018INAVA).

Overall, alterations in INAVA expression and function are linked to immune-related disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance.

## Interactions
The INAVA protein is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling. It associates with NOD2 and RIP2, which are essential for NOD2-initiated signaling pathways. INAVA also forms a complex with IRAK1, another key component in NOD2/RIP2 signaling (Yan2017An). The protein contains three putative 14-3-3 binding domains that are conserved across species, facilitating the recruitment of the scaffolding protein 14-3-3τ. This interaction enhances signaling pathways downstream of PRRs, such as the MAPK and NF-κB pathways, by recruiting phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK), p-p38, and p-IκBα to INAVA (Yan2017An).

The interaction between INAVA and 14-3-3τ is crucial for the assembly of a signaling complex that amplifies PRR-induced signaling and cytokine secretion. This complex is important for cytokine production and immune responses, contributing to bacterial clearance and immune homeostasis (Yan2017An). Mutations in the serine residues of INAVA, which are necessary for 14-3-3τ recruitment, lead to decreased recruitment of 14-3-3τ and p-ERK, resulting in impaired signaling and cytokine secretion (Yan2017An).
