# USP17L19

## Overview
USP17L19 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 19, which is part of the ubiquitin-specific peptidase family. This family of proteins is involved in the regulation of protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein encoded by USP17L19 functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme, which removes ubiquitin moieties from target proteins, thereby influencing their stability and activity. Alterations in the expression of USP17L19 have been linked to various pathological conditions, including immune-related disorders and cancer, highlighting its potential role in modulating inflammatory and oncogenic pathways (Lu2022The; Isa2022The).

## Clinical Significance
USP17L19, a member of the ubiquitin-specific peptidase family, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In psoriasis vulgaris, particularly in the blood dryness syndrome, USP17L19 is abnormally upregulated, suggesting its role in the immune dysfunction and inflammation associated with the disease (Lu2022The). This upregulation indicates that USP17L19 may contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis by influencing inflammatory signaling pathways.

In the context of cancer, USP17L19 has been associated with the response to dual blockade therapy in multiple myeloma. Gene expression profiling has shown that USP17L19 is significantly modulated by the combination treatment targeting RSK2-NTKD and AKT, suggesting its involvement in the molecular response to this therapeutic approach (Isa2022The).

However, the reliability of findings related to USP17L19 in genetic studies can be questionable. In a study on alcohol dependence, USP17L19 was identified as a significant gene, but the results were considered potentially unreliable due to the limited number of rare variants and possible false positives (Li2018Detecting).
