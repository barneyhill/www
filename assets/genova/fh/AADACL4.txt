# AADACL4

## Overview
AADACL4 is a gene that encodes the protein arylacetamide deacetylase like 4, which is categorized as a hydrolase enzyme. This protein is primarily involved in lipid metabolism, where it plays a significant role in the hydrolysis of specific lipid substrates within the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzymatic activity of arylacetamide deacetylase like 4 is crucial for maintaining lipid homeostasis and facilitating detoxification processes by converting lipid-soluble compounds into more water-soluble forms. This conversion is essential for preventing the accumulation of potentially toxic lipid compounds, thereby ensuring cellular health and proper functioning of lipid-dependent processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function
AADACL4 (arylacetamide deacetylase like 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism. The protein functions as a hydrolase, catalyzing the breakdown of specific lipid substrates. It is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining lipid homeostasis and facilitating detoxification processes. By breaking down lipid substrates, AADACL4 contributes to the regulation of lipid levels within the cell, ensuring that lipid concentrations remain balanced and do not reach toxic levels. This activity is essential for the proper functioning of cellular processes that depend on lipid signaling and membrane composition. The hydrolase activity of AADACL4 is integral to the detoxification pathways, as it helps in the conversion of lipid-soluble compounds into more water-soluble forms that can be excreted from the body. This function is vital for protecting cells from the accumulation of potentially harmful lipid compounds, thereby supporting overall cellular health and function.
