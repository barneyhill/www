# PDILT

## Overview
PDILT (protein disulfide isomerase like, testis expressed) is a gene that encodes a member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, specifically expressed in the testis. The protein product of this gene is characterized by its unique structure and function, distinguishing it from other PDIs. Unlike typical PDIs, PDILT lacks oxidoreductase activity due to the presence of an SXXC motif instead of the classical CXXC active site, which alters its enzymatic capabilities (van2005PDILT). Instead, PDILT functions primarily as a molecular chaperone, facilitating the proper folding of spermatogenesis-specific proteins, such as ADAM3, which are crucial for sperm function and male fertility (Tokuhiro2012Protein; Li2018Crystal). The protein is predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum of male postmeiotic germ cells, where it forms complexes with testis-specific lectin chaperones to ensure the maturation of essential proteins during the final stages of germ cell development (van2007A). The absence or dysfunction of PDILT can lead to male infertility, highlighting its critical role in reproductive health (Tokuhiro2012Protein).

## Structure
PDILT is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, specifically expressed in the testis. It is composed of 584 amino acids and includes several regions such as a signal peptide, an N-terminal loop, and multiple thioredoxin-like domains (Li2018Crystal). The protein's structure is characterized by an 'L'-shaped conformation in crystals, distinct from the 'U'-shaped structures of other PDI family members. This structure includes four thioredoxin-like domains arranged with the b, b′, and a′ domains in a line and the a domain positioned above, forming a compact triangle with the N-terminal loop (Li2018Crystal).

PDILT lacks the classical CXXC active site motif found in other PDIs, instead featuring an unusual SXXC motif, which affects its enzymatic activity and suggests a specialized function in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the testis (van2005PDILT). The protein is heavily glycosylated, with nine putative glycosylation sites, which may influence its function and interactions (van2005PDILT). In solution, PDILT predominantly exists as a dimer, with a more extended and flexible structure compared to its monomeric crystal form, allowing it to interact with various substrates (Li2018Crystal).

## Function
PDILT is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, specifically expressed in the testis, where it plays a crucial role in the folding of spermatogenesis-specific proteins in male postmeiotic germ cells. Unlike other PDI family proteins, PDILT lacks oxidoreductase activity due to mutations in its redox-active catalytic sites, which means it does not catalyze thiol-disulfide exchange reactions (van2007A; Li2018Crystal). Instead, PDILT functions as a molecular chaperone, assisting in the proper folding of proteins critical for sperm function, such as ADAM3, which is necessary for sperm migration and fertilization (Tokuhiro2012Protein; Li2018Crystal).

PDILT is expressed exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of male postmeiotic germ cells, where it forms a chaperone complex with testis-specific lectin chaperones, such as calreticulin-3 (CRT3) and calmegin (CMG) (van2007A; Li2018Crystal). This complex is essential for the maturation of spermatogenesis-specific proteins during the final stages of germ cell development, contributing to male fertility (van2007A). The absence of PDILT leads to improper folding of these proteins, resulting in infertility (Li2018Crystal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PDILT gene can have significant implications for male fertility. PDILT is crucial for the proper folding and surface presentation of the sperm membrane protein ADAM3, which is essential for sperm function. In the absence of PDILT, as observed in knockout mouse models, ADAM3 is improperly folded and absent from mature spermatozoa, leading to male infertility. This misfolding affects sperm migration through the uterotubal junction and binding to the zona pellucida, although sperm can still fertilize eggs when directly deposited into the oviduct (Tokuhiro2012Protein).

PDILT's role in the oxidative protein folding process, particularly in forming disulfide bonds in ADAM3, is critical for its function and antigenicity. The absence of functional ADAM3 on sperm surfaces due to PDILT mutations could potentially lead to infertility (Tokuhiro2012Protein). Additionally, PDILT's expression is influenced by androgen levels, as its mRNA expression is significantly downregulated in rats after surgical castration, indicating a unique regulatory mechanism that could impact fertility (Fernandes2024Epididymal). These findings underscore the importance of PDILT in male reproductive health and its potential role in infertility when its function is disrupted.

## Interactions
PDILT, a testis-specific member of the protein disulfide isomerase family, engages in several protein interactions crucial for its function in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It forms disulfide-dependent complexes with other proteins, particularly in testicular cells, despite lacking the classical CXXC motif typical of other PDIs (van2005PDILT). PDILT interacts with Ero1α, an ER oxidoreductase, indicating a role in disulfide bond formation and ER retro-translocation (van2005PDILT). This interaction is facilitated by conserved, non-redox active sequences shared by PDI and PDILT (van2005PDILT).

PDILT also interacts with testis-specific lectin chaperones, such as calreticulin-3 (CRT3) and calmegin (CMG), to assist in the proper folding of spermatogenesis-specific proteins (BastosAristizabal2014Structure; Li2018Crystal). It plays a critical role in the quality control of the sperm membrane protein ADAM3, forming a chaperone complex with CALR3 to facilitate ADAM3's proper folding and maturation (Tokuhiro2012Protein). The absence of PDILT results in the improper folding and absence of ADAM3 on the sperm surface, leading to male infertility (Tokuhiro2012Protein).
