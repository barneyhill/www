# SEZ6

## Overview
The SEZ6 gene encodes the seizure-related 6 homolog protein, which is a critical component in neural development and synaptic function. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its presence in cell-surface isoforms, although it also exists in a secreted form. SEZ6 is characterized by its threonine-rich domain, short consensus repeats (SCR), and CUB-like domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for neuronal connectivity and synaptic regulation (Osaki2011The; Gunnersen2007Sez6). The protein plays a significant role in dendritic arborization and synaptic plasticity, influencing both the stability of dendritic branches and the excitability of cortical pyramidal neurons (Gunnersen2007Sez6). SEZ6 is also a substrate for the BACE1 enzyme, which modulates its surface levels and function as a receptor (Pigoni2016Seizure). Alterations in the SEZ6 gene have been associated with various neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, febrile seizures, and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal neuronal function (Paracchini2018Exome; Yu2006Febrile; Nash2019Lack).

## Structure
The SEZ6 protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in neural development. It contains a threonine-rich domain, five short consensus repeats (SCR), and two CUB-like domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Osaki2011The). These domains suggest a role in binding to other extracellular or cell-surface proteins, which is crucial for its involvement in neuronal connectivity and synaptic regulation (Gunnersen2007Sez6).

SEZ6 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing. There are three main isoforms: Sez-6 type I and type II, which are cell-surface proteins tethered by a single transmembrane domain, and Sez-6 type III, a secreted isoform that lacks the transmembrane domain (Osaki2011The; Gunnersen2007Sez6). The secreted isoform, type III, enhances dendritic arborization, while the transmembrane forms have different effects on dendritic branching (Osaki2011The).

Post-translational modifications of SEZ6 include glycosylation, with the protein existing in different glycosylation states. The mature form is complex glycosylated, while the immature form is high-mannose glycosylated (Pigoni2016Seizure). These modifications may influence the protein's stability, localization, and interactions within the neuronal environment.

## Function
The SEZ6 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in synaptic function and neuronal development. SEZ6 is involved in the regulation of dendritic arborization patterns and excitability of cortical pyramidal neurons. It influences both activity-independent and activity-dependent dendrite and excitatory synapse development postnatally (Gunnersen2007Sez6). SEZ6 is localized along dendritic branches and spines, where it modulates branch stability and interacts with signaling pathways activated by neuronal depolarization (Gunnersen2007Sez6).

SEZ6 is a substrate for the BACE1 enzyme in neurons, which cleaves SEZ6 and regulates its surface levels, potentially affecting its function as a receptor at the cell surface (Pigoni2016Seizure). The protein is also involved in synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity, with its absence leading to impaired cognition and motor functions (Qiu2021The). SEZ6 proteins contain CUB and SCR domains, which are involved in protein interactions, and an intracellular NPxY motif for endocytosis (Nash2019Lack). These proteins are crucial for dendritic spine dynamics and are required for normal neuronal development and function (Nash2019Lack).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SEZ6 gene have been implicated in several neurological conditions. In Alzheimer's disease, a rare missense variant R615H in the SEZ6 gene was identified in an Italian family with familial Alzheimer's disease. This variant was associated with a reduction in amyloid-beta peptide production, a key factor in Alzheimer's pathology, suggesting a potential role in the disease's molecular mechanisms (Paracchini2018Exome). 

SEZ6 has also been linked to febrile seizures and epilepsy. Mutations in SEZ6 were found to be more prevalent in children with febrile seizures, particularly those with complex febrile seizures and a positive family history. These mutations were associated with a higher recurrence rate of seizures and the development of epilepsy (Yu2006Febrile). 

Alterations in SEZ6 expression and interactions have been connected to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia. SEZ6 proteins are involved in synaptic development and function, and their dysregulation may contribute to the etiology of these disorders (Nash2019Lack). The SEZ6 gene is also a substrate for the enzyme BACE1, which regulates its surface levels in neurons, potentially affecting its role in neurological conditions (Pigoni2016Seizure).

## Interactions
SEZ6 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in synaptic function and neural development. It is known to bind with neurotrypsin, a serine protease involved in long-term memory, suggesting a role in synaptic plasticity (Gunnersen2007Sez6). SEZ6 also interacts with motopsin (PRSS12), another serine protease, through its proline-rich/kringle domain. This interaction modulates motopsin's effects on neuronal morphology, specifically influencing neurite outgrowth and branching (Mitsui2013A).

SEZ6 is a substrate for BACE1, a protease that cleaves SEZ6, leading to the shedding of its soluble ectodomains into the extracellular space. This interaction is crucial for SEZ6 processing in neurons (Pigoni2016Seizure). SEZ6 and its homolog SEZ6L undergo further processing by γ-secretase, indicating their involvement in regulated intramembrane proteolysis (Pigoni2016Seizure).

The SEZ6 family, including SEZ6, SEZ6L, and SEZ6L2, also interacts with components of the complement system, inhibiting complement deposition at the level of the C3 convertase. This interaction suggests a role in protecting synapses from complement-dependent pruning (Qiu2020The).
