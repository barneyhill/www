# MEGF11

## Overview
MEGF11 is a gene that encodes the protein multiple EGF-like domains 11, which is primarily involved in cell adhesion and motility, with significant implications in neural development. The MEGF11 protein is characterized by the presence of a signal peptide, an EMI domain, and 17 atypical EGF-like domains, which are essential for its role in cell signaling and adhesion (Suzuki2007The). As a transmembrane protein, MEGF11 is localized to lamellipodia, regions associated with cell motility, suggesting its involvement in dynamic cellular processes such as tissue morphogenesis and cell-cell communication (Suzuki2007The). While its precise functions in healthy human cells are not fully understood, MEGF11's distinct localization patterns indicate a specialized role in facilitating cellular interactions and movement, distinguishing it from its paralog MEGF10 (Suzuki2007The).

## Function
MEGF11 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cell adhesion and motility, playing a significant role in neural development. The MEGF11 protein contains a signal peptide, an EMI domain, and 17 atypical EGF-like domains, which are crucial for its function in cell signaling and adhesion (Suzuki2007The). When expressed in HEK293 cells, MEGF11 displays an irregular, mosaic-like adhesion pattern and localizes to lamellipodia, suggesting its involvement in cell motility (Suzuki2007The). This localization to motility-active zones indicates that MEGF11 may facilitate cell movement, distinguishing it from its paralog MEGF10, which does not localize to these regions (Suzuki2007The).

The protein's presence in lamellipodia suggests a role in dynamic cellular processes, such as tissue morphogenesis and cell-cell communication. Although the exact function of MEGF11 in healthy human cells is not fully elucidated, its distinct localization and adhesion patterns imply a specialized role in cellular interactions and movement (Suzuki2007The). The study of MEGF11's interaction with MEGF10 indicates that these proteins have distinct roles, as their complex patterns do not co-localize, suggesting different functions in cellular processes (Suzuki2007The).

## Clinical Significance
MEGF11 has been implicated in various diseases, primarily through its association with cancer. In the context of breast cancer, MEGF11 was identified as a gene of interest in a study that utilized a multivariate genome-wide association study (muGWAS) approach. This method demonstrated higher power in detecting common cis-epistatic variations shared across populations, suggesting a potential role for MEGF11 in breast cancer genetics (Wittkowski2018Complex). However, the gene is more prominently noted for its association with colorectal cancer, as highlighted in genetic studies that explore its involvement in disease pathways related to membrane-associated receptor signaling and nuclear proteins involved in cell cycle control (Wittkowski2018Complex).

In psoriasis, the MEGF11 gene was examined for its variation frequency among patients compared to normal individuals. Although the variation frequency was lower in psoriasis patients, this difference was not statistically significant, indicating that MEGF11 may not play a major role in this condition (Xing2021Variants). Overall, while MEGF11 is associated with certain cancers, its clinical significance in other diseases remains less clear.
