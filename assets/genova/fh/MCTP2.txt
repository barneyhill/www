# MCTP2

## Overview
MCTP2 is a gene that encodes the protein multiple C2 and transmembrane domain containing 2, which is involved in synaptic transmission and cellular signaling. The protein is characterized by its three C2 domains and two transmembrane regions, classifying it as a transmembrane protein. These structural features enable MCTP2 to function as a calcium sensor within the endoplasmic reticulum, playing a crucial role in neuronal communication by facilitating synaptic vesicle release. The gene's expression is notably observed in the right fusiform gyrus, a brain region associated with face recognition, although its expression level is relatively low. MCTP2 is implicated in maintaining synaptic function and homeostatic plasticity, with potential impacts on cognitive functions such as face recognition. Clinically, mutations in MCTP2 have been linked to congenital heart defects and congenital prosopagnosia, underscoring its significance in both cardiac and neurological development (Lalani2013MCTP2; Sun2024Human; Genç2017MCTP).

## Structure
The MCTP2 protein is characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes a variable N-terminal sequence, three C2 domains, two transmembrane regions (TMRs), and a short C-terminal sequence (Lalani2013MCTP2; Shin2005Evolutionarily). The C2 domains are evolutionarily conserved and are crucial for the protein's function, although they exhibit unusual calcium-binding properties. Unlike typical C2 domains, those in MCTP2 bind calcium with high affinity in the absence of phospholipids, and they do not show significant phospholipid binding (Shin2005Evolutionarily). The C2 domains are separated by short linkers, with a longer region connecting them to the TMRs (Shin2005Evolutionarily).

The transmembrane regions of MCTP2 are located at the C-terminal half of the protein, and the presence of either TMR is sufficient to anchor the protein to membranes, as demonstrated by EYFP-MCTP2 fusion constructs (Shin2005Evolutionarily). Alternative splicing of the MCTP2 gene results in different isoforms, which contribute to the protein's molecular diversity. This splicing affects the linker between C2A and C2B and the first TMR, potentially altering the protein's topography (Shin2005Evolutionarily). The gene structure includes 22 coding exons, and a 41 kb intragenic duplication has been identified, leading to a truncated protein variant (Lalani2013MCTP2).

## Function
MCTP2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in synaptic transmission and cellular signaling. The protein contains three C2 domains and two transmembrane regions, which are crucial for its function as a calcium sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Genç2017MCTP). These C2 domains bind calcium ions, a common feature in proteins that play roles in membrane and vesicle trafficking, essential for neuronal transmission (Sun2024Human). MCTP2 is involved in synaptic transmission by stabilizing synaptic function and maintaining homeostatic plasticity. It acts downstream of calcium influx to facilitate the release of synaptic vesicles, particularly those weakly coupled to presynaptic calcium entry sites (Genç2017MCTP).

In healthy human cells, MCTP2 is expressed in the right fusiform gyrus, a brain region associated with face recognition, although its expression level is relatively low (Sun2024Human). The protein's role in synaptic transmission suggests it may influence neuronal communication and plasticity, potentially affecting cognitive functions such as face recognition. MCTP2's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal synaptic function and its potential impact on neurocognitive development (Genç2017MCTP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MCTP2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In cardiac development, MCTP2 is crucial for the proper formation of the cardiac outflow tract. Alterations in its expression can lead to congenital heart defects such as coarctation of the aorta (CoA) and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Studies have identified both deletions and duplications within the MCTP2 gene that result in these cardiac anomalies, highlighting its dosage sensitivity and importance in cardiogenesis (Lalani2013MCTP2).

In addition to its role in cardiac development, MCTP2 mutations have been associated with congenital prosopagnosia (CP), a condition characterized by face blindness. Specific mutations, such as p.I716S and c.239delG, have been identified in individuals with CP, suggesting a potential link between MCTP2 and face recognition abilities. These mutations are often rare and may affect the gene's function, contributing to the CP phenotype (Sun2024Human).

The clinical significance of MCTP2 mutations is underscored by their impact on both cardiac and neurological functions, indicating that MCTP2 plays a critical role in multiple developmental processes (Lalani2013MCTP2; Sun2024Human).
