# SYT9

## Overview
The SYT9 gene encodes the protein synaptotagmin 9, which is a member of the synaptotagmin family of proteins known for their role as calcium sensors in exocytosis processes. Synaptotagmin 9 is characterized by its two cytosolic calcium-binding C2 domains, which are integral to its function in facilitating fast synchronous neurotransmitter release in neurons and regulating hormone secretion in endocrine cells. Predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly within the limbic system and striatum, synaptotagmin 9 is crucial for synaptic transmission and is also involved in insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells and follicle-stimulating hormone regulation in the anterior pituitary gland (Roper2015Sexspecific; Xu2007Synaptotagmin1; Grise2007Distinct). The protein's interactions with other synaptotagmins and proteins such as Tomosyn-1 and syntaxin-1A underscore its diverse roles in both neuronal and endocrine systems (Gautam2015Synaptotagmins; Rahman2022Synaptotagmin9).

## Structure
Synaptotagmin 9 (SYT9) is a protein characterized by its two cytosolic calcium-binding C2 domains, C2A and C2B, which are crucial for its function as a calcium sensor in exocytosis processes. The primary structure of SYT9 includes these C2 domains, which are homologous to those found in other synaptotagmins, such as SYT1 and SYT2, with 69% sequence homology in the C2A domain and 72% in the C2B domain (Grise2007Distinct). 

The secondary structure of SYT9's C2 domains involves typical beta-sheets and alpha-helices. Notably, the C2B domain of SYT9 lacks certain β-sheets present in SYT1, specifically β-sheets 3 and 4, which are partially or completely absent due to the presence of lysine residues that are generally unfavorable for β-sheet formation (Grise2007Distinct). The C-terminal acidic α-helix H2 in the C2B domain is also shorter compared to SYT1 (Grise2007Distinct).

The tertiary structure of SYT9 has not been fully elucidated, but molecular modeling suggests that the main Ca2+ coordination sites are conserved (Grise2007Distinct). There is no detailed information on the quaternary structure or post-translational modifications of SYT9 in the provided context.

## Function
Synaptotagmin 9 (SYT9) is a calcium sensor protein involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, playing a crucial role in fast synchronous neurotransmitter release in neurons. It is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in the limbic system and striatum, areas associated with emotional and reward behaviors (Xu2007Synaptotagmin1). SYT9 is essential for fast synaptic transmission, as its deletion in striatal neurons leads to a significant decrease in synaptic transmission, specifically affecting fast synchronous release (Xu2007Synaptotagmin1).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, SYT9 is involved in endocrine functions. In pancreatic β-cells, SYT9 acts as a calcium sensor for insulin secretion, with its C2A domain facilitating calcium-dependent translocation to the plasma membrane, while the C2B domain is involved in pre-binding to membranes (Grise2007Distinct). SYT9 is also implicated in the regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion in the anterior pituitary gland, with a sex-specific role in female mice, where it affects the oestrus cycle (Roper2015Sexspecific). These functions highlight SYT9's diverse roles in both neuronal and endocrine systems, contributing to synaptic transmission and hormone secretion.

## Interactions
Synaptotagmin 9 (SYT9) is involved in several protein interactions that regulate its function in cellular processes. SYT9 forms a molecular complex with Tomosyn-1 and syntaxin-1A (Stx1A) at the plasma membrane-insulin granules interface in pancreatic β-cells. This complex inhibits the formation of Stx1A-SNARE complexes, which are essential for insulin granule fusion and exocytosis, thereby reducing insulin secretion (Rahman2022Synaptotagmin9). Knockdown of SYT9 or Tomosyn-1 increases the formation of Stx1A-Snap25-Vamp2 SNARE complexes, suggesting that SYT9 and Tomosyn-1 inhibit these complexes (Rahman2022Synaptotagmin9).

In neurons, SYT9 acts as a calcium sensor for synaptic vesicle exocytosis, interacting with other synaptotagmins such as synaptotagmin-1 and -2. These interactions are crucial for fast neurotransmitter release, particularly in the limbic system and striatum (Xu2007Synaptotagmin1). SYT9 also interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), promoting the generation of β-amyloid peptides, which are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (Gautam2015Synaptotagmins). These interactions highlight SYT9's role in both endocrine and neuronal functions, influencing processes such as insulin secretion and neurotransmitter release.
