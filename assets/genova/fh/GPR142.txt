# GPR142

## Overview
GPR142 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 142, a member of the rhodopsin family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of GPCRs, and is primarily expressed in pancreatic islets and the gastrointestinal tract. GPR142 plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism by regulating the secretion of insulin and incretin hormones in response to aromatic amino acids such as L-Tryptophan and L-Phenylalanine (Lin2016GPR142; Rudenko2019The). The receptor's activity is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis, making it a potential therapeutic target for metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes (Lin2016GPR142). Additionally, GPR142 has been implicated in various cancers, where genomic variations in the gene may contribute to oncogenesis (Kaushik2021PanCancer).

## Structure
The GPR142 protein is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain structure, typical of the rhodopsin family of GPCRs (Kaushik2017Insights; Süsens2006Characterisation). The primary structure of GPR142 consists of 462 amino acids with a molecular weight of 51 kDa (Kaushik2017Insights). The secondary structure is composed of approximately 50% alpha helices, 3.03% beta sheets, and 46.96% coils (Kaushik2017Insights).

The tertiary structure of GPR142 was predicted using threading and ab initio methods due to the absence of a solved crystal structure. The best model showed a Q-Mean Score of 0.426 and a DOPE Score of -34453.63, indicating a stable structure (Kaushik2017Insights; Kaushik2018Structure). The protein's stability is further supported by the presence of eight cysteine residues forming disulfide bonds (Kaushik2017Insights).

GPR142 may require dimer formation for proper signaling function, suggesting a quaternary structure involving dimerization (Kaushik2017Insights). The protein contains a single N-glycosylation site in the extracellular amino-terminal domain, a common post-translational modification in GPCRs (Süsens2006Characterisation). The splice sites between exons two and three are located at an identical position in the first transmembrane domain (Süsens2006Characterisation).

## Function
GPR142 is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in glucose metabolism by regulating insulin and incretin hormone secretion. It is primarily expressed in pancreatic islets and the gastrointestinal tract, where it functions as a receptor for the aromatic amino acids L-Tryptophan (L-Trp) and L-Phenylalanine (L-Phe) (Lin2016GPR142; Rudenko2019The). GPR142 activation by L-Trp enhances the secretion of insulin and incretin hormones such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which are crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis (Lin2016GPR142).

In healthy human cells, GPR142 is involved in nutrient sensing, particularly in response to dietary amino acids, and modulates the secretion of hormones that influence glucose metabolism (Lin2016GPR142). The receptor's activity is essential for the insulinotropic effects of L-Trp, as demonstrated by the absence of these effects in GPR142 knockout mice (Lin2016GPR142). GPR142 also influences glucagon secretion, with its expression being higher in glucagon-storing alpha-cells compared to beta-cells (Rudenko2019The). These functions highlight GPR142's potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes (Lin2016GPR142).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GPR142 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions, particularly in the context of metabolic disorders. GPR142 is significantly involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic β-cells, and its dysfunction can lead to impaired insulin secretion and glucose intolerance, which are key features of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (Lin2016GPR142; AlAmily2019The). Knockdown of GPR142 in β-cells is associated with increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, IFNγ, and MCP-1, which can negatively impact β-cell function and contribute to the pathogenesis of T2D (AlAmily2019The).

In cancer, GPR142 has been identified as having genomic variations, including missense mutations, deep deletions, and amplifications, across several cancer types such as esophageal carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. These mutations are associated with cancer progression, suggesting a potential role for GPR142 in oncogenesis (Kaushik2021PanCancer). The receptor's involvement in both metabolic and cancer-related pathways highlights its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target for these conditions.
