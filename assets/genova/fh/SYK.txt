# SYK

## Overview
SYK (spleen associated tyrosine kinase) is a gene that encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase protein, which plays a pivotal role in the signaling pathways of immune cells. The SYK protein is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells and is integral to the function of classical immunoreceptors, such as B cell receptors, T cell receptors, and Fc receptors. It is involved in various cellular processes, including calcium signaling, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and integrin-mediated adhesion and migration (Mócsai2010The). The protein's structure comprises two N-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and a C-terminal kinase domain, which are crucial for its activation and interaction with phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) (Sada2001Structure; Mócsai2010The). SYK's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are essential for its role in immune cell signaling and its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes (Mansueto2019A; de2011Regulation).

## Structure
The SYK (spleen associated tyrosine kinase) protein is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in immune cell signaling. Its molecular structure includes two N-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and a C-terminal kinase domain, separated by interdomain regions known as interdomain A and interdomain B (Sada2001Structure; Mansueto2019A). The SH2 domains are responsible for binding to phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), which is essential for SYK activation (Mócsai2010The).

The secondary structure of SYK features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall folding and stability. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a compact conformation, which is similar to the inhibited structure of the related Zap-70 kinase (AriasPalomo20073D). SYK can exist in a quaternary structure involving dimerization, although this is not always necessary for its function (AriasPalomo2009Conformational).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in SYK's activation and function. SYK undergoes autophosphorylation and can be phosphorylated by Src family kinases, which are critical for its activation and subsequent signaling pathways (Mansueto2019A). The protein also has splice variant isoforms that can affect its function and regulatory mechanisms (Mócsai2010The).

## Function
The SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in signal transduction in immune cells. SYK is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells and is involved in the signaling pathways of classical immunoreceptors such as B cell receptors (BCRs), T cell receptors (TCRs), and Fc receptors (FcRs) (Mócsai2010The). It is essential for the activation of downstream signaling molecules, including phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) isoforms and phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), leading to cellular responses such as calcium signaling and cytoskeletal rearrangement (Mócsai2010The).

SYK is also involved in integrin signal transduction, which is crucial for leukocyte adhesion and migration, platelet activation, and osteoclast development (Mócsai2010The). In vascular development, SYK is essential for the separation of lymphatic vessels from the general circulation, a process mediated by platelet activation and aggregation (Mócsai2010The). In bone metabolism, SYK is activated downstream of DAP12 and FcRγ, playing a role in osteoclast development and function (Mócsai2010The).

SYK's activity is regulated by its interaction with phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), which leads to its activation and subsequent phosphorylation of downstream targets (de2011Regulation). This kinase is also involved in maintaining vascular integrity and wound healing during embryogenesis (de2011Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SYK gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In diffuse gliomas, high SYK expression is associated with a malignant phenotype and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This is characterized by increased infiltration of immunosuppressive cells, such as M2 macrophages, and a correlation with immune checkpoint molecules, which may affect the efficacy of immunotherapy (Zhou2022SYK).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), SYK is overexpressed, particularly in unmutated cases, contributing to enhanced B-cell receptor signaling and cell survival. SYK inhibitors have shown potential in inducing apoptosis in CLL cells, suggesting SYK as a therapeutic target (Buchner2009Spleen).

SYK mutations, such as gain-of-function variants, are linked to inflammatory diseases. These mutations lead to hyperactivation of SYK and its downstream targets, contributing to immune dysregulation and chronic inflammation. The S550F variant, for example, is associated with increased phosphorylation of ERK and JNK, which are involved in inflammatory processes (Mehta2020Su1800).

SYK's role in various hematological malignancies, including leukemias and lymphomas, further underscores its clinical significance. Its dysregulation can lead to conditions like pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Mócsai2010The).

## Interactions
SYK (spleen associated tyrosine kinase) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in immune cell signaling through its interactions with various proteins. SYK interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) via its C-terminal SH2 domain, specifically binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues such as Tyr-317 on SYK. This interaction is essential for the activation of PI3K in response to signals from immune receptors like the B cell antigen receptor (Moon2005Molecular).

SYK also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl, which binds to phosphorylated Tyr-317, leading to SYK ubiquitination and potential degradation. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domains of Cbl-family proteins (Mócsai2010The; Geahlen2009Syk).

In B cells, SYK's phosphorylation dynamics influence its interactions with other proteins. For instance, serine/threonine phosphorylation in interdomain B is crucial for recruiting 14-3-3 proteins, with phospho-S297 being a key site for 14-3-3g binding. This interaction modulates SYK's recruitment to the plasma membrane and affects B cell receptor (BCR) signaling (Bohnenberger2011Complex).
