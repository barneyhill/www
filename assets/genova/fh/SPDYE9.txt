# SPDYE9

## Overview
SPDYE9 is a gene that encodes the protein known as speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member E9. This protein is part of the speedy/RINGO family, which is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. The SPDYE9 gene plays a crucial role in cell cycle progression by interacting with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), thereby influencing cell division and proliferation. The protein encoded by SPDYE9 is characterized by its ability to modulate the activity of CDKs, which are essential for the transition between different phases of the cell cycle. This regulatory function is critical for maintaining proper cell cycle control and ensuring genomic stability. Dysregulation of SPDYE9 expression or function can have significant implications for cellular growth and has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer (Qiu2020aarFDC).
