# SFRP5

## Overview
Secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (SFRP5) is a gene that encodes a member of the secreted frizzled-related protein family, which functions as a modulator of Wnt signaling pathways. The protein product, secreted frizzled-related protein 5, acts as a soluble decoy receptor, binding to Wnt ligands and preventing their interaction with cell surface receptors, thereby influencing processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. SFRP5 is primarily expressed in adipose tissue, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and regulating inflammation by inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals such as Wnt5a (Schulte2012ProInflammatory; Mori2012Secreted). Its involvement in various signaling pathways underscores its significance in metabolic regulation and its potential protective effects in conditions like coronary artery disease and certain cancers (Su2010Epigenetic; Tong2020Expression).

## Structure


## Function
Secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (SFRP5) is involved in modulating Wnt signaling pathways, acting as a soluble decoy receptor that binds to Wnt ligands, thereby preventing their interaction with cell surface receptors. This regulation is crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and adipogenesis. In healthy human cells, SFRP5 is primarily active in adipose tissue, where it plays a role in maintaining metabolic balance by influencing mitochondrial metabolism and adipocyte function (Mori2012Secreted).

SFRP5 is expressed in the cytoplasm of mature adipocytes and is associated with the extracellular matrix, suggesting it functions in an autocrine or paracrine manner (Wang2014SFRP5; Schulte2012ProInflammatory). It has been shown to inhibit the pro-inflammatory Wnt5a, which is secreted by macrophages in adipose tissue, indicating a protective role against inflammation (Schulte2012ProInflammatory). SFRP5's involvement in Wnt signaling pathways also suggests its role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, impacting overall metabolic processes (Tong2020Expression).

In the context of coronary artery disease, SFRP5 has been noted for its potential protective effects by ameliorating Wnt5a-induced endothelial dysfunction, highlighting its role in maintaining endothelial health (Tong2020Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The SFRP5 gene is clinically significant due to its role in various cancers, particularly ovarian cancer. In ovarian cancer, SFRP5 is often epigenetically silenced through promoter hypermethylation, which is associated with the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. This silencing contributes to a malignant phenotype and increased chemoresistance, particularly to drugs like cisplatin (Su2010Epigenetic). Restoring SFRP5 expression in ovarian cancer cells has been shown to suppress cancer cell growth, invasion, and tumorigenicity, and to sensitize cells to chemotherapy (Su2010Epigenetic). The methylation status of SFRP5 could serve as a prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer (Su2010Epigenetic).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the methylation status of SFRP5 is associated with the clinical response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Patients with methylated SFRP5 have a significantly shorter progression-free survival compared to those with unmethylated SFRP5, suggesting its potential as a predictive biomarker for TKI therapy response (Zhu2012DNA).

SFRP5 is also implicated in other cancers, such as breast and renal cancer, where its downregulation through methylation is linked to poor survival outcomes and increased tumorigenicity (Surana2014Secreted).

## Interactions
SFRP5 (secreted frizzled-related protein 5) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various signaling pathways. One of its primary interactions is with Wnt proteins, particularly Wnt5a and Wnt11, where SFRP5 acts as an inhibitor by binding to these ligands and preventing their interaction with Frizzled receptors. This inhibition affects both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, impacting processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation (Chen2017Recombinant; Liu2018The).

SFRP5 also interacts with Slurp1, a protein involved in lipid metabolism. This interaction has been shown to regulate triglyceride accumulation in hepatocyte steatosis models. In HepG2 cells, Slurp1 promotes SFRP5 expression, and the suppression of SFRP5 reduces Slurp1's ability to decrease triglyceride levels, indicating a functional interaction between these proteins in lipid metabolism (Zhao2019Sfrp5).

Additionally, SFRP5 has been implicated in modulating inflammation through its interaction with the JNK signaling pathway. By inhibiting the binding of Wnt5a to its receptors, SFRP5 reduces JNK activation, which in turn decreases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and improves insulin resistance (Liu2018The).
