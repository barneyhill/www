# GAMT

## Overview
The GAMT gene encodes the enzyme guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase, a critical component in the biosynthesis of creatine, which is essential for energy metabolism in tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain and muscles (HannaElDaher2015Mild; Sinclair2016A). This enzyme, categorized as a methyltransferase, facilitates the conversion of guanidinoacetate to creatine, utilizing S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor. The activity of guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase is primarily localized in the liver and kidneys, where it plays a pivotal role in maintaining normal cerebral creatine levels, crucial for ATP regeneration and neurotransmission (Jomura2022Processing). Mutations in the GAMT gene can lead to guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency, a disorder marked by cerebral creatine deficiency and associated with various neurological symptoms (Rossi2021Intellectual; MercimekMahmutoglu2006GAMT).

## Function
The GAMT gene encodes the enzyme guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of creatine, a compound essential for energy metabolism in tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain and muscles (HannaElDaher2015Mild; Sinclair2016A). In healthy human cells, GAMT catalyzes the conversion of guanidinoacetate (GAA) to creatine, using S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor. This process is vital for maintaining normal cerebral creatine levels, which are necessary for ATP regeneration and buffering, as well as proper neurotransmission in the central nervous system (HannaElDaher2015Mild; Jomura2022Processing).

Creatine synthesized by GAMT is involved in energy storage and supply, impacting cellular energy metabolism and overall organismal energy homeostasis (Aksentijević2020AgeDependent). In the brain, creatine is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis and supporting normal brain development and function (HannaElDaher2015Mild). The enzyme's activity is primarily located in the liver and kidneys, where it facilitates the conversion of GAA to creatine, which is then transported to other tissues (Jomura2022Processing). This enzymatic function is critical for preventing the accumulation of GAA, which can be toxic and lead to neurological disorders if not properly regulated (HannaElDaher2015Mild).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GAMT gene lead to guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT-D), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cerebral creatine deficiency. This condition results in a range of clinical manifestations, including intellectual disability, developmental delay, epilepsy, and movement disorders such as dystonia and ataxia (Rossi2021Intellectual; MercimekMahmutoglu2006GAMT). Patients with GAMT-D often exhibit elevated levels of guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) and reduced creatine levels in bodily fluids, which are key biochemical markers of the disorder (MercimekMahmutoglu2006GAMT).

The severity of GAMT-D symptoms can vary, and there is no clear correlation between specific mutations and clinical outcomes, suggesting that other genetic or epigenetic factors may influence the phenotype (MercimekMahmutoglu2006GAMT; Nasrallah2010Creatine). Common mutations include c.59G>C and c.327G>A, among others (MercimekMahmutoglu2006GAMT). Treatment typically involves creatine supplementation and dietary modifications to reduce GAA levels, which can improve some symptoms if initiated early, although intellectual disability often remains unchanged (Viau2013EvidenceBased; MercimekMahmutoglu2006GAMT). Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for better outcomes, as demonstrated in presymptomatic cases (Schulze2006Presymptomatic).
