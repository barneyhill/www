# OR4N2

## Overview
The OR4N2 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily N member 2, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a critical role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating intracellular signaling pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Raka2021Human). The OR4N2 gene exhibits copy-number variations, contributing to the diversity of olfactory receptors and influencing individual olfactory perception (Hasin2008High-Resolution). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR4N2 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including its potential as a prognostic biomarker in gastric cancer and its involvement in genetic studies related to autism spectrum disorder and other conditions (Wang2020Integrated; Ünsel2020The). Despite these associations, the precise clinical significance of OR4N2 remains an area of active research.

## Function
The OR4N2 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants. Upon binding, OR4N2 undergoes a conformational change that activates intracellular signaling pathways, leading to the perception of smell (Raka2021Human). This process involves the dissociation of G-protein subunits and the generation of second messengers such as cyclic AMP (cAMP) and calcium ions, which are essential for transmitting the signal to the brain (Raka2021Human).

In healthy human cells, the OR4N2 protein contributes to the functional diversity of the olfactory system, allowing for the detection of a wide range of odorants. This diversity is partly due to copy-number variations (CNVs) affecting the OR4N2 gene, which can lead to differences in olfactory receptor gene dosages among individuals (Hasin2008High-Resolution). These variations may influence individual olfactory perception and contribute to the unique olfactory experiences of each person (Hasin2008High-Resolution).

## Clinical Significance
The OR4N2 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in various conditions through alterations in its expression and copy number variations (CNVs). In stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), high expression levels of OR4N2 have been associated with increased mortality, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer (Wang2020Integrated). In the context of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), OR4N2 was identified as one of the genes with multiple mutations, although its specific clinical significance in EOC remains unclear (Zhang2019Nextgeneration).

In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), OR4N2 has been mentioned as part of a CNV, specifically a 213 kb duplication at 14q11.2, which was maternally inherited. However, the clinical significance of this duplication in relation to ASD is not well-defined (Ünsel2020The). Additionally, OR4N2 has been noted in genetic studies involving chromosomal duplications, but without specific disease associations (Goobie2008Molecular). Overall, while OR4N2 is implicated in various conditions, its precise role and clinical significance require further investigation.
