# WHAMM

## Overview
The WHAMM gene encodes the WASP homolog associated with actin, Golgi membranes, and microtubules, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and membrane dynamics. As a member of the WASP family of nucleation-promoting factors, WHAMM is integral to actin filament assembly and membrane trafficking, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The protein is characterized by its ability to interact with both microtubules and actin filaments, facilitating cytoskeletal crosstalk essential for processes such as autophagosome biogenesis and intracellular transport. WHAMM's structural domains, including the WHAMM membrane-interacting domain (WMD), coiled-coil (CC) domain, and PWCA domain, enable it to bind to microtubules and membranes, coordinating membrane tubulation and vesicle trafficking. Mutations in the WHAMM gene have been linked to Galloway-Mowat syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases (Shen2012Structural; Campellone2008WHAMM; Mathiowetz2017An).

## Structure
The WHAMM protein is a member of the WASP family of nucleation-promoting factors and is involved in cytoskeletal coordination during membrane remodeling. It consists of several distinct domains: an N-terminal WHAMM membrane-interacting domain (WMD), a central coiled-coil (CC) domain, and a C-terminal PWCA domain. The WMD is responsible for membrane interaction, while the CC domain mediates binding to microtubules (MTs) (Liu2017Structural; Shen2012Structural).

The WHAMM protein binds to MTs through its CC domain, which interacts with tubulin heterodimers along protofilaments in a head-to-tail fashion. This interaction is characterized by electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged E-hooks of tubulin (Shen2012Structural). The microtubule-binding motif (MBM) within the MT-binding domain (MTBD) of WHAMM forms an ordered assembly around taxol-stabilized MTs, distinguishing between α and β-tubulins (Liu2017Structural).

WHAMM's structure allows it to act as a physical link between MTs and membranes, with the WMD binding to phospholipids and potentially recruiting and deforming liposomes (Shen2012Structural). The presence of MTs decreases WHAMM's ability to stimulate Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly, suggesting a regulatory mechanism where MT binding affects its actin nucleation activity (Shen2012Structural).

## Function
The WHAMM gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and membrane trafficking in healthy human cells. WHAMM functions as a nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) for the Arp2/3 complex, facilitating actin filament assembly. It localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in autophagosome biogenesis and ER to Golgi transport (Kast2015WHAMM; Campellone2008WHAMM). WHAMM promotes actin polymerization on autolysosomes, which is essential for autolysosome tubulation and recycling, a process critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Dai2019WHAMM).

WHAMM's interaction with microtubules and actin filaments allows it to mediate cytoskeletal crosstalk during membrane movement. It binds to microtubules through its coiled-coil domain and to membranes via its WMD domain, coordinating membrane tubulation and vesicle trafficking (Campellone2008WHAMM; Shen2012Structural). WHAMM's ability to recruit the Arp2/3 complex to the ER and facilitate actin comet tail formation is crucial for autophagosome formation and function (Kast2015WHAMM). This protein's activities are vital for processes such as autophagy, membrane remodeling, and intracellular transport, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal homeostasis (Mathiowetz2017An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WHAMM gene have been implicated in Galloway-Mowat syndrome (GMS), particularly in the Amish population. This genetic disorder is characterized by neurological abnormalities and progressive kidney dysfunction. A specific 7bp deletion in the WHAMM gene leads to defects in autophagy, a crucial cellular process for degrading and recycling cellular components. This defect results in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated protein aggregates, contributing to the disease phenotype (Mathiowetz2017An). 

In Amish GMS patients, WHAMM mutations often occur alongside WDR73 mutations, leading to severe defects in autophagy and cytoskeletal irregularities. The mutations result in truncated WHAMM proteins that lack essential motifs for actin nucleation, disrupting normal protein function and contributing to the clinical features of the syndrome (Mathiowetz2017An).

Alterations in WHAMM expression have also been associated with other conditions, such as systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis and lupus-like diseases in dogs (Mathiowetz2017An). Additionally, WHAMM's role in apoptosis suggests that changes in its expression or function could impact apoptotic processes, potentially influencing conditions where apoptosis is dysregulated, such as cancer (King2021The).

## Interactions
The WHAMM protein interacts with several key components of the cytoskeleton and cellular membranes. It binds directly to microtubules through its coiled-coil domain, as demonstrated in cosedimentation assays, and this interaction is crucial for its role in membrane tubulation and dynamics (Shen2012Structural; Campellone2008WHAMM). WHAMM also interacts with the Arp2/3 complex, a critical player in actin polymerization. This interaction is mediated by WHAMM's WCA domain, which is essential for actin assembly at the Golgi and along tubular membranes (Campellone2008WHAMM).

WHAMM's interaction with microtubules can inhibit its actin nucleation function, suggesting a regulatory mechanism where microtubules control WHAMM's nucleation-promoting factor activity (Shen2012Structural). The protein's N-terminal domain binds to phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols, facilitating its association with membranes (Campellone2008WHAMM). WHAMM is also involved in recruiting the Arp2/3 complex to sites of autophagosome formation on the endoplasmic reticulum, where it harnesses actin polymerization forces for membrane formation and autophagosome movement (Kast2015WHAMM). These interactions highlight WHAMM's role in coordinating the activities of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons during membrane remodeling and vesicle trafficking.
