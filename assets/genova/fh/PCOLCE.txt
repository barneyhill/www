# PCOLCE

## Overview
The PCOLCE gene encodes the procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer protein, a glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in collagen maturation by enhancing the activity of procollagen C-proteinase. This protein is primarily involved in the extracellular matrix, where it facilitates the cleavage of C-terminal propeptides from procollagen types I, II, and III, thus promoting the formation of mature collagen fibrils. The procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer is characterized by its CUB domains, which are crucial for its interaction with the C-propeptide of type I procollagen, and its COOH-terminal domain, which shares homology with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (Bányai1999The; Scott1999Structural). This protein is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues, such as tendons and bones, and is particularly active in tissues undergoing remodeling (Steiglitz2006Procollagen; Takahara1994Type). The expression of PCOLCE is notably high in collagen-rich tissues, underscoring its significant role in these areas (Takahara1994Type).

## Structure
The PCOLCE protein, encoded by the human PCOLCE gene, is a glycoprotein that enhances the activity of procollagen C-proteinase, crucial for collagen maturation. The protein is initially synthesized as a precursor with a molecular weight of approximately 47,946 Da, which is processed to a mature form of about 45,523 Da (Takahara1994Type). The mature protein contains two conserved N-glycosylation sites, contributing to its post-translational modifications (Takahara1994Type).

PCOLCE features two NH2-terminal CUB domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and are encoded by exons 2 through 6 (Scott1999Structural). These domains facilitate binding to the COOH-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen, enhancing its cleavage by procollagen C-proteinase (Scott1999Structural). The COOH-terminal domain of PCOLCE is homologous to the N-terminal domains of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and is characterized by a pattern of six conserved cysteines, likely forming disulfide bonds (Bányai1999The).

The protein exists in multiple forms, including a 55-kDa glycoprotein and smaller 36-kDa and 34-kDa proteins derived from partial proteolysis of the 55-kDa form (Takahara1994Type). These smaller forms retain full enhancing activity, indicating functional conservation despite structural modifications (Takahara1994Type).

## Function
The PCOLCE gene encodes the procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer protein, which plays a crucial role in the maturation of collagen, a major component of connective tissues. This protein enhances the activity of procollagen C-proteinase, an enzyme responsible for cleaving the C-terminal propeptides of procollagen types I, II, and III, facilitating the formation of collagen fibrils (Takahara1994Type; Scott1999Structural). The enhancer protein binds specifically to the C-propeptide of type I procollagen, likely mediated by CUB domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions (Takahara1994Type).

PCOLCE is primarily active in the extracellular matrix, where it contributes to tissue development and repair by ensuring proper collagen fibril formation. This process is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues, such as tendons and bones, which are rich in collagen (Steiglitz2006Procollagen; Takahara1994Type). The protein's activity is particularly significant in tissues undergoing remodeling, where it supports the dynamic homeostasis of the extracellular matrix (Guo2023High). The expression of PCOLCE is highest in collagen-rich tissues, indicating its primary role in these areas rather than in the brain (Takahara1994Type).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and localization of the PCOLCE gene have been implicated in several diseases. In oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), PCOLCE is down-regulated and mislocalized, leading to its nuclear entrapment and depletion from the extracellular matrix (ECM). This mislocalization is associated with muscle fibrosis and degeneration, as PCOLCE preferentially binds to the mutant expPABPN1, contributing to the disease's pathology (Raz2013Nuclear).

In osteosarcoma, PCOLCE is upregulated by the transcription factor TWIST1, promoting metastasis. The N-glycosylation of PCOLCE at Asn29 is crucial for its stability and secretion, with mutations at this site reducing metastatic potential. High PCOLCE expression is linked to enhanced cell migration and invasion, indicating its role in cancer progression (Wang2019Upregulation).

In glioma, high PCOLCE expression correlates with poor prognosis and is associated with immune infiltration. It is linked to immune checkpoints and various immune markers, suggesting a role in tumor immunity and progression (Guo2023High). PCOLCE is also implicated in gastric cancer, where its high expression is associated with poorer prognosis and immune infiltration (Xiang2020PCOLCE).

## Interactions
PCOLCE, or procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer, is known for its role in enhancing the activity of procollagen C-proteinases, such as bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1), which are crucial for collagen maturation. PCOLCE interacts specifically with the C-propeptide region of procollagen molecules. This interaction is facilitated by the CUB domains of PCOLCE, which bind to the C-propeptide, potentially inducing a conformational change that makes the cleavage site more accessible to the enzyme (Takahara1994Type; Bourhis2013Procollagen).

PCOLCE also interacts with other extracellular matrix components. The NTR domain of PCOLCE binds to heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), anchoring it to the cell membrane and enhancing the pericellular activity of procollagen C-proteinases (Weiss2010Binding). This interaction is calcium-dependent and occurs with high affinity, suggesting a significant role in regulating collagen deposition in tissues (Weiss2014The).

In the context of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), PCOLCE is found to interact with the mutant form of poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (expPABPN1), leading to its nuclear entrapment and extracellular depletion, which is associated with muscle degeneration (Raz2013Nuclear).
