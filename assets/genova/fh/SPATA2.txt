# SPATA2

## Overview
SPATA2, or spermatogenesis associated 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses. The SPATA2 protein functions as an adaptor, facilitating the recruitment of the deubiquitinase CYLD to the TNF receptor 1 signaling complex, which is pivotal in modulating TNF-induced apoptosis and necroptosis (Masola2022The; Kupka2016SPATA2Mediated). It is characterized by its PUB domain, which enables interactions with other proteins, such as CYLD and HOIP, components of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), thereby influencing NF-κB signaling pathways (Elliott2016SPATA2; Wei2017SPATA2). Beyond its role in immune regulation, SPATA2 is also significant in male fertility, with its deletion linked to reduced testis size and sperm count, underscoring its importance in spermatogenesis (Masola2022The). The protein's involvement in various signaling pathways highlights its potential impact on conditions such as colorectal cancer and inflammatory diseases, making it a subject of interest for therapeutic research (Ren2021Spata2; Tan2022SPATA2).

## Structure
The SPATA2 protein is characterized by its involvement in protein-protein interactions, primarily through its PUB domain, which binds to the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) domain of CYLD, facilitating deubiquitination processes (Wei2017SPATA2; Schlicher2017SPATA2:). This interaction is crucial for regulating RIPK1-dependent apoptosis and necroptosis (Wei2017SPATA2). The SPATA2 protein also contains a PUB-interacting motif (PIM) that interacts with the PUB domain of HOIP, with a critical amino acid, Y338, essential for this interaction (Schlicher2017SPATA2:).

In terms of secondary structure, the SPATA2 protein in Clarias magur, a model organism, has regions composed primarily of alpha helices, particularly in the first conserved region of 220 amino acids (Agarwal2018Molecular). The protein is predominantly hydrophilic, with a hydrophobic N-terminal region, suggesting it may be membrane-associated (Agarwal2018Molecular).

SPATA2 is known to exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function and interactions, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Yang2019PLK). The protein's role in various signaling pathways highlights its importance in cellular processes, including inflammation and cell death regulation (Ren2021Spata2).

## Function
SPATA2 (spermatogenesis associated 2) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses through its involvement in the TNF receptor signaling pathway. It acts as an adaptor protein that facilitates the recruitment of the deubiquitinase CYLD to the TNF receptor 1 signaling complex (TNFR1-SC), which is essential for modulating TNF-induced cell death processes such as apoptosis and necroptosis (Masola2022The; Kupka2016SPATA2Mediated). SPATA2 enhances the enzymatic activity of CYLD, leading to the deubiquitylation of key signaling components like RIPK1, thereby attenuating TNFα-triggered signaling pathways (Masola2022The; Wei2017SPATA2).

SPATA2 is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in the formation of a complex with CYLD and HOIP, a component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of NF-κB signaling, which influences cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis (Elliott2016SPATA2; Kupka2016SPATA2Mediated). The protein's role in spermatogenesis has been highlighted by studies showing that its deletion leads to significant reductions in testis size and spermatozoa count, indicating its importance in male fertility (Masola2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SPATA2 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), SPATA2 is identified as a regulator of chemokines such as CXCL10, which are crucial for T cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. Overexpression of SPATA2 is associated with reduced T cell infiltration, contributing to immune evasion and resistance to PD-1 blockade therapies in CRC. Targeting SPATA2 could potentially enhance T cell infiltration and improve responses to immunotherapy in PD-1-resistant tumors (Tan2022SPATA2).

In the context of male fertility, SPATA2 plays a significant role in spermatogenesis. Deletion of SPATA2 in mice results in reduced testis size, decreased sperm count, and altered hormone levels, indicating its importance in male reproductive health. Lower expression of SPATA2 has been associated with conditions such as oligozoospermia and azoospermia in humans (Zhao2017Deletion).

SPATA2 is also involved in inflammatory responses. Its deficiency can lead to increased activation of inflammatory pathways, such as NF-κB and MAPK, and exacerbate conditions like systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (Wei2017SPATA2; Ren2021Spata2).

## Interactions
SPATA2 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. It contains a PUB domain interacting motif (PIM) that facilitates its interaction with the PUB domain of HOIP, a component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC). This interaction is essential for recruiting the deubiquitinase CYLD to the TNFR1 signaling complex, influencing cell fate decisions upon TNF stimulation (Elliott2016SPATA2; Kupka2016SPATA2Mediated). The interaction between SPATA2 and HOIP is characterized by an affinity of 0.9 mM, and the PIM sequence is highly conserved across species (Kupka2016SPATA2Mediated).

SPATA2 also interacts with CYLD through its N terminus, binding to the USP domain of CYLD. This interaction is characterized by a high affinity, with a dissociation constant of 96 nM, and is crucial for CYLD's activation and function in regulating LUBAC-mediated signaling (Elliott2016SPATA2). SPATA2 acts as a scaffold protein, linking CYLD to LUBAC and controlling the ubiquitination processes following TNF treatment (Elliott2016SPATA2). SPATA2's role in these interactions highlights its importance in modulating inflammatory responses and cell death pathways.
