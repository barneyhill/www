# ZSWIM5

## Overview
ZSWIM5 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger SWIM-type containing 5 protein, which is characterized by the presence of a SWIM domain. This domain is a specialized zinc finger motif that is implicated in DNA or protein interactions, suggesting a role in nuclear processes (Xu2018A). The ZSWIM5 protein is composed of 1188 amino acids and is predominantly localized in the nucleus, indicating its potential involvement in regulatory functions within the cell (Xu2018A). The protein exhibits a high degree of evolutionary conservation, with a 96% similarity between mouse and human homologs, underscoring its potential importance in fundamental biological processes (Xu2018A). While the precise biological functions of ZSWIM5 remain to be fully elucidated, its structural features and localization suggest it may play a role in transcriptional regulation or other nuclear activities (Chang2020Developmental).

## Structure
The ZSWIM5 protein is a zinc finger SWIM-type containing protein, characterized by a SWIM domain with a CxCxnCxH motif, which is predicted to interact with DNA or proteins (Xu2018A). This domain is structurally similar to the zinc-finger motif and is thought to have a ββα structure, akin to the classic C2H2 zinc-finger (Chang2020Developmental). The SWIM domain is located between amino acids 222-259 of the 1188-amino acid-long protein (Chang2020Developmental). The protein shows a high degree of homology between mouse and human versions, with 96% similarity (Xu2018A).

The primary structure of ZSWIM5 consists of 1188 amino acids, and the protein is predicted to localize to the nucleus, suggesting a role in nuclear processes (Xu2018A). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of the SWIM domain indicates a potential for complex folding patterns typical of zinc-finger proteins. The SWIM domain's involvement in various biological processes, such as MuDR transposition in plants and MEK kinase signaling in animals, suggests functional versatility (Chang2020Developmental). However, detailed information on post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms is not available in the provided context.
