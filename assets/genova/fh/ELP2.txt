# ELP2

## Overview
The ELP2 gene encodes the elongator acetyltransferase complex subunit 2, a non-enzymatic scaffold protein that is integral to the function of the Elongator complex. This complex is involved in tRNA modification, specifically the formation of 5-carboxymethyl-uridine (cm5U) at the wobble position of tRNAs, which is crucial for accurate protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis. ELP2, characterized by its WD40 domains, facilitates the structural integrity and assembly of the Elongator complex, particularly the Elp123 subcomplex, by mediating protein-protein interactions. The protein's role extends beyond tRNA modification, as it is also implicated in the regulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, influencing processes such as osteoblast differentiation and inflammatory responses. Mutations in the ELP2 gene are linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in normal brain development and function (Kojic2021Elp2; Xu2015Quantitative).

## Structure
The ELP2 protein, a component of the Elongator complex, plays a crucial role in tRNA modification and transcriptional elongation. Its primary structure is encoded by the ELP2 gene, which consists of eight exons and spans approximately 23 kb. The ELP2 protein is initiated at the first methionine of exon 3b (Ninomiya1995Genomic). 

The secondary structure of ELP2 includes WD40 domains, which are important for its structural integrity and protein-protein interactions (Kojic2021Elp2). These domains contribute to the protein's ability to act as a scaffold within the Elongator complex, facilitating interactions with other subunits such as Elp3 (Kojic2021Elp2).

In terms of tertiary structure, ELP2's overall 3D shape is stabilized by interactions within its WD40 domains. The quaternary structure involves its assembly with other elongator subunits, forming a dimer of trimers in the Elp123 sub-complex (Kojic2021Elp2).

ELP2 is subject to post-translational modifications, including potential phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions. The protein also exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing and differential promoter usage, contributing to its functional diversity (Ninomiya1995Genomic).

## Function
The ELP2 gene encodes a subunit of the Elongator complex, which is crucial for tRNA modification, specifically the formation of 5-carboxymethyl-uridine (cm5U) in the wobble base position of tRNAs. This modification is essential for proper ribosomal function during translational elongation, affecting tRNA binding, recognition, and translocation (Kojic2021Elp2). ELP2 acts as a scaffold protein within the Elongator complex, maintaining its stability and function, although it does not possess any detectable enzymatic activity (Kojic2021Elp2). The Elongator complex, including ELP2, is involved in modifying tRNA molecules, which is crucial for accurate protein synthesis and maintaining protein homeostasis (Kojic2021Elp2).

In healthy human cells, ELP2 is vital for the stability and function of the Elongator complex, particularly the Elp123 subcomplex, which is necessary for tRNA modification activity (Kojic2021Elp2). The Elongator complex's role in tRNA modification helps maintain protein homeostasis by ensuring accurate translation and folding of proteins, which is critical for normal brain development and function (Kojic2021Elp2). ELP2 is also involved in pathways related to protein synthesis and degradation, and its dysfunction can lead to neurodegeneration and myelin loss (Kojic2021Elp2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ELP2 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and developmental delay. These mutations can lead to severe phenotypes such as microcephaly, motor impairments, hypotonia, spasticity, and cerebral palsy. MRI scans of affected individuals often reveal microcephaly, severe brain atrophy, loss of white matter, and a thin corpus callosum (Kojic2021Elp2). The ELP2 gene is part of the Elongator complex, which is crucial for tRNA modifications. Mutations in ELP2 disrupt the stability of the Elp2 protein, impairing the Elongator complex's activity and affecting translation via tRNA modification. This disruption leads to impaired neurogenesis, myelin loss, and neurodegeneration (Kojic2021Elp2).

Mouse models with ELP2 mutations replicate many of these human phenotypes, including developmental delay and microcephaly, and show defects in brain connectivity and neuronal morphogenesis (Kojic2021Elp2). Additionally, ELP2 mutations have been linked to hereditary spastic paraplegias, characterized by lower limb spasticity and weakness (Sager2021HACE1). These findings underscore the critical role of ELP2 in neurodevelopment and its potential involvement in various neurological conditions.

## Interactions
ELP2, a component of the Elongator complex, plays a crucial role in various protein interactions essential for its function. It acts as a scaffold within the Elongator complex, which includes other subunits such as ELP1 and ELP3. ELP2 is necessary for the stability and assembly of the Elongator complex, particularly the Elp123 subcomplex, which is involved in tRNA modification (Kojic2021Elp2). 

ELP2 interacts with ELP1 and ELP3, forming the core of the Elongator complex. This interaction is vital for the complex's assembly and function. Mutations in ELP1 that affect its ability to bind ELP2 and ELP3 can disrupt the formation of the Elongator complex, highlighting the importance of these interactions (Xu2015Dimerization).

In addition to its role in the Elongator complex, ELP2 is involved in the regulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. It interacts with proteins such as STAT3 and JAK1, suggesting a regulatory role in osteoblast differentiation and response to inflammatory signals like TNF-α (Xu2015Quantitative). These interactions indicate that ELP2 has a broader role in cellular processes beyond its function in the Elongator complex.
