# RNPS1

## Overview
RNPS1 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding protein with serine rich domain 1, a crucial component in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA processing. This protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a serine-rich domain, which facilitate its role as a general activator of splicing in human cells (Mayeda1999Purification). RNPS1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it associates with nuclear speckles and active spliceosomes, indicating its involvement in RNA processing (Mayeda1999Purification). Additionally, RNPS1 is implicated in the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, acting as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that interacts with the hUpf protein complex to degrade mRNAs containing premature stop codons (LykkeAndersen2001Communication). Beyond its fundamental roles in RNA metabolism, RNPS1 is also involved in maintaining genomic stability and has been linked to various clinical conditions, including ischemic brain injury and cancer, highlighting its significance in both cellular function and disease (Wang2024RNPS1; Zhang2020RNPS1).

## Structure
The RNPS1 protein is characterized by a single RNA recognition motif (RRM) with conserved RNP-1 and RNP-2 submotifs, which are typical features of RNA-binding proteins (Mayeda1999Purification). This RRM is distantly related to the RRMs of SR proteins and more closely resembles the RRM of the hnRNP C protein (Mayeda1999Purification). The protein also contains an extensive serine-rich domain (S domain) and a C-terminal presumptive nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Mayeda1999Purification). A conserved decapeptide motif, KHMDGGQIDG, is located near the C-terminus of the RRM, just downstream of the RNP-1 submotif, and serves as a distinctive signature for RNPS1-like proteins (Mayeda1999Purification).

RNPS1 is approximately 50 kDa in size when expressed in HeLa cells and baculovirus-infected insect cells, but appears smaller (~42 kDa) when expressed in Escherichia coli, possibly due to a lack of post-translational modifications or truncation (Mayeda1999Purification). Post-translational modifications, likely phosphorylation, affect the electrophoretic mobility of RNPS1, suggesting structural changes (Mayeda1999Purification). The protein is predominantly nuclear and shows a speckled nuclear pattern, colocalizing with the SR protein SC35, indicating its involvement in splicing complexes (Mayeda1999Purification).

## Function
RNPS1 is a crucial RNA-binding protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing, primarily functioning as a general activator of this process in human cells. It is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it associates with nuclear speckles and active spliceosomes, indicating its role in RNA processing (Mayeda1999Purification). RNPS1 contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a serine-rich domain, which are essential for its function in RNA binding and splicing regulation (Mayeda1999Purification).

RNPS1 activates both constitutive and alternative splicing by enhancing the use of 3' splice sites in pre-mRNA, and it shows a strong synergistic effect with SR proteins like SF2/ASF, enhancing splicing activity significantly (Mayeda1999Purification). It is also involved in the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, where it acts as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, interacting with the hUpf protein complex to help degrade mRNAs containing premature stop codons (LykkeAndersen2001Communication).

RNPS1 plays a role in maintaining genomic stability by preventing the formation of R-loops, which can lead to DNA damage. It complements the function of other splicing factors, such as ASF/SF2, in preventing transcription-induced genomic instability (Li2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RNPS1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly ischemic brain injury and cancer. In the context of ischemic stroke, RNPS1 expression is significantly upregulated, and its knockdown has been shown to exacerbate brain injury and increase neuronal death. This suggests that RNPS1 plays a protective role in mitigating neuronal apoptosis during ischemic conditions (Zhang2020RNPS1).

In cancer, particularly head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), RNPS1 is upregulated and contributes to tumor progression by stabilizing the NAT10 protein. This stabilization enhances tRNA ac4C modifications, which are crucial for efficient translation of cancer-related genes. Knockdown of RNPS1 in HNSCC cells results in reduced tumor growth and proliferation, indicating its role in promoting malignancy (Wang2024RNPS1).

RNPS1 is also associated with neurodevelopmental disorders through its involvement in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. Copy number variants (CNVs) involving RNPS1 and other NMD genes have been linked to intellectual disabilities and congenital anomalies, suggesting that dosage imbalances in these genes may contribute to such disorders (Nguyen2013Contribution).

## Interactions
RNPS1 is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA processing. It interacts with the SART3 tumor-rejection antigen, forming a complex that regulates alternative splicing. This interaction is specific, as demonstrated by coexpression studies in 293T cells, where SART3 and RNPS1 together influence splice-site selection in a chimeric pre-mRNA model (Harada2001Binding).

RNPS1 also interacts with several splicing-related proteins, including p54, hTra2β, and pinin. These interactions occur through distinct domains of RNPS1: the S domain for p54, the RS/P domain for hTra2β, and the RRM for pinin. These interactions are crucial for RNPS1's role in alternative splicing regulation, as they influence exon skipping and inclusion in a substrate-specific manner (Sakashita2004Human).

In the context of mRNA surveillance, RNPS1 is a component of the exon-exon junction complex (EJC) and interacts with the human Upf complex, which is central to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). This interaction highlights RNPS1's role in marking exon-exon junctions and influencing mRNA decay (LykkeAndersen2001Communication).
