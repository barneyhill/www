# RBSN

## Overview
The RBSN gene encodes the protein rabenosyn, a key player in the endosomal trafficking system. Rabenosyn is categorized as a RAB effector protein, which is integral to the endolysosomal pathway, facilitating the sorting and transport of endocytosed materials within cells. The protein is characterized by its FYVE domain, which is crucial for binding phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) and targeting rabenosyn to early endocytic membranes. This interaction is essential for the protein's role in endosomal maturation and fusion processes. Rabenosyn interacts with several proteins, including RAB5, and is involved in the recycling of mannose-6-phosphate receptors and the trafficking of transferrin receptors. Clinically, mutations in the RBSN gene have been linked to various disorders, including non-small cell lung cancer and a novel Mendelian disorder characterized by neurological and developmental abnormalities (Stockler2014Single; Guo2024Rabenosyn5; Paul2021RABENOSYN).

## Structure
The RBSN protein, also known as rabenosyn, is characterized by its FYVE domain, which is essential for its function in endosomal recycling. This domain contains a highly conserved R+HHC+XCG motif that specifically recognizes phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), targeting RBSN to early endocytic membranes (Paul2021RABENOSYN). The FYVE domain's structure includes a beta hairpin formed by C- and N-beta strands connected by a loop, with Arginine 180 being crucial for PI3P binding. Glycine 183, while not directly interacting with PI3P, maintains the structural integrity of the beta hairpin loop (Paul2021RABENOSYN).

RBSN is a multi-domain protein, consisting of six annotated domains, and interacts with several protein partners, including RAB5, a regulator of endosome biogenesis (Paul2021RABENOSYN). The protein's structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its tertiary structure. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may affect its function and interactions (Guo2024Rabenosyn5). The protein's FYVE domain is known to bind phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, a lipid product of PI3K (III), indicating its role in vesicle trafficking at different membrane domains (Abe2009Membrane).

## Function
Rabenosyn (RBSN) is a conserved endosomal protein that plays a critical role in the endolysosomal pathway, which is essential for the sorting and transport of endocytosed material in human cells. RBSN is recruited to the early endosome (EE) surface through its FYVE domain, which binds to phosphoinositide substrates like phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). This binding is crucial for the translocation of RBSN to early endosomes, facilitating endosomal maturation and subsequent fusion with lysosomes for targeted degradation (Paul2021RABENOSYN).

In healthy cells, RBSN is involved in both the recycling of cargo back to the cell membrane and the degradation of cargo in lysosomes. It plays a role in the recycling of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptors, which are important for the transport and maturation of lysosomal enzymes like Cathepsin D (CTSD) (Paul2021RABENOSYN). RBSN's function includes ensuring timely endosomal maturation and proper lysosomal degradation of cargo, which is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing neurodegenerative conditions (Paul2021RABENOSYN). The protein's activity is primarily localized to early endosomes, where it influences endosomal recycling and lysosomal degradation processes (Paul2021RABENOSYN).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RBSN gene have significant clinical implications. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), low expression of Rabenosyn-5 (Rbsn) is associated with poor prognosis and increased metastasis. Rbsn acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for CDC42, a small Rho GTPase involved in cell motility. By inhibiting CDC42 activity, Rbsn reduces cancer cell migration and invasion, suggesting its role as an inhibitory factor in NSCLC progression (Guo2024Rabenosyn5).

In a separate context, specific missense mutations in the RBSN gene, such as p.Arg180Gly and p.Gly183Arg, have been linked to a novel Mendelian disorder. This disorder is characterized by progressive muscle weakness, facial dysmorphisms, ophthalmoplegia, and intellectual disability. These mutations disrupt the binding of Rbsn to phosphoinositide PI3P, impairing endosomal maturation and leading to the accumulation of cargo destined for lysosomal degradation (Paul2021RABENOSYN).

Additionally, a single point mutation in the RBSN gene, specifically p.G425R, has been associated with intractable seizures and defective endocytic trafficking. This mutation affects receptor trafficking dynamics, leading to neurological, metabolic, and skeletal abnormalities (Stockler2014Single).

## Interactions
Rabenosyn-5 (RBSN) is a protein that interacts with several key proteins involved in endocytic trafficking. It binds to the early endosomal tethering complexes CORVET and HOPS, primarily through the shared subunit Vps18. This interaction is crucial for endosomal transport but not necessary for autophagy (SimonVecsei2021Identification). Rabenosyn-5 also interacts with Vps45, and both are part of the FERARI complex, which is essential for endocytosis and Rab5-mediated endosomal fusion (SimonVecsei2021Identification).

Rabenosyn-5 serves as an effector for Rab4 and Rab5, playing a significant role in the endocytic pathway and receptor trafficking (Guo2024Rabenosyn5). It is involved in the trafficking of the transferrin receptor (TfR) following clathrin-mediated endocytosis, where it facilitates the movement of TfR from clathrin-coated structures into endosomes (Navaroli2012Rabenosyn5). The interaction between Rabenosyn-5 and Rab5 is particularly important, as Rab5 mutants can impair transferrin uptake, indicating a potential interaction between Rabenosyn-5 and Rab5 (Navaroli2012Rabenosyn5).

Rabenosyn-5 also interacts with CDC42, a small Rho GTPase, acting as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) to inhibit CDC42 activity, which is crucial for suppressing non-small cell lung cancer metastasis (Guo2024Rabenosyn5).
