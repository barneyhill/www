## Overview
Complement factor D (CFD) is a gene that encodes a serine protease, which is a critical component of the alternative pathway of the complement system, an integral part of the innate immune response. The protein product, complement factor D, is primarily synthesized by adipocytes and plays a pivotal role in the proteolytic activation of factor B when bound to C3b, forming the C3bBb complex, which functions as a C3 convertase. This enzymatic activity is essential for the amplification of the complement cascade, facilitating pathogen opsonization and lysis, as well as promoting inflammation (Barratt2021Complement; Aradottir2021Factor). The structure of complement factor D is characterized by a single polypeptide chain with a catalytic triad typical of serine proteases, and it is regulated by a unique self-inhibitory loop that ensures specificity and prevents inappropriate activation (Volanakis1996Complement; Jing1998Structures). Mutations in the CFD gene can lead to increased susceptibility to infections, highlighting its clinical significance in immune defense (Degn2011DiseaseCausing).

## Structure
Complement factor D (CFD) is a serine protease involved in the alternative pathway of the complement system. Its primary structure consists of a single polypeptide chain, and it is primarily synthesized by adipocytes (Volanakis1996Complement). The secondary structure of CFD includes two antiparallel beta-barrel type domains, each containing six beta-strands with a conserved topology, similar to other members of the chymotrypsin family of serine proteases (Volanakis1996Complement). The tertiary structure forms a compact, globular shape typical of serine proteases, with a catalytic triad consisting of Asp, His, and Ser residues, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Volanakis1996Complement). 

CFD exhibits unique structural features, such as an atypical conformation of the His57 residue, which is crucial in serine protease catalysis. His57 typically acts as a general-base catalyst, but in CFD, it displays an atypical 'out' conformation, contributing to its lower esterolytic activity compared to other proteases (Jing1998Structures). CFD also contains a unique 'self-inhibitory loop' that regulates its activity by preventing His57 from adopting an active conformation (Jing1998Structures). There are no known splice variant isoforms for CFD, and common post-translational modifications include glycosylation. CFD functions as a monomer and lacks a quaternary structure.

## Function
Complement factor D (CFD) is a serine protease that plays a critical role in the alternative pathway of the complement system, an essential component of the innate immune response. In healthy human cells, CFD is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of factor B when it is bound to C3b, forming the C3bBb complex, which acts as a C3 convertase. This enzyme complex is crucial for the amplification of the complement response, leading to the opsonization and lysis of pathogens, as well as the promotion of inflammation (Barratt2021Complement; Aradottir2021Factor).

CFD is predominantly produced by adipocytes, but it is also synthesized by macrophages, monocytes, and brain astrocytes. It circulates in the blood plasma, where it exists mainly in its mature form after being cleaved by MASP-3 (Barratt2021Complement). The activity of CFD is tightly regulated by a self-inhibitory loop to prevent inappropriate activation, ensuring specificity for its substrate, factor B (Barratt2021Complement).

In addition to its role in pathogen clearance, CFD is involved in other physiological processes, such as the removal of damaged liver cells and the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation through C3a signaling (Barratt2021Complement).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFD gene, which encodes complement factor D, are associated with increased susceptibility to certain bacterial infections, particularly those caused by encapsulated bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis. This is due to the role of complement factor D in the alternative pathway of the complement system, which is crucial for immune defense against such pathogens (Degn2011DiseaseCausing). Although factor D deficiency is rare, with fewer than 10 cases reported, it leads to selective impairment of the alternative pathway, making individuals more vulnerable to meningococcal disease (Degn2011DiseaseCausing).

In the context of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), polymorphisms in the CFD gene have been investigated, but no significant association with RPL susceptibility has been found. The study suggests that while CFD may play a role in the complement system's regulation of C3 and C5, its polymorphisms do not significantly impact RPL risk (Cho2019Association). The complexity of RPL, involving various pathological causes, necessitates further research to clarify the role of CFD in this condition (Cho2019Association).

## Interactions
Complement factor D (CFD) is a serine protease that plays a crucial role in the alternative complement pathway. It interacts with complement factor B, cleaving it into Ba and Bb fragments, which is essential for the formation of the C3 convertase complex, a key step in the amplification of the complement cascade (Wang2023Endothelialderived). CFD is also involved in interactions with other proteins during various physiological processes. In the context of tendon repair, CFD interacts with extracellular matrix components and proteins such as collagen type I (Col1a1), fibronectin 1 (FN1), and periostin (POSTN), influencing fibroblast migration and collagen expression during different healing phases (Chen2023Complement). 

In sepsis, CFD is linked to platelet activation, where it is stored in human platelets and released upon stimulation by agents like ADP, collagen, or thrombin. This interaction is associated with enhanced thrombin generation and abnormal coagulation activity, impacting platelet function and coagulation processes (Sommerfeld2021Complement). CFD's role in endothelial dysfunction is highlighted by its interaction with endothelial cells, contributing to local complement activation and the expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in conditions like malignant nephrosclerosis (Wang2023Endothelialderived).
