# KCNS3

## Overview
The KCNS3 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel modifier subfamily S member 3, also known as the Kv9.3 subunit. This protein is a modulatory subunit that does not form functional channels on its own but instead associates with other potassium channel subunits, such as Kv2.1, to form heteromeric channels. These channels are integral to the regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, particularly in parvalbumin-expressing neurons within the prefrontal cortex. The Kv9.3 subunit modifies the electrophysiological properties of these channels, enhancing their responsiveness to subthreshold depolarizations and contributing to the generation of cortical gamma oscillations, which are crucial for cognitive processes (Georgiev2012Selective; Miyamae2021Kcns3). Alterations in KCNS3 expression have been linked to neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, as well as respiratory conditions like asthma, highlighting its clinical significance (Bocksteins2016Kv5).

## Function
The KCNS3 gene encodes the Kv9.3 voltage-gated potassium channel modulatory alpha-subunit, which is selectively expressed in parvalbumin (PV) neurons within the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Georgiev2012Selective). These subunits do not form homomeric channels but instead associate with Kv2.1 subunits to create heteromeric Kv2.1/Kv9.3 channels. These channels are located in the soma and dendrites of PV neurons and exhibit modified characteristics compared to homomeric Kv2.1 channels, such as larger single-channel conductance, faster activation, slower deactivation and inactivation, and shifted activation and inactivation curves towards more negative values (Georgiev2012Selective). This makes them more effectively activated by subthreshold membrane depolarizations, enhancing fast excitatory synaptic transmission and precise detection of coincident synaptic inputs, which are crucial for generating cortical gamma oscillations (Georgiev2012Selective).

The presence of Kv9.3 subunits in PV neurons is important for maintaining normal neuronal firing patterns and synaptic integration, contributing to cognitive processes (Miyamae2021Kcns3). The selective expression of KCNS3 in PV neurons suggests a specialized role in modulating neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, which may be relevant to cognitive function and the pathophysiology of disorders such as schizophrenia (Georgiev2012Selective; Georgiev2014Lower).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KCNS3 gene, which encodes the Kv9.3 subunit, have been implicated in several neurological and respiratory conditions. In schizophrenia, lower levels of Kv9.3 mRNA have been observed in parvalbumin-expressing GABA neurons in the prefrontal cortex. This reduction is linked to a decreased number of Kv9.3-expressing neurons and reduced mRNA abundance per neuron, suggesting a potential role of Kv9.3 in the cognitive dysfunctions associated with the disorder (Georgiev2012Selective; Bocksteins2016Kv5).

In the respiratory system, genetic variants of KCNS3, specifically the rs1031771 and rs1031772 SNPs, have been associated with airway hyperresponsiveness, indicating a potential role in asthma. The expression of Kv9.3 is upregulated in response to hypoxia, which may influence lung function and contribute to conditions like pulmonary hypertension (Bocksteins2016Kv5).

In the context of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) pregnancies, increased expression of Kv9.3 in placental tissues has been noted, although its specific role in this condition remains unclear (Bocksteins2016Kv5). These findings highlight the clinical significance of KCNS3 in various physiological and pathological processes.

## Interactions
KCNS3, a potassium channel subunit, is known to form heteromeric complexes with other potassium channel subunits, particularly KCNB1, which encodes the Kv2.1 subunit. These interactions are crucial for modulating the electrophysiological properties of neurons. The Kv9.3 subunit, encoded by KCNS3, interacts with Kv2.1 to form channels that regulate repetitive firing in neurons by amplifying Kv2.1 currents. This interaction is significant in maintaining the firing properties of parvalbumin (PV) neurons, which are essential for proper neuronal signaling and are implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Miyamae2021Kcns3).

The KCNS3-KCNB1 interaction affects the conductance and inactivation properties of the Kv2.1 channels, influencing the response of PV neuron membrane potential during synaptic depolarizations. This modulation is particularly important during UP state episodes, which are associated with gamma frequency bursts, a critical aspect of cognitive processing (Miyamae2021Kcns3). Despite the physiological changes induced by KCNS3 deficiency, the expression of KCNB1 remains unaltered, indicating that the observed effects are specific to the reduction in Kv9.3 subunits (Miyamae2021Kcns3). These interactions highlight the role of KCNS3 in neuronal excitability and its potential impact on neural circuits involved in disorders such as schizophrenia.
