# OR7D4

## Overview
The OR7D4 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 7 subfamily D member 4, a class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the detection of specific steroidal odorants, such as androstenone and androstadienone. This receptor is expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons of the nasal epithelium, playing a critical role in the molecular mechanisms underlying the sense of smell (Sookoian2011Odor). The OR7D4 protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices, which are typical of GPCRs, and is involved in initiating a signaling cascade upon ligand binding, leading to odor perception (de2018Odorant). Genetic variations in OR7D4, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, can significantly influence individual differences in odor sensitivity and perception, impacting social and reproductive behaviors (Logan2014Do). Additionally, the gene has been studied in various contexts, including its potential role in cancer progression and its influence on eating behaviors and obesity (Fessahaye2021Breast; Lee2018Therapeutic).

## Structure
The OR7D4 protein is a member of the class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by its seven transmembrane helices (TM1 to TM7) that form a bundle within the cell membrane (de2018Odorant). The primary structure of OR7D4 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific residues from TM3, TM5, TM6, and TM7 contributing to the formation of the binding cavity (de2018Odorant). The secondary structure includes these alpha helices, typical of GPCRs, which are involved in the receptor's function and ligand binding (Yoshihito2012Olfactory).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, crucial for the receptor's activation and function. Upon activation, an allosteric signal is transmitted from the ligand to the G protein binding site, involving a tilt in the intracellular part of TM6 (de2018Odorant). A highly conserved OR-specific RxKAFSTCxSH motif in TM6 is crucial for OR activation (de2018Odorant). The molecular weight of the monomeric form of OR7D4 is approximately 26 kDa (SanmartíEspinal2017Quantification). There is no evidence of quaternary structure, as GPCRs like OR7D4 often function as monomers. Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, affecting receptor function.

## Function
The OR7D4 gene encodes an olfactory receptor that is part of the class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically involved in detecting steroidal odorants such as androstenone and androstadienone. These receptors are expressed on the cilia of olfactory sensory neurons in the nasal olfactory epithelium, forming the molecular basis for the sense of smell (Sookoian2011Odor). The activation of OR7D4 involves a signaling cascade that begins with the binding of these odorants to the receptor, which then activates a G protein. This activation leads to a series of intracellular events that result in the generation of action potentials in olfactory neurons, ultimately contributing to odor perception (Glezer2019Olfactory).

The receptor's function is influenced by genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which can significantly affect an individual's sensitivity to these odorants. For instance, certain variants of OR7D4, like those with the R88W and T133M substitutions, are associated with reduced sensitivity to androstenone and androstadienone, impacting the perception of these odors (Logan2014Do; Sookoian2011Odor). These genetic differences can influence not only smell perception but also social and reproductive behaviors linked to these pheromones.

## Clinical Significance
The OR7D4 gene is associated with variations in the perception of androstenone, a compound related to body odor. Genetic polymorphisms in OR7D4, such as the RT/WM haplotypes, influence how individuals perceive the intensity and pleasantness of androstenone. These variations can affect social and reproductive behaviors due to differences in odor perception (Li2021From).

While OR7D4 mutations are not directly linked to specific diseases, they have been associated with eating behaviors and obesity. Copy number variations in OR7D4 and other OR7 genes on chromosome 19q13 are linked to reduced levels of adiposity, suggesting a potential connection between OR7D4 variants and obesity through altered olfactory perception and eating behavior (Lee2018Therapeutic).

The gene's role in odor perception also impacts preferences for foods like pork, which can contain varying levels of androstenone. This has implications for agricultural practices, such as pig castration rates in Europe, due to consumer preferences influenced by OR7D4 variants (de2018Odorant). However, the gene's mutations are not directly associated with any specific medical conditions beyond these behavioral and preference influences.

## Interactions
The olfactory receptor OR7D4 is involved in specific protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that interacts with G proteins to transduce signals upon binding to its ligands, such as androstenone and androstadienone. These interactions initiate a signaling cascade, leading to neuronal responses associated with smell perception (de2018Odorant).

In yeast expression systems, the receptor transporting protein 1 short (RTP1S) has been shown to enhance the expression and function of OR7D4. RTP1S acts as a chaperone, facilitating the trafficking of OR7D4 to the plasma membrane, which is essential for its functional expression and response to ligands (Fukutani2015Improving). This interaction highlights the role of accessory proteins in modulating the activity and localization of OR7D4.

Additionally, OR7D4 has been studied in the context of cancer, where its gene is often hypomethylated, suggesting a potential interaction with signaling pathways involved in cancer progression. This hypomethylation is linked to transcriptional activation, which may contribute to carcinogenesis (Fessahaye2021Breast). These interactions underscore the multifaceted roles of OR7D4 in both olfactory and non-olfactory contexts.
