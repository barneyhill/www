# IRX5

## Overview
IRX5 is a gene that encodes the iroquois homeobox 5 protein, a transcription factor involved in various biological processes, including cardiac function and development. The IRX5 protein plays a critical role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing the transcription of target genes. It is particularly significant in cardiac electrical conduction, where it interacts with other transcription factors to modulate the expression of genes such as SCN5A and GJA5, which are essential for proper cardiac function (Al2020Human; Kim2021Understanding). Additionally, IRX5 is involved in cellulose synthesis in plants and has been implicated in cancer progression through its role in NF-κB signaling (Huang2018IRX5; Taylor2003Interactions). Mutations in the IRX5 gene are associated with various clinical conditions, including Hamamy syndrome and cardiac conduction disorders, highlighting its importance in human health (Al2020Human; Mégarbané2021Clinical).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IRX5 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. IRX5 mutations have been linked to Hamamy syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, severe telecanthus, abnormal ears, dentinogenesis imperfecta, and bone fragility. The c.503G>A (p.Arg168His) mutation in IRX5 has been identified as causative for this syndrome (Mégarbané2021Clinical). Some families with Hamamy syndrome also report cardiovascular anomalies, such as intraventricular conduction delays, although these were not observed in all cases (Mégarbané2021Clinical).

In cardiac function, IRX5 mutations are implicated in ventricular conduction disorders. Mutations such as A150P and N166K in the IRX5 gene have been studied using human induced pluripotent stem cells, revealing their role in the transcriptional control of genes involved in cardiac electrical conduction, including SCN5A and GJA5. These mutations may contribute to prolonged QRS intervals observed in patients, suggesting a link to cardiac conduction disorders (Al2020Human).

Alterations in IRX5 expression are also associated with autosomal dominant cone dystrophy, characterized by early tritanopic color vision defects. Duplications affecting the IRX5 gene, along with IRX6, have been linked to this condition, with increased gene dosage potentially underlying the disease phenotype (Kohl2021A).

## Interactions
IRX5, a transcription factor, is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions that are crucial for its function. In cardiac function, IRX5 interacts with the transcription factor GATA4 to regulate the expression of the SCN5A gene, which encodes the sodium channel Na V 1.5. This interaction is essential for activating SCN5A promoter activity and expression, highlighting the role of IRX5 in cardiac conduction (Al2020Human; Kim2021Understanding). IRX5 binds to a conserved IRX binding site in the promoter regions of SCN5A and GJA5, which encodes connexin 40 (CX40), further emphasizing its role in cardiac electrical conduction (Al2020Human; Kim2021Understanding).

In the context of cellulose synthesis in Arabidopsis, IRX5 is part of a protein complex with IRX1 and IRX3, essential for cellulose synthesis. This complex formation is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, indicating physical interactions among these proteins. The stability of this complex is dependent on IRX5, as its absence disrupts the interaction between IRX1 and IRX3 (Taylor2003Interactions).

In tongue squamous cell carcinoma, IRX5 promotes NF-κB signaling by interacting with osteopontin (OPN), enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This interaction involves IRX5 binding to the OPN promoter, as confirmed by a dual-luciferase reporter assay (Huang2018IRX5).
