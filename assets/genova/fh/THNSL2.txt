# THNSL2

## Overview
THNSL2 is a gene that encodes the protein threonine synthase-like 2, which is involved in various biological processes. The protein is categorized as an enzyme, although its specific enzymatic functions in humans are not fully elucidated. THNSL2 has been studied for its potential roles in metabolic pathways and disease mechanisms, particularly in relation to coronary artery disease and metabolic traits such as obesity and body mass index (Kolur2020Transcriptome; Volkov2016A). The gene's expression and genetic variations have been linked to inflammation and other health conditions, making it a subject of interest in clinical research (Rouskas2023Identifying). Additionally, THNSL2 is utilized as a reference gene in neuroblastoma research due to its stable expression, which is crucial for accurate genetic analysis (KahanaEdwin2021Neuroblastoma).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The THNSL2 gene has been implicated in several health conditions through its association with genetic variations and expression levels. In the context of coronary artery disease (CAD), THNSL2 is identified as a novel biomarker, suggesting its potential involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Kolur2020Transcriptome). Additionally, a study on adipose tissue highlights that a secondary expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) of THNSL2 colocalizes with a genome-wide association study (GWAS) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with C-reactive protein levels, indicating a role in inflammation and its associations with obesity and fat mass (Rouskas2023Identifying).

THNSL2 has also been linked to metabolic traits, with SNPs in this locus associated with obesity, body mass index (BMI), and other metabolic phenotypes (Volkov2016A). Although not directly linked to Alzheimer's disease, THNSL2 was mentioned in a study exploring genetic associations with the disease, indicating potential relevance in the context of protein breakdown and metabolic processes (Patel2018Whole‐exome).

In neuroblastoma research, THNSL2 is used as a reference gene in assays evaluating MYCN copy number levels, due to its stable expression, which aids in accurate detection of genetic alterations (KahanaEdwin2021Neuroblastoma).
