# TXNRD1

## Overview
The TXNRD1 gene encodes thioredoxin reductase 1, a selenoprotein enzyme that plays a pivotal role in cellular redox homeostasis. As a member of the oxidoreductase family, thioredoxin reductase 1 is involved in reducing thioredoxin, thereby facilitating various cellular processes such as DNA synthesis, repair, and apoptosis. The enzyme's activity is crucial for protecting cells against oxidative stress, which can lead to cellular damage and contribute to the development of diseases, including cancer. TXNRD1 is expressed in multiple cellular compartments, including the cytosol and nucleus, and is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms with distinct functions. The gene's expression and activity are tightly regulated, reflecting its importance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Arnér2020Perspectives).

## Structure
Thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) is a selenoprotein with a complex molecular structure that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular redox balance. The primary structure of TXNRD1 includes a conserved C-terminal redox-active site characterized by the sequence -Gly-Cys-Sec-Gly-COOH, where selenocysteine (Sec) is essential for its catalytic activity (Gladyshev1996Selenocysteine; Arnér2020Effects). The secondary structure features a central five-stranded parallel β-sheet and a three-stranded β-meander, which are part of the FAD and NADP binding domains (Sandalova2001Threedimensional).

The tertiary structure of TXNRD1 involves a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain, which is tightly bound and conserved across the enzyme family (Sandalova2001Threedimensional). The quaternary structure typically forms homodimers, with active sites located at the interface between subunits, facilitating electron transfer from NADPH to the substrate (Sandalova2001Threedimensional; Peng2013APR-246/PRIMA-1MET).

TXNRD1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms with distinct functions. Notably, the TXNRD1_v3 isoform includes a glutaredoxin domain and can be myristoylated and palmitoylated, targeting it to cell membranes (Arnér2020Effects). These structural features and modifications underscore the enzyme's versatility and importance in cellular processes.

## Function
Thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) is a crucial enzyme in maintaining cellular redox balance by reducing thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) to its active form using NADPH. This reduction is essential for various cellular processes, including DNA synthesis, repair, and apoptosis (Arnér2020Perspectives). TXNRD1 is predominantly found in the cytosol but can also be present in the nucleus and other cellular locations, contributing to its diverse roles in cell biology (Arnér2020Perspectives).

In healthy human cells, TXNRD1 plays a significant role in protecting against oxidative stress by supporting antioxidant defense systems. This function helps maintain cellular integrity and prevents oxidative damage, which can lead to mutations and potentially counteract the initiation of cancer (Arnér2020Perspectives). TXNRD1 is involved in various reductive pathways and redox control in signaling pathways, influencing the activity of transcription factors such as Nrf2, NFκB, and HIF (Arnér2020Perspectives).

TXNRD1 is also essential for embryonic development, as its absence leads to early embryonic lethality due to severe growth retardation and developmental abnormalities (Jakupoglu2005Cytoplasmic). Its activity is context-dependent, influencing health and disease states by modulating cellular responses to oxidative stress (Arnér2020Perspectives).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TXNRD1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. A homozygous mutation in TXNRD1, specifically the p.Pro190Leu variant, is associated with genetic generalized epilepsy. This mutation results in reduced enzyme activity and decreased resistance to oxidative stress, contributing to the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Affected individuals exhibit various forms of seizures, including absence, myoclonic, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (Kudin2017Homozygous).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TXNRD1 is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. High expression levels of TXNRD1 are linked to poor overall survival and disease-free survival in HCC patients. TXNRD1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and its knockdown in HCC cell lines inhibits these processes. The gene's role in HCC progression is partly mediated through the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, where it affects the stability and activity of PTEN, a tumor suppressor (Huang2022USF2mediated; Cho2018Clinical).

The thioredoxin system, including TXNRD1, is crucial in maintaining cellular redox balance. Dysregulation of this system, such as through overexpression of TXNRD1, is associated with aggressive tumor growth and poor prognosis in various cancers, including liver cancer (Cho2018Clinical).

## Interactions
Thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes. TXNRD1 interacts with thioredoxin (Trx1), forming a complex that is essential for maintaining Trx1 in a reduced state, which is crucial for its function in cellular redox homeostasis (FritzWolf2011Crystal). This interaction is characterized by the formation of a mixed disulfide bond between specific cysteine residues of TXNRD1 and Trx1, facilitating electron transfer (FritzWolf2011Crystal).

TXNRD1 also interacts with PTEN, a tumor suppressor protein, by disrupting its interaction with Trx1. This disruption leads to PTEN degradation and activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (Huang2022USF2mediated). The interaction between TXNRD1 and PTEN is significant because it affects PTEN's stability and function, thereby influencing cell proliferation and survival pathways (Huang2022USF2mediated).

In the context of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), TXNRD1 is part of a protein-protein interaction network associated with metabolic processes. Its downregulation in IPAH patients suggests a protective role against disease progression (Lin2022Integrated). These interactions highlight TXNRD1's role in various cellular and pathological processes.
