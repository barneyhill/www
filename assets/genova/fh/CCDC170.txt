# CCDC170

## Overview
The CCDC170 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 170 protein, which is characterized by its structural motif of coiled-coil domains. These domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in cellular structural organization and stability. The CCDC170 protein is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus and is involved in maintaining peri-nuclear microtubules, which are essential for proper cell function and intracellular transport. It is also implicated in bone health, with genetic variations linked to bone mineral density and fracture risk. In the context of breast cancer, CCDC170 is significant due to its involvement in the ESR1-CCDC170 fusion, which is associated with endocrine resistance and increased cancer cell invasiveness. This fusion protein interacts with key signaling pathways, contributing to the aggressive nature of certain breast cancers (Zhang2022Relationship; Mullin2016Genomewide; Veeraraghavan2016Recurrent).

## Structure
The CCDC170 protein is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs where multiple alpha-helices are coiled together, resembling strands of a rope. These domains are crucial for facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are essential for the protein's role in various cellular processes. The coiled-coil structure contributes to the protein's stability and functional versatility.

CCDC170 may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can lead to variations in its structure and function. These isoforms may differ in the number or arrangement of coiled-coil domains, potentially altering their interaction capabilities and biological roles. The presence of different isoforms suggests that CCDC170 can adapt to different cellular contexts and requirements.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are likely to influence the activity and interactions of CCDC170. These modifications can affect the protein's conformation, stability, and interaction with other molecules, thereby modulating its function within the cell. The precise impact of these modifications on CCDC170's structure and function remains an area of active research.

## Function
The CCDC170 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular structural organization, particularly in stabilizing peri-nuclear microtubules (MTs) and maintaining the structure of the Golgi apparatus. This protein is associated with the Golgi body and is involved in MT-dependent Golgi structure processes, which are crucial for proper cell function and intracellular transport (Zhang2022Relationship). The CCDC170 protein contains a coiled helical domain, which is a structural motif that facilitates its interaction with other proteins and cellular components, contributing to its role in cell shape and motility (Zhang2022Relationship).

In the context of bone health, CCDC170 has been associated with bone mineral density (BMD), suggesting its involvement in bone metabolism and structure. Genetic studies have identified polymorphisms in the CCDC170 gene that are linked to variations in BMD at different skeletal sites, indicating its potential role in regulating bone density (Mullin2016Genomewide). These findings highlight the importance of CCDC170 in maintaining bone health and its potential impact on conditions such as osteoporosis (Zhang2022Relationship).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CCDC170 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly breast cancer. The ESR1-CCDC170 fusion is a recurrent genetic alteration found in 6-8% of luminal B breast cancers, which are known for their aggressive nature and resistance to endocrine therapy. This fusion involves the 5'untranslated region of ESR1 and the coding region of CCDC170, leading to truncated protein variants that enhance receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and increase cancer cell invasiveness (Li2020Therapeutic; Veeraraghavan2016Recurrent). 

The presence of the ESR1-CCDC170 fusion is associated with upregulation of the Gab1 protein and activation of downstream signaling molecules such as AKT and ERK, contributing to endocrine resistance (Veeraraghavan2016Recurrent). This fusion is also linked to the activation of the HER2/HER3/SRC/AKT signaling pathway, which supports cancer cell survival under endocrine therapy (Li2020Therapeutic). 

In addition to breast cancer, genetic variations in CCDC170 have been associated with bone health. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CCDC170 are linked to bone mineral density and fracture risk, suggesting a role in bone health and susceptibility to fractures (FariasCisneros2019COL1A1; Mullin2016Genomewide).

## Interactions
The CCDC170 protein is involved in several interactions that influence breast cancer progression. It is known to form dimers, particularly the E2-E10 variant, which may stabilize the HER2/HER3/SRC complex, contributing to endocrine resistance in breast cancer (Li2020Therapeutic). The ESR1-CCDC170 fusion protein, which results in a truncated form of CCDC170, interacts with HER2, HER3, and SRC proteins, forming a complex that enhances ligand-independent growth factor signaling and contributes to tamoxifen resistance (Li2020Therapeutic; Loo2022Fusion‐associatedcarcinomas). This interaction is significant in the context of luminal B breast cancers, where the fusion protein is associated with increased cell motility and invasion (Veeraraghavan2014Recurrent).

The CCDC170 protein also plays a role in apoptosis through the IRE1 pathway. Although no direct binding between CCDC170 and IRE1α was observed, overexpression of CCDC170 increases IRE1α levels, suggesting an indirect interaction that enhances apoptosis under endoplasmic reticulum stress (Wang2020CCDC170). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of CCDC170 in breast cancer, influencing both survival and apoptotic pathways.
