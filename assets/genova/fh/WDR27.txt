# WDR27

## Overview
WDR27 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 27 protein, a scaffold protein characterized by multiple WD repeat domains. These domains are integral to facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are essential for the formation of multiprotein complexes involved in various cellular processes. The WD repeat domain 27 protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to complex cellular pathways. Variants of WDR27 have been implicated in neurological disorders, metabolic syndrome, and immune responses, highlighting its significance in health and disease (Alvarez2023Cooccurring; Zhang2022CircWDR27).

## Structure


## Function
WDR27 encodes a scaffold protein characterized by multiple WD repeat domains, which are crucial for facilitating protein-protein interactions. This protein is ubiquitously expressed in the human body and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and development. In healthy human cells, WDR27 is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to complex cellular pathways (Alvarez2023Cooccurring).

The WDR27 protein's structure, particularly its hinge domain, is essential for its functionality and interaction with other cellular components. Variants of WDR27, such as His467 and S542, have been shown to affect the protein's structure, reducing its solvent accessible surface area and stability, which in turn impacts its ability to interact with its environment (Alvarez2023Cooccurring). Although the exact biological functions of WDR27 in the brain are not fully understood, it is suggested to be involved in metabolic syndrome and related diseases, potentially affecting brain homeostasis and contributing to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (Alvarez2023Cooccurring).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the WDR27 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In a study involving a Peruvian family with a history of dementia spectrum disorders, novel pathogenic variants in WDR27 were identified. These variants were associated with changes in the neurovascular unit of the brain, particularly affecting vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and pericytes, and were linked to Alzheimer's disease risk (Alvarez2023Cooccurring). The WDR27 gene was also associated with metabolic syndrome and related diseases, with mutations affecting protein structure and function (Alvarez2023Cooccurring).

In the context of tuberculosis, the circular RNA form of WDR27 (circ-WDR27) was found to be downregulated in tuberculosis patients and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected macrophages. Overexpression of circ-WDR27 reduced bacterial survival and increased inflammatory cytokine release, suggesting its role in the immune response to tuberculosis (Zhang2022CircWDR27). Additionally, WDR27 has been linked to facial morphology traits, specifically eye shape, through genome-wide association studies (Cha2018Identification). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of WDR27 in various health conditions.

## Interactions
WDR27 is a gene encoding a scaffold protein characterized by multiple WD repeat domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These interactions often involve the formation of multiprotein complexes that are crucial for various cellular processes. In the context of neurological disorders, WDR27 variants have been shown to affect the protein's ability to interact with other partners, potentially impacting brain homeostasis and contributing to conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia (Alvarez2023Cooccurring).

In a study investigating the role of circular RNA derived from WDR27 (circ-WDR27), it was found that circ-WDR27 can act as a molecular sponge for miR-370-3p, a microRNA. This interaction influences the expression of Follistatin-like protein 1 (FSTL1), which is involved in the immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The circ-WDR27/miR-370-3p/FSTL1 signaling network highlights the regulatory role of WDR27 in immune responses, particularly in the context of tuberculosis (Zhang2022CircWDR27).

Although the exact biological functions of WDR27 in the brain are not fully understood, its involvement in pathways related to metabolic syndrome and Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, such as autophagy and mitophagy, suggests a significant role in cellular signaling and homeostasis (Alvarez2023Cooccurring).
