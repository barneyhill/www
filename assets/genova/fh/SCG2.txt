# SCG2

## Overview
The SCG2 gene encodes the protein secretogranin II, a member of the granin family, which is primarily involved in the formation and function of secretory granules in neuroendocrine cells. Secretogranin II is a precursor protein that undergoes proteolytic processing to produce several bioactive peptides, including secretoneurin, which are implicated in various physiological processes such as neurotransmission, inflammation, and angiogenesis (Bartolomucci2011The; Mitchell2020Secretoneurin). The SCG2 gene is highly conserved among mammals, reflecting its essential role in cellular processes related to the regulated secretory pathway (Mitchell2020Secretoneurin). Alterations in SCG2 expression have been associated with clinical conditions, including cancer and reproductive disorders, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Weng2022SCG2:; Mitchell2020Targeted).

## Structure
Secretogranin II (SCG2) is a precursor protein that is approximately 600 amino acids long and is characterized by its acidic nature and tyrosine-sulfated residues (Mitchell2020Secretoneurin). The primary structure of SCG2 is well-conserved among mammals, with 79-87% identity between species, although it shows more variation in teleost fish due to the presence of two paralogs, scg2a and scg2b (Mitchell2020Secretoneurin). 

SCG2 undergoes proteolytic processing by prohormone convertases, primarily PC1 and PC2, to produce several bioactive peptides, including secretoneurin (SN), EM66, and manserin (Bartolomucci2011The; Mitchell2020Secretoneurin). The processing involves cleavage at multiple dibasic amino acid sites, which are conserved across species (Shu2018Identification; Mitchell2020Secretoneurin).

The secondary and tertiary structures of SCG2 are not detailed in the provided context, but granins, including SCG2, are known for their ability to aggregate under conditions of low pH and high calcium ion concentrations, which is crucial for their role in secretory granule formation (Bartolomucci2011The; Mitchell2020Secretoneurin). The specific molecular structure of SCG2, including any quaternary structure or specific domains, is not described in the available sources.

## Function
Secretogranin II (SCG2) is a member of the granin family of proteins, which are involved in the formation and function of secretory granules in neuroendocrine cells. SCG2 plays a crucial role in the regulated secretory pathway, contributing to the storage and release of peptide hormones and neuropeptides. It is processed into smaller bioactive peptides, such as secretoneurin, which participate in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission, inflammation, and angiogenesis (Mitchell2020Secretoneurin).

SCG2 acts as a signal integrator for neurotransmitter inputs, particularly glutamate and dopamine, in neurons. This integration is essential for synaptic plasticity, which is a fundamental process for learning and memory (Iwase2013The). The protein is primarily active in the secretory vesicles of endocrine and neuronal cells, where it influences the biogenesis of dense-core secretory granules. Depletion of SCG2 can lead to a decrease in the number and size of these granules, indicating its importance in granule formation and hormone/neuropeptide processing (Bartolomucci2011The).

SCG2 also plays a role in neuronal differentiation and maturation. It is involved in the differentiation of adult hippocampal progenitors, acting in a non-cell-autonomous manner to promote neuronal maturation (Kim2015REST). This function is critical for proper neuronal development and the maintenance of neurogenesis in the adult brain (Kim2015REST).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SCG2 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions. In colorectal cancer, high SCG2 expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor proliferation, invasion, and migration. This suggests that SCG2 could serve as a prognostic marker and a predictor of chemotherapy and immunotherapy responses in colorectal cancer patients (Weng2022SCG2:). The gene's expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration and the expression of immune checkpoints, indicating its potential role in modulating immune responses in the tumor microenvironment (Weng2022SCG2:).

In zebrafish, mutations in SCG2 disrupt sexual behavior and reproduction, highlighting its role in neuroendocrine functions. These mutations lead to significant reductions in reproductive hormone levels and impair ovulation and spawning, suggesting that SCG2 is crucial for normal reproductive processes (Mitchell2020Targeted). The SCG2-derived peptide secretoneurin has been shown to stimulate luteinizing hormone release, further underscoring its importance in reproductive regulation (Mitchell2020Secretoneurin). These findings suggest that SCG2 plays a significant role in both cancer progression and reproductive health.

## Interactions
Secretogranin II (SCG2) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in various biological processes. In colorectal cancer (CRC), SCG2 interacts with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, promoting the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). This interaction reduces the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thereby inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor growth (Fang2021Secretogranin).

SCG2 is also implicated in the assembly and function of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) in melanoma. Overexpression of SCG2 in melanoma cells leads to the downregulation of components of the antigen processing machinery, resulting in decreased MHC-I expression and contributing to immune evasion (Steinfass2023Secretogranin).

In the context of viral infections, SCG2 is differentially regulated by mammalian reovirus and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), suggesting virus-specific roles. Reovirus infection upregulates SCG2, while HSV-1 infection downregulates it, affecting virus secretion and indicating a potential role in modulating virus output (Berard2015Differential).
