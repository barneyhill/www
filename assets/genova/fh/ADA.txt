# ADA

## Overview
The ADA gene encodes the enzyme adenosine deaminase, a critical component of purine metabolism. This enzyme is responsible for the deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine, processes essential for preventing the toxic accumulation of these substrates and maintaining cellular and immune system function (Whitmore2016Adenosine; Cristalli2001Adenosine). Adenosine deaminase is a monomeric enzyme with a molecular weight of approximately 41,000, featuring an α/β-TIM barrel domain that facilitates its catalytic activity (Wiginton1986Complete; Wilson1991Atomic). It is ubiquitously expressed in human cells, with significant roles in lymphocyte development and function, and is often associated with the cell surface in complex with CD26, a receptor involved in T-cell activation (Akeson1989Normal; Cristalli2001Adenosine). Deficiency in ADA leads to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), underscoring its importance in immune system integrity and overall human health (Whitmore2016Adenosine).

## Structure
The human adenosine deaminase (ADA) protein is a monomeric enzyme with a molecular weight of approximately 41,000, primarily purified from erythrocytes and granulocytes (Wiginton1986Complete). Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, which includes essential residues for its catalytic activity, such as those coordinating a zinc ion crucial for its function (Wilson1991Atomic). The secondary structure of ADA includes an α/β-TIM barrel domain, a common fold in enzymes that facilitates its catalytic mechanism (Wilson1991Atomic).

ADA's tertiary structure is characterized by a globular conformation, with a deep, oblong-shaped active site cavity where substrates and inhibitors bind. This cavity is lined by COOH-terminal segments and connecting loops of the β-barrel strands (Wilson1991Atomic). The enzyme's active site also features a zinc ion coordinated by histidine residues and an aspartic acid, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Wilson1991Atomic).

ADA does not exhibit quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. The enzyme is involved in purine metabolism, catalyzing the deamination of adenosine to inosine, and its deficiency is linked to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (Wiginton1986Complete).

## Function
Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is a crucial enzyme in purine metabolism, responsible for the irreversible deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine. This process prevents the toxic accumulation of these substrates, which is vital for maintaining cellular function and immune system integrity (Whitmore2016Adenosine; Cristalli2001Adenosine). ADA is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and is particularly important for the development and function of lymphocytes, including T and B cells (Wiginton1986Complete; Cristalli2001Adenosine).

In healthy cells, ADA is primarily located in the cytoplasm and is often associated with the cell surface in complex with CD26, a receptor that plays a role in T-cell activation (Akeson1989Normal; Cristalli2001Adenosine). ADA's enzymatic activity is essential for the proper maturation and function of the immune system, as it regulates the levels of adenosine, which can otherwise inhibit DNA synthesis and lymphocyte proliferation (Whitmore2016Adenosine; Cristalli2001Adenosine).

ADA also plays a role in systemic metabolic processes, affecting multiple organ systems beyond the immune system. Its deficiency can lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), highlighting its critical role in human health (Whitmore2016Adenosine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADA gene lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a condition characterized by a profound lack of functional immune cells. This deficiency results in the accumulation of toxic metabolites, such as adenosine and deoxyadenosine, which are harmful to lymphocytes and cause severe immunodeficiency. Patients with ADA deficiency often present with opportunistic infections and are at risk from live vaccines due to their compromised immune systems (Bradford2017Adenosine). ADA deficiency can also lead to systemic issues, including pulmonary inflammation, neurological defects, and skeletal abnormalities (Bradford2017Adenosine).

In addition to SCID, ADA deficiency is associated with autoimmune conditions, such as autoimmune hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus, particularly in patients undergoing PEG-ADA therapy (Bradford2017Adenosine). Altered ADA expression has been linked to various cancers and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its role in maintaining immune homeostasis (Bradford2017Adenosine).

The ADA gene is also implicated in pulmonary complications, with patients experiencing reactive airway diseases like asthma and allergic rhinitis, potentially due to elevated adenosine levels (Bradford2017Adenosine). These diverse clinical manifestations underscore the critical role of ADA in immune function and systemic health.

## Interactions
Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is involved in several significant protein interactions, particularly with CD26 and adenosine receptors (ARs). ADA forms a complex with CD26, where each CD26 dimer binds two ADA molecules. This interaction involves specific regions: the Ile287-Asp297 loop A of CD26 interacts with the Arg76-Ala91 helix α1 of ADA, and the Asp331-Gln344 loop B of CD26 interacts with the Pro126-Asp143 helix α2 of ADA. These interactions are stabilized by a highly amphiphilic interface, allowing both proteins to remain catalytically active (Moreno2018Molecular; Franco2007Enzymatic).

ADA also interacts with adenosine receptors A1R, A2AR, and A2BR, acting as an allosteric modulator. It enhances receptor signaling and affinity, particularly with A2AR, by altering their quaternary structure. ADA's interaction with A2AR and CD26 is crucial for its role in cell-to-cell communication, forming a trimeric complex that facilitates interactions between cells (Moreno2018Molecular).

These interactions are important for ADA's function in immune responses and cellular communication, highlighting its role as a moonlighting protein with multiple functions beyond its enzymatic activity (Moreno2018Molecular).
