# SLC22A15

## Overview
SLC22A15 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 15, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family 22. This family is known for its role in the transport of organic ions, including cations, anions, and zwitterions, across cell membranes. The SLC22A15 protein is characterized as a transmembrane transporter, featuring 12 alpha-helical domains that facilitate the movement of various substrates, such as ergothioneine, carnosine, carnitine, and creatine, in a sodium-dependent manner (Koepsell2013The; Yee2020Deorphaning). Predominantly expressed in the brain, SLC22A15 is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against oxidative stress by regulating antioxidant levels (Yee2020Deorphaning; Yee2021Emerging). The gene's expression and function have been linked to several clinical conditions, including colorectal cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in both metabolic and pathological processes (Yee2020Deorphaning; Zhu2019OGlcNAcylation).

## Structure
The SLC22A15 protein is a member of the solute carrier family 22, which includes transporters for organic cations, anions, and zwitterions. It consists of 547 amino acids and is expressed on the plasma membrane, with a molecular size of approximately 60 kDa, which reduces upon deglycosylation, indicating post-translational glycosylation (Yee2020Deorphaning). The protein is predicted to have 12 transmembrane alpha-helical domains, a common feature of the SLC22 family, which are involved in the transport of various substrates across cell membranes (Koepsell2013The).

Comparative structure modeling of SLC22A15 suggests that its substrate-binding pocket has a mixture of positive and negative charges, similar to other zwitterion transporters in the family, such as SLC22A4, SLC22A5, and SLC22A16. This electrostatic potential indicates an affinity for zwitterionic compounds (Yee2020Deorphaning). The protein's structure is modeled using the 2.6 Å crystal structure of the maltose-bound human GLUT3 (SLC2A3) as a template, which shares the major facilitator superfamily fold assignment with SLC22A15 (Yee2020Deorphaning). The protein's quaternary structure may involve homodimer or heterodimer formation, typical of the SLC22 family, although specific details for SLC22A15 are not provided.

## Function
SLC22A15 is a member of the solute carrier family 22, which is involved in the transport of organic ions across cell membranes. In healthy human cells, SLC22A15 functions primarily as a transporter of zwitterions and cations, including ergothioneine, carnosine, carnitine, and creatine. This transport is sodium-dependent, allowing for the intracellular concentration of these substrates (Yee2020Deorphaning). SLC22A15 is expressed on the plasma membrane and is involved in both the uptake and efflux of these compounds, contributing to cellular metabolism and homeostasis (Yee2020Deorphaning).

The transporter is particularly active in the brain, where it is implicated in the regulation of antioxidant levels, such as ergothioneine and carnosine, which are important for protecting against oxidative stress (Yee2020Deorphaning; Yee2021Emerging). SLC22A15's role in the central nervous system suggests it may contribute to maintaining cellular health and function by regulating the availability of key metabolites (Yee2021Emerging). The protein's activity in fatty acid metabolism and its association with fat-related traits further highlight its importance in metabolic processes (Yee2020Deorphaning).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC22A15 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in transporting organic ions. Alterations in the expression of SLC22A15 have been associated with tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Studies have shown that SLC22A15 is significantly overexpressed in CRC tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its expression is regulated by the transcription factor YY1, which undergoes O-GlcNAcylation. This modification enhances YY1's stability and transcriptional activity, leading to increased expression of SLC22A15, which contributes to the transformed phenotype of CRC cells (Zhu2019OGlcNAcylation).

Genetic polymorphisms in SLC22A15 have also been linked to responses to the anti-asthmatic drug albuterol and tumor growth, although the mechanisms remain unclear (Yee2020Deorphaning). Additionally, SLC22A15 is involved in the transport of ergothioneine, carnosine, and carnitine, with its expression in the brain suggesting a role in neurological health. Variants in SLC22A15 have been associated with autism and fat-related traits such as body mass index and trunk fat mass (Yee2020Deorphaning). The gene's involvement in cancer and cellular processes is further supported by its association with pathways related to the cell cycle and cellular senescence (Yee2020Deorphaning).
