# TNFRSF4

## Overview
TNFRSF4, also known as OX40, is a gene that encodes the protein TNF receptor superfamily member 4, a type I transmembrane receptor. This protein is a crucial component of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and plays a significant role in the immune system, particularly in T-cell biology. TNFRSF4 is primarily expressed on activated T cells, including CD4 and CD8 subsets, and is involved in providing costimulatory signals essential for T-cell proliferation, survival, and memory formation. The protein interacts with its ligand, OX40L, to activate several signaling pathways, including NF-κB, PI3K-Akt, and MAPK, which are vital for immune responses. Due to its role in modulating immune functions, TNFRSF4 is implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancers and autoimmune diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (So2019The; Croft2009The; Watts2005TNF/TNFR).

## Structure
TNFRSF4, also known as OX40, is a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The primary structure of TNFRSF4 includes a signal peptide, an extracellular domain with cysteine-rich motifs, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (So2019The; Magis2012An). The extracellular domain is characterized by the presence of cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), which are crucial for ligand-binding specificity and interaction with TNF ligands (Magis2012An). 

The secondary structure of TNFRSF4 features beta-sheets and alpha-helices, which contribute to its stable conformation. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a stable conformation, allowing the protein to perform its function effectively. The quaternary structure may involve homotrimerization, which is common among members of the TNF receptor superfamily (Magis2012An).

Post-translational modifications of TNFRSF4 include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. Splice variants of TNFRSF4 may exist, potentially altering the extracellular or cytoplasmic regions, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context (So2019The).

## Function
TNFRSF4, also known as OX40, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and plays a significant role in T-cell biology. It is primarily expressed on activated CD4 and CD8 T cells, as well as other lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. OX40 is not constitutively expressed but is induced upon T-cell activation, with expression peaking 24 hours to 4-5 days after stimulation (Croft2009The).

OX40 provides costimulatory signals that promote T cell division and survival, enhancing the clonal expansion of effector and memory T cell populations. It interacts with its ligand OX40L, which is expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), to provide critical costimulatory signals that enhance T-cell survival and function (So2019The; Croft2009The). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells and influences the function of NKT cells and NK cells (Croft2010Control).

OX40 signaling activates several pathways, including the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways, PI3K-Akt, and MAPK pathways, which are essential for T-cell responses (So2019The; Croft2009The). These pathways lead to the upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins and cytokine production, contributing to the regulation of immune responses and memory T cell formation (Watts2005TNF/TNFR; Croft2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TNFRSF4 gene, also known as OX40, have been implicated in various cancers and autoimmune diseases. In endometrial carcinoma (EC), TNFRSF4 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with a better prognosis. It is linked to immune-related activities within the tumor microenvironment, suggesting its role in immune regulation (Ma2022Identification). Conversely, in neuroblastoma, low TNFRSF4 expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including reduced overall survival and event-free survival. It is particularly downregulated in cisplatin-resistant tumors, correlating with higher risks of metastasis and relapse (Murphy2024In).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), elevated TNFRSF4 expression is associated with poor prognosis, including lower overall survival and higher relapse rates. High expression levels correlate with specific genetic mutations such as FLT3-ITD and NPM1, which are known to influence AML prognosis (Gamaleldin2021The; Gu2020Elevated). TNFRSF4 has also been studied in autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus, where it plays a role in disease occurrence and inflammation (Gamaleldin2021The). These findings suggest that TNFRSF4 expression levels could serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
TNFRSF4, also known as OX40, interacts with its ligand OX40L to form a co-signaling complex that includes PI3K/PKB and NF-κB1. This interaction leads to the recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAF) 2, 3, and 5, with TRAF2 playing a dominant role in mediating the functional effects of OX40. The recruitment of TRAF2 is essential for the activation of the NF-κB1 pathway, which involves the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, allowing NF-κB1 to translocate to the nucleus and activate gene transcription (So2019The; Croft2009The).

OX40 also recruits the p85 subunit of PI3K and PKB into lipid rafts, promoting the phosphorylation of IKKα/β and PKB, thereby enhancing T cell division and survival (Croft2009The). The cytoplasmic domain of OX40 contains a PIQEE motif that recruits TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5, forming a signaling complex with PKCθ, p85 PI3K, RIP1, cIAP1, cIAP2, and the IKKα/β/γ complex. This complex leads to the activation of canonical NF-κB and Akt pathways (So2019The). TRAF3 acts as an inhibitor of TRAF2-dependent OX40-mediated NF-κB activation, while TRAF6, although not directly bound by OX40, is important for noncanonical NF-κB activation (So2019The).
