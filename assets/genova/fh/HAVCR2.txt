# HAVCR2

## Overview
HAVCR2, also known as TIM-3, is a gene that encodes the hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2, a type I transmembrane protein involved in immune regulation. The protein, characterized by an immunoglobulin-like V-type domain, plays a critical role as an inhibitory receptor on various immune cells, including T cells, regulatory T cells, myeloid cells, and natural killer cells. TIM-3 is integral to maintaining immune homeostasis by modulating immune responses and preventing excessive inflammation through interactions with multiple ligands such as galectin 9 and phosphatidylserine (Wolf2019TIM3). The protein's structure, which includes a mucin-like stalk and a cytoplasmic tail, facilitates its function in intracellular signaling pathways. Mutations in the HAVCR2 gene have been linked to immune-related conditions, including subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, underscoring its clinical significance in immune regulation and potential as a therapeutic target (Lewis2023Biology; Polprasert2019Frequent).

## Structure
HAVCR2, also known as TIM-3, is a type I transmembrane protein characterized by an immunoglobulin-like V-type domain in its extracellular region. This domain is crucial for its role in immune regulation. The protein structure includes a mucin-like stalk, which connects the immunoglobulin-like domain to the transmembrane domain. The transmembrane domain anchors the protein in the cell membrane, while the cytoplasmic tail is involved in intracellular signaling pathways. 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in HAVCR2, influencing its stability and function. Glycosylation typically occurs in the extracellular region, affecting the protein's interactions with other molecules and its overall conformation. The presence of these modifications is essential for the proper functioning of TIM-3 in immune cell regulation. 

The protein does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a single polypeptide chain. However, its tertiary structure is defined by the folding of the immunoglobulin-like domain and the mucin-like stalk, which are critical for its interaction with ligands and other proteins on the surface of immune cells. The specific arrangement of these domains allows TIM-3 to participate effectively in immune response modulation.

## Function
The HAVCR2 gene encodes the TIM3 protein, which plays a crucial role in immune regulation by acting as an inhibitory receptor on various immune cells, including T cells, regulatory T cells, myeloid cells, and natural killer cells (Wolf2019TIM3). TIM3 is involved in maintaining immune homeostasis by modulating immune responses and preventing excessive inflammation. It interacts with multiple ligands, such as galectin 9, phosphatidylserine, CEACAM1, and HMGB1, which influence its signaling pathways and immune cell functions (Wolf2019TIM3).

In healthy human cells, TIM3 negatively regulates Toll-like receptor (TLR) responses in myeloid cells, affecting cytokine production and TLR expression, which helps in reducing inflammation (Wolf2019TIM3). It also plays a role in antigen cross-presentation by facilitating the uptake of apoptotic material by CD8+ dendritic cells (Wolf2019TIM3). TIM3's interaction with transcription factors such as STAT1 and NRF2 influences the expression of inflammatory mediators and macrophage functions, contributing to immune homeostasis (Wolf2019TIM3).

TIM3 is expressed in various cell types, including T cells, where it limits IFNγ-driven inflammation and promotes transplant tolerance (Wolf2019TIM3). Its expression is regulated by transcription factors like T-bet, NFIL3, PRDM1, and MAF, and its surface expression is reduced in patients with autoimmune diseases, indicating its role in controlling inflammatory responses (Wolf2019TIM3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HAVCR2 gene, which encodes the TIM-3 protein, are associated with several immune-related conditions, most notably subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Germline mutations such as c.245A>G (p.Y82C) and c.302C>T (p.T101I) have been identified in patients with SPTCL, with the p.Y82C mutation being particularly prevalent in East Asian populations and the p.T101I mutation more common in South Asians (Polprasert2019Frequent). These mutations lead to misfolding of the TIM-3 protein, impairing its function as a negative immune checkpoint and resulting in uncontrolled immune activation (Lewis2023Biology).

HAVCR2 mutations are also linked to HLH, a severe systemic inflammatory syndrome. The p.Y82C mutation, in particular, has been associated with HLH even in the absence of lymphoma, suggesting a distinct pathogenic mechanism involving decreased TIM-3 expression and increased cytokine release (Song2023Case). In cancer, alterations in HAVCR2 expression are associated with immune evasion and poor prognosis in various types, including glioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for survival and immunotherapy (Li2022Differential).

## Interactions
HAVCR2, also known as TIM-3, is involved in various physical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in immune regulation. TIM-3 interacts with galectin-9 (Gal-9), which induces cell death and promotes peripheral tolerance in T cells, particularly in the context of chronic viral infections like HIV-1 (Sironi2014A). This interaction is crucial for the negative regulation of T-cell mediated responses. TIM-3 also binds to phosphatidylserine, contributing to its role in immune suppression (Sironi2014A).

In cancer immunity, TIM-3 interacts with nuclear proteins in dendritic cells to inhibit nucleic acid recruitment, affecting innate immune response signaling (Li2022Differential). It is also part of a multiprotein complex involving interactions with proteins such as ZAP70, LCP2, LCK, and FYN, which are involved in blocking phosphorylation of key signaling pathway components (Liu2021Identifying). These interactions highlight TIM-3's role in modulating immune responses by associating with both inhibitory and costimulatory molecules.

TIM-3's interaction with LGALS9 is significant in the context of spinal cord injury-related neuropathic pain, where it acts as a co-receptor on NK cells, enhancing IFN-gamma production and inhibiting NK cell activity through the mTOR signaling pathway (Huang2020The).
