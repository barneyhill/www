# RASSF8

## Overview
RASSF8 is a gene that encodes the protein Ras association domain family member 8, which is part of the Ras association domain family. This protein functions primarily as a tumor suppressor and is involved in critical cellular processes such as cell-cell adhesion and the regulation of cell growth. RASSF8 contains an N-terminal Ras association (RA) domain, which facilitates its interaction with other proteins, although it lacks the SARAH domain present in some other RASSF family members (Volodko2014RASSF). The protein plays a significant role in maintaining cellular architecture by associating with adherens junctions, thereby preventing excessive cell migration and contributing to cellular homeostasis. Its interactions with proteins like 14-3-3 suggest a role in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation (Volodko2014RASSF). The gene's expression is often altered in various cancers, where its downregulation is linked to increased tumor aggressiveness, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (He2017Hypoxiainducible; Bo2018The).

## Function
RASSF8 is a member of the Ras association domain family and functions as a tumor suppressor. It is involved in several cellular processes, including cell-cell adhesion and regulation of cell growth. RASSF8 contains an N-terminal RA domain, which is crucial for its interactions with other proteins, but it lacks the SARAH domain found in some other RASSF family members (Volodko2014RASSF).

In healthy cells, RASSF8 plays a role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion through its association with adherens junctions, which are linked to the b-catenin/E-cadherin complex. This interaction is important for maintaining cellular architecture and preventing excessive cell migration, which can contribute to tumor aggressiveness when disrupted (Volodko2014RASSF). RASSF8 also interacts with the adapter protein 14-3-3, which is involved in regulating apoptosis and cell cycle progression, suggesting that RASSF8 may influence these processes in healthy cells (Volodko2014RASSF).

The precise roles of RASSF8 in tumorigenesis and its function in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, but its involvement in growth inhibition and cell adhesion highlights its potential importance in cellular homeostasis and cancer prevention (Richter2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RASSF8 gene have been implicated in the progression of several cancers. In gastric cancer, RASSF8 is downregulated, which is associated with increased cell growth, migration, and invasion. This downregulation is often mediated by microRNAs such as miR-224 and miR-377, which target RASSF8 and contribute to the aggressiveness of the cancer. The suppression of RASSF8 leads to enhanced NF-κB transcriptional activity, promoting cancer progression and lymph node metastasis (He2017Hypoxiainducible; Bo2018The).

In epithelial ovarian cancer, miR-320a targets RASSF8, leading to its downregulation. This interaction is linked to increased proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells, suggesting that RASSF8 acts as a tumor suppressor in this context as well (Zhang2021MicroRNA320a).

The downregulation of RASSF8 is also observed in lung cancer, where its knockdown contributes to increased cell migration and invasion, further supporting its role as a tumor suppressor across different cancer types (He2017Hypoxiainducible). These findings highlight the potential of RASSF8 as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
RASSF8 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. In Drosophila, RASSF8 forms a complex with ASPP, a homolog of p53 activating partners, which is essential for regulating Src kinase activity and adherens junction (AJ) remodeling during eye development. This complex is recruited to AJs by the Drosophila Magi protein, a homolog of human MAGI proteins, which are involved in cell adhesion and AJ dynamics. The interaction between RASSF8 and Magi is mediated by a PPxY motif in RASSF8 and WW domains in Magi, and is necessary for maintaining AJ integrity during interommatidial cell rearrangement (Zaessinger2015Drosophila).

In gastric cancer, RASSF8 is a direct target of miR-224, which is upregulated under hypoxic conditions. MiR-224 suppresses RASSF8 expression, leading to increased cell growth, migration, and invasion. RASSF8 modulates NF-κB transcriptional activity, with its overexpression reducing NF-κB activity and its knockdown enhancing it. This interaction suggests that RASSF8 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting NF-κB signaling, which is associated with oncogenic processes (He2017Hypoxiainducible).
