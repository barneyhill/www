# IER5

## Overview
The IER5 gene encodes the immediate early response 5 protein, which is a critical component in cellular stress responses and cell cycle regulation. This protein is primarily characterized by its role as an inhibitor of the PP2A/B55α phosphatase activity, influencing various cellular processes through modulation of phosphorylation states (Cao2023Molecular). IER5 is involved in the DNA damage response and is essential for the induction of squamous cell differentiation mediated by Notch signaling (Pan2020IER5). The protein's interactions with key regulatory subunits, such as B55α and B55β, and its involvement in the dephosphorylation and activation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Yamano2020Nuclear; Kawabata2015Immediate‐early). Additionally, IER5's expression is linked to various cancers, where it contributes to tumorigenesis and cancer cell proliferation, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Asano2016IER5).

## Structure
The IER5 protein is composed of 327 amino acids, with a primary structure that includes 42 negatively charged residues (Asp and Glu) and 31 positively charged residues (Arg and Lys) (Xiong2019Prediction). The protein has a molecular weight of 33,703.69 and a theoretical isoelectric point of 4.91, indicating it is generally hydrophilic (Xiong2019Prediction). The secondary structure of IER5 is characterized by the presence of 6 α-helices, with no β-sheets or β-turns, and the remainder of the structure consists of disordered coils (Xiong2019Prediction). The tertiary structure was predicted using the I-TASSER platform, which provides a three-dimensional model based on sequence-structure-function predictions (Xiong2019Prediction). The protein lacks transmembrane structures and signal peptides, suggesting a nuclear localization, supported by a nuclear localization sequence with a 56.5% probability (Xiong2019Prediction). Post-translational modifications include 18 O-glycosylation sites and 22 phosphorylation sites, involving serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (Xiong2019Prediction). No information is available regarding the quaternary structure or specific domains within the protein.

## Function
IER5 (immediate early response 5) is a protein that plays a significant role in cellular stress responses and cell cycle regulation. In healthy human cells, IER5 functions as an inhibitor of the PP2A/B55α phosphatase activity. It achieves this by using its N-terminal helical hairpin to block the substrate-binding platform of the B55α regulatory subunit, thereby inhibiting the dephosphorylation of certain substrates (Cao2023Molecular). This inhibition is crucial in the context of Notch signaling, particularly in squamous cell carcinoma cells, where IER5 influences the expression of KRT1, a marker of keratinocyte differentiation (Cao2023Molecular).

IER5 is also involved in the DNA damage response and is necessary for the induction of squamous cell differentiation mediated by Notch signaling. It interacts with the B55α regulatory subunit of PP2A, and this interaction is enhanced by Notch activation, which increases IER5 expression (Pan2020IER5). Additionally, IER5 regulates the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), impacting protein synthesis and stress response mechanisms (Kawabata2015Immediate‐early). IER5's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and responses to stress.

## Clinical Significance
IER5 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in modulating cellular stress responses and proliferation. Alterations in IER5 expression are associated with tumorigenesis, particularly through its interaction with the transcription factor HSF1. IER5 forms a complex with HSF1 and the phosphatase PP2A, promoting the dephosphorylation and activation of HSF1, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation under stress conditions (Yamano2020Nuclear; Asano2016IER5). This activation pathway is distinct from the heat shock response and is linked to the anchorage-independent growth of cancer cells, a hallmark of malignancy (Asano2016IER5).

IER5 is also a target of p53, a tumor suppressor, and its expression is induced by DNA-damaging agents. This induction is associated with the activation of HSF1 and the upregulation of heat shock proteins, contributing to cancer cell survival and proliferation (Asano2016IER5). High levels of IER5 expression correlate with poor prognosis in cancers such as bladder, breast, and brain cancers, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Asano2016IER5). The presence of super-enhancers at the IER5 locus in cancer cells further underscores its role in tumor pathogenesis (Asano2016IER5).

## Interactions
IER5 (immediate early response 5) is involved in several key protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular stress responses and cell cycle regulation. IER5 interacts with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), specifically binding to its B55 regulatory subunits, such as B55α and B55β. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal region of IER5 and is essential for enhancing PP2A's phosphatase activity towards target proteins like heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) (Pan2020IER5; Ueda2019IER; Kawabata2015Immediate‐early).

IER5 forms a ternary complex with HSF1 and PP2A, facilitating the dephosphorylation and activation of HSF1, which is necessary for the heat shock response (Yamano2020Nuclear). The protein also contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal that interacts with importin-α and importin-β, enabling its nuclear import, which is critical for its role in activating HSF1 (Yamano2020Nuclear).

IER5's interaction with PP2A/B55α involves a helical hairpin conformation that occludes a substrate recruitment surface on B55α, inhibiting PP2A/B55α's ability to dephosphorylate certain substrates (Cao2023Molecular). These interactions highlight IER5's role in modulating phosphorylation states and cellular stress responses.
