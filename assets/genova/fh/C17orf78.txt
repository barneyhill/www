# C17orf78

## Overview
C17orf78 is a gene located on chromosome 17 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 17 open reading frame 78. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, which suggests its involvement in cellular signaling or transport processes across the cell membrane. The specific biological functions and pathways associated with C17orf78 remain under investigation, but its expression and potential interactions with other cellular components indicate a role in various physiological processes. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which C17orf78 and its encoded protein contribute to cellular function and their implications in health and disease.
