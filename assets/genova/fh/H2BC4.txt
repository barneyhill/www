# H2BC4

## Overview
H2BC4 is a gene that encodes the protein H2B clustered histone 4, which is a member of the histone H2B family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the structural organization of chromatin by forming nucleosomes, the fundamental units of DNA packaging. As a core histone, H2B clustered histone 4 interacts with other histones, such as H2A, H3, and H4, to facilitate DNA compaction and regulate gene expression. The gene's involvement in chromatin dynamics underscores its significance in various biological processes, including cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. H2BC4 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, such as cancer and spontaneous abortion, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Liu2024Analysis; Jia2022H2B; Auwul2021Bioinformatics).

## Clinical Significance
The H2BC4 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in chromatin structure and gene expression regulation. Mutations in H2BC4 have been reported in neoplastic Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) of the skin, where cases with these mutations exhibited particularly invasive disease, often associated with aneuploidy (Ragusa2023Contribution). In breast cancer, H2BC4 is overexpressed, particularly in metastatic relapse of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and lobular carcinoma (LC). This overexpression is linked to DNA repair gene dysregulation and is thought to be influenced by copy number variations (CNVs) (Mohamed2021The).

In glioma, H2BC4 is highly expressed, suggesting a potential role as a prognostic biomarker, although specific mutations or alterations in this context are not detailed (Jia2022H2B). Additionally, H2BC4 has been identified as a candidate gene associated with spontaneous abortion, based on its evolutionary conservation and intolerance to mutations, as indicated by significant PhyloP scores and RVIS percentiles (Liu2024Analysis). These findings highlight the clinical significance of H2BC4 in various pathological conditions, emphasizing its potential as a target for further research and therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
H2BC4, a member of the histone H2B family, is involved in the formation of nucleosomes, which are essential for DNA packaging into chromatin. This protein interacts with other histones, such as H2A, H3, and H4, to form the nucleosome core, playing a crucial role in DNA compaction and gene expression regulation. In the context of viral carcinogenesis, H2BC4 has been identified as part of the 'Viral carcinogenesis' pathway, suggesting potential interactions with other genes or proteins involved in this pathway (Auwul2021Bioinformatics).

In the study of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), H2BC4 was found to be downregulated in olaparib-treated MDA-MB-468 cells. This downregulation indicates that H2BC4 may have interactions or roles in breast cancer that are not yet fully understood, necessitating further investigation into its specific functions and interactions in this context (Hekmatshoar2024The).

While the proteomic profiling study by Lukauskas et al. involved H2BC4 in the context of histone protein normalization, specific interactions of H2BC4 with proteins or nucleic acids were not detailed in the provided excerpts (Lukauskas2024Decoding). Therefore, the precise nature of H2BC4's interactions remains to be fully elucidated.
