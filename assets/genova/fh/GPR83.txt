# GPR83

## Overview
GPR83 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 83, a member of the rhodopsin-like class A GPCR family. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of GPCRs, and is involved in various neuroendocrine signaling pathways. The GPR83 protein is expressed predominantly in the brain, where it plays a crucial role in modulating physiological processes such as stress, reward, anxiety, and feeding behaviors. It interacts with neuropeptides like PEN and procholecystokinin-derived peptides, influencing signaling pathways mediated by different G proteins. GPR83's involvement in these pathways suggests its potential impact on energy metabolism, pain modulation, and developmental processes. Alterations in GPR83 expression or function have been associated with conditions such as anxiety, obesity, and developmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Müller2013The; Mack2022GPR83; Mack2019Neuropeptide).

## Structure
GPR83 is a G protein-coupled receptor characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure typical of the rhodopsin-like class A GPCR family (Mack2019Neuropeptide). The human GPR83 gene produces two transcripts: a longer isoform 1 with 423 amino acids and a shorter isoform 2 with 381 amino acids, the latter lacking the third transmembrane domain (Li2022FAM237A). The mature human GPR83 protein consists of 407 amino acids, forming a seven helical-bundle structure with conserved residues in TMD3, TMD6, and TMD7, which are crucial for structural integrity, ligand binding, and downstream signaling (Li2022FAM237A).

The receptor has potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the N-terminus and phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and A in the third intracellular loop and C-terminus (Lueptow2018Targeting). These post-translational modifications may influence receptor function and signaling. GPR83 also forms homodimers, a common feature among GPCRs, which may affect its signaling properties (Müller2013GProtein).

In terms of splice variants, the human GPR83 gene is known to produce a functional variant that is highly expressed, while in mice, up to four isoforms have been identified, with some predicted to be nonfunctional (Mack2019Neuropeptide). The physiological significance of these splice variants remains to be fully elucidated.

## Function
GPR83, a G protein-coupled receptor, functions as a receptor for the neuroendocrine peptide PEN, which is derived from the proSAAS precursor. This receptor is involved in various signaling pathways, including Gq- and Gi-mediated signaling, which influence intracellular processes such as phospholipase C (PLC) activity and adenylyl cyclase inhibition (Gomes2016Identification; Mack2019Neuropeptide). GPR83 is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions like the hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex, suggesting its involvement in stress, reward, anxiety, fear, learning, and memory (Mack2019Neuropeptide).

In the hypothalamus, GPR83 signaling is associated with increased PLC activity, while in the hippocampus, it inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity, indicating its ability to couple with different G proteins depending on the brain region (Mack2019Neuropeptide). The receptor's activation by PEN has been shown to modulate synaptic activity, such as inhibiting presynaptic glutamate release in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, which may influence feeding behaviors (Gomes2016Identification).

GPR83 also plays a role in the modulation of food intake and reward behaviors, as evidenced by altered feeding and anxiety-related behaviors in GPR83 knockout mice (Mack2022GPR83). These findings highlight GPR83's significant role in neuroendocrine signaling and its potential impact on various physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the GPR83 gene have been implicated in several physiological and pathological conditions. In the context of pain modulation, GPR83 is expressed in dorsal root ganglion neurons and is associated with nociceptive genes. Silencing GPR83 in these neurons reduces responses to pain stimuli, suggesting its involvement in pain sensation and its potential as a target for pain management therapies (Kim2023Gpr83).

GPR83 also plays a role in anxiety-related behaviors. Studies have shown that GPR83 knockout mice exhibit decreased anxiety levels, particularly in males, indicating a sex-specific influence on anxiety modulation. The receptor's expression in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens, regions associated with anxiety, further supports its role in stress responses (Fakira2021PEN).

In terms of energy metabolism, GPR83 interacts with the ghrelin receptor, influencing systemic energy balance. GPR83 knockout mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity and exhibit improved glucose tolerance, suggesting that GPR83 modulates ghrelin signaling and energy homeostasis. This interaction highlights its potential involvement in metabolic disorders such as obesity (Müller2013The).

GPR83 has also been linked to craniofacial-limb syndromes in chickens, suggesting a possible role in developmental disorders. Alterations in GPR83 expression may contribute to phenotypes such as truncated limbs and cleft palate, indicating its significance in developmental pathways (O’Hare2018Two).

## Interactions
GPR83, a G protein-coupled receptor, engages in various interactions with other proteins, particularly neuropeptides and receptors. It is known to interact with the neuropeptide PEN, derived from the proSAAS precursor, which acts as a high-affinity ligand for GPR83, influencing its signaling pathways (Lueptow2018Targeting). GPR83 also interacts with peptides derived from procholecystokinin (proCCK), such as CCK56-62 and CCK56-63, which can bind to the receptor and modulate signaling pathways, including those mediated by G proteins like Gai, Gas, and Gaq (Mack2022GPR83).

GPR83 forms functional complexes with other receptors, such as GPR171 and the ghrelin receptor GHSR1a. The interaction with GPR171 alters the pharmacological properties of GPR83, affecting its signaling dynamics and enhancing PEN-induced endocytosis (Gomes2016Identification; Price2022The). These interactions suggest that GPR83 participates in complex signaling networks, potentially influencing physiological processes like energy metabolism and immune response (Gomes2016Identification; Lueptow2018Targeting). The receptor's ability to form dimers and its interactions with other proteins highlight its role in diverse cellular functions (Müller2013GProtein).
