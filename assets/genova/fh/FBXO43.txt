# FBXO43

## Overview
FBXO43 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 43, a member of the F-box protein family, which is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This protein functions as part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complex, an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. F-box protein 43 is particularly important in regulating the cell cycle, especially during mitosis, by ensuring the timely degradation of proteins that could otherwise disrupt cellular function or lead to genomic instability. The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various diseases, including male infertility and cancers such as breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance in cell cycle regulation and tumor progression (Zhou2023FBox; Ma2021Downregulation; Li2023FBXO43).

## Structure


## Function
FBXO43, or F-box protein 43, is a member of the F-box protein family, which plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This protein is a component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complex, a multi-protein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that is responsible for tagging specific proteins with ubiquitin, marking them for degradation by the proteasome. The activity of FBXO43 is particularly significant during the cell cycle, where it is involved in regulating mitosis. By targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, FBXO43 ensures proper cell division and maintains genomic stability. This regulation is essential for the orderly progression of the cell cycle and prevents the accumulation of proteins that could potentially disrupt cellular function or lead to genomic instability. The precise control of protein levels by FBXO43 is vital for healthy cell proliferation and the prevention of diseases associated with cell cycle dysregulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FBXO43 gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly in the context of male infertility and various cancers. In the realm of male infertility, mutations in FBXO43 have been associated with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) and teratozoospermia. A homozygous nonsense mutation in FBXO43 causes meiotic spermatocyte arrest at early diplotene, leading to NOA. Another mutation, a homozygous nonsynonymous mutation, is linked to teratozoospermia, resulting in abnormal spermatozoa with larger amorphous heads and chromatin defects (Zhuang2024The).

In cancer, FBXO43 is implicated in breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In breast cancer, FBXO43 is overexpressed, and its downregulation inhibits tumor growth by limiting its interaction with PCNA, a protein involved in DNA replication and repair. This interaction is crucial for the oncogenic effects of FBXO43, and its disruption leads to reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as increased apoptosis (Ma2021Downregulation).

In HCC, FBXO43 is upregulated and promotes cancer cell growth and invasion by facilitating the degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 through a UBE2C-dependent pathway. This upregulation is associated with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages (Zhou2023FBox).

## Interactions
FBXO43, also known as F-box protein 43, is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cancer cell proliferation and migration. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FBXO43 interacts with Cyclin D1 (CCND1), stabilizing it through polyubiquitination with K63-linked ubiquitin chains. This interaction promotes HCC cell proliferation and migration by enhancing CCND1 stability, which is crucial for cell cycle progression (Li2023FBXO43). Immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the binding between FBXO43 and CCND1, and silencing FBXO43 results in reduced CCND1 expression, while its overexpression increases CCND1 levels (Li2023FBXO43).

In breast cancer, FBXO43 interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). This interaction is significant for tumor growth, as downregulation of FBXO43 limits its interaction with PCNA, thereby inhibiting tumor proliferation. Co-immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the interaction between FBXO43 and PCNA, and overexpression of PCNA can reverse the effects of FBXO43 knockdown, highlighting the importance of this interaction in breast cancer cell proliferation and migration (Ma2021Downregulation). These interactions suggest that FBXO43 plays a role in regulating cell cycle and tumor growth through its interactions with key proteins.
