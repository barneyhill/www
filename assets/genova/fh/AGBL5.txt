# AGBL5

## Overview
The AGBL5 gene encodes the protein AGBL carboxypeptidase 5, which is a member of the cytosolic carboxypeptidase (CCP) family. This protein functions as a deglutamylase, playing a crucial role in the post-translational modification of tubulin by removing glutamate residues from polyglutamylated tubulin. This activity is essential for regulating microtubule dynamics, which are vital for various cellular processes, including cell division, intracellular transport, and neuronal function (Milibari2022Unilateral; Astuti2016Mutations). AGBL5 is particularly significant in the human retina, where it is expressed in all layers and is crucial for maintaining photoreceptor cell integrity (Kastner2015Exome). Mutations in AGBL5 are linked to retinal dystrophies such as autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and syndromic forms of the disease, highlighting its importance in ocular health (Holanda2024Syndromic; Astuti2016Mutations).

## Function
The AGBL5 gene encodes a protein that is part of the cytosolic carboxypeptidase (CCP) family, specifically known as CCP5. This protein is involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin, a critical component of the cytoskeleton. AGBL5 functions as a deglutamylase, removing glutamate residues from the C-terminus of polyglutamylated tubulin, which is essential for regulating microtubule dynamics (Milibari2022Unilateral; Astuti2016Mutations). These modifications are crucial for maintaining microtubule stability and function, affecting processes such as cell division, intracellular transport, and neuronal function (Astuti2016Mutations).

In the human retina, AGBL5 is active in all layers, with prominent expression in the cone inner segments, ganglion cells, and nerve fiber layer. This suggests a significant role in retinal structure and function, particularly in maintaining the balance of post-translational modifications necessary for photoreceptor cell integrity (Kastner2015Exome). Disruptions in AGBL5 function can lead to hyperglutamylation, which is associated with retinal degeneration and conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa (Mercey2024Glutamylation). The protein's activity is primarily cytoplasmic, especially in regions with high microtubule activity, underscoring its importance in cellular and organismal homeostasis (Milibari2022Unilateral).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AGBL5 gene are associated with several retinal dystrophies, most notably autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP). This condition is characterized by the progressive degeneration of photoreceptors, leading to symptoms such as night blindness, peripheral visual field loss, and eventual deterioration of central vision due to cone photoreceptor degeneration (Astuti2016Mutations). Various mutations in AGBL5, including missense and nonsense variants, have been identified in different families affected by arRP, with these mutations often leading to protein destabilization or loss of function (Patel2016Expanding; Astuti2016Mutations).

In addition to arRP, AGBL5 mutations have been implicated in syndromic forms of retinitis pigmentosa, where patients also experience neurosensory hypoacusis, a type of hearing impairment (Holanda2024Syndromic). Furthermore, novel mutations in AGBL5 have been linked to unilateral retinitis pigmentosa, a rare form of the disease affecting only one eye, suggesting a potential association with ciliopathy-related retinal diseases (Milibari2022Unilateral). These findings underscore the genetic heterogeneity and complexity of retinal dystrophies associated with AGBL5 mutations.
