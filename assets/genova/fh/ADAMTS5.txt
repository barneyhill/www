# ADAMTS5

## Overview
ADAMTS5 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 5, commonly referred to as aggrecanase-2. This protein is a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family, which is characterized by its role as a metalloprotease involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix components, particularly aggrecan, a key proteoglycan in cartilage. The ADAMTS5 protein is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and is implicated in various physiological processes, including cartilage remodeling and endometrial tissue restructuring. Its activity is significant in the context of joint health, where it contributes to the breakdown of cartilage in conditions such as osteoarthritis. The protein's structure includes multiple domains that facilitate its interactions with other extracellular matrix proteins, influencing its function and regulation (Kelwick2015The; Gendron2007Proteolytic).

## Structure
ADAMTS5, also known as aggrecanase-2, is a multi-domain enzyme with a complex molecular structure. It consists of several domains: an N-terminal pro-domain, a catalytic domain, a disintegrin-like domain, two thrombospondin type 1 motifs, a cysteine-rich region, and a spacer domain (Kosasih2016A; Korchagina2020Structural). The catalytic domain features a metzincin architecture, characterized by a five-stranded β-sheet and α-helices forming a hydrophobic pillow under a Zn2+ ion, coordinated by a consensus HEXXHXBG(/N/S)BXHD motif (Kelwick2015The). 

The tertiary structure of ADAMTS5 includes a unique disulfide bond between residues 342 and 394, distinguishing it from other metalloproteases (Shieh2008High). The protein also contains a novel structural calcium binding site, which contributes to its substrate specificity and stability (Shieh2008High). 

ADAMTS5 forms catalytically active oligomers, stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bonds and non-covalent interactions, which are crucial for its full aggrecanase activity (Kosasih2016A). Post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation, C-mannosylation, and O-fucosylation affect its secretion, localization, and function (Kelwick2015The). These modifications occur primarily at the thrombospondin-like repeats, ensuring proper folding and secretion.

## Function
ADAMTS5, also known as ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 5, is a crucial enzyme involved in the degradation of aggrecan, a major component of the cartilage extracellular matrix. In healthy human cells, ADAMTS5 is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it plays a significant role in tissue remodeling and development, particularly in joint health and function (Verma2011ADAMTS4). The enzyme is constitutively expressed and is not regulated by cytokines, unlike its counterpart ADAMTS-4, which is upregulated by catabolic cytokines (Verma2011ADAMTS4).

ADAMTS5 is involved in the proteolysis of the extracellular matrix in the human endometrium, a process essential for tissue remodeling during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Its expression is correlated with the decidualization of stromal cells, indicating its role in establishing a uterine environment capable of supporting pregnancy (Zhu2006Expression). The enzyme is synthesized in an inactive proform and activated upon secretion, undergoing further post-translational modifications (Zhu2006Expression). In normal cartilage, ADAMTS5 is primarily found in the superficial zone, associated with hyaluronan surrounding cells, suggesting its involvement in extracellular matrix organization (Plaas2007Aggrecanolysis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ADAMTS5 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in osteoarthritis (OA). ADAMTS5 is a key enzyme responsible for the degradation of aggrecan, a major component of cartilage. Its excessive activity leads to cartilage destruction, a hallmark of OA. Genetic variations in ADAMTS5, such as the rs2830585 polymorphism, have been associated with an increased risk of knee OA, especially in older populations (Zhou2019Genetic). 

In addition to its role in OA, ADAMTS5 is implicated in other conditions. It is involved in the regulation of adipose tissue, where its deficiency promotes the browning of white adipose tissue and increases brown adipose tissue mass, potentially influencing obesity and metabolic health (Bauters2017Loss). ADAMTS5 also plays a role in cardiac development, with deficiencies leading to heart valve abnormalities (Dubail2015Insights).

Furthermore, ADAMTS5 has been studied in the context of cancer. A specific polymorphism, rs2380585, in the ADAMTS5 gene is associated with a decreased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in a Chinese Han population, suggesting a protective role against this type of cancer (Li2014Association).

## Interactions
ADAMTS5, a member of the ADAMTS family, is known for its interactions with various proteins, particularly within the extracellular matrix (ECM). It primarily interacts with aggrecan, a major cartilage proteoglycan, through its cysteine-rich and spacer domains, facilitating its role as a potent aggrecanase involved in cartilage degradation (Gendron2007Proteolytic; Dennler2023Phylogenetic). ADAMTS5 also interacts with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), which mediates its endocytosis. This interaction is significant as it regulates the extracellular activity of ADAMTS5, impacting its aggrecanolytic function (Santamaria2017Development).

The interaction with LRP1 can be specifically blocked by a monoclonal antibody, 1B7, which binds to the catalytic and disintegrin domains of ADAMTS5, preventing its endocytosis and allowing for increased extracellular activity (Santamaria2017Development). Additionally, ADAMTS5 is involved in interactions with other ECM components such as fibromodulin, decorin, and biglycan, which are influenced by its non-catalytic domains (Gendron2007Proteolytic). These interactions highlight the role of ADAMTS5 in ECM remodeling and its potential implications in diseases such as osteoarthritis.
