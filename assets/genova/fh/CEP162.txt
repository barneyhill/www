# CEP162

## Overview
CEP162 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 162, a critical component involved in the processes of ciliogenesis and neurogenesis. The protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein and is integral to the assembly and function of the ciliary transition zone (TZ), a structure essential for the proper formation and function of cilia. CEP162 localizes to the distal ends of centrioles, where it interacts with microtubules and other core TZ components, facilitating their organization and stability. This interaction is crucial for the removal of CP110 from the mother centriole, a necessary step for axoneme elongation and cilia formation. Mutations in the CEP162 gene have been linked to ciliopathies, including late-onset retinitis pigmentosa, underscoring its importance in maintaining retinal health and overall ciliary function (Wu2024Cep131Cep162; Nuzhat2023CEP162; Wang2013CEP162).

## Structure
The human CEP162 protein is composed of 1,403 amino acids and features three coiled-coil (CC) domains located in its C-terminus. These domains are designated as CC1 (residues 617-906), CC2 (residues 957-1,121), and CC3 (residues 1,167-1,386) (Nuzhat2023CEP162). The coiled-coil regions facilitate protein-protein interactions, with CC1 and CC2 associating with microtubules and CC3 interacting with centrioles (Nuzhat2023CEP162). 

A known mutation, c.1935dupA, results in a truncated version of the protein, CEP162-E646R*5, which retains the ability to bind microtubules but loses its capacity to associate with centrioles or CEP290 (Nuzhat2023CEP162). This truncated protein is approximately 80 kDa, compared to the full-length protein's molecular weight of about 165 kDa (Nuzhat2023CEP162). 

The protein's localization is crucial for its function, as it is found at the basal bodies and is involved in ciliogenesis and neurogenesis (Nuzhat2023CEP162). Despite the importance of these structural features, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of CEP162 are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
CEP162, also known as centrosomal protein 162, plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis and neurogenesis in healthy human cells. It is essential for the assembly of the transition zone (TZ) at the base of cilia, a critical step in ciliogenesis. CEP162 localizes to the distal ends of centrioles, where it interacts with core TZ components and mediates their association with microtubules (MTs) (Wang2013CEP162). This localization is crucial for the proper recruitment of transition zone proteins, ensuring the structural integrity and function of cilia (Nuzhat2023CEP162).

CEP162 is involved in the removal of CP110 from the mother centriole, a necessary step for axoneme elongation and proper cilia formation (Nuzhat2023CEP162). It also interacts with CEP290, facilitating its association with MTs, and acts as a bridge linking TZ components to ciliary MTs (Wang2013CEP162). In the retina, CEP162 is expressed throughout and is particularly important for maintaining retinal health, as its deficiency can lead to retinal degeneration (Nuzhat2023CEP162).

CEP162's ability to bind directly to MTs has been demonstrated, and its overexpression can induce the formation of MT bundles, highlighting its role in microtubule stabilization (Wang2013CEP162).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP162 gene are associated with late-onset retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a form of retinal degeneration. Specifically, a homozygous frameshift variant in CEP162 has been identified in patients from two unrelated Moroccan families, leading to a truncated protein that fails to localize to the ciliary basal body. This mislocalization results in impaired recruitment of transition zone proteins, crucial for ciliary function, and is linked to the retinal degeneration observed in these patients (Nuzhat2023CEP162).

The truncated CEP162 protein retains some microtubule binding ability and localizes to mitotic spindles, suggesting partial functionality in neuroretina development. However, its inability to support proper ciliary assembly and maintenance is a key factor in the development of RP, highlighting the gene's dual role in ciliogenesis and neurogenesis (Nuzhat2023CEP162).

CEP162 mutations are also implicated in broader ciliopathies, which are disorders arising from ciliary dysfunction. These conditions can affect multiple organs, including the retina, and are characterized by defects in cilia structure or function (Wu2024Cep131Cep162; Nuzhat2023CEP162). The study of CEP162 mutations provides insights into the pathogenesis of these ciliopathies and their impact on human health.

## Interactions
CEP162 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in ciliogenesis and the assembly of the ciliary transition zone (TZ). It directly binds to microtubules, stabilizing ciliary microtubules at the distal ends of centrioles to promote TZ formation (Wang2013CEP162). CEP162 forms a complex with CEP290, a core TZ component, facilitating its association with microtubules. This interaction is essential for the proper assembly of the TZ (Wu2024Cep131Cep162; Wang2013CEP162). Immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that CEP162 and CEP290 are part of the same protein complex, with the N-terminal region of CEP162 required for this interaction (Wang2013CEP162).

CEP162 also interacts with CEP131, acting as a bridge between CEP131 and CEP290. This interaction is critical for the localization of CEP290 to the basal body and the initiation of ciliogenesis (Wu2024Cep131Cep162). The C-terminal half of CEP162 is crucial for its interaction with CEP131 and its localization to the basal body (Wu2024Cep131Cep162). These interactions highlight the role of CEP162 in maintaining the structural integrity and function of ciliary components.
