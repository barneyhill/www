# TSR1

## Overview
TSR1 is a gene that encodes the TSR1 ribosome maturation factor, a protein crucial for the biogenesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit. This protein is categorized as a ribosome maturation factor and plays a pivotal role in the late stages of 18S rRNA maturation, which is essential for the proper assembly and export of pre-40S ribosomal particles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Carron2010Analysis). Structurally, TSR1 is characterized by a chalice-like form with a small GTPase-like fold, although it lacks the conserved motifs necessary for guanine nucleotide binding and GTP hydrolysis, making it a structural mimic rather than a functional enzyme (McCaughan2016Pre40S). TSR1's interaction with various ribosomal components ensures the fidelity of ribosome assembly, preventing premature translation initiation and maintaining the integrity of protein synthesis (Karbstein2013Quality). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its potential involvement in conditions such as spontaneous coronary artery dissection, highlighting the importance of further research into its genetic variations and implications (Sun2019Association).

## Structure
The TSR1 protein is a ribosome maturation factor involved in the biogenesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Structurally, TSR1 is characterized by a chalice-like form with a small GTPase-like fold in its N-terminal domain and three β-barrel domains (McCaughan2016Pre40S). Despite its structural similarity to translational GTPases such as EF-Tu, TSR1 lacks the conserved motifs necessary for guanine nucleotide binding and GTP hydrolysis, making it a structural mimic rather than a functional enzyme (McCaughan2016Pre40S). 

The protein's domains I-III show structural resemblance to the EF-Tu family of GTPases, although TSR1 does not possess catalytic activity due to disrupted sequence signatures (McCaughan2016Pre40S). The electrostatic surface of TSR1 reveals a negatively charged front surface and a positively charged back surface, which is important for its interaction with pre-40S ribosomal particles (McCaughan2016Pre40S). 

TSR1's structure includes a unique long insertion in domain II, differentiating it from its relatives (McCaughan2016Pre40S). The protein's C-terminal domain is positioned close to the head and beak regions of the pre-40S particle, and its binding is mutually exclusive with other factors like eIF5B and Rio1, suggesting a regulatory role in ribosome maturation (McCaughan2016Pre40S).

## Function
The human gene TSR1 encodes a ribosome maturation factor that plays a critical role in the biogenesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit. In healthy human cells, TSR1 is involved in the late stages of 18S rRNA maturation, which is essential for the formation of the 40S ribosomal subunit. This process is crucial for the proper assembly and export of pre-40S ribosomal particles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Carron2010Analysis). TSR1 is necessary for the efficient nuclear export of these particles, and its depletion results in their retention within the nucleus, indicating its role in facilitating their transport to the cytoplasm (Carron2010Analysis).

TSR1 functions as a structural mimic of translational GTPases, although it lacks GTPase activity. It acts as a placeholder on pre-40S particles, preventing premature association with mature 60S subunits and blocking the binding of other factors necessary for final maturation (McCaughan2016Pre40S). This ensures that only properly assembled ribosomes are exported and prevents premature translation initiation (Karbstein2013Quality). TSR1's role in ribosome biogenesis is vital for maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis and supporting cellular growth and function.

## Clinical Significance
The TSR1 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in ribosome maturation and potential genetic variations. In the context of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), a study has explored the association of TSR1 gene variants with this condition in the Chinese Han population. SCAD is a significant cause of acute coronary syndrome, particularly in younger women, and is characterized by the splitting of the coronary artery wall. The study utilized whole exome sequencing to identify genetic variants in TSR1 that may contribute to the pathogenesis of SCAD, suggesting a potential genetic influence on the condition (Sun2019Association).

While the TSR1 gene's role in Yarrowia lipolytica is well-documented in the context of the signal recognition particle-dependent translocation pathway, there is no direct evidence linking TSR1 mutations to specific diseases in humans from this research. However, the essential nature of TSR1 in protein translocation and its structural similarities to other proteins highlight its importance in cellular processes (Mamoun1996The). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of TSR1 gene mutations in humans.

## Interactions
TSR1 is a ribosome maturation factor that plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit. It interacts with various ribosomal components and assembly factors to ensure proper ribosome assembly and function. TSR1 is structurally similar to translational GTPases but lacks the active site residues necessary for GTP binding and hydrolysis, rendering it inactive as a GTPase (McCaughan2016Pre40S).

TSR1 binds to pre-40S ribosomal particles, where it prevents premature binding to the 60S subunit by presenting a highly acidic surface on the outside of pre-40S particles (McCaughan2016Pre40S). This interaction is crucial for blocking the binding of other factors such as the GTPase eIF5B and the ATPase Rio1, which are necessary for late pre-40S maturation (EspinarMarchena2017Placeholder). TSR1's removal is necessary for the association of eIF5B and Rio1, which are involved in the final maturation steps of pre-40S particles (McCaughan2016Pre40S).

TSR1 also interacts with Dim1, another ribosome assembly factor, in the formation of 80S-like ribosome intermediates. These intermediates are important for quality control, ensuring that only translation-competent ribosomes are released into the translating pool (Rai2019An). TSR1's interaction with pre-rRNA and other ribosomal proteins is essential for the processing and assembly of ribosomal RNA, highlighting its role in the complex network of interactions necessary for ribosome biogenesis (GELPERIN2001Bms1p).
