# STX10

## Overview
STX10 is a gene that encodes the protein syntaxin 10, a member of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) family, which is integral to vesicular transport processes within cells. Syntaxin 10 is primarily involved in the trafficking of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), a critical pathway for maintaining lysosomal enzyme sorting and cellular homeostasis. The protein forms a SNARE complex with STX16, Vti1a, and VAMP3, distinguishing its role from other SNARE complexes involved in different transport pathways (Ganley2008A). Syntaxin 10's interactions with various proteins, including Rab GTPases and tethering proteins like GCC185, underscore its importance in vesicle fusion and regulation of transport processes (Ganley2008A). Alterations in STX10 expression or function have been linked to diseases such as osteosarcoma and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Gong2023Identification; Kim2018Alternative).

## Function
Syntaxin 10 (STX10) is a SNARE protein that plays a critical role in vesicular transport processes within human cells, particularly in the trafficking of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). STX10 is part of a SNARE complex that includes STX16, Vti1a, and VAMP3, which is essential for the recycling of MPRs from late endosomes to the Golgi complex. This complex is distinct from those involved in other transport pathways, such as those for TGN46 and cholera toxin, which involve STX6 (Ganley2008A).

STX10 is specifically required for the transport of cargoes from late endosomes to the TGN, a process that is crucial for maintaining proper lysosomal enzyme sorting and cellular homeostasis. Depletion of STX10 leads to missorting of MPRs, resulting in their dispersal to peripheral vesicles and increased degradation rates, which affects the steady-state levels of these receptors (Ganley2008A). The interaction of STX10 with other proteins, such as GCC185, a tethering protein, and Rab GTPases, is vital for vesicle fusion and the regulation of these transport processes (Ganley2008A).

## Clinical Significance
STX10 (syntaxin 10) has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. In osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, STX10 is identified as a MYC target gene with significant clinical implications. It is highly expressed in osteosarcoma tissues compared to normal tissues, and its expression is linked to the MYC gene. Knockdown experiments in osteosarcoma cell lines have shown that reducing STX10 expression leads to decreased cell viability, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in cancer progression. High STX10 expression correlates with increased risk and lower survival rates, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention and a prognostic indicator in osteosarcoma (Gong2023Identification).

STX10 is also involved in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) through its role in vesicle-mediated transport. Alterations in alternative splicing and mutations in STX10 can dysregulate vesicular transport and immune responses, contributing to PD pathology (Kim2018Alternative). Additionally, STX10 has been highlighted in network analyses of prostate cancer, indicating its potential involvement in cancer regulation (Shukla2023Towards). These findings underscore the clinical significance of STX10 in various diseases.

## Interactions
STX10 (syntaxin 10) is involved in several protein interactions critical for its function in vesicle trafficking. It forms a SNARE complex with STX16, Vti1a, and VAMP3, which is essential for the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) from late endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in human cells (Ganley2008A). This complex is distinct from the one involving STX6, which is used for transporting other proteins like TGN46 and cholera toxin (Ganley2008A).

STX10 interacts with the small GTPase Rab9, which is necessary for its role in retrograde transport from late endosomes to the TGN (Ganley2008A; Dingjan2018Endosomal). The interaction between STX10 and the tethering protein GCC185 is regulated by Rab GTPases, particularly Rab6, which competes with STX16 for GCC185 binding (Ganley2008A).

STX10 also binds to STX13, which is involved in transferrin receptor recycling, indicating its multiple roles in endosomal transport (Ganley2008A). These interactions highlight STX10's critical role in distinguishing between different transport routes to the Golgi (Ganley2008A).
