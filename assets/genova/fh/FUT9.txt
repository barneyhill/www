# FUT9

## Overview
FUT9 is a gene that encodes the enzyme fucosyltransferase 9, which is a member of the glycosyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the biosynthesis of the Lewis X (Le^x) antigen, a glycan structure that plays a crucial role in cell-cell recognition and adhesion. Fucosyltransferase 9 is categorized as a fucosyltransferase enzyme, which functions within the Golgi apparatus to catalyze the transfer of fucose to glycoproteins and glycolipids. The expression of FUT9 is notably significant during human embryogenesis, particularly in the brain, suggesting its involvement in neural development and organogenesis. In adult tissues, its expression diminishes, indicating a developmental role. The enzyme's activity is associated with intracellular processes, and it has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, due to its role in glycan synthesis and modification (Fujita2021Fucosylation; CailleauThomas2000FUT4).

## Function
FUT9 (fucosyltransferase 9) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of the Lewis X (Le^x) antigen, a glycan structure involved in cell-cell recognition and adhesion. This enzyme is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of fucose, a hexose sugar, to glycoproteins and glycolipids (CailleauThomas2000FUT4). The Le^x antigen is synthesized on the type-2 N-acetyllactosamine precursor, and FUT9 is particularly noted for its myeloid-like α3-fucosyltransferase activity profile (CailleauThomas2000FUT4).

During human embryogenesis, FUT9 is one of the earliest expressed α3-fucosyltransferase genes, indicating its importance in early development. It is strongly expressed in the brain, moderately in the kidney, and weakly in muscle during the fetal period, suggesting a role in neural development and organogenesis (CailleauThomas2000FUT4). The presence of Le^x synthesized by FUT9 may be crucial for cell-cell interactions during embryogenesis, potentially influencing signal transduction pathways that promote cellular proliferation (CailleauThomas2000FUT4).

In adult tissues, the expression of FUT9 decreases, which implies its primary function is during early development. The enzyme's activity is entirely associated with the cell fraction, with no activity detected in the supernatant, highlighting its intracellular role (CailleauThomas2000FUT4).

## Clinical Significance
FUT9, a fucosyltransferase enzyme, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in glycan synthesis. In colon cancer, FUT9 expression is linked to cancer stemness and chemoresistance. It is associated with increased expression of stemness markers such as CD44 and Sox2, enhanced tumor-sphere formation, and resistance to 5-FU chemotherapy, suggesting its role in promoting tumor proliferation and survival (Fujita2021Fucosylation). 

In the context of neurological disorders, FUT9 is uniquely expressed in the brain and is involved in neuron-glia interactions. Alterations in FUT9 expression have been implicated in schizophrenia, where genetic variants may contribute to the condition. Knockdown studies in cellular models show impaired neurite outgrowth, and Fut9 knockout mice exhibit increased anxiety-like behaviors, indicating its importance in neural development and behavior (Schneider2017Biological; Mealer2020Glycobiology).

In colon adenocarcinoma, high FUT9 expression correlates with a higher TNM stage, suggesting a role in cancer progression. However, its expression is generally decreased in tumor tissues, indicating a complex role in cancer biology (Wang2022Fucosyltransferases).

## Interactions
Fucosyltransferase 9 (FUT9) is involved in the Lewis X modification of glycoproteins, specifically interacting with lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1). This interaction is facilitated by a 29-amino acid segment in the N-domain of LAMP-1, which is critical for FUT9-dependent modification. This segment, termed the 'Lewis X code', can be attached to other glycoproteins to induce Lewis X modifications, indicating a specific interaction mechanism (Saito2022An).

Proximity-dependent biotinylation experiments have shown that FUT9 interacts with erythropoietin (EPO) when the L29 sequence is attached, confirming the interaction in CHO-K1 cells. In vitro experiments further demonstrate that FUT9 preferentially catalyzes Lewis X modification on L29-tagged EPO, suggesting that the interaction does not require other cellular components (Saito2022An).

The study of FUT9's role in colorectal cancer cells using CRISPR-dCas9-VPR technology has shown that FUT9 can alter the N-glycome composition, leading to the neo-expression of the Lewis X antigen. This suggests that FUT9 may influence interactions with immune receptors, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Blanas2018Transcriptional).
