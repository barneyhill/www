# CHP1

## Overview
CHP1, or calcineurin B homologous protein 1, is a gene that encodes the protein calcineurin-like EF-hand protein 1, a multifunctional calcium-binding protein. This protein is characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures that facilitate calcium ion binding, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. As a regulatory protein, CHP1 is involved in the modulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1), impacting its stability, activity, and pH sensitivity. Beyond ion transport, CHP1 influences intracellular transport, gene regulation, and immune response by interacting with microtubules and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase activity. It also plays a role in ribosomal RNA synthesis regulation through its interaction with the upstream binding factor (UBF) in the nucleus. Mutations in the CHP1 gene have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, such as autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia, and its dysregulation is implicated in conditions like spinal muscular atrophy and cancer (Di2012Calcineurin; JiménezVidal2010Nuclearlocalized; Dong2021Structure; MendozaFerreira2018Biallelic).

## Structure
CHP1, also known as calcineurin B homologous protein 1, is a calcium-binding protein characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures capable of binding calcium ions. Structurally, CHP1 consists of two globular domains, the N-lobe and C-lobe, each containing two EF-hand motifs. Of these, only EF3 and EF4 can bind calcium, while EF1 and EF2 cannot (Di2012Calcineurin). The protein also features a myristoylation signal, suggesting a Ca2+-myristoyl switch mechanism, and two nuclear export signals (NES-1 and NES-2), which are crucial for its transport from the nucleus to the cytosol (Di2012Calcineurin).

CHP1 is involved in the regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1), where it plays a critical role in the biosynthetic maturation, cell surface expression, and pH sensitivity of NHE1. The NHE1-CHP1 complex has been studied using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing that CHP1 differentially associates with the inward-facing and outward-facing conformations of NHE1, which is important for regulating NHE1 activity (Dong2021Structure). CHP1's interaction with NHE1 involves specific structural elements, such as the sidechains of Q151 and I155, which stabilize CHP1 in the inhibitor-bound structure (Dong2021Structure). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its function in various cellular processes, including ion transport and signal transduction.

## Function
Calcineurin homologous protein 1 (CHP1) is a multifunctional Ca2+-binding protein involved in various cellular processes. It plays a critical role in the regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1), a key protein in maintaining intracellular pH and cell volume. CHP1 binds to the C-terminal domain of NHE1, enhancing its stability and activity by masking a degradation signal, which prevents its recognition by ubiquitin-dependent disposal systems (Matsushita2007Loss; Matsushita2011Dual). This interaction is essential for the proper localization and function of NHE1 in the plasma membrane (Matsushita2011Dual).

CHP1 contains EF-hand Ca2+ binding motifs, specifically EF3 and EF4, which are crucial for its interaction with NHE1 and maintaining the physiological pH sensitivity of the exchanger (Pang2004Role). The binding of Ca2+ ions to these motifs is important for the structural integrity of CHP1, which is necessary for its function in pH regulation (Pang2004Role).

In addition to its role in ion transport, CHP1 is involved in intracellular transport and gene regulation. It interacts with microtubules to facilitate microtubule-membrane interactions and inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity, affecting T cell proliferation and immune response (Di2012Calcineurin; JiménezVidal2010Nuclearlocalized). CHP1 also interacts with the upstream binding factor (UBF) in the nucleus, inhibiting ribosomal RNA synthesis, which suggests a regulatory role in ribosomal biogenesis (JiménezVidal2010Nuclearlocalized).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHP1 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders. A biallelic 3-bp deletion mutation (p.K19del) in CHP1 has been linked to autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA) in humans. This mutation impairs the function of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1), leading to symptoms such as motor neuropathy, cerebellar atrophy, spastic paraparesis, intellectual disability, and slow ocular saccades (MendozaFerreira2018Biallelic). The mutation results in protein aggregation and misfolding, which disrupts the targeting of NHE1 to the membrane, contributing to the disease phenotype (MendozaFerreira2018Biallelic).

CHP1 is also implicated in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), where its elevated levels contribute to the disease pathology. Reducing CHP1 levels has been shown to restore neurite outgrowth and ameliorate motor axon outgrowth defects, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for SMA (Janzen2018CHP1).

In cancer, the gene morgana/chp-1, a homolog of CHP1, is involved in centrosome duplication and tumorigenesis. Its downregulation leads to centrosome amplification and increased susceptibility to neoplastic transformation, indicating its role in preventing tumorigenesis (Ferretti2010Morganachp1).

## Interactions
CHP1 (calcineurin like EF-hand protein 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1), where it binds to the C-terminal domain, affecting the exchanger's activation and pH sensitivity. This interaction is crucial for maintaining NHE1's structural integrity and function, with CHP1 binding increasing the Ca2+ binding affinity of the complex (Di2012Calcineurin; Pang2004Role).

CHP1 also interacts with the calcineurin catalytic A subunit, inhibiting its phosphatase activity by preventing calmodulin binding, which affects the assembly of the calcineurin holoenzyme and impairs NFAT's nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity (Di2012Calcineurin; JiménezVidal2010Nuclearlocalized).

In the nucleus, CHP1 interacts with the upstream binding factor (UBF), a component of the RNA polymerase I complex, inhibiting ribosomal RNA synthesis. This interaction is calcium-sensitive and occurs in the nucleoplasm, potentially sequestering UBF and limiting its translocation to the nucleolus (JiménezVidal2010Nuclearlocalized).

CHP1 also binds to DRAK2, a kinase involved in apoptosis, inhibiting its activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and interacts with kinesin family member 1B (KIF1Bβ2), facilitating vesicle transport along microtubules (Di2012Calcineurin).
