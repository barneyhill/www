# NEK11

## Overview
NEK11 is a gene that encodes the protein NIMA related kinase 11, a serine/threonine kinase that is part of the NIMA-related kinase family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage response, particularly at the G2/M checkpoint, where it helps maintain genomic stability by preventing cells with damaged DNA from entering mitosis. NEK11 is activated in response to genotoxic stress and is involved in the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of CDC25A, a process crucial for cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. The kinase is expressed in a cell-cycle-dependent manner and localizes to the nucleus and polar microtubules, indicating its involvement in cell cycle regulation. NEK11's interactions with other proteins, such as NEK2A, are essential for its activation and function, highlighting its significance in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Noguchi2002Nek11; Sabir2015Loss; Fry2012Cell).

## Structure
NEK11 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is part of the NIMA-related kinase family. The primary structure of NEK11 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein chain, with two identified isoforms, Nek11L and Nek11S, generated by alternative splicing (Noguchi2002Nek11). The catalytic domain of NEK11 shows significant similarity to other kinases in the family, such as Nek3 and Nek4/STK2, with 43% identity, and 33% identity with A. nidulans NIMA (Noguchi2002Nek11).

The secondary structure of NEK11 includes predicted coiled-coil and PEST-like motifs in its C-terminal non-catalytic region, which are common in other NIMA family kinases and are involved in protein-protein interactions (Noguchi2002Nek11). The tertiary structure of NEK11 is crucial for its function, as it undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which modulates its activity. NEK11 is phosphorylated by Nek2, particularly in its non-catalytic regions, which disrupts its autoinhibitory interaction and activates the kinase (Noguchi2004Nucleolar).

NEK11's quaternary structure involves interactions with other proteins, such as Nek2A, which phosphorylates NEK11 and enhances its kinase activity (Noguchi2004Nucleolar). These interactions are essential for NEK11's role in cell cycle regulation and response to genotoxic stress.

## Function
NEK11 (NIMA related kinase 11) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in the DNA damage response, particularly at the G2/M checkpoint. It is involved in maintaining genomic stability by ensuring that cells do not enter mitosis with damaged DNA. NEK11 is activated in response to DNA replication inhibitors and genotoxic stresses, and its activity is dependent on ATM and ATR kinases. These kinases phosphorylate CHK1, which subsequently activates NEK11 by phosphorylating it on Ser273. This activation leads to the phosphorylation of CDC25A, targeting it for degradation and causing G2-M arrest, thereby preventing the propagation of damaged DNA (Fry2012Cell).

NEK11 is expressed in a cell-cycle-dependent manner, with its levels peaking from the S phase to the G2/M transition. It localizes to the nucleus during interphase and to polar microtubules during prometaphase and metaphase, indicating its involvement in cell cycle regulation and genomic stability (Noguchi2002Nek11). NEK11's function is crucial for the proper response to DNA damage, acting downstream of ATM/ATR and Chk1 to promote Cdc25A degradation and prevent mitotic progression (Sabir2015Loss). This kinase is essential for maintaining cell cycle integrity and promoting cell survival under stress conditions (Sabir2015Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NEK11 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In ovarian cancer, NEK11 mRNA is significantly downregulated, particularly in cisplatin-resistant cells, suggesting its role in drug resistance. This downregulation is associated with interactions involving proteins, small molecules, and microRNAs that contribute to drug resistance, highlighting NEK11's potential as a therapeutic target in overcoming chemotherapy resistance (LIU2014Downregulation).

In melanoma, the NEK11 p.Arg374Ter mutation has been identified as a potential high-penetrance susceptibility gene. This mutation leads to a loss of function due to protein instability and degradation, and is associated with somatic loss of the wildtype allele in melanoma tumors, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. However, the mutation's presence in family members without cancer indicates possible nonpenetrance (Christodoulou2019NEK11).

NEK11 is also involved in the DNA damage response, particularly in the regulation of CDC25A proteolysis, which is crucial for maintaining the G2/M checkpoint. Alterations in NEK11 expression or function can lead to increased CDC25A levels, contributing to genomic instability and cancer progression (Sørensen2010NEK11−Linking). These findings underscore NEK11's clinical significance in cancer susceptibility and treatment.

## Interactions
NEK11, a member of the NIMA-related kinase family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response. NEK11 interacts with NEK2A, forming complexes that are essential for its activation. This interaction is mediated by specific domains within the proteins, particularly the C-terminal region of NEK11, which contains PEST-like elements crucial for binding with NEK2A. NEK2A phosphorylates NEK11, particularly in its non-catalytic regions, which disrupts autoinhibitory interactions within NEK11, thereby activating it (Noguchi2004Nucleolar).

NEK11 also interacts with nucleophosmin (NPM) in the nucleolus, where it colocalizes with NEK2A during various cell cycle phases. This colocalization is facilitated by the coiled-coil domain of NEK2A, which is absent in NEK2B, indicating a specific interaction between NEK11 and NEK2A (Noguchi2004Nucleolar).

In the context of drug resistance, NEK11 interacts with several proteins and small molecules. It has direct interactions with proteins such as NEK2, MET, JUN, and CHEK2, many of which are linked to drug resistance in ovarian cancer (LIU2014Downregulation). These interactions highlight NEK11's role in complex cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
