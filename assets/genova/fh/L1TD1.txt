# L1TD1

## Overview
L1TD1, or LINE1 type transposase domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes an RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The L1TD1 protein is characterized by several structural domains, including a coiled-coil domain, an RNA recognition motif, and a C-terminal domain, which facilitate its interactions with RNA and other proteins. Functionally, L1TD1 is integral to maintaining the undifferentiated state of hESCs by interacting with core pluripotency factors such as OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2, and by participating in RNA processing and translation (Närvä2012RNA‐Binding; Emani2015The). Additionally, L1TD1 is implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor behavior and patient prognosis, acting as either a positive or negative prognostic marker depending on the cancer type (Santos2015Embryonic; Chakroborty2019L1TD1).

## Structure
The L1TD1 protein in humans is composed of 865 amino acids and is encoded by two protein-coding exons. The second exon shows higher conservation with the L1 element's ORF1p, maintaining 43% amino acid identity and preserving key motifs such as the coiled-coil, RNA-recognition, and C-terminal motifs (McLaughlin2014Positive). The protein includes several structural domains: a C-terminal coiled coil (CC) domain, an RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain, a C-terminal carboxyl tail domain (CTD), and an N-terminal CTD domain (Emani2015The). The N-terminal RRM domain is unique, with only 30 of its C-terminal amino acids being typical of RRM domains, and it may contain the CC domain (Emani2015The). The middle region of L1TD1 has an unusual poly-E repeat region (Emani2015The).

L1TD1 is an RNA-binding protein, and its interaction with RNA has been demonstrated through UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation experiments (Närvä2012RNA‐Binding). The protein is involved in maintaining pluripotency and interacts with other proteins to form complexes important for this function (Emani2015The). The coiled-coil domain in exon 2 may be crucial for its interaction with L1-ORF1p, potentially acting as a dominant negative version of ORF1p (McLaughlin2014Positive).

## Function
The L1TD1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). It is part of a regulatory network involving core pluripotency factors such as OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2, which bind to its promoter and regulate its expression. L1TD1 is essential for the self-renewal and undifferentiated state of hESCs, as its depletion leads to the downregulation of these key pluripotency markers and induces differentiation (Närvä2012RNA‐Binding; McLaughlin2014Positive).

L1TD1 is an RNA-binding protein that interacts with multiple proteins involved in RNA processing, translation, and post-transcriptional regulation. It is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting it traffics between these compartments to perform its functions. The protein is involved in RNA splicing, translation, and protein trafficking, contributing to the maintenance of pluripotency by ensuring proper RNA and protein synthesis (Emani2015The).

The L1TD1 protein also interacts with the proteasome complex, maintaining high proteasome activity in hESCs, which is crucial for pluripotency. Its expression is linked to proteasome activity, and silencing L1TD1 reduces the expression of many interacting partners, highlighting its role in maintaining the pluripotent state (Emani2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the L1TD1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, with its role differing depending on the cancer type. In colon cancer, high L1TD1 expression is associated with longer disease-free survival, suggesting it as a positive prognostic marker. This contrasts with its role in medulloblastoma, where high expression correlates with poor prognosis, reduced overall survival, and increased metastasis (Santos2015Embryonic; Chakroborty2019L1TD1).

In medulloblastoma, L1TD1 is highly expressed and linked to poor clinical outcomes. Its expression is associated with stem-like properties, chemoresistance, and aggressive tumor behavior. Silencing L1TD1 in medulloblastoma cells leads to decreased viability, increased apoptosis, and reduced neurosphere formation, indicating its role in maintaining cancer cell stemness (Santos2015Embryonic).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), L1TD1 expression is downregulated due to promoter methylation. Despite this downregulation, low L1TD1 expression is associated with shorter overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients. L1TD1 may act as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC, as its overexpression reduces tumor growth and proliferation in vitro and in xenograft models (Altenberger2017SPAG6).

## Interactions
L1TD1 is an RNA-binding protein that plays a significant role in maintaining pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) through its interactions with various proteins and RNA elements. It is known to interact with core pluripotency transcription factors such as OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2, which are crucial for maintaining the undifferentiated state of hESCs (Närvä2012RNA‐Binding; Emani2015The). L1TD1 also interacts with LIN28, another RNA-binding protein, in cytoplasmic structures known as P-bodies, which are involved in mRNA and miRNA processing. This interaction is RNA-dependent, as it is disrupted by RNase treatment (Närvä2012RNA‐Binding).

L1TD1 is part of a complex network of protein interactions, including those involved in RNA splicing, translation, and degradation. It interacts with multiple stem-cell-specific proteins, many of which are involved in RNA-processing biology, particularly RNA translation and splicing (Emani2015The). L1TD1 also associates with its ancestral protein L1 ORF1p to promote LINE-1 retrotransposition, forming heteromultimers that bind to L1 RNA in an RNA-independent manner (Kavaklıoğlu2024The). These interactions highlight L1TD1's role in both pluripotency and retrotransposition processes.
