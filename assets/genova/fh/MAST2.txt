# MAST2

## Overview
The MAST2 gene encodes the microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase 2, a member of the AGC kinase family, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its modular structure, including a serine/threonine kinase domain, a PDZ domain, and a DUF1908 domain, which facilitate its involvement in protein-protein interactions and regulatory functions (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated; Garland2008Expression). MAST2 is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it influences cell signaling, cytoskeletal organization, and intracellular transport (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). It is involved in the regulation of critical pathways, such as mTOR, and interacts with proteins like PTEN and NHE3, impacting processes like tumor suppression, ion transport, and immune response (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). Alterations in the MAST2 gene have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and venous thromboembolism, underscoring its clinical significance (Morange2020A; Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

## Structure
The MAST2 protein is part of the AGC kinase family and is characterized by a modular structure comprising several conserved domains. It includes a central serine/threonine kinase domain, a PDZ domain towards the C-terminal end, and a DUF1908 domain towards the N-terminus (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated; Garland2008Expression). The DUF1908 domain is approximately 275 amino acids long and is divided into an unstructured N-terminal half and a structured C-terminal half containing eight alpha-helices (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). The PDZ domain, consisting of 80-100 amino acids, is involved in protein-protein interactions and is classified as a Class 1 PDZ domain, recognizing specific motifs in ligands such as PTEN (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

MAST2's kinase domain shares conserved motifs with other AGC kinases, essential for ATP binding and kinase activity, but features a unique serine in the glycine-rich loop, suggesting potential regulatory phosphorylation (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). The protein is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). MAST2 can exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may differ in their functional properties and tissue distribution (Garland2008Expression).

## Function
MAST2, a microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase, plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of PTEN, a critical tumor suppressor, by facilitating its phosphorylation, which reduces PTEN activity and prevents degradation. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways, such as mTOR, which are important for cell growth and survival (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). In neuronal cells, MAST2 interacts with PTEN to suppress neurite outgrowth, highlighting its role in neuronal homeostasis and function (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

MAST2 also interacts with the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3, inhibiting its ion transport function, which is vital for maintaining ion and pH homeostasis in epithelial tissues like the lung and intestine (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). Additionally, MAST2 is involved in immune response regulation by interacting with TRAF6, a component of the NF-κB pathway, potentially inhibiting NF-κB activation and modulating inflammatory responses (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

MAST2's activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it influences cell signaling and cytoskeletal organization, contributing to the maintenance of cell structure and intracellular transport (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAST2 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In breast cancer, MAST2 gene fusions, such as those with ARID1A, have been identified and are associated with increased proliferation in benign breast cell lines. Knockdown of MAST2 in cancer cell lines reduces growth and tumor formation, suggesting its role in invasive breast carcinomas (Veeraraghavan2016Recurrent; Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). In inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), high-functional impact mutations in the non-coding regions of MAST2 are more frequent compared to non-IBC cases, indicating a potential role in this aggressive cancer subtype (Li2021Whole-genome).

MAST2 is also linked to glioblastoma, where its overexpression promotes cell survival and growth, and knockdown reduces tumor growth, suggesting its role as an oncogene (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). In liver cancer, MAST2 mRNA is upregulated, expanding its diagnostic potential (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

A rare coding mutation, the Arg89Gln (R89Q) variant, in the MAST2 gene has been associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) in a French family, affecting the hemostatic balance of endothelial cells (Morange2020A). MAST2 is also involved in cystic fibrosis, male infertility, and immune response regulation, highlighting its diverse clinical significance (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

## Interactions
MAST2, a microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase, engages in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with PTEN, a tumor suppressor, facilitating its phosphorylation and stabilizing its activity, which is significant in multiple myeloma cell lines and neuronal homeostasis (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). MAST2 also binds to the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3, inhibiting its ion transport function, potentially through phosphorylation (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated; Garland2008Expression).

MAST2 forms part of large multiprotein complexes, interacting with β2-syntrophin to link the dystrophin complex with the microtubule network (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated; Garland2008Expression). It also binds to protocadherin LKC (PCLKC), a tumor suppressor, through its PDZ domain (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). The interaction with TRAF6, a component of the NF-κB pathway, suggests a role in immune response regulation (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

MAST2's PDZ domain interacts with peptides from PTEN and rabies virus glycoproteins, affecting neuronal survival during rabies virus infection by competing with PTEN for binding (Delhommel2015Deciphering). These interactions highlight MAST2's involvement in diverse biological processes, including immune responses, neuronal function, and cancer biology.
