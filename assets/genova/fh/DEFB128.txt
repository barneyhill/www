# DEFB128

## Overview
DEFB128 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 128, a member of the beta-defensin family, which is integral to the innate immune system. Defensin beta 128 is categorized as an antimicrobial peptide, known for its ability to disrupt microbial membranes and provide defense against a wide range of pathogens. The gene is expressed in various tissues, contributing to mucosal immunity and modulating inflammatory responses. In particular, DEFB128 has been studied for its role in the oral microbiome, where it interacts with antimicrobial factors and influences the microbial balance in gingival tissues. Alterations in the expression of DEFB128 have been linked to increased susceptibility to infections and have implications in cancer research, highlighting its clinical significance in both infectious and non-infectious diseases (Castiglione2013Karyotype-Phenotype; Ebersole2022Gingival; Ma2020Enhanced).

## Function
DEFB128, or defensin beta 128, is a member of the beta-defensin family, which plays a significant role in the innate immune system by providing antimicrobial defense. These proteins are known for their ability to disrupt microbial membranes, thereby protecting against a variety of pathogens. DEFB128 is expressed in multiple tissues, contributing to mucosal immunity and modulating inflammatory responses. In the human epididymis, DEFB128 is one of the differentially expressed genes validated for its expression patterns, although specific functions in healthy human cells are not detailed in the available studies (Légaré2020Differential).

In the context of the oral microbiome, DEFB128 is involved in the interaction with antimicrobial factors (AMFs) and is affected by the relative abundance of bacterial families. In healthy gingival tissues, particularly in younger individuals, DEFB128 shows elevated frequencies of significant correlations with the microbiome, suggesting its role in maintaining oral health (Ebersole2022Gingival). The expression of DEFB128, along with other AMFs, is influenced by age and disease states, with decreased expression observed in older age groups during periodontitis (Ebersole2022Gingival). This indicates that DEFB128 may play a role in the transition from health to disease in the oral cavity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DEFB128 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in immune defense. The deletion of DEFB128, along with other β-defensin family members, has been associated with increased susceptibility to infections, as these genes are crucial for microbial defense (Castiglione2013Karyotype-Phenotype). In the context of bacterial infections, DEFB128 expression is upregulated in response to immune signaling pathways, such as those activated by the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1), which enhances the production of defensins and proinflammatory cytokines, thereby contributing to antimicrobial activity (Guo2017Characterization).

Additionally, alterations in DEFB128 expression have been noted in cancer research. For instance, in lung adenocarcinoma, DEFB128 was identified as a down-regulated gene in a protein-protein interaction network, suggesting its potential involvement in cancer progression (Ma2020Enhanced). Furthermore, a loss of DEFB128 at chromosomal region 20p13 has been associated with inferior overall survival in patients treated with dacarbazine for leiomyosarcoma, indicating its possible role in cancer prognosis (Wozniak2021Molecular). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DEFB128 in both infectious and non-infectious diseases.
