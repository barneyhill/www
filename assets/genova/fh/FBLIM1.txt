# FBLIM1

## Overview
FBLIM1 is a gene that encodes the filamin-binding LIM protein 1 (FBLP1), also known as migfilin, which is a crucial component in cytoskeletal organization and cellular adhesion processes. The protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal filamin-binding domain, a central proline-rich region, and a C-terminal LIM domain, which facilitate its interactions with various proteins and transcription factors. FBLP1 plays a significant role in bone remodeling and maintaining bone homeostasis by regulating the balance between osteoclast and osteoblast activity. It is also involved in anti-inflammatory responses and integrin activation, which are essential for cellular adhesion and movement. Mutations in the FBLIM1 gene have been linked to diseases such as chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and glioma, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Cox2017Recessive; Deng2023FBLIM1).

## Structure
The FBLIM1 gene encodes the filamin-binding LIM protein 1 (FBLP1), also known as migfilin, which plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal organization and bone remodeling. The protein structure includes an N-terminal filamin-binding domain, a central proline-rich region, and a C-terminal LIM domain. The N-terminal domain interacts with Filamin A/B/C, while the central domain binds to vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). The C-terminal LIM domain interacts with transcription factors such as CSX/NKX2-5 or mitogen-inducible gene 2 (MIG2), depending on the splice variant (Cox2017Recessive).

The LIM domains in FBLIM1 are characterized by a conserved sequence of cysteine/histidine residues that coordinate Zn2+ ions, forming a zinc finger topology. These domains are about 55-65 amino acids long, with each zinc finger consisting of approximately 30 amino acids. FBLIM1's LIM2 domain is noted for being more hydrophobic than its LIM1 and LIM3 domains (Siddiqui2021Bioinformatic).

FBLIM1 is involved in protein interactions and is a key regulator of the cytoskeleton, anchoring cell-extracellular matrix adhesion proteins and filamin-containing actin filaments. It competes with integrin β for filamin binding to promote integrin activation (Cox2017Recessive). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its cellular localization and function (Siddiqui2021Bioinformatic).

## Function
FBLIM1, also known as filamin-binding LIM protein 1, plays a crucial role in bone remodeling and maintaining bone homeostasis. It is involved in balancing osteoclast and osteoblast activity, which is essential for proper bone formation and density maintenance. In healthy cells, FBLIM1 acts as an anti-inflammatory molecule, regulated by STAT3 upon macrophage stimulation by IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. This regulation suggests that FBLIM1 is involved in the anti-inflammatory response, preventing excessive bone resorption and inflammation (Cox2017Recessive).

FBLIM1 encodes for a protein that is a key regulator of the cytoskeleton, anchoring cell-extracellular matrix adhesion proteins and filamin-containing actin filaments. It competes with integrin β for filamin binding to promote integrin activation, which is significant in neutrophils and vascular and endothelial cells during sterile inflammation (Cox2017Recessive). The protein has an N-terminal filamin-binding domain, a central proline-rich domain, and a C-terminal LIM domain, which interact with various proteins and transcription factors, contributing to its role in cell adhesion, signaling, and movement (Cox2017Recessive). FBLIM1's function in healthy human cells involves maintaining proper cytoskeletal structure and function, essential for cell adhesion and movement.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FBLIM1 gene are implicated in several diseases, particularly chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) and glioma. In CRMO, a rare pediatric autoinflammatory bone disease, both coding and regulatory mutations in FBLIM1 contribute to its pathogenesis. These mutations can disrupt the balance between osteoclast and osteoblast activity, leading to excessive bone resorption and sterile inflammation (Cox2017Recessive). A specific mutation, rs41310367, affects transcription factor binding, impacting bone remodeling and inflammatory responses (Cox2017Recessive). 

In glioma, a type of brain tumor, FBLIM1 mRNA is significantly elevated, serving as a potential prognostic biomarker. High expression levels are associated with poor prognosis and advanced clinical stages, and its knockdown suppresses glioma cell proliferation (Deng2023FBLIM1). FBLIM1 is also linked to immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting a role in tumor growth and immune interactions (Deng2023FBLIM1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FBLIM1 is upregulated and interacts with circFBLIM1 and miR-346, promoting cancer progression. This interaction highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in HCC (Bai2018circFBLIM1).

## Interactions
FBLIM1, also known as filamin-binding LIM protein 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It contains several domains that facilitate these interactions, including an N-terminal filamin-binding domain, a central proline-rich domain, and a C-terminal LIM domain. The N-terminal domain binds to Filamin A/B/C, which is essential for cytoskeletal organization and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion (Cox2017Recessive). FBLIM1 competes with integrin β for filamin binding, promoting integrin activation, a mechanism observed in neutrophils and vascular endothelial cells (Cox2017Recessive).

The central proline-rich domain of FBLIM1 interacts with the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), which is involved in actin filament dynamics (Cox2017Recessive). The C-terminal LIM domain interacts with transcription factors such as CSX/NKX2-5 or mitogen-inducible gene 2 (MIG2), depending on the splice variant (Cox2017Recessive). FBLIM1 is also implicated in interactions with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), playing a role in cross-linking actin filaments and cell-extracellular matrix adhesions (Deng2023FBLIM1). These interactions highlight FBLIM1's involvement in cytoskeletal maintenance and signal transduction pathways.
