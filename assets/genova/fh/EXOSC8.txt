# EXOSC8

## Overview
EXOSC8 is a gene that encodes the protein exosome component 8, a crucial part of the RNA exosome complex, which is involved in RNA processing and degradation. The protein, also known as hRRP43, is a structural component of the exosome's hexameric ring, contributing to its quaternary assembly and function. It contains an S1 RNA-binding domain and a KH domain, which are essential for RNA binding and processing, facilitating the passage of RNA through the exosome complex (Gerlach2018Distinct; RodríguezGarcía2021New). EXOSC8 is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans, underscoring its fundamental role in RNA metabolism. The protein's interactions with other exosome subunits, such as EXOSC9, are vital for maintaining the integrity and function of the exosome complex. Variants in the EXOSC8 gene can lead to significant alterations in protein levels and are associated with clinical conditions such as pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1C, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and development (Slavotinek2020Biallelic; RodríguezGarcía2021New).

## Structure
The EXOSC8 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the RNA exosome complex, which is involved in RNA processing and degradation. The protein is part of the hexameric ring structure of the exosome, contributing to its quaternary assembly (RodríguezGarcía2021New). EXOSC8, also known as hRRP43, is conserved from yeast to humans, indicating its essential role in the exosome complex (Gerlach2018Distinct).

Structurally, EXOSC8 contains domains typical of exosome components, including an S1 RNA-binding domain and a KH domain, which are crucial for its function in RNA binding and processing (Gerlach2018Distinct). These domains help form the barrel-like structure of the exosome, facilitating the passage of RNA through the complex (RodríguezGarcía2021New).

The protein's interaction with other exosome subunits, such as EXOSC9, is vital for maintaining the integrity and function of the exosome complex. Variants in EXOSC8 can impact these interactions, potentially altering the structure and function of the exosome (RodríguezGarcía2021New). The protein's expression levels and stability are also influenced by genetic variants, which can lead to significant reductions in protein levels and affect the entire exosome complex (RodríguezGarcía2021New).

## Function
The EXOSC8 gene encodes a component of the RNA exosome complex, a crucial multi-subunit ribonuclease involved in RNA processing and degradation. In healthy human cells, EXOSC8 is part of the core structure of the exosome, which is composed of nine subunits forming a two-layered ring-like structure. This complex is evolutionarily conserved and functions in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Zaki2023A; RodríguezGarcía2021New).

In the nucleus, the RNA exosome processes and degrades various RNA precursors, including un-spliced pre-messenger RNAs and cryptic transcripts. In the cytoplasm, it targets mRNAs with AU-rich elements and RNAs that have escaped nuclear degradation (Zaki2023A; RodríguezGarcía2021New). EXOSC8 plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity and function of the RNA exosome, which is essential for RNA quality control and regulation of RNA levels (RodríguezGarcía2021New).

The RNA exosome, including EXOSC8, is also involved in ribosome biogenesis, a critical process for protein synthesis. It ensures proper RNA maturation and turnover, which are vital for cellular homeostasis and normal cell cycle progression (Müller2020RNA). Disruption of EXOSC8 can lead to increased p53 levels, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Müller2020RNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EXOSC8 gene are associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1C (PCH1C), a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by developmental delay, cerebellar and corpus callosum hypoplasia, hypomyelination, and spinal muscular atrophy (Slavotinek2020Biallelic; RodríguezGarcía2021New). Patients with PCH1C often exhibit psychomotor deficits, respiratory failure, and hearing impairment (Cavusoglu2024Evaluation). The condition is linked to defects in oligodendroglia, leading to hypomyelination (RodríguezGarcía2021New).

EXOSC8 mutations can lead to alterations in ribosome biogenesis and increased p53 levels, which are associated with increased apoptosis in brain cells, suggesting that these mutations may contribute to ribosomopathies (Müller2020RNA). In zebrafish models, EXOSC8 mutations result in underdevelopment of the cerebellum and neuromuscular defects (Müller2020RNA).

Clinical presentations of EXOSC8-related disorders can vary, with some patients experiencing additional symptoms such as microcephaly, seizures, autistic features, and gait disorders (Cavusoglu2024Evaluation). The phenotypic spectrum of PCH1C is expanded by novel variants, which can lead to exon skipping and early protein truncation, as seen in some patients (Zaki2023A).

## Interactions
EXOSC8 is a component of the RNA exosome complex, which is involved in RNA processing and degradation. It forms part of the core structure of the exosome, interacting with other subunits such as EXOSC3 and EXOSC9. These interactions are crucial for the stability and function of the exosome complex (Slavotinek2020Biallelic). EXOSC8 is also known to bind adenylate-uridylate-rich element-containing RNAs, which suggests its role in RNA substrate processing (Zhang2019Exosome).

In the context of disease, EXOSC8 variants have been associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1C, a condition characterized by severe neurological symptoms. This association highlights the importance of EXOSC8 interactions within the exosome complex for normal cellular function and development (Slavotinek2020Biallelic).

The interactions of EXOSC8 within the exosome complex are not only structural but also functional, as they facilitate the degradation of RNA substrates, which is essential for maintaining cellular RNA homeostasis. These interactions are conserved across species, underscoring their fundamental role in RNA metabolism (Zhang2019Exosome).
