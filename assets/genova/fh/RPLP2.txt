# RPLP2

## Overview
RPLP2 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit P2, a critical component of the ribosomal 60S subunit involved in protein synthesis. The protein encoded by RPLP2 is categorized as a ribosomal protein and plays a pivotal role in the elongation phase of translation by facilitating interactions between the ribosome and elongation factors, thereby ensuring the proper elongation of nascent polypeptide chains (Uchiumi1990Monoclonal). RPLP2 forms heterodimers with RPLP1, contributing to the structural integrity of the ribosomal stalk, which is essential for ribosomal function (Ishii2006Characteristics). Beyond its fundamental role in protein synthesis, RPLP2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including metabolic reprogramming and immune response modulation, particularly in the context of cancer (Yang2023RPLP2). Its expression levels have been associated with clinical outcomes in several cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Xu2024Exploring; Cai2020A).

## Function
RPLP2 encodes the ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit P2, which is a component of the ribosomal 60S subunit. In healthy human cells, RPLP2 plays a critical role in the elongation phase of protein synthesis by facilitating interactions between the ribosome and elongation factors such as EF-1a and EF-2. These interactions are essential for the proper elongation of nascent polypeptide chains during translation (Uchiumi1990Monoclonal). RPLP2, along with RPLP1, forms heterodimers that contribute to the structure of the ribosomal stalk, which is crucial for the ribosome's function in protein synthesis (Ishii2006Characteristics).

RPLP2 is active in the cytoplasm, where it enhances ribosome elongation efficiency, particularly on mRNAs encoding proteins with multiple transmembrane domains. This function is vital for the biogenesis of complex membrane proteins, ensuring their proper folding and stability (Campos2019Ribosomal). The protein is also involved in maintaining the stability and function of ribosomes by interacting with elongation factors, which are crucial for translational fidelity (Yang2018Senescent). The phosphorylation of RPLP2 by kinases such as CK2α and GRK2 is important for its function, contributing to ribosome heterogeneity and the translation of specific mRNAs (Yang2018Senescent).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RPLP2 gene have been implicated in several cancers. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), RPLP2 is overexpressed, which is associated with poor clinical outcomes such as reduced overall survival and increased disease progression. This overexpression is linked to genetic factors like increased copy number variations and epigenetic factors such as reduced promoter methylation levels, suggesting a role for RPLP2 as an oncogene in LUAD (Xu2024Exploring).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RPLP2 is also overexpressed and contributes to cancer progression by activating the TLR4/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This activation promotes metabolic reprogramming towards aerobic glycolysis, a hallmark of cancer cell proliferation. Targeting the RPLP2/TLR4/PI3K/AKT axis is proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC (Yang2023RPLP2).

RPLP2 is part of a three-gene signature associated with poor prognosis in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML). High expression levels of RPLP2 correlate with central nervous system disease and chloroma, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker in pediatric AML (Cai2020A).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high RPLP2 expression is linked to poor prognosis, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker (Li2023Establishment).

## Interactions
RPLP2, a component of the ribosomal stalk, interacts with several proteins and pathways, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It forms a stable heterodimer with RPLP1, which then associates with RPLP0 to attach to the ribosome, facilitating the recruitment of elongation factors during protein synthesis (Campos2017RPLP1). This interaction is crucial for the translation of specific mRNAs, particularly those encoding proteins with multiple transmembrane domains (Campos2019Ribosomal).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RPLP2 is involved in metabolic reprogramming by interacting with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). RPLP2 binds to TLR4, activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which in turn regulates the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a key factor in glycolysis and cancer cell proliferation (Yang2023RPLP2). This interaction promotes aerobic glycolysis, a hallmark of cancer metabolism, and contributes to HCC progression (Yang2023RPLP2).

RPLP2 also plays a role in the immune response by acting as a pattern-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that binds to TLR4 on dendritic cells, potentially influencing tumor-immune interactions (Yang2023RPLP2). These interactions highlight RPLP2's multifaceted role in both protein synthesis and cellular signaling pathways.
