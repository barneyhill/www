# TOM1

## Overview
TOM1 (target of myb1 membrane trafficking protein) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in endosomal trafficking and autophagy. The TOM1 protein is characterized by its modular structure, which includes an N-terminal VHS domain, a central GAT domain, and a C-terminal region with a Myosin VI binding motif. These domains facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions, particularly in the endosomal sorting and autophagy pathways. TOM1 is integral to the ubiquitin-dependent sorting of endosomal cargo and the maturation of autophagosomes, interacting with proteins such as TOLLIP and Myosin VI. It also plays a regulatory role in inflammatory signaling by modulating receptor trafficking and degradation. Mutations in the TOM1 gene have been linked to immune dysfunction and other clinical conditions, underscoring its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease (Roach2021Protein; Lång2024TOM1).

## Structure
The TOM1 protein is a modular protein involved in endosomal trafficking, characterized by several distinct domains. It contains an N-terminal VHS domain, a central GAT domain, and a long C-terminal region. The VHS domain adopts a right-handed superhelix structure composed of eight α-helices, with α-helices α1-α5 and α7 being highly conserved. This domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly binding to ubiquitin through residues on α-helices 2 and 4 (Roach2021Protein). The GAT domain is associated with membrane trafficking and interacts with TOLLIP, a protein involved in cargo recognition and transport within the ESCRT pathway (Roach2021Protein).

The C-terminal region of TOM1 contains a Myosin VI binding motif (MBM), which forms a complex with Myosin VI, playing a role in autophagy and immune responses (Roach2021Protein). This interaction is crucial for the tethering function of Myosin VI, facilitating autophagosome maturation (Hu2019Structure).

TOM1 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its function. The protein also has splice variants, resulting in isoforms with different functional properties (Roach2021Protein).

## Function
TOM1 (target of myb1 membrane trafficking protein) is a crucial adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily in the endosomal sorting and autophagy pathways. It plays a significant role in the endosomal ubiquitin-dependent sorting pathway by interacting with ubiquitin and polyubiquitin chains through its VHS and GAT domains, with a preference for Lys63-linked chains (Roach2021Protein). TOM1 is involved in the recruitment of clathrin to endosomal membranes and facilitates the trafficking of receptors such as the interleukin 1-receptor, type 1 (IL-1R1) (Roach2021Protein).

In autophagy, TOM1 is essential for the formation of amphisomes, which are necessary for the maturation of autophagosomes. This process involves TOM1's interaction with Myosin VI, where it binds to the C-terminal CBD domain of Myosin VI, aiding in the transport and spatial organization of endosomes (Roach2021Protein). TOM1 also interacts with TOLLIP, which localizes to autophagosomes and regulates the fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes (Roach2021Protein).

TOM1 acts as a negative regulator of inflammatory signaling, particularly in pathways involving IL-1β and TNF-α, by sorting IL-1R1 for degradation, thus ensuring the resolution of inflammatory responses (Roach2021Protein). It is also involved in TLR2/4 signaling pathways, modulating receptor recycling and having an anti-inflammatory role (Roach2021Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TOM1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly those involving immune system dysfunction. A notable mutation, the p.G307D missense mutation, is associated with early-onset autoimmunity syndrome, characterized by symptoms such as arthritis, eczema, enteropathy, and interstitial lung disease, along with combined immunodeficiency. This mutation disrupts the interaction between TOM1 and TOLLIP, impairing autophagosome-lysosome fusion and leading to defective autophagy and altered immune signaling pathways (Keskitalo2019Dominant; Lång2024TOM1).

In Alzheimer's disease, TOM1 levels are decreased, which results in increased levels of IL-1R1 and IL-1β, exacerbating inflammation and cognitive decline. Restoration of TOM1 levels in animal models has shown potential therapeutic benefits (Roach2021Protein).

TOM1 is also implicated in pathogen infections, where it can be hijacked by bacteria like Shigella flexneri to impair endosomal maturation, aiding bacterial survival (Roach2021Protein). Additionally, TOM1 is identified as a risk allele for multiple myeloma and is involved in cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer cell invasion through interactions with TOLLIP (Roach2021Protein). These findings underscore TOM1's role in various diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
TOM1 (target of myb1 membrane trafficking protein) is involved in various protein interactions that facilitate its role in intracellular trafficking and signaling. TOM1 interacts with Myosin VI through its C-terminal region, forming a stable complex that is crucial for endosomal localization and the maturation of autophagosomes. This interaction involves the Myosin VI-binding motif within TOM1, which is essential for tethering endosomes and autophagosomes (Hu2019Structure).

TOM1 also participates in the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, associating with ubiquitin moieties on cargo via its VHS and GAT domains. It forms complexes with other ESCRT proteins such as TOLLIP, Endofin, and Hrs at early endosomal membrane surfaces, enhancing its role in cargo sorting (Roach2021Protein).

In the context of protein quality control, TOM1 interacts with the ribosome-bound quality control (RQC) complex, particularly after the extraction of nascent peptides from the 60S ribosomal subunit. This interaction helps prevent the accumulation of aberrant protein aggregates, a function that does not rely on TOM1's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Defenouillère2017The).

TOM1's interaction with TOLLIP is also significant in regulating immune responses and autophagy. The TOM1 G307D variant impairs this interaction, affecting autophagosome-lysosome fusion and leading to immune dysregulation (Lång2024TOM1).
