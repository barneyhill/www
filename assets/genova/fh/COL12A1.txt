# COL12A1

## Overview
The COL12A1 gene encodes the collagen type XII alpha 1 chain, a protein that belongs to the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT) family. This protein plays a crucial role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) by interacting with other collagen types, particularly collagen I, to regulate fibril spacing and assembly, thereby maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical properties of connective tissues (Delbaere2020Novel; Izu2023Collagen). Collagen type XII is predominantly expressed in connective tissues such as tendons, ligaments, and the periosteum, where it contributes to the organization and mechanical properties of these tissues (Izu2023Collagen). The protein is mechanosensitive, responding to mechanical stress, and plays a role in cell communication and tissue repair processes (Izu2021Collagen). Mutations in the COL12A1 gene are linked to various connective tissue and muscle disorders, including myopathic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and distal myopathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Mohassel2019Dominant; Delbaere2020Novel).

## Structure
The COL12A1 gene encodes collagen type XII alpha 1 chain, a protein that is part of the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT) family. Collagen XII is a homotrimer composed of three α1 chains, each featuring two short collagenous domains (COL1 and COL2) and three non-collagenous domains (NC1, NC2, and NC3) (Coppens2022Ehlers‐Danlosmyopathy; Delbaere2020Novel). The NC3 domain is particularly large, containing 18 fibronectin type III (FN3) repeats and four von Willebrand factor A (vWA) domains (Delbaere2020Novel; Izu2023Collagen).

The primary structure of collagen XII includes a sequence of Gly-X-Y repeats typical of collagenous domains, which are crucial for forming the triple helix (Mohassel2019Dominant). The secondary structure involves these triple-helical regions, while the tertiary structure is characterized by the formation of a stable triple helix (Mohassel2019Dominant). In its quaternary structure, collagen XII interacts with other collagen types, such as collagen I, to modulate the extracellular matrix (Araújo2021A).

Collagen XII exists in two major splice variant isoforms: the long variant (XIIA) and the short variant (XIIB). The long variant includes additional FN3 and vWA domains compared to the short variant, resulting in a molecular weight difference of about 100 kDa (Gerecke1997Complete; Izu2023Collagen). The long variant is a proteoglycan with glycosaminoglycan side chains, while the short variant lacks these features (Gerecke1997Complete).

## Function
Collagen type XII alpha 1 chain, encoded by the COL12A1 gene, is a member of the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT) family. It plays a significant role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) by interacting with collagen I fibrils to regulate fibril spacing and assembly, which is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical properties of tissues (Delbaere2020Novel; Izu2023Collagen). Collagen XII is primarily expressed in connective tissues such as tendons, ligaments, and the periosteum, where it is enriched in pericellular regions (Izu2023Collagen).

In tendons, collagen XII is essential for the organization and mechanical properties, influencing tenocyte structure, cell-cell communication, and interaction with collagen fibrils. Its absence leads to increased interfibrillar space and structural abnormalities (Izu2021Collagen). Collagen XII also interacts with small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) like decorin, which are important for lateral fibril growth (Izu2021Collagen).

Collagen XII is mechanosensitive, responding to mechanical stress, which may induce its production. It plays a role in forming matrix bridges that connect adjacent tenocyte processes, stabilizing cell surface molecules and facilitating communication (Izu2021Collagen). Its deficiency can lead to impaired communication and adhesion, affecting tissue repair processes (Schönborn2020Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COL12A1 gene, which encodes collagen type XII alpha 1 chain, are associated with several connective tissue and muscle disorders. Myopathic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (mEDS) is one such condition, characterized by muscle hypotonia, joint hypermobility, joint contractures, and mild skin involvement. Pathogenic variants in COL12A1, including heterozygous in-frame exon skipping defects and arginine-to-cysteine substitutions, lead to alterations in the extracellular matrix, such as intracellular accumulation of collagen XII chains and changes in the levels of decorin and tenascin-X (Delbaere2020Novel).

Distal myopathy is another condition linked to dominant mutations in COL12A1. Patients exhibit symptoms like congenital onset, mild gross motor delay, distal and proximal weakness, and joint hyperlaxity. These mutations include missense variants and large deletions, which disrupt collagen XII function and lead to increased intracellular retention and loss of extracellular collagen XII (Mohassel2019Dominant).

Recessive loss-of-function mutations in COL12A1 result in a more severe phenotype, with symptoms such as congenital hypotonia, severe dysphagia, and significant joint hyperlaxity. These mutations emphasize the clinical involvement of both connective tissue and muscle, potentially expanding the phenotype to include cardiomyopathy (Neuhaus2019P.382Recessive).

## Interactions
COL12A1, the collagen type XII alpha 1 chain, is involved in various interactions within the extracellular matrix (ECM) and plays a significant role in cancer progression. It is part of the fibril-associated collagen family and interacts with other collagen types and matrix components, contributing to tissue structure and function. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), COL12A1 is associated with immune cell infiltration, including macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and NK cells, which are linked to poor prognosis (Li2021Bioinformatics). 

In gastric cancer, COL12A1 interacts with IDO1 to activate the MAPK pathway, promoting cell migration and metastasis. This interaction involves a feedback loop where IDO1 and COL12A1 reciprocally regulate each other, enhancing the migratory capacity of cancer cells (Xiang2019A). The interaction between COL12A1 and integrin β1 is crucial in this process, as blocking integrin β1 inhibits cell migration and the expression of COL12A1 and phosphorylated ERK (Xiang2019A).

In breast cancer, COL12A1 is associated with immunomodulators such as TNFSF4, NT5E, and CD276, which play roles in immunosuppression and tumor aggressiveness (Yan2023COL12A1). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of COL12A1 in modulating the tumor microenvironment and influencing cancer progression.
