# IFI16

## Overview
IFI16 is a gene that encodes the interferon gamma inducible protein 16, a member of the PYHIN protein family, which is characterized by the presence of a pyrin domain (PYD) and two HIN (hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear) domains. The IFI16 protein functions primarily as a DNA sensor within the innate immune system, playing a pivotal role in detecting intracellular viral DNA and initiating immune signaling pathways. It is integral to the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, leading to the production of type I interferons, which are crucial for antiviral defense (Unterholzner2010IFI16; Jønsson2017IFI16). Beyond its immune functions, IFI16 is involved in regulating cell growth and inflammatory responses, and its expression and localization are implicated in various diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancers (Gugliesi2013Nuclear; Song2010InterferonInducible).

## Structure
The IFI16 protein is a member of the PYHIN family, characterized by the presence of a pyrin domain (PYD) at the N-terminus and two HIN (hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear) domains. The PYD facilitates protein-protein interactions, while the HIN domains are responsible for DNA binding (Jin2012Structures; Bawadekar2015Mislocalization). The HIN domains contain two oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) folds, which interact with the sugar-phosphate backbone of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) through electrostatic interactions (Jin2012Structures). 

IFI16 exists in three isoforms (A, B, and C) due to alternative mRNA splicing, with the B isoform being the most abundant (Veeranki2012Interferoninducible; Bawadekar2015Mislocalization). The protein is predicted to be hydrophilic and lacks a leader peptide and transmembrane region, suggesting it is non-secreted and located in the cytosol and/or nucleus (Trapani1992A). 

Post-translational modifications of IFI16 include phosphorylation and acetylation, which may influence its function and localization. The protein can form oligomers, contributing to its quaternary structure. The HIN domains of IFI16 are crucial for its role as an innate immune sensor, recognizing cytosolic and nuclear dsDNA and participating in inflammasome assembly (Jin2012Structures; Veeranki2012Interferoninducible).

## Function
IFI16 (interferon gamma inducible protein 16) is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily acting as a DNA sensor in the innate immune response. It plays a crucial role in detecting intracellular viral DNA and initiating immune signaling pathways. IFI16 is essential for the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, which leads to the production of type I interferons, critical for antiviral defense (Unterholzner2010IFI16; Jønsson2017IFI16). In human macrophages, IFI16 promotes the production and function of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), a secondary messenger that activates STING, leading to the phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3, and subsequent interferon production (Jønsson2017IFI16).

IFI16 also acts as a negative regulator of cell growth by down-regulating the expression of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene. It inhibits the transcription of the hTERT gene by interfering with the activity of c-Myc, a transcription factor known to activate hTERT expression, thereby playing a role in cellular aging and tumor suppression (Song2010InterferonInducible). Additionally, IFI16 is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses by activating NF-κB transcriptional activity, which leads to the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines (Duan2011Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the IFI16 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly autoimmune disorders and certain cancers. In systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and Sjögren's syndrome (SjS), IFI16 is often overexpressed and mislocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and extracellular space. This mislocalization can lead to the presence of circulating IFI16 in the sera of patients, where it acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), impairing endothelial cell functions and contributing to disease pathogenesis (Gugliesi2013Nuclear; Bawadekar2015The).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), reduced expression of IFI16 is associated with poor clinical outcomes, particularly in patients expressing ZAP70 and CD38. This suggests that IFI16 may serve as a prognostic biomarker in CLL, with its expression levels influencing disease progression and treatment response (Piccaluga2017IFI16).

In mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), IFI16 expression is significantly downregulated, which may be linked to metabolic reprogramming and alterations in cellular processes, potentially playing a role in the disease's pathogenesis (Piccaluga2019Interferon).

## Interactions
IFI16 is involved in various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that are crucial for its role in the immune response. It interacts with the PAF1 complex (PAF1C), which includes core members such as PAF1, CTR9, and CDC73. These interactions are enhanced in the oligomerization-capable R23K mutant compared to the oligomerization-deficient R23Q mutant, highlighting the importance of IFI16's ability to oligomerize for its interactions with antiviral and transcription-regulatory proteins (Lum2019ChargeMediated).

IFI16 also interacts with the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) protein pUL83, which stimulates the activity of the viral immediate-early promoter through its interaction with IFI16. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of IFI16 to the MIEP, necessary for efficient transcription from the MIEP at low multiplicities of infection (Cristea2010Human).

In the context of DNA sensing, IFI16 interacts with the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein in a DNA-dependent manner, which is crucial for the induction of IFN-β. This interaction is observed in THP-1 cells where STING is recruited to IFI16 following viral DNA stimulation (Unterholzner2010IFI16). IFI16 also forms complexes with the pro-apoptotic speck protein ASC, leading to the activation of procaspase-1, which is crucial for the production and secretion of IL-1β (Bawadekar2015Mislocalization).
