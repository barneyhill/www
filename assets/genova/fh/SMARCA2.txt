# SMARCA2

## Overview
SMARCA2 is a gene that encodes the protein SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 2, commonly referred to as BRM. This protein is a critical component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression by altering chromatin structure. As an ATPase, BRM utilizes the energy from ATP hydrolysis to reposition nucleosomes, thereby modulating DNA accessibility and facilitating the binding of transcriptional regulators to DNA. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and cell cycle control, and is predominantly active in the nucleus. SMARCA2 is essential for maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly in non-proliferating or differentiated cells (Kadoch2016PRC2; Savas2018The; Chetty2020SMARCAfamily).

## Structure
The SMARCA2 protein, also known as BRM, is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. It contains several important domains, including an ATPase domain, a bromodomain, and a BRK domain. The ATPase domain is essential for its function in chromatin remodeling, facilitating the destabilization of DNA-histone interactions in an ATP-dependent manner (Koga2009Involvement). The bromodomain recognizes acetylated lysines, which is important for its interaction with chromatin (Kofink2022A).

The BRK domain, found between residues 610 and 659, has a beta-beta-alpha-beta fold and is involved in protein-protein interactions, potentially serving as a peptide binding site (Allen2020Structure). This domain is highly conserved and shares structural similarities with the GYF domain, known for mediating protein interactions (Allen2020Structure).

SMARCA2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which influence its activity and interactions. The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its function and regulation (Koga2009Involvement). These structural features and modifications are critical for the protein's role in chromatin remodeling and its involvement in various cellular processes.

## Function
The SMARCA2 gene encodes a protein that is a key component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure. This protein functions as an ATPase, utilizing the energy from ATP hydrolysis to reposition nucleosomes, thereby modulating DNA accessibility and facilitating the binding of transcriptional regulators to DNA (Kadoch2016PRC2; Chetty2020SMARCAfamily). 

In healthy human cells, SMARCA2 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and cell cycle control. It is particularly important for increasing chromatin accessibility, which is essential for the repair of double-strand DNA damage (Chetty2020SMARCAfamily). The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other chromatin-associated proteins to influence gene expression patterns necessary for normal cellular function (Savas2018The).

SMARCA2 also plays a role in cellular differentiation and development, as it is involved in controlling cell proliferation and cell cycle checkpoints. Its activity is crucial for maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly in non-proliferating or differentiated cells (Reyes1998Altered).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SMARCA2 gene, which encodes a key subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, have been implicated in various cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SMARCA2-negative expression is associated with high-risk factors such as advanced tumor stage, poor differentiation, and worse survival outcomes, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Sun2022SMARCA2). In gastric cancer, SMARCA2 expression alterations are linked to poor prognosis, particularly in non-EBV/MSI diffuse/mixed subgroups and stage III disease, suggesting that SMARCA2-lost gastric cancers might represent a distinct molecular subgroup (Huang2021The).

In atypical neurofibromas associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, SMARCA2 is frequently heterozygously deleted, although its expression levels might not be significantly altered, indicating a complex role in tumor progression (Pemov2019Low). The loss of SMARCA2 expression is also observed in other solid tumors, such as lung, esophageal, ovarian, bladder, colon, and breast carcinomas, where it is often epigenetically silenced rather than mutated (Glaros2007The). This epigenetic silencing can be reversed by histone deacetylase inhibitors, highlighting potential therapeutic strategies (Glaros2007The).

## Interactions
SMARCA2, also known as BRM, is a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and participates in various protein interactions. It interacts with the transcription factor GLI1, enhancing GLI1's transcriptional activity at GLI1-BS-containing promoters. This interaction involves multiple regions of SMARCA2, including fragments 393-786 and 786-1179, and was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays (Safgren2020The).

In the context of multiple myeloma, SMARCA2 interacts with NSD2, a histone methyltransferase, in a noncanonical manner independent of the SWI/SNF complex. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of the prometastatic gene PTP4A3 through chromatin remodeling. SMARCA2 and NSD2 collaboratively recruit to the PTP4A3 promoter, influencing its expression and contributing to cancer progression (Chong2021SMARCA2).

SMARCA2 also plays a role in the SWI/SNF complex's function in cancer cell lines with SMARCA4 mutations. In these cells, SMARCA2 forms residual complexes essential for cell proliferation, highlighting a compensatory mechanism between SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 within the SWI/SNF complex (Wilson2014Residual). These interactions underscore SMARCA2's involvement in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation across different biological contexts.
