# PLEKHG2

## Overview
PLEKHG2 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology and RhoGEF domain containing G2, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) primarily involved in the regulation of Rho family small GTPases, such as Rac1 and Cdc42. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes including actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, cell migration, and gene transcription. PLEKHG2 is characterized by the presence of a dbl homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which are crucial for its specificity and membrane localization, respectively (Ueda2008Heterotrimeric; Edvardson2015Microcephalydystonia). The protein is activated by Gβγ subunits and is involved in signaling pathways that lead to actin polymerization, essential for cell shape and motility (Ueda2008Heterotrimeric). Additionally, PLEKHG2 is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Shain2013Integrative; Edvardson2015Microcephalydystonia).

## Function
PLEKHG2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a crucial role in the regulation of Rho family small GTPases, specifically Rac1 and Cdc42, in healthy human cells. It is involved in the activation of these GTPases, which are essential for actin cytoskeleton rearrangements, cell migration, and gene transcription (Ueda2008Heterotrimeric). PLEKHG2 contains a dbl homology (DH) domain that regulates RhoGTPase specificity and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that aids in membrane localization and regulation of its basal GEF activity (Edvardson2015Microcephalydystonia).

The protein is activated by Gβγ subunits, part of the heterotrimeric G protein complex, and is involved in signaling pathways that lead to actin polymerization, a process essential for cell shape, motility, and division (Ueda2008Heterotrimeric; Edvardson2015Microcephalydystonia). PLEKHG2 is also phosphorylated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, specifically through the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which regulates cell morphology and neurite outgrowth (Sato2014Threonine).

In addition to its role in cytoskeletal reorganization, PLEKHG2 interacts with proteins such as four-and-a-half LIM domains 1 (FHL1), which enhances its activity and influences cell morphology (Sato2016Fourandahalf). These interactions and regulatory mechanisms highlight PLEKHG2's significant role in cellular signaling and morphological changes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLEKHG2 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. A specific homozygous missense mutation, p.Arg204Trp, has been linked to intellectual disability, postnatal microcephaly, and dystonia. This mutation leads to decreased activity of the PLEKHG2 protein, impairing its ability to stimulate RhoGTPases, which are crucial for actin polymerization and neuronal development (Nishikawa2022Impaired; Edvardson2015Microcephalydystonia). Patients with this mutation exhibit profound mental retardation, dystonia, and a distinct neuroimaging pattern characterized by abnormal white matter and atrophy (Nishikawa2022Impaired; Edvardson2015Microcephalydystonia).

The p.Arg204Trp mutation affects the interaction of PLEKHG2 with Gβγ, disrupting the Rac/Cdc42-PAK1 signaling pathway, which is essential for dendritic spine formation and synaptic connectivity. This disruption likely contributes to the synaptic dysfunction observed in affected individuals, leading to intellectual disability (Nishikawa2022Impaired). The mutation also results in impaired axon growth and guidance, further impacting neurodevelopment (Nishikawa2022Impaired).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, PLEKHG2 has been implicated in pancreatic cancer. It is located within the 19q13 amplicon, a region frequently amplified in pancreatic cancers, suggesting a potential role as an oncogene in these cases (Shain2013Integrative).

## Interactions
PLEKHG2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, facilitating actin cytoskeleton reorganization (Ueda2008Heterotrimeric). PLEKHG2 interacts with the Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, which enhances its RhoGEF activity, while the Gαs subunit attenuates its function (Ueda2008Heterotrimeric; Nishikawa2017Specific). 

The protein also interacts with the Four-and-a-half LIM domains 1 (FHL1) protein, specifically the FHL1A isoform, which enhances PLEKHG2-induced serum response element (SRE)-dependent gene transcription (Sato2016Fourandahalf; Nishikawa2017Specific). This interaction is crucial for forming a ternary complex with Gβγ in HEK293 cells (Sato2016Fourandahalf). 

PLEKHG2 is negatively regulated by interactions with β-actin and γ-actin, which inhibit its activity (Nishikawa2017Specific). It is also phosphorylated at threonine 680 by the EGFR/Ras/MAPK pathway, which is important for its activation and regulation of cell morphology (Sato2014Threonine). These interactions highlight PLEKHG2's role in modulating cellular dynamics and signaling.
