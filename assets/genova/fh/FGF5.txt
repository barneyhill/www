# FGF5

## Overview
Fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) is a gene that encodes a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, which is involved in a wide array of biological processes, including cell growth, development, and tissue repair. The FGF5 protein is categorized as a growth factor and is particularly significant in the regulation of the hair growth cycle, where it functions as an inhibitor by promoting the transition from the anagen (growth) phase to the catagen (regression) phase of hair follicles (Jo2021Expression; Higgins2014FGF5). This regulatory role is crucial for maintaining hair length and preventing excessive growth. FGF5 interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptors, primarily FGFR1 and FGFR2, to exert its biological effects, including influencing cell proliferation and migration (Amano2021Specific; Chen2020FGF5). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, such as trichomegaly and certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ghassemi2017FGF5; Hoang2023Fibroblast; Higgins2014FGF5).

## Structure
The FGF5 protein is encoded by the human fgf-5 oncogene and is part of the fibroblast growth factor family. The primary structure of FGF5 includes a leucine-rich hydrophobic amino terminus, which suggests the presence of a signal sequence for cotranslational transport into the endoplasmic reticulum (Zhan1988The). The protein also contains a consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation, Asn-Gly-Ser, at residues 109 to 111, indicating potential post-translational modifications (Zhan1988The).

The secondary structure of FGF5 includes regions that show significant homology to other FGF family proteins, with two blocks of residues (90 to 180 and 187 to 207) displaying 20% identity and 29% homology when considering conservative amino acid substitutions (Zhan1988The). The tertiary structure of FGF5 has been studied using molecular dynamics simulations, which revealed that a missense mutation (Y174H) affects the protein's structural dynamics, leading to changes in secondary structure and increased solvent accessibility (Hoang2023Fibroblast).

FGF5 is secreted as a glycoprotein with heterogeneous sialic acid content, indicating both N-linked and O-linked glycosylation (Bates1991Biosynthesis). The presence of splice variant isoforms is suggested, but specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
FGF5 (fibroblast growth factor 5) is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, which plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including cell growth, development, and tissue repair. In healthy human cells, FGF5 is primarily involved in regulating the hair growth cycle. It acts as an inhibitor of hair growth by promoting the transition from the anagen (growth) phase to the catagen (regression) phase of the hair follicle cycle. This regulation is essential for maintaining the balance of hair growth and ensuring proper hair length (Jo2021Expression; Higgins2014FGF5).

FGF5 exerts its effects by binding to its receptor, FGFR1, located within the dermal papilla at the base of the hair follicle. This interaction is crucial for the transition of hair follicles from the growth phase to the regression phase, thereby influencing hair length (Higgins2014FGF5). The gene produces two protein isoforms due to alternative splicing: a full-length form and a shorter form, FGF5S. The full-length FGF5 promotes the catagen phase, while FGF5S acts antagonistically by inhibiting the catagen-promoting activity of FGF5 (Suzuki2000DualMode). This dual-mode regulation is vital for the proper cycling of hair growth and the prevention of excessive hair length.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the FGF5 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. One notable condition is trichomegaly, characterized by abnormally long eyelashes. This condition is associated with mutations in the FGF5 gene, such as the missense mutation Y174H, which affects the protein's structure and its interaction with the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), leading to decreased receptor activation and prolonged hair growth phases (Hoang2023Fibroblast; Higgins2014FGF5).

FGF5 is also involved in various cancers. Its overexpression has been linked to poor survival outcomes in breast cancer, where it is associated with worse clinical features and survival metrics (Huang2018Expression). In melanoma, FGF5 promotes tumor growth and malignancy, with its expression affecting signaling pathways that enhance tumor proliferation and angiogenesis (Ghassemi2017FGF5). In pancreatic cancer, FGF5 is overexpressed and contributes to cancer cell growth through autocrine and paracrine signaling (Kornmann1997Fibroblast).

Additionally, FGF5 has been implicated in the progression of astrocytic brain tumors and is associated with increased malignancy in glioblastoma multiforme (Allerstorfer2008FGF5). Its role in these conditions highlights its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) interacts primarily with fibroblast growth factor receptors FGFR1 and FGFR2, particularly the IIIc isoforms, which are predominantly expressed in mesenchymal lineages. This interaction is crucial for FGF5's role in promoting angiogenesis and cell proliferation (Amano2021Specific). FGF5 binds to FGFR1 to induce cell proliferation, and this interaction can be inhibited by specific RNA aptamers, such as F5f1 and F5f3, which bind to FGF5 and prevent its interaction with FGFR1, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation (Amano2021Specific).

In the context of Schwann cells, FGF5 interacts with FGFR1 and FGFR2, influencing cell migration and adhesion. This interaction does not activate the ERK1/2 signaling pathways typically involved in cell proliferation but instead inhibits basal ERK1/2 activity, leading to increased cell-cell adherence and migration through the upregulation of N-cadherin (Chen2020FGF5).

FGF5 also participates in interactions with its missense mutant FGF5-H174, which shows a stronger binding affinity to FGFR1 compared to the wild-type FGF5. This altered interaction affects the conformation and connectivity of hotspot residues, potentially impacting the protein's function (Hoang2023Fibroblast).
