# RWDD2A

## Overview
RWDD2A is a gene that encodes the protein RWD domain containing 2A, which is characterized by the presence of a conserved RWD domain. This domain is known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the RWDD2A protein may play a role in various cellular processes, including those involving ubiquitination and signaling pathways (Puthiyedth2016Identification; Tatara2024Emerging). The gene has been implicated in several biological contexts, such as Alzheimer's disease, where it is overexpressed in certain brain regions, and obesity, where it is part of a network regulating numerous transcription factors (Puthiyedth2016Identification; Joshi2021Identification). Despite these associations, the precise biological functions and interactions of the RWDD2A protein remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to uncover its roles in health and disease.

## Interactions
RWDD2A is a gene encoding a protein that contains a conserved RWD domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions. The RWD domain is found in various proteins, including ring finger proteins, dead-like helicases, and WD repeat-containing proteins, suggesting a role in diverse cellular processes (Puthiyedth2016Identification). Although specific interactions involving RWDD2A are not detailed in the available literature, the RWD domain is known for its ability to mediate interactions with other proteins, potentially involving ubiquitination processes or signaling pathways (Tatara2024Emerging).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, RWDD2A has been reported to be overexpressed in multiple human brain regions, indicating its potential involvement in disease-related pathways (Puthiyedth2016Identification). In obesity research, RWDD2A is part of a transcription factor-regulated network, predicted to regulate 82 transcription factors, including KDM5B, highlighting its role in transcription factor interactions (Joshi2021Identification). Despite these findings, specific physical interactions of RWDD2A with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be elucidated, and further research is needed to fully understand its functional interactions in cellular processes.
