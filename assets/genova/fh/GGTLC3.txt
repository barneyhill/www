# GGTLC3

## Overview
GGTLC3 is a gene that encodes the protein gamma-glutamyltransferase light chain family member 3, which is part of the gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) family. This family of proteins is involved in the metabolism of glutathione and the transfer of gamma-glutamyl functional groups, playing a crucial role in cellular detoxification processes and amino acid transport. The protein encoded by GGTLC3 is categorized as an enzyme, specifically functioning as a transferase, which facilitates the transfer of specific functional groups between molecules. Understanding the structure and function of GGTLC3 and its encoded protein is essential for elucidating its role in various physiological and pathological processes, including its potential implications in disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
