# ASB14

## Overview
The ASB14 gene encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 14, which is part of the ASB family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains and a SOCS box, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes, respectively. The ankyrin repeat domains facilitate the binding of the protein to various substrates, while the SOCS box is implicated in targeting proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. ASB14 is thought to play a role in cellular processes by modulating protein stability and turnover, although its specific biological functions and interactions remain to be fully elucidated. The protein is categorized as an adaptor protein due to its role in mediating interactions between other proteins (Qiu2020aarFDC).
