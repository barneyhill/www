# INHBA

## Overview
The INHBA gene encodes the inhibin subunit beta A, a critical component of the activin and inhibin protein complexes, which are part of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. This gene plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and reproductive function. The inhibin subunit beta A protein, through its involvement in forming activins and inhibins, regulates the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone and influences reproductive physiology. Additionally, it is implicated in wound healing and immune response modulation. The protein's interactions and regulatory mechanisms are significant in cancer progression, where altered expression levels of INHBA are associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma (Wu2019Expression; Zhang2022Comprehensive).

## Structure
The INHBA gene encodes the inhibin beta A subunit, which is a component of the inhibin and activin protein complexes. The primary structure of the INHBA protein consists of a polypeptide chain with a specific sequence of amino acids. Its secondary structure includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the polypeptide chain, allowing the protein to achieve its functional conformation. In terms of quaternary structure, the INHBA subunit assembles with other subunits to form dimers, which are essential for its biological activity.

Post-translational modifications are common in the INHBA protein, with glycosylation and cleavage being notable processes that can affect its function and stability. These modifications can influence the protein's interactions and activity within the cell. The INHBA protein can also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which allows for the generation of multiple protein variants from a single gene. These isoforms may have distinct functional roles or regulatory properties, contributing to the complexity of the protein's biological functions.

## Function
INHBA encodes the inhibin beta A subunit, which is a component of the activins and inhibins, proteins that play crucial roles in various cellular processes. Activins, formed by the dimerization of inhibin beta subunits, are involved in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. These proteins are particularly significant in reproductive physiology, where they influence processes such as follicle-stimulating hormone secretion and gonadal function. Activins also contribute to wound healing by promoting cell proliferation and migration, and they play a role in the immune response by modulating the activity of immune cells.

Inhibins, on the other hand, are heterodimers composed of an inhibin beta subunit and an inhibin alpha subunit. They primarily function to inhibit the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland, thus playing a critical role in the regulation of the reproductive system. INHBA is expressed in various tissues, including the gonads, pituitary gland, and placenta, indicating its involvement in both local and systemic physiological processes. The activity of INHBA in these tissues underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions related to growth, reproduction, and tissue repair.

## Clinical Significance
The INHBA gene, encoding the inhibin subunit βA, is implicated in the progression of various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), INHBA is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poor overall and disease-free survival. This overexpression is linked to DNA copy number variations and downregulation of miR-217-5p, suggesting a role in tumor progression and as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (Wu2019Expression; Zhang2022Comprehensive).

In lung adenocarcinoma, INHBA is overexpressed in a majority of cases, with high expression levels associated with poor survival outcomes. The gene's expression is linked to increased cell proliferation and is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, including histone acetylation and promoter methylation (Seder2009Upregulated).

In gastric cancer, INHBA expression is elevated in tumor tissues and is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in specific subtypes. The gene's expression is not primarily controlled by promoter methylation but rather by DNA amplification and transcription factor regulation. INHBA is involved in immune infiltration and cancer-related signaling pathways, making it a potential biomarker for prognosis and a predictor of immunotherapy response (Liu2023Identification).

## Interactions
INHBA, the inhibin subunit beta A, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its role in cancer progression. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), INHBA interacts with the Hippo signaling pathway by binding to the Merlin protein, leading to decreased phosphorylation and increased nuclear translocation of YAP, a key component of the pathway. This interaction promotes cancer cell invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Zhang2021Inhibin).

In gastric cancer, INHBA expression is regulated by circTHBS1, which stabilizes INHBA mRNA through interactions with the RNA-binding protein HuR. CircTHBS1 promotes the export of HuR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where HuR binds to U- or AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated regions of target mRNAs, including INHBA, enhancing their stability (Qiu2022CircTHBS1). CircTHBS1 also acts as a miRNA sponge for miR-204-5p, preventing it from downregulating INHBA expression (Qiu2022CircTHBS1).

In esophageal squamous cancer cells, the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 enhances the stability of INHBA mRNA by recognizing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications, which promotes tumor invasion and migration (Wang2023Elevated). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving INHBA in various cancer types.
