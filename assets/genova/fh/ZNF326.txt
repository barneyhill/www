# ZNF326

## Overview
ZNF326 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 326, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 326 is involved in various cellular processes, including gene transcription, alternative splicing, and signal transduction, and is categorized as a transcription factor due to its ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. The protein has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, such as breast cancer, glioma, and colorectal cancer, through its interactions with other proteins and signaling pathways. These interactions often influence key processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell proliferation, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Yu2018ZNF326; Yang2021ZNF326; Yu2019ZNF326).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF326 has been implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), ZNF326 is associated with a malignant phenotype. High expression of ZNF326 correlates with poor prognosis and advanced cancer stages. It promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness by interacting with deleted in breast cancer-1 (DBC1), upregulating matrix metalloproteinases, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins (Yu2018ZNF326). However, other studies suggest ZNF326 may act as a tumor suppressor in TNBC, where its downregulation leads to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth (Rangel2017Identification).

In glioma, ZNF326 is highly expressed and correlates with advanced tumor grades. It enhances glioma cell proliferation and invasiveness by upregulating histone deacetylase enzyme-7 (HDAC7) and activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Yu2019ZNF326).

ZNF326 also plays a role in colorectal cancer, where its overexpression is linked to advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis. It promotes EMT and invasiveness through the TGF-β signaling pathway, altering the expression of EMT-related proteins (Yang2021ZNF326). These findings highlight ZNF326's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
ZNF326, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing cellular processes and cancer progression. In glioma cells, ZNF326 interacts with HDAC7, a histone deacetylase, to modulate the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction decreases the acetylation and phosphorylation of β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt pathway, thereby promoting tumor growth (Yu2019ZNF326). ZNF326 also directly binds to β-catenin in the nucleus, enhancing its interaction with the transcription factor TCF4, which activates Wnt target genes (Yu2019ZNF326).

In breast cancer, ZNF326 interacts with DBC1 (Deleted in Breast Cancer 1), a protein involved in gene transcription and alternative splicing. This interaction promotes the expression of proteins related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell proliferation, such as MMP7, Snail, Slug, cyclinA2, and cyclinB1 (Yu2018ZNF326).

ZNF326 also interacts with the long non-coding RNA OLBC15 in triple-negative breast cancer. OLBC15 binds to ZNF326, leading to its degradation via the ubiquitination pathway, which affects the expression of downstream genes (Deng2020A). These interactions highlight ZNF326's multifaceted role in cancer progression.
