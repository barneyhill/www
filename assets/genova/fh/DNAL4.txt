# DNAL4

## Overview
The DNAL4 gene encodes the dynein axonemal light chain 4, a protein that is a critical component of the axonemal dynein motor complex. This protein is categorized as a light chain within the outer arm dyneins (OADs), which are essential for the motility of cilia and flagella. These structures are involved in various cellular processes, including cell movement, fluid transport, and sensory functions. The DNAL4 gene plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of these motor complexes, contributing to the stability and regulation of ciliary and flagellar activities. Mutations in DNAL4 have been linked to clinical conditions such as congenital mirror movements and teratozoospermia, highlighting its importance in human health and disease (Uhlmann2007Molecular; Pânzaru2022Genetic; Rao2024Structure).

## Function
The DNAL4 gene encodes a light chain of dynein, a motor protein complex involved in the movement of cilia and flagella, which are essential for various cellular and physiological processes. Dyneins are responsible for generating force toward the minus end of microtubules, utilizing ATPase activity to convert chemical energy into mechanical work. This function is crucial for the motility of cilia and flagella, which play roles in cell movement, fluid transport across epithelial surfaces, and sensory functions (Uhlmann2007Molecular; Rao2024Structure).

In humans, DNAL4 is part of the structural arrangement of dyneins, specifically within the axonemal dyneins, which are involved in ciliary and flagellar movement. The protein is a component of the outer arm dyneins (OADs) and is involved in maintaining the structural integrity and function of these motor complexes (Rao2024Structure). Although the specific role of DNAL4 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its presence in the dynein complex suggests it contributes to the stability and regulation of ciliary and flagellar functions, which are vital for normal cellular operations and organismal health (King2008DyneinIndependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAL4 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. Congenital mirror movements (CMM) are associated with biallelic mutations in DNAL4, located on chromosome 22q13.1. CMM is characterized by involuntary mirroring of voluntary movements, particularly in the hands, but no callosal anomalies have been reported in association with DNAL4 mutations (Pânzaru2022Genetic).

In the context of male infertility, a frameshift variant in DNAL4 has been identified in men with teratozoospermia, a condition marked by abnormal sperm morphology. Although DNAL4 has not been previously linked to teratozoospermia in humans, similar mutations in boars have been shown to affect sperm motility and cause midpiece abnormalities. These findings suggest that DNAL4 mutations may contribute to sperm deficiencies by altering sperm morphology, potentially aiding in distinguishing teratozoospermia from other infertility types (Kyrgiafini2022WholeGenome).

Despite being tested in the context of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), DNAL4 mutations were not found to be associated with this condition in the patients studied. However, DNAL4 remains a candidate gene for PCD due to its role in ciliary function (Leigh2009Clinical).
