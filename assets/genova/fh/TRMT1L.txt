# TRMT1L

## Overview
TRMT1L is a gene that encodes the tRNA methyltransferase 1-like protein, which is primarily involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules. This protein is categorized as a methyltransferase due to its role in catalyzing the formation of dimethylguanosine (m2,2G) at specific positions in tRNA, a modification essential for tRNA stability and function. Unlike its paralog TRMT1, TRMT1L is predominantly localized in the nucleolus, indicating its specific involvement in nuclear tRNA modifications. The protein's structure includes a Rossmann-fold methyltransferase domain and a CCCH-type zinc finger motif, which are critical for its RNA binding and methylation activities. TRMT1L plays a significant role in neurodevelopment, with deficiencies linked to neurological disorders and motor coordination issues, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper neurological function (Jonkhout2021Subcellular; Zhang2024Human).

## Structure
The TRMT1L protein is involved in tRNA modifications and features a distinct molecular structure. It contains a Rossmann-fold methyltransferase (MTase) domain and a CCCH-type zinc finger (ZnF) motif, which are crucial for its function in RNA binding and methylation (Petrosyan2024N2methylguanosine). In TRMT1L, the ZnF motif is positioned before the MTase domain, a structural arrangement that may influence substrate interactions (Petrosyan2024N2methylguanosine). Unlike its paralog TRMT1, TRMT1L lacks a mitochondrial targeting sequence and is predominantly localized in the nucleus, particularly in the nucleoli, suggesting its role in nuclear tRNA modifications (Jonkhout2021Subcellular).

The protein's primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids that form these domains, while its secondary structure likely comprises alpha helices and beta sheets typical of Rossmann-fold domains. The tertiary structure of TRMT1L would involve the overall 3D conformation of these domains, although specific details are not provided in the context. There is no information on the quaternary structure or post-translational modifications specific to TRMT1L in the provided context. The presence of splice variant isoforms is not mentioned, indicating that such variants may not be characterized or relevant in the current literature.

## Function
TRMT1L is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the methylation of tRNA molecules, specifically catalyzing the formation of dimethylguanosine (m2,2G) at position 27 in tyrosine tRNAs. This modification is crucial for the stability and function of these tRNAs, impacting protein synthesis and cell proliferation (Zhang2024Human). TRMT1L also plays a role in maintaining acp3U modifications in a subset of tRNAs, which is essential for their stability and function in translation (Zhang2024Human).

TRMT1L is primarily localized in the nucleolus of human cells, suggesting a distinct role in tRNA biogenesis and function, which is crucial for proper neurodevelopment (Zhang2024Human). The protein's activity is not limited to its methyltransferase function, as it also influences the efficient translation of tyrosine and serine codons, affecting gene expression and tRNA surveillance pathways (Zhang2024Human).

In TRMT1L-deficient models, such as knockout mice, altered motor coordination and behavioral changes have been observed, indicating its importance in the nervous system and its potential role in motor control (Jonkhout2021Subcellular; Zhang2024Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRMT1L gene have been linked to several neurological disorders. A pathogenic variant, specifically a homozygous missense mutation c.1535C>T, p.(Pro512Leu), has been identified in patients with early-onset neurodegenerative symptoms. This variant impairs acp3U modification in tRNA-Ala and Cys, which is associated with the observed neurodegenerative symptoms (Zhang2024Human). TRMT1L deficiency in mice has been shown to lead to altered motor coordination and aberrant behavior, suggesting its crucial role in the nervous system (Jonkhout2021Subcellular; Zhang2024Human).

The TRMT1L gene is also implicated in motor neuropathy and leukodystrophy in humans, with mutations potentially affecting translation efficiency and protein synthesis, contributing to developmental delays and growth defects (Zhang2024Human). Knockout studies in mice have demonstrated cognitive impairments, indicating that TRMT1L is essential for normal neurological function (Jonkhout2021Subcellular).

Alterations in TRMT1L expression or function may disrupt its role in tRNA modification, leading to reduced global translation levels and impacting neurodevelopmental processes (Zhang2024Human). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TRMT1L in maintaining proper neurological health.
