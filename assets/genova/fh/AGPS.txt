# AGPS

## Overview
The AGPS gene encodes the enzyme alkylglycerone phosphate synthase, a crucial component in the biosynthesis of ether lipids, particularly plasmalogens, within peroxisomes. As a member of the FAD binding oxidoreductase/transferase type 4 family, AGPS plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism by facilitating the conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) into alkylglycerone phosphate, a key step in plasmalogen synthesis (Liegel2011Blind; Itzkovitz2011Functional). Plasmalogens are vital for maintaining cellular membrane integrity, signal transduction, and protection against oxidative stress. Mutations in the AGPS gene can lead to disorders such as rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, underscoring the enzyme's importance in human health (Itzkovitz2011Functional). Additionally, AGPS is implicated in cancer biology, where its overexpression is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and drug resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhu2014Alkylglyceronephosphate; Benjamin2013Ether).

## Structure
The AGPS protein, encoded by the AGPS gene, is a peroxisomal enzyme involved in the synthesis of ether lipids, particularly plasmalogens. The molecular structure of AGPS includes a hydrophobic tunnel capable of accommodating a 16-carbon chain, which is crucial for its function in plasmalogen synthesis (Itzkovitz2011Functional). The protein also features a gating helix that aids in substrate binding and product release, and a catalytic center that forms a flavin-linked intermediate with dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) (Itzkovitz2011Functional). 

AGPS is part of the FAD binding oxidoreductase/transferase type 4 family, indicating the presence of a C-terminal catalytic FAD oxidase domain (Liegel2011Blind). The enzyme operates through a 'ping-pong' mechanism, where the fatty acid is removed from DHAP before the binding of the fatty alcohol (Itzkovitz2011Functional). 

In terms of quaternary structure, AGPS forms homotrimeric complexes, which are stable even in the absence of GNPAT, another protein involved in ether lipid biosynthesis (Itzkovitz2011Functional). The structural integrity and active site configuration are critical for AGPS function, as mutations can lead to protein destabilization and reduced plasmalogen synthesis capacity (Itzkovitz2011Functional).

## Function
AGPS (alkylglycerone phosphate synthase) is a peroxisomal enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of ether lipids, particularly plasmalogens, which are essential components of cell membranes. In healthy human cells, AGPS functions within the peroxisomes, where it collaborates with glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPAT) on the luminal membrane surface. The initial step in plasmalogen synthesis involves GNPAT acylating dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), followed by AGPS exchanging the acyl group for an alkyl group, forming alkylglycerone phosphate (Itzkovitz2011Functional).

This process is crucial for the production of plasmalogens, which are important for maintaining membrane structure, facilitating signal transduction, modulating inflammatory responses, and providing protection against oxidative stress (Itzkovitz2011Functional). The presence of AGPS is necessary for full GNPAT activity, indicating a functional interdependence between these enzymes in healthy cells (Itzkovitz2011Functional).

Mutations in the AGPS gene can lead to disorders such as rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP), characterized by reduced plasmalogen synthesis and associated with various developmental abnormalities (Itzkovitz2011Functional). The enzyme's activity is essential for normal cellular processes, highlighting its importance in human health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AGPS gene are associated with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 3 (RCDP3), a rare genetic disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities, intellectual disability, and respiratory issues. RCDP3 is caused by mutations that lead to a deficiency in plasmalogen biosynthesis, resulting in clinical features similar to other types of RCDP, such as severe shortening of rhizomelic bones, bilateral cataracts, and severe growth and motor delays (Malheiro2014Plasmalogens; Liegel2011Blind).

Alterations in AGPS expression levels have been implicated in cancer. AGPS is up-regulated in various aggressive human cancer cells, including breast, melanoma, and prostate cancers. This overexpression is linked to increased cancer cell motility, survival, and tumor growth. Conversely, AGPS knockdown leads to reduced cancer aggressiveness by altering lipid metabolism and decreasing oncogenic signaling lipids (Benjamin2013Ether).

In glioma and hepatic carcinoma, AGPS overexpression is associated with drug resistance. Silencing AGPS in these cancer cells restores drug sensitivity, suggesting its role in supporting chemotherapy resistance (Zhu2014Alkylglyceronephosphate). These findings highlight AGPS as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
AGPS (alkylglycerone phosphate synthase) is known to interact with the GNPAT (glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase) enzyme within the peroxisome. These interactions are crucial for the biosynthesis of plasmalogens, a type of ether phospholipid. AGPS and GNPAT form high molecular weight complexes, likely with a stoichiometry of two AGPS molecules to one GNPAT molecule, facilitating substrate channeling between the enzymes (Itzkovitz2011Functional). The presence of AGPS is necessary for full GNPAT activity, as evidenced by reduced GNPAT activity in cells lacking functional AGPS, suggesting a functional interdependence between these proteins (Itzkovitz2011Functional).

AGPS can form homotrimeric complexes independently and, in the presence of GNPAT, heterotrimeric complexes. Cross-linking experiments have shown that AGPS forms complexes of approximately 200 and 260 kD, which are consistent with AGPS-only complexes. These complexes were not detected in RCDP3 cell lines with reduced or absent AGPS, indicating that AGPS can maintain its stability and form complexes independently of GNPAT (Itzkovitz2011Functional). The interaction dynamics between AGPS and GNPAT highlight the complex nature of their relationship in ether lipid biosynthesis.
