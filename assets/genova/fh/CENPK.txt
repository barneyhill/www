# CENPK

## Overview
CENPK, or centromere protein K, is a gene located on chromosome 5q12.3 that encodes a protein integral to the kinetochore, a critical structure for chromosome segregation during cell division. The CENPK protein, consisting of 269 amino acids, is a component of the CENPA-CAD complex, which is essential for the assembly of centromere proteins and the recruitment of the NDC80 complex, ensuring accurate chromosome separation during mitosis (Ma2021Bioinformatics; Wu2021Knockdown). This protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, particularly at the centromere region, where it plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability by preventing aneuploidy (Chen2022The). Beyond its fundamental role in cell division, CENPK is implicated in cancer progression, interacting with various proteins to influence tumor cell proliferation and migration, making it a potential prognostic marker in several cancers (Tian2022Centromeric; Li2022Lentivirusmediated).

## Function
CENPK (centromere protein K) is a crucial component of the kinetochore, a protein structure on chromatids that plays a vital role in chromosome segregation during cell division. It is encoded by the CENPK gene located on chromosome 5q12.3 and consists of 269 amino acids with a molecular weight of 31 kD (Ma2021Bioinformatics). In healthy human cells, CENPK is part of the CENPA-CAD complex, which is involved in the assembly of centromere proteins and the recruitment of the NDC80 complex to the external centromere. These interactions are essential for accurate chromosome separation during mitosis, ensuring the maintenance of diploid chromosome numbers (Wu2021Knockdown).

CENPK is active in the nucleus, particularly at the centromere region of chromosomes, where it contributes to the proper function of the kinetochore. This protein is involved in processes such as chromosome alignment and segregation, which are critical for the fidelity of cell division (Ma2021Bioinformatics). The kinetochore, including CENPK, ensures that each daughter cell receives the correct number of chromosomes, thus playing a fundamental role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy (Chen2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CENPK gene have been implicated in the progression and prognosis of several cancers. In prostate cancer, high CENPK expression is associated with pathways related to mitotic spindles and the cell cycle, contributing to tumor-related signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation. Clinically, elevated CENPK levels are linked to lower overall survival and disease-free survival probabilities, making it a potential prognostic marker for prostate cancer (Chen2022The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, downregulation of CENPK suppresses tumor growth by affecting the YAP1 signaling pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and invasion. This suggests that CENPK may regulate the YAP1 pathway, influencing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor progression (Downregulation; p&gt; Wang2019&lt).

CENPK is also overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis and clinical progression. Its expression correlates with patient outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic factor (Ma2021Bioinformatics).

In gastric cancer, CENPK promotes cell proliferation and migration, with its knockdown leading to reduced tumor growth and increased apoptosis. It interacts with proteins like XRCC5, suggesting a mechanism through which it influences cancer progression (Tian2022Centromeric).

## Interactions
CENPK, or centromere protein K, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell division and cancer progression. It is a component of the CENPA-CAD complex, which is essential for kinetochore assembly and chromosome segregation during mitosis (Wu2021Knockdown). CENPK interacts with the CENPA-nac complex and collaborates with KNL1 to recruit the NDC80 complex to the centromere, ensuring chromosome stability (Wu2021Knockdown).

In gastric cancer, CENPK has been shown to interact with XRCC5, also known as Ku80, a component of the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex involved in DNA repair. This interaction is suggested to play a role in DNA damage repair and cell cycle regulation, contributing to reduced apoptosis and enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which promotes cancer progression (Tian2022Centromeric). Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses have identified other potential interacting proteins with CENPK, including JUP, ACTA2, HNRNPD, HSPb1, and PARP1 (Tian2022Centromeric).

In colorectal cancer, CENPK interacts with genes such as YWHAZ and BMI1, influencing tumor cell proliferation and invasion (Li2022Lentivirusmediated). These interactions suggest that CENPK plays a significant role in cancer cell proliferation and migration through its interactions with various proteins.
