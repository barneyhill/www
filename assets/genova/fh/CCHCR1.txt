# CCHCR1

## Overview
CCHCR1, or coiled-coil alpha-helical rod protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, mRNA metabolism, and centrosome function. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil alpha-helical rod structure, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and is implicated in processes such as steroidogenesis and cell cycle regulation. CCHCR1 is notably associated with the major psoriasis susceptibility locus PSORS1, and its polymorphic variants have been linked to increased risk of psoriasis and other skin-related conditions. The protein's interactions with components like astrin and EDC4 underscore its role in centrosome dynamics and mRNA turnover, respectively, highlighting its multifaceted involvement in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis (Ling2014CCHCR1; Tervaniemi2012Centrosomal; Ying2022CCHCR1astrin).

## Structure
The CCHCR1 protein is characterized by its coiled-coil alpha-helical rod structure, which is a common motif for facilitating protein-protein interactions (Tervaniemi2012Centrosomal; Ying2022CCHCR1astrin). The protein contains several coiled-coil regions, including a leucine zipper motif, which suggests potential for dimerization and interactions with DNA (PACHOLSKABOGALSKA2012Analysis). CCHCR1 is not part of any known protein family, indicating a unique primary structure (Tervaniemi2012Centrosomal).

The protein has multiple isoforms, with isoform 1 being longer due to an additional 89 amino acids in its N-terminal domain, influenced by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 2 (Tervaniemi2012Centrosomal). Isoform 3, in contrast, is shorter and has been associated with increased cell proliferation and apoptosis (Tervaniemi2012Centrosomal). The formation of these isoforms is dependent on the presence of specific alleles, which affect the translation process (Tervaniemi2018Intracellular).

CCHCR1 localizes to centrosomes and P-bodies, suggesting a role in cytoskeletal organization and mRNA turnover (Tervaniemi2018Intracellular; Ying2022CCHCR1astrin). The protein interacts with astrin, a spindle-associated protein, through its C-terminal coiled-coil region, which is crucial for centrosome-related functions (Ying2022CCHCR1astrin).

## Function
The CCHCR1 gene encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including steroidogenesis, cell proliferation, differentiation, and cytoskeleton organization. It is localized in multiple cellular compartments such as the cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, and centrosome (Ling2014CCHCR1). CCHCR1 interacts with EDC4, a component of processing bodies (P-bodies), suggesting its role in mRNA metabolism and turnover, which could affect the transcriptome and cellular functions (Ling2014CCHCR1).

CCHCR1 is also implicated in centrosome function and mitosis. It interacts with astrin, a protein crucial for centrosome maturation, and is involved in centriole duplication and microtubule assembly, which are essential for maintaining genomic stability (Ying2022CCHCR1astrin). The protein's role in centrosomal recruitment of MCPH proteins and its interaction with astrin highlight its importance in cell cycle progression and mitotic accuracy (Ying2022CCHCR1astrin).

In the skin, CCHCR1 is expressed in basal keratinocytes and is involved in steroidogenesis, enhancing pregnenolone production, a precursor in steroid hormone synthesis. This function is crucial for skin homeostasis and immune regulation (Tiala2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CCHCR1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, most notably psoriasis. The CCHCR1 gene is located within the major psoriasis susceptibility locus PSORS1, and its polymorphic nature, particularly the CCHCR1*WWCC allele, is associated with an increased risk of developing psoriasis. This gene influences cell proliferation and apoptosis, with specific isoforms affecting these processes differently. Isoform 3, linked to the risk allele, is associated with increased cell proliferation and apoptosis, contributing to psoriasis pathogenesis (Tervaniemi2012Centrosomal).

CCHCR1 is also involved in the regulation of the EGFR-STAT3 signaling pathway, which is significant in psoriasis. Alterations in this pathway due to CCHCR1 expression changes can impact cytoskeletal organization and keratin 17 expression, a marker for psoriasis (Tervaniemi2012Centrosomal).

In addition to psoriasis, CCHCR1 has been linked to skin cancers, such as squamous cell carcinoma, where its expression is upregulated and correlates with EGFR expression. This suggests a role in cancer cell proliferation and transformation (Suomela2009CCHCR1). The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its clinical significance in dermatological and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
CCHCR1, also known as coiled-coil alpha-helical rod protein 1, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts specifically with the E2 protein of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16), sharing a common binding interface with the BRD4 protein. This interaction is competitive, as CCHCR1 reduces the binding of BRD4 to HPV16 E2, affecting transcriptional activation (Muller2014CCHCR1).

CCHCR1 also interacts with astrin and CEP72, which are crucial for centrosome localization and centriole duplication. Astrin deubiquitinates CCHCR1, protecting it from degradation and facilitating its centrosomal localization. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of CEP72 to the centrosome, highlighting CCHCR1's role in centrosome dynamics (Ying2022CCHCR1astrin).

In addition, CCHCR1 forms a complex with EDC4 in processing bodies (P-bodies), suggesting a role in mRNA metabolism. It interacts with other P-body components like XRN1, indicating its involvement in mRNA decapping and degradation processes (Ling2014CCHCR1).

CCHCR1 also associates with HAX1, a protein involved in mRNA stability and translational control. This interaction is implicated in the regulation of mRNA complexes and is associated with psoriasis pathology (Pisani2021Identification).
