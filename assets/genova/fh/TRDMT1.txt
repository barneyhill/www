# TRDMT1

## Overview
TRDMT1, or tRNA aspartic acid methyltransferase 1, is a gene that encodes a methyltransferase enzyme involved in the methylation of cytosine residues in tRNA molecules. This enzyme is categorized as a methyltransferase due to its role in transferring methyl groups to specific nucleotides, thereby influencing RNA stability and function. The protein encoded by TRDMT1 is crucial for maintaining the integrity of tRNA, particularly under stress conditions, by preventing cleavage and ensuring accurate protein synthesis (Schaefer2010RNA; Goll2006Methylation). TRDMT1 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in gene expression regulation and cellular stress responses. Its function is conserved across species, underscoring its importance in fundamental cellular processes (Goll2006Methylation). Additionally, TRDMT1 has been implicated in DNA damage repair and is of interest in cancer research due to its potential influence on tumorigenesis and response to chemotherapy (Zhu2021Ubiquitinationmediated; Endres2019tRNA).

## Structure
TRDMT1, also known as tRNA aspartic acid methyltransferase 1, is characterized by an enclosed substrate-binding site where the methyl-accepting base is sandwiched between surrounding side-chains. This interaction involves hydrophobic interactions, π-stacking, and hydrogen bonds, suggesting a binding mode where the substrate base flips out of the RNA helix (Schapira2015Structural). The enzyme features an enclosed, druggable substrate-binding cavity, which is associated with methylating purine or pyrimidine rings, contrasting with RNMTs that methylate the ribose ring and have shallower binding sites (Schapira2015Structural).

The structural diversity of RNA methyltransferases, including TRDMT1, is noted, with many adopting a Rossman fold typical of class I methyltransferases (Schapira2015Structural). This fold is significant for the enzyme's function and interaction with its substrates. The primary structure of TRDMT1 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the catalytic domain responsible for its methyltransferase activity. While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TRDMT1 are not provided, the presence of an enclosed binding site suggests a complex three-dimensional conformation that facilitates its specific interactions with RNA substrates (Schapira2015Structural).

## Function
TRDMT1, also known as tRNA aspartic acid methyltransferase 1, is primarily involved in the methylation of cytosine residues in tRNA molecules, specifically at cytosine 38 in the anticodon loop of tRNA Asp. This methylation is crucial for maintaining tRNA stability and ensuring proper protein synthesis by protecting tRNAs from stress-induced cleavage (Schaefer2010RNA; Goll2006Methylation). In healthy human cells, TRDMT1-mediated methylation plays a significant role in maintaining translational fidelity, which is essential for the correct discrimination between aspartic acid and glutamic acid codons, thereby ensuring the production of properly folded proteins (Adamczyk-Grochala2022DNMT2/TRDMT1).

TRDMT1 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences gene expression and cellular stress responses. Its activity is particularly important under stress conditions, as it helps protect tRNAs from cleavage, thereby contributing to cellular survival and homeostasis (Schaefer2010RNA). The enzyme's function is conserved across species, highlighting its essential role in cellular processes (Goll2006Methylation). In the context of cancer, TRDMT1's role in maintaining protein homeostasis and modulating stress responses is of particular interest, as it may influence tumorigenesis (Endres2019tRNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TRDMT1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of premature ovarian failure (POF), TRDMT1 plays a crucial role in DNA damage repair in granulosa cells. Mutations such as E63K and G155V can impair its subcellular localization and DNA repair efficiency, leading to increased susceptibility to oxidative damage and apoptosis, which are contributing factors to POF (Sha2021TRDMT1).

In cancer, TRDMT1 is involved in the cellular response to chemotherapy-induced stress. Knockout studies in various cancer cell lines, including glioblastoma, have shown that the absence of TRDMT1 can lead to increased DNA damage, impaired DNA damage response, and altered cell cycle regulation. This suggests that TRDMT1 may influence cancer progression and treatment resistance (Bloniarz2021The). Additionally, TRDMT1 knockout affects the DNA methylome in glioblastoma cells, potentially impacting gene expression and cancer cell fate during chemotherapy (Zabek2023Knockout).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of TRDMT1 in both reproductive health and cancer, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker.

## Interactions
TRDMT1, also known as tRNA aspartic acid methyltransferase 1, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its role in DNA damage repair and RNA modification. TRDMT1 interacts with DNA:RNA hybrids, which facilitates the recruitment of repair proteins RAD52 and RAD51 to promote homologous recombination (HR) and protect cells from DNA damage (Zhu2021Ubiquitinationmediated; Chen2020m5C). RAD52 acts as a reader of m5C modifications in DNA:RNA hybrids, enhancing its binding affinity and recruitment to damage sites (Chen2020m5C).

The E3 ligase TRIM28 is a key player in the ubiquitination of TRDMT1, specifically targeting lysine K251, which is necessary for the removal of TRDMT1 from DNA damage sites (Zhu2021Ubiquitinationmediated). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of TRDMT1's stability and function in DNA repair processes (Zhu2021Ubiquitinationmediated). Mutations such as G155V affect TRDMT1's ubiquitination and its ability to repair DNA, increasing sensitivity to chemotherapy (Zhu2021Ubiquitinationmediated).

TRDMT1 also interacts with proteins involved in RNA processing and is a component of RNA processing bodies and stress granules, particularly under oxidative stress conditions (Sha2021TRDMT1). These interactions highlight TRDMT1's multifaceted role in cellular processes related to DNA repair and RNA modification.
