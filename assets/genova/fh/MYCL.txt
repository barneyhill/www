# MYCL

## Overview
The MYCL gene encodes the MYCL proto-oncogene, a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHLZ) transcription factor that is part of the MYC family. This protein plays a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation and cellular reprogramming, particularly in the context of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and oncogenesis. MYCL's structure, characterized by its interaction with the MAX protein, facilitates its DNA-binding capability, which is essential for modulating gene expression related to cell adhesion, RNA processing, and core biosynthetic processes (Anderson2020The; Akifuji2021MYCL). Clinically, MYCL is implicated in the progression of certain cancers, such as small cell lung cancer (SCLC), where it is often deregulated, leading to tumorigenic processes (MassóVallés2020MYC). Despite its oncogenic potential, targeted therapies for MYCL-driven cancers remain under investigation (MassóVallés2020MYC).

## Structure
The MYCL protein, part of the MYC family, is a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHLZ) transcription factor. This structure is crucial for its ability to bind DNA and dimerize with the MAX protein, allowing it to regulate gene expression (Brägelmann2017Family). MYCL contains several MYC Box (MB) domains, specifically MB0 and MB2, which are essential for its function in reprogramming human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The MB0 domain is involved in regulating cell adhesion-related proteins, while the MB2 domain interacts with RNA-binding proteins, playing a role in RNA processing (Akifuji2021MYCL).

MYCL lacks the MB3a domain found in c-MYC and is approximately 30 amino acids shorter at the N-terminus, which contributes to its lower transformation activity (Akifuji2021MYCL). The protein can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may affect its activity and interactions (Akifuji2021MYCL). MYCL is expressed in different isoforms, with the short isoform lacking the helix-loop-helix domain, which is crucial for efficient DNA binding (MassóVallés2020MYC). These structural features contribute to MYCL's unique functional properties compared to other MYC family members.

## Function
The MYCL gene, a member of the MYC family of transcription factors, plays a crucial role in cellular reprogramming and transcriptional regulation. In healthy human cells, MYCL is involved in the formation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-like colonies by promoting mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). This process is facilitated through the MYC Box 0 (MB0) and MYC Box 2 (MB2) domains of the MYCL protein, which regulate the expression of cell adhesion-related proteins and interact with RNA-binding proteins, respectively (Akifuji2021MYCL).

MYCL's MB0 domain is essential for regulating cell adhesion proteins, which are critical for MET, while the MB2 domain is involved in RNA processing, affecting gene expression related to cell adhesion and the cytoskeleton (Akifuji2021MYCL). MYCL also supports transcription broadly by enhancing the expression of genes involved in core biosynthetic processes, such as nucleic acid and peptide biosynthesis, which are crucial for maintaining cell size and mRNA content (Anderson2020The).

MYCL's interaction with the MAX protein is essential for its DNA-binding capability, allowing it to modulate the transcription of target genes critical for normal cellular functions (Akifuji2021MYCL). This interaction is vital for MYCL's role in reprogramming and transcriptional regulation.

## Clinical Significance
MYCL, a member of the MYC family of proto-oncogenes, plays a significant role in the progression of certain cancers, particularly small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In SCLC, MYCL is often deregulated, leading to increased expression and genomic amplification, which supports tumorigenic processes. Approximately 20% of SCLC patients exhibit MYCL amplification, which correlates with poor survival outcomes (MassóVallés2020MYC). MYCL promotes cancer progression by activating pathways involved in ribosomal biogenesis and protein production, although it has a lower transforming activity compared to MYC (MassóVallés2020MYC).

MYCL's expression is more tissue-restricted compared to MYC, and its role in cancer is often observed in tumors of neuroendocrine or neural origin (MassóVallés2020MYC). In addition to SCLC, MYCL is amplified or overexpressed in various other tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (MassóVallés2020MYC). The gene is located on chromosome 1 (1p32) and is subject to a polymorphism that results in long and short isoforms, with the short isoform lacking the HLH domain necessary for efficient DNA binding (MassóVallés2020MYC). Despite its oncogenic potential, no targeted therapies are currently available for MYCL-driven cancers, although immunotherapy and other treatments are under investigation (MassóVallés2020MYC).

## Interactions
MYCL, a member of the MYC family of transcription factors, is known for its interactions with various proteins and complexes, playing a significant role in oncogenesis. MYCL forms heterodimers with MAX, another basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein, which is crucial for its DNA-binding activity and transcriptional regulation. This interaction is essential for the viability of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) cells, particularly in the context of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) infection (Cheng2017Merkel).

In MCC, MYCL is recruited by the MCPyV small T antigen (ST) to the EP400 complex, a histone acetyltransferase and chromatin remodeling complex. This recruitment is critical for the oncogenic activity of MCPyV, as the ST-MYCL-EP400 complex binds to specific gene promoters, activating their expression and maintaining cell viability (Cheng2017Merkel). The complex also includes other components such as TRRAP, DMAP1, and YEATS4, and is involved in regulating gene expression related to metabolic and translational processes (Cheng2017Merkel).

MYCL's interaction with the EP400 complex is unique among polyomaviruses and is essential for the viability of virus-positive MCC cells. This interaction supports the activation of classic MYC targets involved in RNA processing and metabolic processes while repressing differentiation markers (Cheng2017Merkel).
