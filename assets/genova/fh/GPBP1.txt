# GPBP1

## Overview
The GPBP1 gene encodes the GC-rich promoter binding protein 1, a transcriptional regulator that plays a pivotal role in gene expression by binding to GC-rich promoter regions of DNA. This protein is characterized by its ability to interact with both DNA and RNA, facilitated by specific structural motifs such as the extended AT-hook (eAT-hook) domain, which exhibits a preference for RNA oligonucleotides with helix-loop structures (Filarsky2015The). GPBP1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it modulates the transcription of genes involved in critical cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and response to pathogenic factors (Yu2018Legionella). The protein's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is implicated in various diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Revert2018Selective; Lee2021Identification).

## Structure
The GPBP1 gene encodes a protein involved in transcription regulation, characterized by its ability to bind GC-rich promoter regions. The molecular structure of the GPBP1 protein includes specific domains that facilitate DNA binding, which are often characterized by motifs such as zinc fingers or helix-turn-helix. These motifs are crucial for the protein's interaction with DNA, allowing it to regulate transcription effectively.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the function of GPBP1. These modifications can alter the protein's activity, stability, or interaction with other molecules, thereby impacting its role in transcription regulation. The presence of splice variant isoforms of GPBP1 suggests that the protein can exist in multiple forms, each potentially having distinct structural and functional properties. These isoforms may result from alternative splicing events, which can lead to variations in the protein's domain composition and overall structure.

The structural complexity of GPBP1, including its domain architecture and potential modifications, underscores its versatile role in gene expression regulation. Understanding these structural features is essential for elucidating the precise mechanisms by which GPBP1 influences transcriptional processes.

## Function
GPBP1, or GC-rich promoter binding protein 1, is a transcriptional regulator that binds to GC-rich promoter regions of DNA. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression, influencing key cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. GPBP1 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other transcription factors and regulatory proteins to modulate gene activity. By binding to specific DNA sequences, GPBP1 can either activate or repress the transcription of target genes, thereby controlling the expression of genes involved in various cellular functions. Its activity is essential for maintaining normal cellular homeostasis and function, as it ensures that genes are expressed at the right time and in the appropriate amounts. The precise regulation of gene expression by GPBP1 is vital for proper cell cycle progression and the differentiation of cells into specialized types, which are critical processes for the development and maintenance of healthy tissues and organs.

## Clinical Significance
The GPBP1 gene, also known as Vasculin, is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or interactions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), GPBP1 is dysregulated, particularly in neurons of AD patients and in the vascular wall, where it plays a role in atherosclerosis. Its expression is significantly down-regulated in the cerebral artery under conditions of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, suggesting a shared pathway between AD and CVD (Singh2024Comprehensive; Lee2021Identification).

In cancer, GPBP1 is involved in tumor growth and metastasis. Elevated levels of circulating GPBP1 correlate with poor outcomes in breast and lung cancer patients, indicating its role in metastasis. GPBP1 is also linked to chemoresistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through its involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes (Revert2018Selective).

GPBP1's role extends to chronic kidney disease (CKD), where its interaction with RTN3 affects the IGF2-JAK2-STAT3 pathway, promoting collagen synthesis and mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to kidney fibrosis (Fan2022Loss). These findings highlight GPBP1's significance in various pathological conditions, necessitating further research into its mechanisms and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
GPBP1, also known as GC-rich promoter binding protein 1, is involved in several interactions with nucleic acids and proteins. It contains an extended AT-hook (eAT-hook) domain, which is a novel RNA-binding motif. This domain shows a strong preference for binding RNA over DNA, with a significant affinity for RNA oligonucleotides that have a helix-loop structure (Filarsky2015The). The eAT-hook domain in GPBP1 also binds to GC-rich DNA sequences, playing a role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with the GC-rich promoter of IGF2, as confirmed by a dual-luciferase reporter assay (Fan2022Loss).

GPBP1 interacts with the Legionella effector AnkX, as identified through a NAPPA-based proteome array method and validated by bead-based pull-down assays and wNAPPA (Yu2018Legionella). In the context of Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease, GPBP1 has been identified as a gene with altered interactions in gene regulatory networks, although specific physical interactions in these contexts are not detailed (Lee2021Identification). These interactions suggest that GPBP1 plays a multifaceted role in cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and response to pathogenic factors.
