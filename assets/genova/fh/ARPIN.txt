# ARPIN

## Overview
The ARPIN gene encodes a protein known as the actin-related protein 2/3 complex inhibitor, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. This protein functions as an inhibitor of the Arp2/3 complex, a key player in actin filament nucleation and branching, thereby influencing cell motility and migration. ARPIN's regulatory activity is crucial for processes such as tissue development, wound healing, and the maintenance of epithelial and endothelial barrier integrity. It achieves this by modulating the activity of the Arp2/3 complex and interacting with junction proteins, contributing to the stability of cellular junctions. Additionally, ARPIN's involvement in actomyosin contractility and vascular permeability underscores its significance in cellular and physiological contexts (MontoyaGarcia2024Arpin; Gorelik2015The).

## Structure


## Function
ARPIN is a protein that functions as an inhibitor of the Arp2/3 complex, which is essential for actin filament nucleation and branching. In healthy human cells, ARPIN plays a critical role in regulating cell motility and migration by modulating the activity of the Arp2/3 complex. This regulation is crucial for controlling the speed and directional persistence of cell movement, as ARPIN induces pauses in cell migration, allowing cells to change direction more frequently. This mechanism is particularly important in processes such as tissue development and wound healing, where precise control of cell movement is required (Gorelik2015The).

ARPIN is also involved in maintaining the integrity of epithelial and endothelial barriers. In epithelial cells, ARPIN associates with junction proteins like E-cadherin and claudin-1, contributing to the stability of epithelial junctions and the intestinal epithelial barrier (ChánezParedes2021The). In endothelial cells, ARPIN regulates actomyosin contractility and endothelial barrier integrity, influencing vascular permeability. This function is independent of the Arp2/3 complex and involves a ROCK1/ZIPK-dependent mechanism (MontoyaGarcia2024Arpin). ARPIN's activity at cell-cell contacts highlights its role in maintaining barrier function and actin cytoskeleton dynamics.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ARPIN gene have been linked to various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and inflammatory conditions. In breast cancer, downregulation of ARPIN is associated with poor prognosis, as it correlates with lower metastasis-free survival rates. This downregulation occurs at both the mRNA and protein levels and is linked to high-grade tumors, indicating a role in cancer progression (Lomakina2016Arpin). The loss of ARPIN expression in breast cancer cell lines is associated with increased cell migration and proliferation, suggesting enhanced tumor growth and metastasis (Lomakina2016Arpin).

In colorectal cancer, ARPIN expression is also reduced during cancer progression, with significant downregulation observed in adenomas and adenocarcinomas compared to normal colon tissue (Lomakina2016Arpin). In inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis, ARPIN is downregulated in inflamed colon tissues, which may contribute to intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction. This downregulation is associated with increased epithelial permeability and disruption of junctional proteins, potentially exacerbating inflammation (ChánezParedes2021The). The restoration of ARPIN levels in patients treated with mesalazine suggests a potential therapeutic role in managing inflammation (ChánezParedes2021The).

## Interactions
Arpin is known to interact with the Arp2/3 complex, a critical component in actin filament nucleation and branching. Arpin binds specifically to the Arp3 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, engaging a site that is distinct from the higher-affinity nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) binding site on Arp2-ArpC1. This interaction is mediated through Arpin's C-terminal residues, which include the C and A domains, similar to those found in NPFs (Fregoso2021Molecular). 

The binding of Arpin to Arp3 is characterized by a 1:1 stoichiometry and a binding affinity of approximately 1.24 μM, independent of the nucleotide state of the Arp2/3 complex (Fregoso2021Molecular). This interaction inhibits the Arp2/3 complex by stabilizing it in an inactive conformation, thereby preventing actin polymerization (Fregoso2021Molecular). 

Arpin's inhibitory role is crucial in cellular processes such as phagocytosis, where it counteracts actin polymerization stimulated by Rac1 signaling through the WAVE complex (Jubrail2019Arpin). Arpin's interaction with the Arp2/3 complex is also influenced by its C-helix, which is essential for binding and inhibiting the complex (Fregoso2021Molecular).
