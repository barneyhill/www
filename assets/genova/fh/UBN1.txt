# UBN1

## Overview
Ubinuclein 1 (UBN1) is a gene that encodes the ubinuclein 1 protein, a key component of the HIRA histone chaperone complex. This protein is integral to chromatin remodeling and the regulation of gene expression, particularly through its role in the deposition of the histone variant H3.3 at regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. Ubinuclein 1 is characterized by its histone recognition domain, which confers specificity for H3.3, and its ability to bind DNA, facilitating the targeting of the HIRA complex to specific chromatin regions. The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as ZO-1 and cingulin, highlight its involvement in diverse cellular processes, including senescence and chromatin assembly independent of DNA replication (Ricketts2019The; Lupo2012Identification; Banumathy2009Human).

## Structure
Ubinuclein 1 (UBN1) is a protein that plays a critical role in the HIRA histone chaperone complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. The UBN1 protein contains several important domains, including the histone recognition domain (HRD), a middle domain, and a basic loop. The HRD specifically binds to the histone variant H3.3 over H3.1, with key residues such as Y132, D133, D136, F138, I139, D140, and N141 being crucial for this specificity (Daniel2015Ubinuclein1). The middle domain, spanning residues 296-584, is predicted to form a helical secondary structure and is capable of dimerization, which is essential for its function in histone binding (Ricketts2019The). This domain binds to H3/H4 histones and is involved in the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) (Ricketts2019The). The basic loop of UBN1 has DNA-binding activity, contributing to the protein's role in chromatin remodeling (Ricketts2019The). UBN1 does not associate with assembled nucleosomes, indicating its role is limited to the initial binding of free histones before chromatin incorporation (Ricketts2019The).

## Function
UBN1 (ubinuclein 1) is a crucial component of the HIRA histone chaperone complex, which plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation in human cells. UBN1 is involved in the deposition of the histone variant H3.3 at cis-regulatory elements, such as promoters and enhancers, which is essential for the regulation of gene transcription during cell differentiation and senescence (Banumathy2009Human; Xiong2018UBN12). 

UBN1 interacts with the HIRA protein through its Hpc2-related domain (HRD), which is essential for the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) and transcriptional repression of proliferation-promoting genes (Banumathy2009Human). This interaction is crucial for the stability and function of the HIRA complex, which operates independently of DNA replication to assemble chromatin (Banumathy2009Human).

In addition to its role in chromatin remodeling, UBN1 has DNA-binding capabilities, facilitated by a lysine-rich region that allows it to bind non-sequence-specific DNA, which may help target the HIRA complex to specific chromatin regions (Ricketts2019The). UBN1's activities are vital for cellular processes such as senescence, a known tumor suppressor mechanism, and tissue aging (Banumathy2009Human).

## Interactions
Ubinuclein 1 (UBN1) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. UBN1 interacts with the tight junction protein ZO-1, specifically binding to its PDZ2 domain through a non-classical site within a 184-amino acid N-terminal region of UBN1. This interaction influences the nuclear localization of ZO-1 (Lupo2012Identification). UBN1 also interacts with cingulin, another tight junction protein, and co-localizes with it in human colon epithelial HT29 cells (Lupo2012Identification).

UBN1 is part of the HIRA complex and interacts with histones H3.3 and H4, facilitating their deposition onto DNA. It binds free H3.3/H4 histones but not when they are part of nucleosomes or tetrasomes, indicating a role in chromatin remodeling (Ricketts2019The). UBN1 also interacts with the 14-3-3 epsilon protein in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, mediated by protein kinase A (PKA), which affects its localization between the nucleus and tight junctions (Conti2013Interaction).

In B-cells, UBN1 interacts with activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a key enzyme in antibody diversification. This interaction is primarily driven by van der Waals interactions and involves specific residues in both proteins (Jaiswal2022Activationinduced).
