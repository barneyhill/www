# ITPRIPL2

## Overview
ITPRIPL2 is a gene that encodes the protein inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-interacting protein-like 2, which is involved in cellular processes related to intermediate filament formation and mitochondrial dynamics. The protein is known to interact with vimentin, an intermediate filament protein, influencing its organization and integration into the cellular cytoskeleton (Hemel2024The). ITPRIPL2 has been implicated in the regulation of cellular morphology and function, particularly through its interactions with ligands such as ATP and cGAMP, which may serve as co-factors in these processes (Hemel2024The). Clinically, the gene's expression is associated with the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is regulated by microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tangen2023LOXL1AS1).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ITPRIPL2 gene have been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The gene is a downstream target of miR-1224-5p, a microRNA that is downregulated in HCC. This downregulation leads to increased expression of ITPRIPL2, which is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis in HCC cells (Tangen2023LOXL1AS1). The long non-coding RNA LOXL1-AS1 is overexpressed in HCC and acts as a competing endogenous RNA by sponging miR-1224-5p, thereby preventing it from inhibiting ITPRIPL2. This interaction promotes the activation of the AKT pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation and survival (Tangen2023LOXL1AS1).

The knockdown of ITPRIPL2 in HCC cells results in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its role in cancer progression. The study indicates that targeting the miR-1224-5p/ITPRIPL2/AKT axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC (Tangen2023LOXL1AS1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ITPRIPL2 in the context of HCC, where its aberrant expression contributes to tumor growth and resistance to apoptosis.

## Interactions
ITPRIPL2 interacts with the intermediate filament protein vimentin. Immunostaining studies have shown that ITPRIPL2 partially co-localizes with vimentin, particularly around the nucleus, but not with mitochondria (Hemel2024The). Overexpression of ITPRIPL2 in HeLa cells results in the condensation of the vimentin network, while knockdown of ITPRIPL2 leads to fewer vimentin fibers and clusters, indicating a role in vimentin processing or integration into intermediate filament fibers (Hemel2024The). Protein docking simulations suggest two potential interaction configurations between ITPRIPL2 and vimentin, with favorable binding energies for both configurations (Hemel2024The).

The study also identifies ATP and cGAMP as potential ligands for ITPRIPL2, with cGAMP possibly serving as a co-factor for vimentin processing. Knockdown of cGAS, the enzyme producing cGAMP, results in similar effects on vimentin and mitochondrial morphology as ITPRIPL2 knockdown, suggesting that cGAMP may be necessary for proper ITPRIPL2 function and its interaction with vimentin (Hemel2024The). These interactions highlight the role of ITPRIPL2 in vimentin-driven intermediate filament formation and its potential involvement in mitochondrial dynamics (Hemel2024The).
