# CRLS1

## Overview
CRLS1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cardiolipin synthase 1, which plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial function by catalyzing the biosynthesis of cardiolipin, a unique phospholipid found in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Cardiolipin synthase 1 is an enzyme that facilitates the conversion of phosphatidylglycerol into cardiolipin, a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity and function (Lee2022Deleterious; Lee2020Cardiolipin). The presence of cardiolipin is crucial for the assembly and stability of mitochondrial protein complexes, including those involved in oxidative phosphorylation and the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) (Lee2022Deleterious). Mutations in the CRLS1 gene can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and are associated with various mitochondrial diseases, underscoring the gene's significance in cellular health and energy production (Lee2022Deleterious; Ren2023Knockout).

## Function
The CRLS1 gene encodes cardiolipin synthase 1, an enzyme crucial for the biosynthesis of cardiolipin (CL), a unique phospholipid located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. In healthy human cells, CRLS1 is responsible for converting phosphatidylglycerol (PG) into cardiolipin, which is essential for maintaining the integrity and function of the mitochondrial inner membrane (Lee2022Deleterious; Lee2020Cardiolipin). Cardiolipin plays a vital role in stabilizing the interaction between mitochondrial ribosomes and the inner membrane, facilitating the co-translational insertion of newly synthesized proteins into the membrane (Lee2020Cardiolipin). 

Cardiolipin is also critical for the assembly and stability of large protein complexes, such as the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system and the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS), which are central to mitochondrial function, including energy production and regulation of programmed cell death (Lee2022Deleterious). The presence of cardiolipin supports the formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes, necessary for efficient ATP production (Lee2020Cardiolipin). Alterations in cardiolipin levels and composition can lead to various mitochondrial dysfunctions, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular health (Lee2022Deleterious).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CRLS1 gene, which encodes cardiolipin synthase 1, are associated with a range of mitochondrial diseases due to cardiolipin deficiency. These mutations lead to an autosomal recessive multi-system mitochondrial disease characterized by symptoms such as progressive encephalopathy, bull's eye maculopathy, auditory neuropathy, diabetes insipidus, autonomic instability, cardiac defects, and early death (Lee2022Deleterious). Specific variants, such as the CRLS1:c.326T>A mutation resulting in a p.(Ile109Asn) substitution, have been shown to cause severe mitochondrial dysfunction, including reduced complex IV-stimulated respiration and fragmented mitochondrial morphology (Lee2022Deleterious).

In murine models, cardiomyocyte-restricted knockout of the Crls1 gene leads to severe dilated cardiomyopathy and early lethality due to heart failure, highlighting the critical role of CRLS1 in cardiac development and function (Ren2023Knockout). The deficiency in cardiolipin prevents the accumulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins, crucial for efficient cardiac contraction, and disrupts the maturation of mitochondrial cristae, leading to heart failure (Ren2023Knockout). These findings underscore the importance of CRLS1 in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, with mutations leading to significant clinical consequences.
