# NOP10

## Overview
NOP10 is a gene that encodes the NOP10 ribonucleoprotein, a critical component of the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex. This protein is involved in the pseudouridylation and processing of precursor ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which is essential for ribosome biogenesis and cellular growth. NOP10 interacts with other core proteins such as Cbf5, Gar1, and Nhp2, forming a complex that associates with H/ACA snoRNAs and telomerase RNA, thereby playing a significant role in RNA modification and telomere maintenance (Reichow2008Nop10; Pogačić2000Human). Mutations in the NOP10 gene have been linked to dyskeratosis congenita and other telomere-related disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability and healthy cellular functions (Reichow2008Nop10; Walne2007Genetic).

## Structure
The NOP10 protein is a component of the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complex, playing a crucial role in RNA modification processes. Structurally, NOP10 is a small protein composed of 58 amino acids with an isoelectric point of 10.5 (KHANNA2005Structural). Its primary structure shows sequence homology with other Nop10 proteins but not with other protein families (KHANNA2005Structural).

In terms of secondary structure, NOP10 features a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet in its N-terminal region, forming a β-hairpin, which is a common motif in nucleic acid binding proteins (KHANNA2005Structural). This β-hairpin is involved in weak RNA interactions, specifically binding to the 3' hairpin of U65 snoRNA (KHANNA2005Structural). The C-terminal region of NOP10 is less structured and becomes more ordered upon binding to its partner protein, Cbf5 (KHANNA2005Structural).

The tertiary structure of NOP10 is partially disordered, with the β-hairpin and a short 3_10 helix forming the more structured regions (KHANNA2005Structural). The quaternary structure involves its interaction with Cbf5, forming part of the active enzyme complex necessary for pseudouridylation (Reichow2008Nop10). In archaea, NOP10 contains a zinc-binding motif, which is absent in eukaryotic NOP10, where it is replaced by a less stable β-hairpin (Reichow2008Nop10).

## Function
NOP10 is a crucial component of the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs), which are involved in the pseudouridylation and processing of precursor ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in human cells. This protein plays a significant role in the assembly and stability of the H/ACA snoRNP complex, which is essential for the modification of uridine to pseudouridine in rRNA, a process critical for the proper folding and stability of RNA structures (Reichow2008Nop10; Pogačić2000Human).

NOP10 interacts with other core proteins such as Cbf5, Gar1, and Nhp2, forming a complex that associates with H/ACA snoRNAs and telomerase RNA. This interaction is vital for the processing and modification of rRNA, contributing to ribosome biogenesis and cellular growth (Henras1998Nhp2p; Pogačić2000Human). NOP10 is active in the nucleolus and Cajal bodies, where it aids in the maturation of rRNA and the maintenance of telomere length, impacting genomic stability (Pogačić2000Human).

Mutations in NOP10 have been linked to dyskeratosis congenita, a genetic disorder affecting telomerase activity and ribosome biogenesis, underscoring its importance in maintaining healthy cellular functions (Reichow2008Nop10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NOP10 gene are associated with several genetic disorders, primarily due to its role in telomere maintenance and ribosomal biogenesis. Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a rare inherited disorder linked to mutations in NOP10, characterized by premature aging, ectodermal dysplasia, bone marrow failure, and increased cancer risk. These mutations impair telomere maintenance and ribosomal function, leading to oxidative stress and activation of the p53 pathway, independent of telomere shortening (Walne2007Genetic; IbáñezCabellos2020Acute).

Specific mutations, such as p.R34W, have been identified in patients with autosomal recessive dyskeratosis congenita, resulting in significantly shorter telomeres and reduced levels of TERC RNA, a component of the telomerase complex (Walne2007Genetic). Another mutation, p.Thr16Met, is associated with a distinct phenotype that includes nephrotic syndrome, cataracts, sensorineural deafness, and enterocolitis, highlighting the role of defective pseudouridylation in these conditions (Balogh2020Pseudouridylation).

Additionally, a heterozygous mutation in NOP10 has been linked to familial pulmonary fibrosis, further illustrating the gene's involvement in telomere-related disorders (Kannengiesser2020First). These findings underscore the clinical significance of NOP10 mutations in various telomere and ribosome-related diseases.

## Interactions
NOP10 is a component of the H/ACA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which plays a crucial role in the pseudouridylation of rRNA and snRNA. It interacts with several proteins, including dyskerin (also known as NAP57), NHP2, and GAR1, forming a core trimer essential for the assembly and function of H/ACA RNPs. This trimer specifically recognizes H/ACA RNAs, with NOP10 being a key player in the assembly process (Wang2004Architecture). 

NOP10 also interacts with the human telomerase RNA component (hTR) and H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), indicating its involvement in both ribosome biogenesis and telomerase function (Pogačić2000Human). The protein forms part of a complex with dyskerin, NHP2, and GAR1, which is necessary for the correct processing and stabilization of hTR (Pogačić2000Human). 

Mutations in NOP10, such as R34W, can disrupt its interactions with RNA, affecting the assembly of pre-RNPs and leading to reduced levels of hTR and short telomeres in dyskeratosis congenita patients (Trahan2009Effects). These interactions highlight the critical role of NOP10 in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the H/ACA RNP complex.
