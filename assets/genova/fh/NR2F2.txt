# NR2F2

## Overview
The NR2F2 gene encodes the nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F member 2 protein, commonly referred to as COUP-TFII, which is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a pivotal role in regulating gene expression across various biological processes, including development, metabolism, and differentiation. Structurally, COUP-TFII contains a DNA-binding domain with zinc finger motifs and a ligand-binding domain, enabling it to interact with specific DNA sequences and other molecular partners (Guzmán2021Orphan). The protein's ability to form homodimers or heterodimers is crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation (Guzmán2021Orphan). NR2F2 is implicated in several physiological and pathological conditions, including cardiovascular development, metabolic regulation, and various congenital disorders, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Polvani2019COUPTFII; Bashamboo2018Loss).

## Structure
The NR2F2 protein, also known as COUP-TFII, is a member of the nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F. It features a classical nuclear receptor structure, including a DNA-binding domain (DBD) with conserved zinc finger motifs and a ligand-binding domain (LBD) (Guzmán2021Orphan). The DBD is responsible for recognizing specific DNA sequences, while the LBD facilitates interactions with ligands, co-activators, and co-repressors, playing a crucial role in the protein's regulatory functions (Guzmán2021Orphan).

NR2F2 can form homodimers or heterodimers, which are important for its function as a transcription factor (Guzmán2021Orphan). The protein's quaternary structure is influenced by its ability to dimerize, which is a common feature among nuclear receptors (Guzmán2021Orphan). Although specific post-translational modifications are not detailed in the provided context, such modifications, including phosphorylation, are known to affect the function of nuclear receptors like NR2F2.

The protein may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can lead to variations in its regulatory roles (Guzmán2021Orphan). These structural features enable NR2F2 to participate in diverse physiological processes, including development and metabolism.

## Function
The NR2F2 gene, also known as COUP-TFII, encodes a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of adipogenesis, glucose homeostasis, and energy metabolism. NR2F2 is expressed during the early stages of white adipocyte development and is crucial for the regulation of adipose tissue. It negatively regulates the expression of Wnt10b, an inhibitor of adipogenesis, and influences mitochondrial biogenesis, glucose homeostasis, and energy expenditure (Li2009The).

In endothelial cells, NR2F2 is essential for maintaining venous identity by activating vein-specific enhancers and repressing artery-specific gene expression. It interacts with transcription factors like ERG to modulate the expression of genes involved in arteriovenous differentiation, ensuring the distinct gene expression profiles of arterial and venous endothelial cells (Sissaoui2020Genomic).

NR2F2 also plays a role in mesenchymal cell differentiation, promoting adipogenesis and chondrogenesis while inhibiting osteogenesis and myogenesis. It is necessary for proper chondrogenesis and influences the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into cartilage cells (Gao2016NR2F2; Xie2011Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NR2F2 gene, also known as COUP-TFII, are associated with a range of congenital heart defects (CHDs). These include atrioventricular septal defects (AVSDs), double outlet right ventricle (DORV), ventricular septal defect (VSD), Tetralogy of Fallot, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) (Al2014Rare; Wang2019NR2F2; Qiao2018A). Loss-of-function mutations in NR2F2 can lead to haploinsufficiency, where a single functional copy of the gene is insufficient for normal function, contributing to these defects (Qiao2018A). 

Alterations in NR2F2 expression are linked to cardiovascular diseases such as arteriosclerosis and heart failure, as well as metabolic disorders like diabetes (Polvani2019COUPTFII). Overexpression of COUP-TFII can result in dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure due to impaired metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction (Polvani2019COUPTFII). 

NR2F2 mutations are also implicated in disorders of sex development, liver cirrhosis, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (Polvani2019COUPTFII; Bashamboo2018Loss). These mutations often result in protein truncation, affecting the gene's normal interactions and functions (Bashamboo2018Loss).

## Interactions
NR2F2, also known as COUP-TFII, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. In breast cancer cells, NR2F2 interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and co-factors such as FOXA1 and GATA3. These interactions are crucial for forming ERα-bound super-enhancers, which are important for ERα-mediated transcriptional regulation (Erdős2020NR2F2; Jiang2019Cooperativity). NR2F2 binds to chromatin and influences ERα binding by maintaining chromatin accessibility, although it does not independently modulate histone modifications (Jiang2019Cooperativity).

NR2F2 also interacts with other nuclear receptors, such as retinoid X receptor (RXR), forming heterodimers that influence gene expression (Erdős2020NR2F2). In endothelial cells, NR2F2 collaborates with the transcription factor ERG to regulate vein-specific gene expression and interacts with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to repress artery-specific gene expression (Sissaoui2020Genomic). These interactions highlight NR2F2's multifunctional role in regulating gene expression across different cell types and conditions.
