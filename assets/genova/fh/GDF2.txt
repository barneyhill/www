# GDF2

## Overview
GDF2, also known as bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9), is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. The protein, BMP9, is a secreted ligand that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including vascular homeostasis, bone development, and neural function. As a member of the TGF-β superfamily, BMP9 is characterized by its ability to form homo- or heterodimers and its interaction with specific receptor complexes, such as the BMPR2/ACVRL1 complex on endothelial cells. This interaction initiates signaling pathways that regulate endothelial cell function and angiogenesis. BMP9 is also recognized for its potent osteogenic properties, making it a key factor in bone and cartilage development. Mutations in the GDF2 gene have been linked to vascular disorders such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), highlighting its clinical significance (Hodgson2021Homozygous; Wang2018Germline; Desroches‐Castan2021BMP9).

## Structure
GDF2, also known as BMP9, is a member of the TGF-β superfamily and exhibits a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of GDF2 consists of a polypeptide chain that includes a signal peptide, a propeptide, and a mature peptide. The secondary structure of GDF2 features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its stability and function (Yoo2024Growth).

The tertiary structure of GDF2 is characterized by a cystine-knot motif, a common feature in the TGF-β superfamily, which involves a specific arrangement of cysteine residues forming disulfide bonds. This motif is crucial for the protein's stability and its ability to interact with receptors (Rider2010Bone).

In terms of quaternary structure, GDF2 can form homo- or heterodimers, with the potential for heterodimers to be more potent in cell differentiation and bone regeneration (Mulloy2015The). The mature GDF2 protein is processed into a growth factor domain that is bound to a prodomain upon secretion, which is essential for its biological activity (Gräf2018Identification).

Post-translational modifications of GDF2 include glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage, which are important for its secretion and function (Yoo2024Growth). These structural features enable GDF2 to act as a major circulating ligand for the endothelial BMPR2/ACVRL1 receptor complex, playing a significant role in various physiological processes (Gräf2018Identification).

## Function
GDF2, also known as BMP9, is a critical component of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) superfamily, playing a significant role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and endothelial cell function. In healthy human cells, BMP9 is primarily expressed in the liver and circulates in the bloodstream at active concentrations. It binds with high affinity to the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) and BMPRII receptor complex on endothelial cells, initiating a signaling cascade that involves the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/9 transcription factors (Kienast2016Rapid; Desroches‐Castan2021BMP9).

This signaling pathway is crucial for promoting endothelial quiescence, reducing apoptosis, and maintaining barrier permeability, thereby regulating angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis (Hodgson2021Homozygous; Desroches‐Castan2021BMP9). BMP9 also interacts with co-receptors such as endoglin (ENG), enhancing its signaling capabilities (Kienast2016Rapid).

Beyond its vascular roles, BMP9 is the most potent BMP for inducing osteogenic differentiation, influencing bone and cartilage development (Kienast2016Rapid). It also functions as a neurotropic factor, maintaining the cholinergic phenotype in the central nervous system (Kienast2016Rapid). These diverse functions underscore the importance of GDF2 in various physiological processes, including vascular integrity, bone health, and neural function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GDF2 gene, which encodes bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9), are associated with several vascular disorders, including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). A novel homozygous missense variant, c.946A > G (p.Arg316Gly), has been linked to pediatric PAH. This mutation disrupts BMP9 processing, leading to the secretion of inactive pro-BMP9 and a lack of mature BMP9 in circulation, which impairs the ALK1/BMPR2 signaling pathway crucial for vascular function (Chomette2023Pediatric).

Homozygous GDF2 mutations can also result in an HHT-like syndrome, characterized by atypical telangiectases and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs). These mutations lead to reduced levels of circulating BMP9 and BMP10, affecting endothelial BMP activity and contributing to the pathogenesis of these conditions (Hodgson2021Homozygous).

GDF2 mutations have been identified in idiopathic PAH cohorts, with some mutations causing haploinsufficiency in the pulmonary endothelium. This suggests that GDF2 is a significant susceptibility gene for PAH, second only to BMPR2 mutations in terms of impact (Wang2018Germline).

## Interactions
GDF2, also known as BMP9, is a ligand that interacts with the BMPR2 receptor, forming a heterotetrameric complex with activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) on endothelial cells. This interaction activates the BMP-specific SMAD1/5/8 signaling pathway, which is crucial for its antiproliferative effects on endothelial cells (Wang2024Hemodynamic). When GDF2 expression is decreased, it may bind to ActR-IIA/IIB instead of BMPR2, leading to increased endothelial cell proliferation, a mechanism relevant in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (Wang2024Hemodynamic).

GDF2's interactions are characterized by specific binding to type I receptors at the wrist epitope and type II receptors at the knuckle epitope, a common feature among BMPs and GDFs (Mueller2015Mechanisms). The promiscuity of type II receptor usage among GDFs suggests that receptor-binding epitopes have special characteristics or conserved protein-protein interfaces (Mueller2015Mechanisms). GDF2 also interacts with BMP10, with elevated BMP10 levels observed when GDF2 levels are reduced, indicating a counterbalancing relationship in vascular proliferation regulation (Wang2024Hemodynamic). These interactions highlight GDF2's role in modulating vascular development and its implications in diseases like PAH.
