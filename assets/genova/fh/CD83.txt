# CD83

## Overview
CD83 is a gene that encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, primarily recognized for its role in the immune system. The CD83 protein is a type-I membrane protein characterized by a V-set Ig-domain fold and is highly glycosylated, which influences its structural and functional properties (Heilingloh2017Crystal). It exists in both a membrane-bound form and a soluble form, the latter of which has immune-suppressive properties (Heilingloh2017Crystal). Functionally, CD83 is a critical marker for mature dendritic cells and plays a significant role in the maturation and regulation of immune cells, particularly T cells and B cells, by acting as a co-stimulatory receptor (Breloer2008CD83; Grosche2020The). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are tightly regulated, with implications in various clinical conditions, including autoimmune diseases and cancer (Zhang2007CD83; Riaz2023CD83).

## Structure
The CD83 protein is a type-I membrane protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is composed of 205 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 45 kDa. The protein structure includes a signal peptide (residues 1-19), an extracellular domain (residues 20-144) with a V-set Ig-domain fold, a membrane-spanning segment (residues 145-166), and a cytoplasmic tail domain (residues 167-205) (Heilingloh2017Crystal). The extracellular domain is highly glycosylated, with three potential N-glycosylation sites at residues 79, 96, and 117, and an atypical glycosylation at Asn86 (Heilingloh2017Crystal).

The tertiary structure of CD83 features a typical immunoglobulin-like domain fold, specifically a V-set Ig-like fold, although certain β-strands typical for V-set Ig-domains are absent, indicating a high disorder propensity in that segment (Heilingloh2017Crystal). The protein can form disulfide-bridged homodimers in bacterial expression systems, but this is not observed in eukaryotic systems due to glycosylation (Heilingloh2017Crystal). CD83 can also form homotypic assemblies, with trimer formation being more thermodynamically favorable than dimer formation (Heilingloh2017Crystal).

CD83 exists in two isoforms: a full-length membrane-bound form and a soluble form (sCD83) consisting only of the extracellular domain. The soluble form has immune-suppressive properties, affecting T-cell stimulation and disease symptoms in various models (Heilingloh2017Crystal).

## Function
The CD83 molecule is a transmembrane glycoprotein primarily recognized as a marker for mature dendritic cells (DCs) and plays a significant role in the immune system. It is involved in the maturation and regulation of immune cells, particularly influencing the activation and function of T cells and B cells. In T cells, CD83 acts as a co-stimulatory receptor, similar to CD80 and CD86, enhancing their activation and proliferation. It is crucial for the thymic maturation of CD4+ T cells, with CD83-deficient mice showing reduced numbers of these cells, indicating its essential role in T cell development (Breloer2008CD83; Grosche2020The).

In B cells, CD83 is expressed at low levels beyond the pre-B cell stage and can interfere with late maturation when overexpressed. It is rapidly upregulated following TLR engagement or BCR ligation, indicating its role in B cell activation and homeostasis (Breloer2008CD83; Grosche2020The). CD83 also influences dendritic cell function by stabilizing MHC-II and CD86 expression, which are crucial for effective antigen presentation and T cell stimulation (Grosche2020The). The soluble form of CD83 can inhibit T-cell stimulation and modulate immune responses, highlighting its complex role in immune regulation (Lechmann2002Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD83 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In cervical cancer, CD83 gene polymorphisms, particularly five SNPs within the 3' end, are linked to increased susceptibility, especially in women with high-risk HPV infections (HPV16 and HPV18) (Zhang2007CD83). Somatic mutations, such as a 1-bp deletion near the start codon and a frameshift deletion, have been identified in cervical cancer cell lines, leading to truncated proteins and potentially contributing to cancer pathogenesis (Zhang2007CD83).

In autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, CD83 plays a significant role. In Behçet's disease, increased expression of CD83 on leukocytes is associated with disease progression, and its soluble form (sCD83) can reduce disease severity by inhibiting dendritic cell-mediated T cell activation (Riaz2023CD83). In multiple sclerosis, altered CD83 expression in dendritic cells and regulatory T cells affects immune regulation, with higher levels of soluble CD83 observed in patients (Riaz2023CD83).

In inflammatory bowel disease, CD83 expression is crucial for immune homeostasis, and its absence can exacerbate colitis symptoms (Grosche2020The). CD83 is also implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus, where altered expression in myeloid dendritic cells may contribute to increased infection rates (Riaz2023CD83).

## Interactions
The CD83 protein, particularly its soluble form (sCD83), is involved in various interactions that are crucial for its function in the immune system. Structurally, CD83 shares similarities with proteins such as CD80, CD86, and PD-L2, which are part of the B7 family, suggesting potential common functional mechanisms, although CD83 is not classified as a B7 family member (Heilingloh2017Crystal). These structural similarities imply that CD83 might engage in both homotypic and heterotypic interactions, akin to those seen in the B7 family, although no specific binding partner has been identified (Heilingloh2017Crystal).

CD83 can form homotypic assemblies, such as dimers and trimers, which may play a role in its biological function. Trimer formation is considered more likely to contribute to CD83's function due to more extensive inter-subunit atomic contacts (Heilingloh2017Crystal). The potential for CD83 to interact with CTLA-4 is suggested due to structural similarities with CD80 and CD86, which both interact with CTLA-4 through a similar protein interface (Heilingloh2017Crystal).

Post-transcriptionally, CD83 expression is regulated by AUF1 proteins, which bind to CD83 mRNA and enhance its translation. This interaction is mediated through a pyrimidine-rich element (PRE) within the CD83 mRNA (Ehlers2012Posttranscriptional).
