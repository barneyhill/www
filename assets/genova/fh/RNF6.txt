# RNF6

## Overview
RNF6, or ring finger protein 6, is a gene that encodes a RING finger ubiquitin ligase, a type of enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This system is crucial for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by tagging specific proteins for degradation. The RNF6 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of axonal growth and neuronal development, through its interaction with LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) (Tursun2005The). Additionally, RNF6 has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, acting as an oncogene by modulating signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT3 and YAP, which are critical for cell proliferation, migration, and survival (Huang2021RNF6; Liang2018RINGFinger). The diverse roles of RNF6 in both normal cellular functions and disease states underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology.

## Structure


## Function
RNF6 (ring finger protein 6) is a ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein levels within cells through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It is involved in tagging proteins for degradation, thereby influencing various cellular processes. One of its primary functions is the regulation of LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) levels in axonal growth cones, which is essential for maintaining appropriate actin dynamics necessary for axonal growth and neuronal development (Tursun2005The).

RNF6 achieves this by interacting with LIMK1 and targeting it for proteasomal degradation, a process dependent on its RING finger domain. This interaction leads to the polyubiquitination of LIMK1, signaling it for degradation by the 26S proteasome (Tursun2005The). The regulation of LIMK1 by RNF6 is critical for the dynamic changes in the cytoskeletal actin network, which are crucial for axon growth and the establishment of neuronal circuits (Tursun2005The).

RNF6 is expressed in various cell types, including neurons, where it is found in axonal projections and growth cones, indicating its involvement in neuronal differentiation and development (Tursun2005The). Its activity in the nucleus and cytoplasm suggests a broader role in cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
The RNF6 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role as an oncogene. In colorectal cancer, RNF6 is frequently amplified and overexpressed, which is associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages. This overexpression leads to the activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of SHP-1, a negative regulator of this pathway, thereby enhancing cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Liang2018RINGFinger). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma, RNF6 overexpression is linked to increased metastasis and radioresistance, facilitated through the ubiquitination of the transcription factor FoxA1. This overexpression correlates with poor overall and disease-free survival in patients (Cai2019RNF6). 

RNF6 also plays a significant role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and affecting cell communication and proliferation. Its overexpression is associated with enhanced cell migration and invasion (Cheng2023RNF6). 

In multiple myeloma, RNF6 promotes cell proliferation and survival by stabilizing the glucocorticoid receptor, contributing to drug resistance (Ren2019RNF6). These findings suggest that RNF6 is a potential therapeutic target in various cancers due to its role in promoting tumor progression and resistance to treatment.

## Interactions
RNF6, a RING finger protein, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In multiple myeloma (MM) cells, RNF6 interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) at the ligand-binding domain, stabilizing GR through K63-linked polyubiquitination, which enhances GR's transcriptional activity and promotes the expression of prosurvival genes (Ren2019RNF6). In colorectal cancer, RNF6 interacts with SHP-1, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, which leads to increased phosphorylation of STAT3, a key factor in cancer progression (Liang2018RINGFinger).

In breast cancer, RNF6 facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of MST1, affecting the YES-associated protein (YAP) signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell migration and invasion (Huang2021RNF6). RNF6 also interacts with LIMK1 in neurons, targeting it for proteasomal degradation, which regulates axonal growth (Tursun2005The). In hepatocellular carcinoma, RNF6 interacts with FoxA1, promoting its degradation and contributing to metastasis and radioresistance (Cai2019RNF6). These interactions highlight RNF6's role in modulating various signaling pathways and cellular functions through its ubiquitin ligase activity.
