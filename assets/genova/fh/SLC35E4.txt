# SLC35E4

## Overview
SLC35E4 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member E4, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family. This family is known for its role in facilitating the transport of various molecules across cellular membranes. The SLC35E4 protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter, suggesting its involvement in the movement of specific substrates within the cell. While the precise substrates and physiological roles of SLC35E4 remain to be fully elucidated, its membership in the SLC family indicates a potential role in cellular homeostasis and metabolism. Further research is needed to clarify its specific functions and interactions within the cellular environment.
