# GPR150

## Overview
GPR150 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 150, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are integral membrane proteins involved in transmitting signals from the extracellular environment to the interior of the cell, playing crucial roles in various physiological processes. G protein-coupled receptor 150 is implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior and has potential associations with conditions such as cancer and obesity. The receptor's ability to form heterodimers with other GPCRs, such as the melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R), suggests a role in modulating receptor trafficking and signaling pathways, which are essential for maintaining energy metabolism and homeostasis (So2020Tackling; Li2021Identification).

## Structure


## Interactions
GPR150, a G protein-coupled receptor, has been identified to have a significant inhibitory effect on the cell surface expression of the melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R). This interaction suggests that GPR150 may form heterodimers with MC3R, influencing its trafficking and expression levels. The study conducted by Li et al. involved co-transfecting MC3R with GPR150 and other GPCRs, using a non-permeabilized ELISA assay to quantify their cell surface expression. The findings indicate that the formation of heterodimers can alter the membrane translocation and signaling of these receptors, highlighting the potential role of GPR150 in modulating MC3R function (Li2021Identification).

While GPR150 is associated with various physiological processes, including regulation of feeding and potential roles in cancer and obesity, specific details on its interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not well-documented. The research emphasizes the importance of identifying new GPCR partners interacting with MC3R and MC4R, as these interactions are crucial for energy metabolism and homeostasis (So2020Tackling). However, the context does not provide further specific information about other physical interactions involving GPR150.
