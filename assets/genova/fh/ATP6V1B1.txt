# ATP6V1B1

## Overview
The ATP6V1B1 gene encodes the B1 subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), a critical enzyme complex involved in the acidification of intracellular compartments across various tissues. This gene is particularly significant in the kidney and inner ear, where it plays essential roles in maintaining acid-base balance and auditory function, respectively. The protein encoded by ATP6V1B1, known as ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit B1, is a component of the V1 domain of V-ATPase, responsible for ATP hydrolysis. It is characterized by its involvement in nucleotide binding and its interaction with other subunits and proteins, facilitated by a PDZ-binding motif. Mutations in ATP6V1B1 are linked to autosomal recessive distal renal tubular acidosis and sensorineural hearing loss, highlighting its clinical significance in renal and auditory health (Finberg2003Molecular; Dahmani2020ATP6V1B1; Karet1999Mutations).

## Structure
The ATP6V1B1 gene encodes the B1 subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), which is part of the V1 domain responsible for ATP hydrolysis. The B1 subunit is involved in nucleotide binding and is expressed in specific tissues such as the kidney, ocular ciliary epithelium, male reproductive tract, placenta, and inner ear (Finberg2003Molecular). The B1 subunit contains a PDZ binding motif at its carboxy terminus, which may mediate tissue-specific interactions with PDZ domain-containing proteins (Finberg2003Molecular).

The protein's structure includes multiple subunits, with the V1 domain composed of three A-subunits and three B-subunits (Finberg2003Molecular). The B1 isoform shares 93% amino acid identity with human and bovine B1 isoforms, indicating a high degree of conservation (Finberg2003Molecular). The B1 subunit preferentially binds certain isoforms, such as ATP6V0A4, and not others like ATP6V0A1, suggesting specific interaction patterns within the V-ATPase complex (Merkulova2015Mapping).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may play a role in the regulation of the V-ATPase complex, although specific modifications for ATP6V1B1 are not detailed in the provided context (Merkulova2015Mapping). The protein's interactome includes various proteins involved in trafficking, folding, assembly, and phosphorylation, highlighting its complex regulatory network (Merkulova2015Mapping).

## Function
The ATP6V1B1 gene encodes the B1 subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), a crucial enzyme complex involved in acidifying intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells. This acidification is essential for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the regulation of cytosolic pH (Wagner2004Renal; Finberg2003Molecular). In the kidney, the B1 subunit is specifically expressed in the intercalated cells of the cortical collecting duct, where it plays a vital role in proton secretion and maintaining acid-base balance (Wagner2004Renal; Finberg2003Molecular). This function is critical for urine acidification and systemic pH regulation (Wagner2004Renal).

The B1 subunit is also expressed in the inner ear, where it contributes to maintaining the pH of the endolymph, a fluid in the cochlea, which is crucial for normal auditory function (Wagner2004Renal; Karet1999Mutations). The presence of a PDZ-binding motif at the carboxy terminus of the B1 subunit suggests it may mediate tissue-specific interactions and targeting of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, further highlighting its specialized roles in different tissues (Wagner2004Renal; Finberg2003Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP6V1B1 gene are associated with autosomal recessive distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), a condition characterized by the kidney's inability to properly acidify urine, leading to metabolic acidosis. This condition is often accompanied by sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) due to the gene's role in maintaining ion homeostasis in the inner ear (Dahmani2020ATP6V1B1; Stover2002Novel; Kumar2015Mutations). 

The ATP6V1B1 gene encodes the B1 subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, which is crucial for acid secretion in renal cells and the inner ear. Mutations in this gene can lead to structural changes in the protein, resulting in poor substrate binding and reduced stability, which impairs its function (Kumar2015Mutations). These mutations include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations, which can cause the protein to truncate prematurely, affecting its normal function (Miura2013Mutational; Karet1999Mutations).

Patients with ATP6V1B1 mutations often present with early-onset SNHL and may also exhibit an enlarged vestibular aqueduct, a common inner-ear malformation (Dahmani2020ATP6V1B1). The gene's expression in the cochlea and kidney underscores its importance in both renal and auditory systems (Karet1999Mutations).

## Interactions
ATP6V1B1, a subunit of the V-ATPase complex, participates in various protein interactions crucial for its function. It interacts with other V-ATPase subunits, including ATP6V0A4, but not with ATP6V0A1, indicating a preference for certain isoforms (Merkulova2015Mapping). The B1 subunit also associates with the d1 subunit rather than the d2 subunit, which was unexpected given the lack of renal function abnormalities in d2 knockout mice (Merkulova2015Mapping).

The study identified 23 high-scoring interactions involving ATP6V1B1, with 13 being V-ATPase subunits. Notably, interactions with SLC9A3R1 (NHERF1) and SLC9A3R2 (NHERF2) were confirmed, both of which have high SAINT scores, indicating strong interactions (Merkulova2015Mapping). These proteins are involved in trafficking and are part of a cluster that includes ARHGEF7, RPSKA3, SNX27, and EZR, which are interconnected and involved in trafficking processes (Merkulova2015Mapping).

The B1 subunit also binds to actin, facilitated by a profilin-like binding site, which is crucial for the recycling of V-ATPases (Eaton2021The). This interaction is part of a broader network involving PDZ domain-containing proteins like SNX27, which binds to the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of ATP6V1B1 (Merkulova2015Mapping).
