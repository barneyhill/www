# AHRR

## Overview
The AHRR gene encodes the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling pathway. As a member of the basic helix-loop-helix-Per-ARNT-Sim (bHLH-PAS) family of transcriptional regulators, AHRR functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, modulating the expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and cell cycle regulation (Sakurai2017The; Baba2001Structure). The protein achieves this by forming a heterodimer with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), thereby competing with the AHR/ARNT complex for binding to DNA and repressing AHR-mediated transcription (Sakurai2017The; Carlson2002A). Beyond its role in AHR signaling, AHRR is implicated in various biological processes, including angiogenesis and tumor suppression, and is associated with several clinical conditions, such as cancer and reproductive health issues (Zudaire2008The; Hahn2009Regulation).

## Structure
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix-Per-ARNT-Sim (bHLH-PAS) family of transcriptional regulators. The protein structure includes bHLH and PAS domains, which are crucial for DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (Sakurai2017The). The bHLH domains exhibit a helix-loop-helix structure with two α-helices connected by a linker region containing a short α-helix, while the PAS domains consist of a central five-stranded β-sheet flanked by surrounding α-helices (Sakurai2017The).

AHRR lacks the PAS-B domain present in other family members like AhR, which affects its dimerization and function (Sakurai2017The). The protein can form a heterodimer with ARNT, competing with AhR for binding to ARNT and target DNA, thereby repressing AhR signaling (Sakurai2017The). The unique interface between PAS-A (AhRR) and PAS-B (ARNT) is formed mainly by hydrophobic interactions and specific hydrogen bonds, contributing to the unique quaternary structure of the AhRR/ARNT complex (Sakurai2017The).

AHRR exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing. The predominant human isoform, AHRRΔ8, lacks exon 8 and is more effective in repressing AHR and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling compared to the full-length AHRR 715 variant (Karchner2009The). The AHRRΔ8 isoform is the major form expressed in human tissues and tumor cell lines (Karchner2009The).

## Function
The AHRR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor) gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in regulating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling pathway. AHRR functions as a transcriptional repressor, primarily inhibiting AHR-mediated gene expression. This repression is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and modulating responses to environmental toxins (Baba2001Structure; Hahn2009Regulation).

In healthy human cells, AHRR is involved in a negative feedback loop where AHR activation leads to the upregulation of AHRR, which in turn suppresses AHR activity. This loop is essential for controlling the expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and cell cycle regulation, such as cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) (HaarmannStemmann2007Analysis; Baba2001Structure). AHRR is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences processes like cell growth and differentiation (HaarmannStemmann2007Analysis).

AHRR also has broader roles beyond AHR repression, potentially affecting other ARNT-dependent proteins like hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), indicating its involvement in various biological processes, including angiogenesis and tumor suppression (Karchner2009The; Hahn2009Regulation). The expression of AHRR is higher in adult tissues compared to embryonic ones, suggesting its importance in adult organ function (Hahn2009Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AHRR gene have been linked to various cancers. AHRR is often downregulated in cancers such as colon, breast, lung, stomach, cervical, and ovarian cancers, primarily due to promoter hypermethylation. This downregulation is associated with increased tumorigenic potential, enhanced cell growth, resistance to apoptosis, increased motility, and invasive potential in cancer cells (Zudaire2008The; Linnenkamp2020A). The hypermethylation of the AHRR promoter is a common epigenetic alteration in cancer cells, leading to its silencing and contributing to tumor progression (Zudaire2008The).

AHRR is also implicated in reproductive health, with studies suggesting a controversial role in conditions like endometriosis and male infertility. However, the specific AHRR variants associated with these conditions are not well understood, and the association might be due to polymorphisms in nearby genes rather than AHRR itself (Hahn2009Regulation).

In addition to cancer, AHRR has been associated with cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCLP). Variants in AHRR have been linked to an increased risk of NSCLP, potentially due to its role in the TCDD-AHR pathway, which affects tissue morphogenesis and epithelial cell differentiation (Linnenkamp2020A).

## Interactions
The AHRR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor) protein is involved in several interactions that modulate transcriptional activity. AHRR forms a heterodimer with the ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) protein, competing with the AHR/ARNT complex for binding to xenobiotic-responsive elements (XRE) in DNA, thereby repressing AHR-mediated transcription (Sakurai2017The; Carlson2002A). This competitive binding is a key mechanism by which AHRR exerts its repressive function.

AHRR also interacts with other proteins to form a complex that mediates transcriptional repression. It physically interacts with ANKRA2, a corepressor that binds to the C-terminal region of AHRR. ANKRA2 is known to interact with histone deacetylases HDAC4 and HDAC5, which are recruited by AHRR to facilitate transcriptional repression (Oshima2007Molecular). Coimmunoprecipitation studies have shown that AHRR can directly interact with HDAC5, even in the absence of ANKRA2, indicating multiple pathways for forming repressive complexes (Oshima2007Molecular).

Additionally, AHRR interacts with the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), suppressing its transcriptional activity. This interaction occurs through the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ERα, but not through the activation function-1 (AF-1) region (Kanno2008Suppressive).
