# GFPT1

## Overview
The GFPT1 gene encodes the enzyme glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1, which plays a pivotal role in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. This enzyme is classified as a transaminase and is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate and glutamine into glucosamine-6-phosphate, a critical step in the production of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a substrate essential for glycosylation processes (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2; Issop2018GFPT1). The GFPT1 protein is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and is particularly important in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating glycosylation, which affects protein folding, stability, and function (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2). Mutations in the GFPT1 gene are linked to congenital myasthenic syndromes, highlighting its clinical significance in neuromuscular function (Senderek2011Hexosamine; Bauché2017Mutations).

## Structure
The GFPT1 protein contains a glutaminase domain and two sugar isomerase (SIS) domains, which are crucial for its function in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (Senderek2011Hexosamine). The protein structure includes a muscle-specific exon 16 that encodes an insertion of 18 additional amino acids, contributing to its tissue-specific functionality (Senderek2011Hexosamine). GFPT1 is a homodimeric enzyme, indicating a quaternary structure where two identical subunits form a functional protein complex (Senderek2011Hexosamine).

The protein undergoes O-GlcNAcylation, a post-translational modification involving the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to serine or threonine residues, which is important for its regulatory functions (Senderek2011Hexosamine). GFPT1 has two splice variants: a ubiquitous isoform and a muscle-specific isoform, GFPT1-L, which is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and the heart (Issop2018GFPT1). The presence of these isoforms suggests alternative splicing plays a role in the protein's functional diversity across different tissues. The structure of GFPT1 has been modeled based on the crystal structures of the Escherichia coli ortholog (GlmS) and the isomerase domain of human GFPT1, providing insights into its functional conformation (Senderek2011Hexosamine).

## Function
GFPT1 (glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1) is a key enzyme in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, catalyzing the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate and glutamine into glucosamine-6-phosphate. This reaction is the first and rate-limiting step in the pathway, which is crucial for producing UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a substrate essential for glycosylation processes (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2; Issop2018GFPT1). Glycosylation is a critical post-translational modification that affects protein folding, stability, and function, impacting various cellular processes such as cell signaling, growth, and metabolism (Issop2018GFPT1).

In healthy human cells, GFPT1 is ubiquitously expressed and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the entry of metabolites into the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. This regulation is achieved through feedback inhibition by UDP-GlcNAc, which helps maintain appropriate levels of this metabolite and ensures proper glycosylation (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2). GFPT1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences the glycosylation of proteins and lipids, thereby affecting cellular functions and organismal outcomes such as stress resistance, longevity, and cell growth (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2; Issop2018GFPT1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GFPT1 gene are associated with congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), particularly the limb-girdle form (LG-CMS). These syndromes are characterized by muscle weakness and fatigability due to defective synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (Senderek2011Hexosamine; Bauché2017Mutations). GFPT1 mutations lead to impaired glycosylation of proteins at the NMJ, affecting proteins such as muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) and acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunits, which are crucial for neuromuscular transmission (An2022Abnormal). 

Patients with GFPT1-related CMS often exhibit proximal limb muscle weakness, minimal ocular or facial involvement, and normal or slightly elevated serum creatine kinase levels. They typically respond well to treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or 3,4-diaminopyridine (An2022Abnormal; Huh2012Limb‐girdle). Muscle biopsies from affected individuals frequently reveal tubular aggregates, a hallmark of the condition, which are linked to defective glycosylation pathways (Issop2018GFPT1; Huh2012Limb‐girdle). 

In addition to CMS, GFPT1 mutations can lead to a specific type of myopathy known as tubular aggregate myopathy with synaptopathy, characterized by synaptic morphological defects and impaired neuromuscular transmission (Bauché2017Mutations).

## Interactions
GFPT1, or glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1, is known to physically interact with the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein in breast cancer cells. This interaction is significant as GFPT1 influences PD-L1 expression and stability through O-GlcNAc modification, a type of glycosylation. Co-immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed a direct physical interaction between GFPT1 and PD-L1, indicating a reciprocal relationship. GFPT1 knockdown results in reduced PD-L1 levels and its glycosylation, while overexpression of GFPT1 increases them. This interaction enhances PD-L1 protein stability by reducing its degradation rate, which is mediated by O-glycosylation (Tang2024GFPT1).

In colorectal cancer, GFPT1 is involved in metabolic pathways that regulate protein function through glycosylation. Although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, GFPT1 and O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) are upregulated by fatty acid synthase (FASN), contributing to cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. GFPT1 plays a particularly important role in promoting colorectal cancer cell proliferation downstream of FASN (Drury2024Overexpression).
