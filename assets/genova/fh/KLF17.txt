# KLF17

## Overview
KLF17 is a gene that encodes the KLF transcription factor 17, a member of the Krüppel-like factor (KLF) family, which is characterized by the presence of three C2H2 zinc finger domains. These domains enable the protein to bind to specific DNA sequences, thereby functioning as a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression (Zhou2015Krüppellike; Swamynathan2010Krüppellike). The KLF17 protein plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including the suppression of tumor growth and metastasis, by interacting with key signaling pathways such as the TGF-β/Smad pathway (Ali2015KLF17). Alterations in the expression of KLF17 have been associated with the progression of several cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Jiang2019Clinical; Liu2013Downregulated).

## Structure
KLF17, also known as zinc finger protein 393 (Zfp393), is a member of the Krüppel-like factor (KLF) family, characterized by a highly conserved C-terminal region composed of three C2H2 zinc finger domains. These domains are crucial for binding to GC-rich sequences in DNA, such as GC-box and CACCC-box sequences, allowing KLF17 to function as a transcription factor (Zhou2015Krüppellike; Swamynathan2010Krüppellike). The primary structure of KLF17 includes 389 amino acids, forming these zinc finger motifs (Huang2015Novel).

The secondary structure of KLF17 likely involves alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of zinc finger proteins, where the zinc fingers consist of two short beta strands followed by an alpha helix, with conserved cysteines and histidines coordinating a zinc ion (Swamynathan2010Krüppellike). The tertiary structure of KLF17 is defined by the overall 3D conformation of these zinc finger domains, which facilitate its interaction with DNA.

KLF17 is frequently downregulated in various human cancers, and its expression is regulated by miR-9, which targets its 3′ untranslated region (Zhou2015Krüppellike). The gene is located on chromosome 1p34.1 and is a human homologue of murine Zfp393 (Zhou2015Krüppellike).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
KLF17 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KLF17 is significantly downregulated, which is associated with increased tumor invasion and poor prognosis. This downregulation is linked to enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis, making KLF17 a potential prognostic marker for HCC (Liu2013Downregulated). In colorectal cancer (CRC), KLF17 expression is also reduced, correlating with lymph node metastasis and poorer survival rates. It serves as an independent prognostic biomarker, with its downregulation potentially influenced by DNA methylation changes (Jiang2019Clinical).

In breast cancer, KLF17 acts as a metastasis suppressor. Its expression is often reduced in metastatic cells, leading to increased cell viability, migration, and invasion. Mutant p53 can repress KLF17 expression, further promoting cancer progression (Gumireddy2009KLF17; Ali2014Gainoffunction). In lung adenocarcinoma, low KLF17 expression is associated with larger tumors and poor prognosis, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Cai2012Reduced). These findings highlight KLF17's potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker in various cancers.

## Interactions
KLF17 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cancer progression and metastasis. It physically interacts with Smad3, a key component of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, enhancing the formation of the Smad3-DNA complex. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of metastasis-associated genes and the suppression of tumor growth (Ali2015KLF17). KLF17 is also involved in a positive feedback loop with Smad3, where TGF-β/Smad3 signaling induces KLF17 expression, which in turn potentiates the signaling pathway (Ali2015KLF17).

KLF17 interacts with mutant p53 in breast cancer cells, where mutant p53 represses KLF17 expression, thereby promoting cancer progression. This interaction affects KLF17's ability to bind to EMT target gene promoters, reducing its tumor suppressive functions (Ali2014Gainoffunction). In non-small cell lung cancer, KLF17 enhances p53 transcription and interacts with the p53 promoter, forming a positive feedback loop that is crucial for suppressing cancer cell migration and invasion (Ali2015Tumorsuppressive).

KLF17 also binds directly to the DNA consensus sequence of the ID-1 promoter, inhibiting its transcription, which is important for regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis (Gumireddy2009KLF17; Ismail2014DJ1).
