# KDM4F

## Overview
KDM4F is a gene that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 4F, which is a member of the histone demethylase family. This enzyme is involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression through its ability to demethylate specific lysine residues on histone proteins, particularly targeting tri- and di-methylated lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3/me2). The activity of lysine demethylase 4F is essential for modulating chromatin structure, thereby influencing key cellular processes such as transcription, DNA repair, and replication. The gene's expression and the protein's function are particularly significant during human embryonic development, where they play a role in the maternal-to-zygotic transition and the regulation of chromatin states (Franci2014The; Yang2021Human; Yang2022Metabolic).

## Function
KDM4F (lysine demethylase 4F) is a histone demethylase enzyme that specifically targets tri- and di-methylated lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3/me2). This demethylation activity is crucial for regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure, which in turn influences processes such as transcription, DNA repair, and replication. KDM4F is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates chromatin dynamics to impact cellular differentiation and proliferation (Franci2014The).

In the context of human embryonic development, KDM4F has been implicated in the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). During this process, the upregulation of KDM4F in Type I arrested embryos is associated with disruptions in the balance of activatory and repressive chromatin states. This imbalance leads to the upregulation of transposable elements, which is linked to the downregulation of epigenetic suppressors like PRMT5. These changes suggest that KDM4F plays a role in the failure of the zygotic genome activation (ZGA) by altering the chromatin state, contributing to epigenetic deregulation in arrested embryos (Yang2021Human; Yang2022Metabolic).
