# HERPUD2

## Overview
HERPUD2 is a gene that encodes the protein HERPUD family member 2, which is a ubiquitin domain protein involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by participating in the degradation of misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum. Unlike its paralogue Herp, HERPUD family member 2 does not bind to the deubiquitinating enzyme Usp7 and is not induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress, indicating distinct functional dynamics within the ERAD pathway (kny2010molecular). The gene's expression and its circular RNA form, hsa_circHERPUD2, have been implicated in various diseases, including coronary artery disease, where it may serve as a potential biomarker (He2023Interaction).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The HERPUD2 gene, which encodes a protein involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In the context of coronary artery disease (CAD), the circular RNA form of HERPUD2, known as hsa_circHERPUD2, is significantly down-regulated in patients compared to healthy controls. This down-regulation suggests its potential role as a biomarker for CAD diagnosis (He2023Interaction). The expression of hsa_circHERPUD2 is also negatively associated with certain lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption, indicating a complex interaction that may influence CAD risk (He2023Interaction).

The study of hsa_circHERPUD2 in CAD patients highlights its potential diagnostic value, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.662 in ROC analysis, indicating moderate diagnostic potential (He2023Interaction). These findings suggest that alterations in HERPUD2 expression, particularly in its circular RNA form, may contribute to the pathogenesis of CAD and could serve as a target for future therapeutic interventions (He2023Interaction).

## Interactions
HERPUD2, a ubiquitin domain protein, is involved in Synoviolin-mediated endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD). It is a component of Synoviolin-based ERAD complexes, where it co-migrates with Synoviolin, Herp, p97, and Derlin-1 in glycerol gradients, indicating its role as a novel component of these complexes (kny2010molecular). HERPUD2 specifically interacts with Synoviolin, as demonstrated by streptavidin agarose precipitation and Western blot analysis, but does not associate with the Synoviolin homologue Gp78, suggesting a selective interaction with Synoviolin-based complexes (kny2010molecular).

Unlike its paralogue Herp, HERPUD2 does not bind to the deubiquitinating enzyme Usp7, indicating distinct interaction dynamics within the ERAD pathway (kny2010molecular). HERPUD2 is not induced by ER stress, and it does not interact with Herp, suggesting that these proteins may exclude each other from the same complexes (kny2010molecular). Despite sharing significant sequence identity with Herp, HERPUD2's interactions and stability differ, as it is not degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system and remains stable under conditions that induce Herp degradation (kny2010molecular).
