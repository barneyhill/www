# RASL11A

## Overview
RASL11A is a gene that encodes the protein RAS like family 11 member A, which is part of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. This protein family is known for its role in intracellular signal transduction, influencing various cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and survival. RAS like family 11 member A is implicated in tumor suppression, as evidenced by its involvement in the spontaneous regression of tumors in Tasmanian devils and its down-regulation in certain human cancers (Margres2020Spontaneous). Additionally, genetic variations near RASL11A have been linked to behavioral traits such as alcohol dependence, suggesting a broader role in human health beyond oncology (Reilly2017Genetic). Despite its identification in glioblastoma-related networks, its expression does not significantly differ in glioblastoma, indicating a complex and context-dependent function (Yang2019Primary).

## Clinical Significance
The RASL11A gene has been implicated in various diseases due to its role as a potential tumor suppressor. In Tasmanian devils, RASL11A is associated with spontaneous tumor regression in Devil Facial Tumor Disease (DFTD). A mutation in the 5' untranslated region of RASL11A leads to its activation, which is linked to reduced tumor cell proliferation and tumor regression (Margres2020Spontaneous). This suggests that RASL11A may have a similar tumor-suppressive role in human cancers, as its expression is down-regulated in human prostate tumors and hypermethylated in colon cancer cell lines (Margres2020Spontaneous).

In human studies, RASL11A has been associated with alcohol dependence. A genome-wide association study identified a significant SNP near RASL11A, suggesting that genetic variations affecting its regulation could influence behaviors related to alcohol dependence (Reilly2017Genetic). Although RASL11A was identified in a protein-protein interaction network related to glioblastoma, its expression did not significantly differ between glioblastoma and control samples, indicating it might not impact glioblastoma survival (Yang2019Primary). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of RASL11A in cancer biology and addiction research.
