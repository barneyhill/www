# CIDEA

## Overview
CIDEA (cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector a) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, primarily within adipose tissue. The CIDEA protein is a member of the CIDE family, characterized by a CIDE domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in lipid droplet dynamics and apoptosis. It plays a significant role in regulating lipid storage by inhibiting lipolysis, thereby promoting triglyceride accumulation in adipocytes. Additionally, CIDEA is implicated in enhancing insulin sensitivity and thermogenesis, partly through its interaction with liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) and regulation of UCP1 transcription. The protein's structure includes an amphipathic helix essential for its interaction with lipid droplets, highlighting its role in lipid droplet fusion and energy balance (Puri2008Cidea; Barneda2015The; Jash2019CIDEA).

## Structure
The CIDEA protein is characterized by its CIDE domain, which is a protein interaction module involved in lipid metabolism and apoptosis. The primary structure of CIDEA includes a sequence of 217 amino acids, with four highly conserved regions shared with other CIDE family proteins such as CIDEB and CIDEC (Barneda2015The). The secondary structure of CIDEA features an amphipathic helix within its C-terminal region, spanning amino acids 163-180, which is crucial for its interaction with lipid droplets and phosphatidic acid (Barneda2015The). This helix is characterized by a sequence that includes cationic residues important for binding (Barneda2015The).

The CIDE domain of CIDEA exhibits an alpha/beta roll fold, consisting of two alpha helices and five beta strands, although some variations exist, such as the absence of a distinct helix a2 in CIDE-A (Park2014Structural). The electrostatic surface of the CIDE domain is polarized, with one side being acidic and the other basic, facilitating interactions with binding partners (Park2014Structural).

CIDEA forms trans-complexes through its N-terminal and C-terminal dimerization sites, which are essential for its function in lipid droplet fusion (Barneda2015The). The protein's ability to dimerize and interact with other lipid droplet proteins suggests a complex quaternary structure that supports its role in lipid transfer (Barneda2015The).

## Function
The CIDEA gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis in healthy human cells. CIDEA is primarily expressed in adipose tissue, where it is involved in the regulation of lipid droplet formation and storage. It functions by inhibiting lipolysis, thereby promoting triglyceride accumulation within adipocytes. This process is facilitated by the carboxy-terminal domain of the CIDEA protein, which localizes to lipid droplets and shares homology with perilipin, another lipid droplet-associated protein (Christianson2010Identification).

CIDEA is also implicated in enhancing insulin sensitivity. Its expression in white adipose tissue correlates positively with insulin sensitivity, suggesting that it helps sequester triglycerides in adipocytes, preventing ectopic lipid accumulation in other tissues such as the liver and muscle, which can impair insulin signaling (Puri2008Cidea).

In addition to its role in lipid storage, CIDEA is involved in thermogenesis. It regulates the transcription of UCP1, a key gene in thermogenic processes, by interacting with liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) and modulating its activity on the UCP1 promoter-enhancer region. This interaction is crucial for the britening of adipocytes and the maintenance of thermogenic activity (Jash2019CIDEA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CIDEA gene are linked to several metabolic disorders. Changes in CIDEA expression or function are associated with conditions such as obesity, insulin resistance, type II diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Polymorphisms in CIDEA have been specifically linked to metabolic syndrome in humans, suggesting a genetic predisposition influenced by this gene (Jash2019CIDEA). In obese individuals, CIDEA expression in white adipose tissue correlates positively with insulin sensitivity, indicating its potential role in enhancing triglyceride storage and reducing circulating fatty acids, which may protect against insulin resistance (Puri2008Cidea).

CIDEA is also involved in lipid droplet dynamics, and its expression influences lipid droplet size and triglyceride accumulation. Alterations in CIDEA expression can lead to changes in lipid storage, which are implicated in obesity and related metabolic disorders (Puri2008Cidea). The gene's role in lipid droplet fusion and growth is crucial for maintaining adipose tissue mass, and deficiencies in CIDEA, especially when combined with Fsp27 deficiency, result in reduced adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity, highlighting its significance in lipid metabolism and energy balance (Wu2013Cidea).

## Interactions
CIDEA is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in lipid metabolism and apoptosis. It interacts with liver X receptors (LXR), specifically LXRa and LXRb, in white fat cells. This interaction is evidenced by a concentration-dependent decrease in LXR activity when CIDEA is co-transfected, and it is confirmed through pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Kulyté2011CIDEA). CIDEA also forms complexes with other CIDE family proteins, such as CIDEB and CIDEC, which are involved in lipid droplet (LD) fusion and enlargement. These interactions are facilitated by the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of CIDEA, which are crucial for LD docking and the formation of CIDEA-CIDEA complexes (Barneda2015The).

CIDEA interacts with phosphatidic acid (PA) through its C-terminal amphipathic helix, which is essential for lipid droplet fusion and the transfer of triacylglycerol (TAG) molecules between LDs (Barneda2015The). These interactions highlight CIDEA's role in regulating lipid metabolism and energy balance within adipocytes.
