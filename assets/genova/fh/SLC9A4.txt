# SLC9A4

## Overview
The SLC9A4 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 9 member A4, commonly referred to as NHE4, which is a member of the sodium/proton exchanger family. This transmembrane protein plays a critical role in maintaining intracellular pH and cell volume by facilitating the exchange of intracellular hydrogen ions for extracellular sodium ions. NHE4 is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells of the stomach, kidney, and brain, where it contributes to various physiological processes, including acid secretion in the stomach and ammonia excretion in the kidney (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE; Fuster2013Traditional). In the brain, it functions as a sodium sensor, crucial for fluid balance regulation (Sakuta2020SLC9A4). The protein's structure is characterized by 12 membrane-spanning segments and a cytoplasmic C-terminal region, which suggests a regulatory role through phosphorylation and interaction with ancillary factors (Orlowski2004Diversity). NHE4's interactions with other proteins, such as the calcium-binding protein CHP1, further underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Frommelt2024The).

## Structure
The SLC9A4 gene encodes the NHE4 protein, which is a member of the sodium/proton exchanger family. The primary structure of NHE4 consists of 798 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 90 kDa (Pedersen2019The; Fuster2013Traditional). The protein is characterized by 12 conserved membrane-spanning segments at the N-terminus, which is a common feature among members of the SLC9 family (Orlowski2004Diversity). The C-terminal region is hydrophilic and faces the cytoplasm, containing sites for phosphorylation and binding of ancillary factors, indicating a regulatory function (Orlowski2004Diversity).

The NHE4 protein is primarily localized to the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells in the stomach, small intestine, colon, and kidney, as well as in pancreatic zymogen granules (Pedersen2019The; Fuster2013Traditional). The protein's structure is based on homology to the bacterial Na+/H+ exchanger NhaA, suggesting a similar transport domain with two opposing funnel structures facing the intracellular and extracellular surfaces (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE). While specific details on the quaternary structure of NHE4 are not provided, it is suggested that NHEs may form homodimers or higher-order complexes (Orlowski2004Diversity).

## Function
The SLC9A4 gene encodes the NHE4 protein, a sodium/hydrogen exchanger involved in maintaining intracellular pH and cell volume by exchanging intracellular hydrogen ions for extracellular sodium ions. This protein is primarily expressed in epithelial cells of the stomach, kidney, and brain, among other tissues (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE; Fuster2013Traditional). In the stomach, NHE4 is located on the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells, where it is functionally coupled with anion exchanger-2 to maintain cell volume and intracellular ion concentrations necessary for acid secretion (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE). In the kidney, NHE4 plays a critical role in ammonium absorption in the medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, working alongside the apical Na/K/2Cl cotransporter. This function is essential for ammonia recycling and excretion, contributing to acid-base homeostasis (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE; Fuster2013Traditional).

In the brain, particularly in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, SLC9A4 acts as a sodium sensor, regulating water intake by responding to changes in sodium concentration. This role is crucial for maintaining fluid balance in the body (Sakuta2020SLC9A4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC9A4 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. SLC9A4, also known as NHE4, is associated with gastric issues such as stomach inflammation, hypochlorhydria, and gastric necrosis. These conditions are linked to mutations in the gene, which affect the normal function of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger, leading to impaired pH homeostasis and cellular ion balance (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE).

In the context of eczema, a low-frequency missense variant in SLC9A4, rs61731289, has been identified as a potential causal allele. This variant is associated with eczema susceptibility, suggesting that SLC9A4 may play a role in the pathogenesis of this chronic inflammatory skin disease (Grosche2021Rare).

SLC9A4 has also been linked to non-obese asthma in the African American population. Genetic studies have identified SLC9A4 as a gene associated with asthma in individuals without obesity, indicating its potential role in the pathogenesis of asthma in this subgroup (Liu2022Burden).

Additionally, a novel variant in SLC9A4, c.1919G>A, has been associated with pediatric celiac disease, although its statistical significance was not established due to small sample sizes (Balasopoulou2016Novel).

## Interactions
The SLC9A4 gene encodes the NHE4 protein, which is part of the solute carrier family of Na+/H+ exchangers. NHE4 is known to interact with the calcium-binding protein CHP1, which stabilizes its localization at the plasma membrane. This interaction is part of a broader network involving other SLC9A family members, suggesting a role in maintaining the functional integrity of these exchangers at the cellular membrane (Frommelt2024The).

While specific protein-protein interactions involving SLC9A4 are not extensively detailed, the protein is suggested to be functionally coupled with anion exchanger-2 (AE2, SLC4A2) in parietal cells of the stomach. This coupling is thought to be important for maintaining intracellular ion concentrations necessary for acid secretion (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE).

The SLC9A4 protein is also implicated in the renal absorption of NH4+/NH3, working alongside the apical Na/K/2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2, SLC12A1) in the kidney's thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. This interaction is crucial for ammonia excretion and maintaining acid-base balance, particularly during metabolic acidosis (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE).
