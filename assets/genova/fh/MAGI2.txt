# MAGI2

## Overview
MAGI2, or membrane-associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. This protein functions primarily as a scaffold, facilitating the organization and stabilization of protein complexes at cellular junctions. It is characterized by the presence of multiple PDZ, WW, and guanylate kinase-like domains, which enable it to interact with a variety of proteins involved in cellular signaling and structural integrity. MAGI2 plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of synaptic and cellular structures, particularly in neuronal and renal tissues. In the brain, it is involved in synaptic organization and signaling, while in the kidney, it is essential for the function of the glomerular filtration barrier. Additionally, MAGI2 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including congenital nephrotic syndrome, cancer, and cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia (Lehtonen2005Cell; Koide2012Common; Nagashima2015MAGI2SSCAM).

## Structure
MAGI2, also known as membrane-associated guanylate kinase with inverted organization-2, is characterized by the presence of multiple PDZ, WW, and guanylate kinase-like domains. These domains facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for cellular signaling and structural integrity. The PDZ domains, particularly PDZ3 to PDZ5, are essential for binding to the C-terminus of Nephrin, a key interaction for the proper localization of Nephrin in podocytes (Yamada2021MAGI2). Additionally, PDZ domains 1 and 5 are critical for binding to Neph1, highlighting their role in maintaining the stability and localization of slit diaphragm proteins (Yamada2021MAGI2).

MAGI2 is part of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, which is involved in clustering receptors and signaling proteins at specific membrane regions, such as tight and synaptic junctions (Lehtonen2005Cell). The WW domains of MAGI2 interact with sequences in proteins like b-dystroglycan and neuroligin 2, forming complexes at synaptic sites (sumita2007synaptic). These interactions suggest that MAGI2 acts as a scaffold protein, similar to PSD-95, involved in the accumulation of synaptic components at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (sumita2007synaptic). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in cellular adhesion and signaling pathways.

## Function
MAGI2, also known as synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM), is a scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of cell structures in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. It is part of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, which includes MAGI1, MAGI2, and MAGI3. These proteins have a unique arrangement of protein-protein interaction domains, including a guanylate kinase (GK) domain, WW domains, and PDZ domains, which facilitate interactions with various receptors, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling molecules (Nagashima2015MAGI2SSCAM).

In the brain, MAGI2 is involved in synaptic organization, interacting with molecules at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. It is also involved in RhoA signaling, which is crucial for neuronal function (Nagashima2015MAGI2SSCAM). Outside the brain, MAGI2 functions as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing PTEN, a well-known tumor suppressor protein, and is involved in multiple signaling pathways, including the Wnt, TGFβ, and Notch pathways (Nagashima2015MAGI2SSCAM).

In the kidney, MAGI2 is a component of the nephrin multiprotein complex, playing a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the glomerular filtration barrier. It interacts with nephrin and other proteins involved in maintaining the slit diaphragm's integrity, which is essential for kidney function (Lehtonen2005Cell).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAGI2 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS), mutations in MAGI2 disrupt the MAGI2-RapGEF2-Rap1 signaling pathway, leading to podocyte dysfunction and severe glomerulosclerosis. This disruption results in reduced Rap1 activation, causing structural abnormalities and a disorganized actin cytoskeleton in podocytes, which are critical for kidney function (Zhu2019Disruption).

In cancer, MAGI2 acts as a potential tumor suppressor gene. Its promoter methylation and somatic mutations serve as biomarkers for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) diagnosis and prognosis. MAGI2 methylation is also observed in cervical and prostate cancers, where it is associated with decreased mRNA expression, suggesting a role in tumor suppression (Valle2020HIST1H2BB).

The MAGI2 gene is implicated in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Common variants in MAGI2 are associated with increased risk of cognitive deficits, particularly affecting executive function in schizophrenic patients (Koide2012Common).

Additionally, the MAGI2 gene region is linked to celiac disease, with specific polymorphisms affecting intestinal barrier function and increasing disease risk (JauregiMiguel2019MAGI2).

## Interactions
MAGI2, also known as membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted 2, is a scaffolding protein that participates in various protein interactions crucial for cellular function. It interacts with Nephrin and Neph1, key components of the slit diaphragm in podocytes, through its PDZ domains. This interaction is essential for maintaining the localization and function of these proteins, which are critical for the kidney's filtration barrier (Yamada2021MAGI2). MAGI2 also forms a complex with RapGEF2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which is crucial for activating Rap1, a small GTPase involved in podocyte signaling. Disruption of this complex due to MAGI2 mutations leads to podocyte dysfunction and congenital nephrotic syndrome (Zhu2019Disruption).

In the brain, MAGI2 interacts with synapse-associated proteins such as SAPAP/GKAP, NMDA receptors, and neuroligins, playing a key role in synaptic organization (Nagashima2015MAGI2SSCAM). It also stabilizes PTEN, a tumor suppressor, through its PDZ domain, contributing to its tumor suppressive functions (Nagashima2015MAGI2SSCAM). These interactions highlight MAGI2's role in both cellular signaling and structural integrity across different tissues.
