# TCF23

## Overview
TCF23 is a gene that encodes the transcription factor 23, a protein involved in the regulation of gene expression. As a transcription factor, TCF23 plays a crucial role in modulating the transcriptional activity of specific target genes, thereby influencing various cellular processes. The protein is categorized as a transcription factor due to its ability to bind to DNA and regulate the transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA. TCF23 is implicated in several biological pathways and may have significant roles in cellular differentiation and development. Its dysregulation has been associated with various pathological conditions, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
