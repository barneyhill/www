# CSE1L

## Overview
CSE1L, also known as chromosome segregation 1 like, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes such as nuclear transport, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The protein encoded by CSE1L, often referred to as CAS (Cellular Apoptosis Susceptibility), functions primarily as a nuclear transport factor, facilitating the recycling of importin α from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which is essential for the proper localization of proteins necessary for mitosis and genomic stability (Bera2001Cse1l; Behrens2003CSE1LCAS:itsroleinproliferationandapoptosis). CAS is predominantly cytoplasmic but associates with centrioles and the mitotic spindle during cell division, playing a vital role in chromosome alignment and the mitotic spindle checkpoint (Brinkmann1998CAS). The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and its potential implications in cancer progression, where its dysregulation is often observed (Lin2021Nuclear; Cheng2017CSE1L).

## Function
The CSE1L gene, also known as CAS (Cellular Apoptosis Susceptibility), plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, including nuclear transport, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. CSE1L is involved in the nuclear to cytoplasmic reshuffling of importin α, a process essential for the nuclear transport of proteins required for mitosis and apoptosis. This function is critical for recycling importin α from the nucleus to the cytosol, ensuring the proper localization of proteins necessary for cell division and genomic stability (Bera2001Cse1l; Behrens2003CSE1LCAS:itsroleinproliferationandapoptosis).

CSE1L is highly expressed in proliferating cells and is necessary for accurate chromosome alignment during cell division, which is vital for maintaining genomic stability. It is also implicated in the degradation of Cyclin B during mitosis, a key checkpoint in the cell cycle (Behrens2003CSE1LCAS:itsroleinproliferationandapoptosis). The protein is predominantly found in the cytoplasm, associated with microtubules, but during meiosis and mitosis, it associates with centrioles and the mitotic spindle (Brinkmann1998CAS).

In healthy human cells, CSE1L is essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression, playing a significant role in the mitotic spindle checkpoint, which ensures accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis (Behrens2003CSE1LCAS:itsroleinproliferationandapoptosis).

## Clinical Significance
The CSE1L gene, also known as chromosome segregation 1 like, is significantly implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. Overexpression of CSE1L is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive cancer phenotypes. In colorectal cancer, CSE1L is overexpressed in primary tumors compared to normal tissues, and its knockdown reduces cell viability and increases apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Pimiento2016Knockdown; Alnabulsi2012Cellular). In serous ovarian carcinomas, high CSE1L expression correlates with higher tumor grade and adverse outcomes (Jiang2016CAS). Similarly, in endometrial carcinoma, elevated CSE1L levels are linked to shorter patient survival (Jiang2016CAS).

CSE1L is also involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, where it serves as a biomarker for prognosis, and in non-small cell lung cancer, where its expression is linked to metastatic potential (Jiang2016CAS). In thyroid tumors, particularly those with the BRAFV600E mutation, increased CSE1L expression is observed (Jiang2016CAS). Additionally, CSE1L is implicated in pancreatic cancer, where its high expression is associated with worse prognosis and is suggested to regulate cancer proliferation through the AKT signaling pathway (Zhang2021CSE1L). These findings highlight CSE1L's potential as a biomarker and target for cancer therapy.

## Interactions
CSE1L, also known as CAS, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cancer progression and cellular processes. In osteosarcoma cells, CSE1L interacts with the MSH6 protein, a key player in DNA mismatch repair. This interaction stabilizes MSH6 protein levels, promoting osteosarcoma cell proliferation. Knockdown of CSE1L leads to decreased MSH6 protein stability via the proteasome pathway, highlighting the importance of this interaction in tumor progression (Cheng2017CSE1L).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CSE1L interacts with the transcription factor P65, a component of the NF-kB pathway. This interaction stabilizes P65 in the nucleus, enhancing NSCLC cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. CSE1L's role in this context involves modulating the NF-kB/MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumorigenesis (Lin2021Nuclear).

CSE1L also interacts with the protein phosphatase PPM1H in colon adenocarcinoma. PPM1H dephosphorylates CSE1L, potentially regulating cell cycle and proliferation. This interaction suggests a role for CSE1L in modulating cell death and sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli (Sugiura2008Protein).
