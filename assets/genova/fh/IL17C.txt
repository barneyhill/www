# IL17C

## Overview
IL17C is a gene that encodes the protein interleukin 17C, a member of the cytokine family involved in immune responses. Interleukin 17C is primarily produced by epithelial cells, such as keratinocytes and colonic epithelial cells, and plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of epithelial barriers against pathogens. It functions through an autocrine feedback loop, enhancing the expression of tight-junction proteins and contributing to both innate and adaptive immune responses. The protein signals through the IL-17RA/RE receptor complex, activating pathways like MAPK and NF-κB, which lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This signaling is essential for reinforcing epithelial defenses and modulating immune responses, with implications in various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders (Nies2020IL17CIL17RE:; Swedik2021IL17C).

## Function
IL-17C is a cytokine primarily produced by epithelial cells, such as keratinocytes and colonic epithelial cells, and plays a significant role in the immune response. It functions in an autocrine feedback loop with epithelial cells to strengthen innate barriers against infectious agents. This cytokine is involved in reinforcing the mechanical epithelial barrier by inducing the expression of tight-junction proteins like occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-4, which help maintain the integrity of epithelial barriers against pathogens (Nies2020IL17CIL17RE:).

IL-17C signals through the IL-17RA/RE receptor complex, which is expressed on both epithelial and T H 17 cells. This signaling involves the adaptor molecule ACT1, activating pathways such as MAPK and NF-κB, leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Nies2020IL17CIL17RE:). IL-17C also stimulates T H 17 cell function, enhancing the adaptive immune system's ability to combat infections (Nies2020IL17CIL17RE:).

In healthy human cells, IL-17C contributes to host defense mechanisms by inducing the expression of defensins and inflammatory cytokines, which are crucial for both innate and adaptive immune responses (Nies2020IL17CIL17RE:).

## Clinical Significance
IL17C has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of lung cancer, high mRNA expression levels of IL17C are associated with poor overall survival, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker. Although IL17C is not significantly overexpressed in lung cancer, its expression is linked to patient prognosis and involvement in specific signaling pathways, such as the 'TNF receptor signaling pathway' and 'IFN-γ' pathways, which are relevant to lung cancer biology (Liao2019Comprehensive).

IL17C is also involved in inflammatory responses that can enhance cancer cell resistance to PD-1 immunotherapy, indicating that blocking IL17C signaling might improve therapeutic outcomes in certain lung cancer models (Huangfu2023The). The gene's expression is highest in lung tissues compared to other IL-17 family members, and it plays a role in recruiting tumor-associated neutrophils, which can enhance tumor growth (Liao2019Comprehensive).

While IL17C's specific expression and function in lung cancer are not fully elucidated, its involvement in cancer resistance to immunotherapy and its association with poor prognosis highlight its clinical significance in cancer research (Huangfu2023The; Liao2019Comprehensive).

## Interactions
IL-17C interacts with the IL-17RE receptor, forming a complex with IL-17RA, which is essential for its signaling function. This interaction is crucial for the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, which are involved in inflammatory responses (Chang2011Interleukin17C; Nies2020IL17CIL17RE:). The IL-17C/IL-17RE complex employs the adaptor protein Act1, which is necessary for the downstream signaling cascade that leads to the expression of various cytokines and inflammatory mediators (Chang2011Interleukin17C; Nies2020IL17CIL17RE:).

IL-17C is primarily produced by epithelial cells and plays a role in maintaining an autocrine loop that reinforces the epithelial barrier against pathogens. This interaction is significant in both innate and adaptive immune responses, particularly in the context of Th17-driven autoimmunity (Nies2020IL17CIL17RE:; Swedik2021IL17C). IL-17C also interacts with other cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-22, enhancing their mediated expression of inflammatory mediators (Swedik2021IL17C). These interactions highlight the role of IL-17C in modulating immune responses and its potential involvement in autoimmune diseases.
