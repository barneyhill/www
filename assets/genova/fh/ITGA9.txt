# ITGA9

## Overview
The ITGA9 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 9, a critical component of the integrin family of transmembrane receptors that mediate cell adhesion and signaling. Integrin subunit alpha 9 pairs with the beta 1 subunit to form the integrin α9β1 heterodimer, which is involved in diverse biological processes, including cell migration, tissue remodeling, and immune response. Unlike other integrins, α9β1 does not recognize the classic RGD motif but instead binds to alternative sequences, such as Met-Leu-Asp, allowing it to interact with a unique set of ligands, including fibronectin and tenascin-C (Høye2012The; Xu2021Integrinα9β1). The ITGA9 gene is located on chromosome 3p21.3 and has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and congenital chylothorax, due to its role in cellular adhesion and signaling pathways (Ma2008A; Høye2012The). The integrin α9β1's involvement in critical physiological and pathological processes underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in disease management.

## Structure
The ITGA9 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 9, which is a component of the integrin family of transmembrane receptors involved in cell adhesion and signaling. The alpha 9 subunit is composed of 1035 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 114.5 kDa (Xu2021Integrinα9β1). Its structure includes a large N-terminal extracellular domain responsible for ligand binding, a transmembrane segment, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail that interacts with intracellular proteins (Xu2021Integrinα9β1). 

The alpha 9 subunit, along with alpha 4, forms a unique subfamily of integrins that do not recognize the classic RGD motif, distinguishing them from other integrin subfamilies (Xu2021Integrinα9β1). Instead, it recognizes ligands with sequences like Met-Leu-Asp (Høye2012The). Integrin α9β1 interacts with several extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin and tenascin-C, which are involved in processes like wound healing and tumor stroma formation (Høye2012The). 

The ITGA9 gene is located on chromosome 3p21.3 and has been implicated as a potential tumor suppressor, with aberrant expression and methylation associated with various cancers (Høye2012The). The gene's transcriptional regulation involves factors such as TGF-b and NF-kB, which influence its expression and function (Høye2012The).

## Function
Integrin alpha 9 (ITGA9) is a subunit that pairs with beta 1 to form the integrin α9β1, a receptor involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction. This integrin is crucial for the assembly of the fibronectin matrix during lymphatic valve morphogenesis, particularly through its interaction with the EIIIA domain of fibronectin. This interaction is essential for the proper formation of lymphatic valve leaflets, which are necessary for maintaining unidirectional lymphatic flow (Bazigou2009Integrin-α9).

Integrin α9β1 is also involved in mediating cell-cell interactions through binding with the disintegrin domains of ADAM-12 and ADAM-15 in an RGD-independent manner. This interaction supports processes such as myoblast fusion during myogenesis and is crucial for tissue integrity and cellular communication (Eto2000RGDindependent).

In healthy human cells, integrin α9β1 is expressed in various tissues, including smooth muscle, airway epithelia, and immune cells. It plays a role in recruiting immune cells to inflammatory sites and is implicated in processes like vascular remodeling and cartilage remodeling (Eto2000RGDindependent). The integrin's activation status is crucial for its interactions, similar to its role in adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins (Eto2000RGDindependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ITGA9 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In cancer, ITGA9 is implicated in various types, including breast, lung, and colorectal cancers. It is often downregulated or methylated, contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis. In breast cancer, ITGA9 is a marker of the basal-like subtype and is associated with reduced metastasis-free survival (Høye2012The). In lung cancer, ITGA9 downregulation is linked to the progression of adenocarcinoma (Anedchenko2008Downregulation). 

In congenital chylothorax, a severe condition characterized by the accumulation of lymphatic fluid, a recurrent missense mutation in ITGA9 has been identified in human fetuses, suggesting a genetic basis for the disease. This mutation is associated with poor response to prenatal therapy and may follow an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (Ma2008A).

ITGA9 is also involved in the pathogenesis of acute aortic dissection (AAD). It is significantly downregulated in AAD, affecting the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells, which is crucial for the disease's development (Huang2020Integrin). These findings highlight ITGA9's role in various pathological conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
Integrin α9β1, encoded by the ITGA9 gene, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cell adhesion and signaling. It forms a heterodimer with the β1 subunit and interacts with several ligands, including tenascin-C (TNC), osteopontin (OPN), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (Høye2012The; Staniszewska2008Integrin). In cancer, ITGA9 interacts with TNC and ADAM12, supporting cell migration and contributing to processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Xu2021Integrinα9β1). 

In autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, ITGA9 binds to TNC and OPN, facilitating intracellular signaling that contributes to inflammation (Xu2021Integrinα9β1). The integrin also interacts with nerve growth factor (NGF), activating signaling pathways involving Erk1/2 and paxillin, which regulate cell migration and proliferation (Staniszewska2008Integrin). 

ITGA9's interaction with ADAM proteins, such as ADAM2, is significant in processes like sperm-egg binding and fusion (Desiderio2010ADAM2). The integrin also binds to the EIIIA domain of fibronectin, promoting filopodia formation through Cdc42 activation (Høye2012The). These interactions highlight ITGA9's diverse roles in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
