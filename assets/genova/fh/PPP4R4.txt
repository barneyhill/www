# PPP4R4

## Overview
The PPP4R4 gene encodes the protein phosphatase 4 regulatory subunit 4, which is a crucial component of the protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) complex. This protein is categorized as a regulatory subunit, playing a pivotal role in modulating the activity of the PP4 complex. The PP4 complex is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic integrity. The regulatory subunit encoded by PPP4R4 is integral to the precise control of these processes, ensuring that the PP4 complex functions correctly in response to cellular signals. Dysregulation of PPP4R4 has been associated with pathological conditions such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PPP4R4 gene, which encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. PPP4R4 plays a critical role in cellular processes such as DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. Disruptions in these processes due to changes in PPP4R4 can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, contributing to the development of cancer. Additionally, improper regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle can result in neurodegenerative conditions, where cell death and dysfunction are prevalent. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which PPP4R4 alterations contribute to these diseases is essential for developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Research into PPP4R4's involvement in disease mechanisms continues to be a significant area of interest, as it holds potential for novel interventions in conditions where its normal function is compromised.
