# NEFM

## Overview
The NEFM gene encodes the neurofilament medium chain (NF-M), a crucial component of the neuronal cytoskeleton, specifically categorized as an intermediate filament protein. This protein plays a vital role in the structural integrity and function of myelinated axons in vertebrates. NF-M is integral to the assembly of neurofilaments, which are essential for maintaining axonal caliber, promoting axonal growth, and supporting the organization of cytoplasmic organelles within neurons (Perrot2008Review; CamposMelo2018Dysregulation). The NEFM gene's expression and regulation are critical for normal neuronal function, and its dysregulation is implicated in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer (CamposMelo2018Dysregulation; Li2021NEFM).

## Structure
The neurofilament medium chain (NEFM) protein is a critical component of the neuronal cytoskeleton, characterized by a tripartite structure. Its primary structure includes a central α-helical rod domain, approximately 310 amino acids in length, flanked by non-helical head and tail domains (Perrot2008Review). The rod domain facilitates the formation of coiled-coil structures, essential for the assembly of neurofilaments (Perrot2008Review).

The secondary structure of NEFM is dominated by α-helices within the rod domain, which are crucial for its structural integrity (Perrot2008Review). The tertiary structure involves the coiled-coil motifs that allow NEFM to dimerize with other neurofilament proteins, such as neurofilament light (NFL) and neurofilament heavy (NFH), forming heteropolymers (Perrot2008Review).

In terms of quaternary structure, NEFM participates in the assembly of intermediate filaments by forming coiled-coil dimers with NFL or NFH, which then align into tetramers and mature into 10-nm filaments (Perrot2008Review). The tail domain of NEFM contains multiple lysine-serine-proline (KSP) repeats, which are heavily phosphorylated, a post-translational modification crucial for neurofilament assembly and stability (Perrot2008Review). This phosphorylation is regulated by various kinases, including cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and microtubule-associated protein (MAP) kinases (Perrot2008Review).

## Function
The NEFM gene encodes the medium molecular weight neurofilament protein (NF-M), a critical component of neurofilaments in vertebrate myelinated axons. Neurofilaments are the most abundant cytoskeletal elements in these axons and play a crucial role in determining axonal caliber, promoting axonal growth, and forming a three-dimensional lattice that supports the organization of cytoplasmic organelles (CamposMelo2018Dysregulation). In healthy human cells, the post-transcriptional control of NEFM mRNA is essential for maintaining normal levels of neurofilament proteins, which is vital for promoting axonal outgrowth, controlling axon caliber, and preventing the formation of neurofilament aggregates that can lead to axonal degeneration and neuronal death (CamposMelo2018Dysregulation).

The stability of NEFM mRNA is regulated by various factors, including miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, ensuring the correct stoichiometry of neurofilament subunits, which is essential for normal neuronal function (CamposMelo2018Dysregulation). NEFM is primarily active in the axon, contributing to the stability and function of the neuronal cytoskeleton, impacting nerve cell communication and overall nervous system integrity (Szaro2010Posttranscriptional). The proper regulation of NEFM mRNA stability ensures the maintenance of healthy neurons and the proper functioning of axons (CamposMelo2018Dysregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the NEFM gene are implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In breast cancer, NEFM acts as an onco-suppressor, with its transcriptional expression being downregulated and negatively correlated with DNA methylation. This methylation-mediated inactivation is common in primary breast tumors and is associated with poor survival outcomes. The silencing of NEFM through DNA methylation is linked to an aggressive cancer phenotype, affecting cell proliferation and correlating with a worse prognosis (Calmon2015Epigenetic; Li2021NEFM).

In neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dysregulation of NEFM mRNA stability is observed. ALS-linked miRNAs downregulate NEFM mRNA levels, leading to increased NEFM protein levels, which contribute to the formation of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. These inclusions are neuropathological markers in ALS and may disrupt axonal transport, impairing neuronal survival (CamposMelo2018Dysregulation).

NEFM is also involved in adrenal gland function, where it regulates aldosterone secretion. In conditions like aldosterone-producing adenomas, NEFM expression affects the responsiveness to dopamine, influencing aldosterone production and potentially contributing to hypertension (Maniero2017NEFM).

## Interactions
The NEFM (neurofilament medium chain) protein is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. In human adrenal tissues, NEFM interacts with the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R), where it plays a role in inhibiting D1R-mediated aldosterone secretion. This interaction is significant in zona glomerulosa cells of the adrenal gland, where NEFM facilitates the desensitization and internalization of D1R, thereby attenuating adenylate cyclase activation and reducing aldosterone secretion (Maniero2017NEFM).

In neuronal contexts, NEFM interacts with the D1 dopamine receptor, specifically binding to the third cytoplasmic loop of the receptor. This interaction affects the receptor's cell surface expression and desensitization. Overexpression of NEFM in HEK293 cells leads to reduced D1 receptor binding activity and promotes receptor accumulation in intracellular compartments, suggesting a role in receptor trafficking or internalization. NEFM also negates agonist-induced desensitization of the D1 receptor, potentially by modulating receptor phosphorylation or preventing association with regulatory proteins like β-arrestin (Kim2002NeurofilamentM). These interactions highlight NEFM's role in modulating receptor function and signaling pathways.
