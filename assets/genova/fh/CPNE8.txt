# CPNE8

## Overview
CPNE8 is a gene that encodes the protein copine 8, a member of the copine family, which is characterized by its calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding properties. Copine 8 is a multifunctional protein that plays a role in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking and signal transduction, due to its ability to interact with phospholipids and other proteins. Structurally, copine 8 contains two C2 domains and a von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain, which facilitate its calcium-dependent membrane association and protein-protein interactions (Goel2019Differential; Khvotchev2024Copines). The gene has been studied for its potential involvement in prion diseases, where it may influence disease progression and incubation time, although its precise role remains to be fully understood (Mead2019Genetic; Lloyd2009A). Further research is necessary to elucidate the full spectrum of CPNE8's functions and its implications in human health and disease.

## Structure
CPNE8, a member of the copine family, is characterized by a conserved structure comprising two C2 domains (C2A and C2B) at the N-terminus and a von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain at the C-terminus. The C2B domain is crucial for calcium-dependent membrane association, while the C2A domain is considered dispensable (Khvotchev2024Copines). The protein has a molecular weight of approximately 63,108 Da and consists of 564 amino acids. The domain boundaries for CPNE8 are C2A (T24-E152), C2B (D158-T294), and VWA (Q307-R542) (Khvotchev2024Copines).

The 3D structure of CPNE8 is described as butterfly-like, with the C2 domains forming 'wings' and the VWA domain forming the 'body'. This arrangement suggests a unique mode of calcium-activated membrane interaction (Khvotchev2024Copines). The VWA domain contains a MIDAS motif for divalent metal binding, which may induce structural changes (Khvotchev2024Copines). CPNE8 is involved in calcium-dependent binding to phospholipids and protein-protein interactions, facilitated by its C2 and VWA domains (Goel2019Differential). Alternative splicing generates various isoforms of Copine proteins, though the specific effects on CPNE8's function are not clear (Khvotchev2024Copines).

## Clinical Significance
The CPNE8 gene has been investigated for its potential role in prion diseases, particularly in relation to prion disease incubation time in mice. Research has identified CPNE8 as a candidate quantitative trait gene for prion disease incubation time, suggesting it may be involved in key pathways related to the disease's pathogenesis (Lloyd2009A). A study found that CPNE8 mRNA is upregulated at the terminal stage of prion disease, indicating its potential involvement in disease progression (Lloyd2009A). However, in vitro studies using the scrapie cell assay did not find significant results for CPNE8, suggesting it may not have a strong association with prion disease susceptibility in this context (Brown2014In).

Despite these findings, the precise role of CPNE8 in prion disease remains unresolved. The gene encodes a member of the copine family, which are calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins, potentially involved in prion protein trafficking (Mead2019Genetic). While CPNE8 has been linked to prion disease in mice, its clinical significance in humans and other conditions remains to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to clarify its role and potential implications in neurological disorders.
