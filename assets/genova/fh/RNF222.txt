# RNF222

## Overview
RNF222 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 222, which is a member of the RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain, a specialized type of zinc finger that facilitates protein-protein interactions, particularly in the ubiquitination pathway. The ubiquitination process is crucial for regulating protein degradation, signal transduction, and various cellular processes. The RNF222 gene is involved in tagging specific proteins for degradation by the proteasome, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating diverse biological functions. Although the precise biological roles of RNF222 are still being elucidated, its involvement in protein ubiquitination suggests it may play a role in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and response to stress (Qiu2020aarFDC).
