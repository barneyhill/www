# VPS33A

## Overview
VPS33A is a gene that encodes the VPS33A protein, a core subunit of the CORVET and HOPS complexes, which are integral to vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion processes in eukaryotic cells. The VPS33A protein belongs to the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) family and plays a pivotal role in the tethering and docking of vesicles, facilitating SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. This protein is particularly involved in the fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes, as well as autophagosomes with lysosomes, thereby contributing to cellular degradation pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Wartosch2015Recruitment; Graham2013Structural). Mutations in the VPS33A gene have been linked to severe systemic disorders, underscoring its essential function in lysosomal trafficking and cellular health (Kondo2016Mutation; Dursun2017A).

## Structure
The VPS33A protein is a member of the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) family and is a core subunit of the HOPS complex, which is involved in vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion. Structurally, VPS33A adopts an SM-like fold, despite having less than 20% sequence identity with other known SM proteins (Graham2013Structural). The protein consists of three domains, with a flexible hinge connecting the N-terminal domain 1 to the C-terminal domains 2 and 3 (Graham2013Structural). Domain 3b of VPS33A is particularly important for its interaction with Vps16, another component of the HOPS complex, and this interaction is crucial for the recruitment of VPS33A to the HOPS complex (Graham2013Structural).

VPS33A lacks a pocket for binding the N-terminal peptides of Qa-SNAREs, a feature that distinguishes it from other SM proteins (Wartosch2015Recruitment; Graham2013Structural). This structural characteristic suggests a unique role in SNARE-mediated membrane fusion, as it can bind assembled SNARE complexes instead (Graham2013Structural). The interaction with Vps16 involves specific residues, and mutations in these residues can disrupt the binding, affecting the protein's function in vesicle trafficking (Wartosch2015Recruitment; Graham2013Structural).

## Function
VPS33A is a critical component of the CORVET and HOPS complexes, which are involved in membrane trafficking processes in eukaryotic cells. These complexes facilitate the fusion of vesicles with target membranes, playing a vital role in endosomal and lysosomal trafficking. VPS33A is recruited to the HOPS complex by VPS16, which is essential for the fusion of endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes, a process crucial for cellular degradation pathways (Wartosch2015Recruitment).

In healthy human cells, VPS33A is involved in the tethering and docking of vesicles, a step preceding SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. It interacts with SNARE complexes, facilitating the fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes, as well as autophagosomes with lysosomes (Wartosch2015Recruitment; Graham2013Structural). This activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by ensuring the proper degradation of macromolecules and organelles (Wartosch2015Recruitment).

VPS33A is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in endosomal and lysosomal compartments, where it contributes to the regulation of vesicle-mediated transport and cellular degradation processes (Hunter2018Proteomic). Its function is essential for the proper functioning of the endocytic and autophagic pathways, impacting cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VPS33A gene are associated with a novel type of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), characterized by severe systemic symptoms. The specific mutation c.1492C > T (p.Arg498Trp; p.R498W) has been identified in patients from the Yakut population, leading to symptoms such as coarse facial features, skeletal abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, respiratory problems, and mental retardation. These patients exhibit massive accumulation of heparan sulfate (HS) and increased urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels, along with additional symptoms not typical of conventional MPS, such as heart, kidney, and hematopoietic disorders, often resulting in a fatal outcome between 1 and 2 years of age (Kondo2016Mutation).

The mutation in VPS33A affects lysosomal functions, leading to lysosomal over-acidification and disruption of GAG metabolism, which contributes to the MPS-like phenotype (Kondo2016Mutation). In another study, a homozygous p.R498W mutation in VPS33A was linked to a probable new syndrome with a storage disease phenotype, involving respiratory difficulties, renal involvement, developmental delay, and severe anemia (Dursun2017A). These findings highlight the critical role of VPS33A in maintaining normal lysosomal function and its involvement in severe multisystem disorders when mutated.

## Interactions
VPS33A is a core subunit of the CORVET and HOPS complexes, playing a crucial role in endosomal and lysosomal trafficking. It interacts with several proteins, including VPS16 and VPS18, which are essential for its recruitment to the HOPS complex and proper localization to target membranes (Hunter2017Proteomic; Wartosch2015Recruitment). The interaction between VPS33A and VPS16 is particularly critical, as it facilitates the fusion of endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes. Mutations in either VPS33A or VPS16 that disrupt this interaction can inhibit lysosomal fusion processes (Wartosch2015Recruitment).

VPS33A also interacts with components of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KC3) complexes, such as PIK3C3 (Vps34), PIK3R4 (Vps15), and NRBF2, indicating its involvement in membrane trafficking processes (Hunter2017Proteomic). In the context of autophagy, VPS33A regulates SNARE protein interactions, particularly with Stx17, SNAP29, and VAMP7. This regulation is mediated by a novel interaction motif that acts as a master-switch, controlling the inhibition and promotion of these interactions (Saleeb2017A). The phosphorylation status of Stx17 influences its interaction with VPS33A, affecting SNARE complex formation and autophagosome clearance (Saleeb2019A).
