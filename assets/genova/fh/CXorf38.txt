# CXorf38

## Overview
CXorf38 is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the protein known as chromosome X open reading frame 38. This protein is not yet fully characterized in terms of its specific biological function or classification into a well-defined protein category such as kinase or receptor. However, emerging research suggests that CXorf38 may play a role in various physiological and pathological processes, including its potential involvement in genetic syndromes and cancer prognosis. The gene's expression appears to be influenced by micronutrient levels, particularly in the context of ZIP8 malfunction, and it may escape X-chromosome inactivation, leading to sex-biased expression patterns (Zhang2011Transcriptional; Tan2022Singlegene). These characteristics make CXorf38 a subject of interest for further investigation in the fields of genetics and disease research.

## Clinical Significance
CXorf38, located on the X chromosome, has been implicated in various conditions due to its altered expression or potential involvement in genetic syndromes. In the context of ZIP8 malfunction, CXorf38 is significantly downregulated, suggesting its expression may be influenced by essential micronutrients such as manganese and selenium. This downregulation is associated with imbalanced intracellular micronutrient levels, which could have implications in diseases related to ZIP8 malfunction, including certain cancers (Tan2022Singlegene).

In bladder cancer, CXorf38 has been identified as a prognostic gene, with its expression being evaluated for potential roles in cancer prognosis and development (Chen2020Evaluating). Additionally, CXorf38 is mentioned in the context of a novel intellectual disability syndrome characterized by digital abnormalities and short stature, suggesting it may be a candidate gene for further investigation in this X-linked recessive disorder (Barboza‐Cerda2013A).

CXorf38 also shows female-biased expression in the liver, indicating it may escape X-chromosome inactivation, which could contribute to sex-biased differences in liver function or disease susceptibility (Zhang2011Transcriptional). Its involvement in sex-related differences is further supported by its potential role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Lin2019Sexrelated).
