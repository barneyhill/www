# TPSAB1

## Overview
The TPSAB1 gene encodes tryptase alpha/beta 1, a serine protease predominantly expressed in mast cells. This enzyme plays a critical role in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune response modulation and tissue remodeling. Tryptase alpha/beta 1 is involved in the formation of tetrameric complexes, which are essential for its enzymatic activity. These complexes can be homotetramers or heterotetramers, with the latter exhibiting unique functional properties due to the presence of both alpha and beta tryptase subunits. The gene's expression and the resulting protein activity are implicated in several clinical conditions, such as hereditary alpha-tryptasemia (HaT), characterized by elevated serum tryptase levels and associated symptoms. The TPSAB1 gene's role in immune regulation and its involvement in conditions like systemic mastocytosis and anaphylaxis underscore its clinical significance (Lyons2021Heritable; Le2019Impact).

## Structure
The TPSAB1 gene encodes tryptase alpha/beta 1, a serine protease primarily found in mast cells. The primary structure of tryptase consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure is a compact, globular form stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining the enzyme's active conformation (Lyons2021Mast).

The quaternary structure of tryptase involves the formation of tetramers, which are the active form of the enzyme. These tetramers are stabilized by the acidic environment and heparin glycosaminoglycan in mast cell granules. The tetramer has a toroidal shape, with each protomer stabilizing its neighbor (Lyons2021Mast). 

Post-translational modifications of tryptase may include glycosylation, which can affect its stability and activity. The TPSAB1 gene can produce different isoforms through alternative splicing, resulting in alpha- and beta-tryptases. Alpha-tryptase lacks catalytic activity due to specific amino acid substitutions, while beta-tryptase is enzymatically active (Lyons2021Inherited). These isoforms can form heterotetramers with distinct functional properties, such as increased stability and expanded peptidolytic activity (Lyons2021Inherited).

## Function
The TPSAB1 gene encodes for tryptase alpha/beta 1, a serine protease predominantly expressed in mast cells and, to a lesser extent, basophils. In healthy human cells, TPSAB1 contributes to the formation of tryptase tetramers, which are stored in the secretory granules of mast cells and released upon cell activation (Le2019Impact). These tetramers, particularly those containing beta-tryptase, are active proteases involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of protease-activated receptors like PAR2 (Le2019Impact).

Alpha-tryptase, although lacking significant protease activity, can form heterotetramers with beta-tryptase, which have unique functional properties. These heterotetramers can activate PAR2 and make mast cells susceptible to vibration-triggered degranulation (Le2019Impact). The presence of alpha-tryptase subunits in heterotetrameric tryptases may contribute to their stability and expanded peptidolytic activity at physiological concentrations (Lyons2021Inherited).

Tryptases are involved in fibroblast and smooth muscle proliferation, extracellular matrix digestion, recruitment of eosinophils and neutrophils, stimulation of nerve and epithelial cells, and promotion of angiogenesis (Lyons2021Inherited). These processes are crucial for tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, nerve stimulation, and smooth muscle contractility (Glover2021Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TPSAB1 gene, which encodes tryptase alpha/beta 1, are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to increased copy numbers of the gene. Hereditary alpha-tryptasemia (HaT) is a notable condition linked to elevated baseline serum tryptase levels resulting from increased TPSAB1 gene copies. This autosomal dominant disorder affects approximately 3% to 7% of the population and is characterized by symptoms such as dysautonomia, gastrointestinal dysmotility, joint hypermobility, chronic pain, and a high prevalence of atopic conditions (Glover2021Clinical; Le2019Impact).

HaT is also associated with systemic mastocytosis and severe anaphylaxis, particularly from Hymenoptera venom. Patients with HaT often exhibit severe mediator-related symptoms, including vascular instability and anaphylaxis, independent of clonal mast cell burden (Lyons2021Heritable; Greiner2021Hereditary). The presence of HaT can complicate the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis, as it affects serum tryptase levels, a diagnostic criterion for the disease (Glover2021Clinical).

The TPSAB1 gene's increased copy number is a genetic biomarker for severe symptoms in mastocytosis and is linked to a higher risk of anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions (Greiner2021Hereditary).

## Interactions
The TPSAB1 gene encodes tryptase alpha/beta 1, a serine protease primarily found in mast cells, which participates in various protein interactions. Tryptase forms tetramers, which are enzymatically active complexes composed of either homotetramers or heterotetramers. The heterotetramers, consisting of both alpha and beta tryptase protomers, exhibit unique functional properties compared to homotetramers. These heterotetramers can activate protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2), a receptor involved in increasing vascular permeability, which may contribute to the severity of anaphylaxis and other clinical phenotypes associated with hereditary alpha-tryptasemia (HaT) (Lyons2021Heritable; Le2019Impact).

Tryptase alpha/beta 1 also interacts with the EMR2 protein on mast cells. The heterotetramers cleave EMR2α, facilitating mast cell degranulation when mechanical force is applied, a process relevant to vibratory urticaria observed in HaT (Le2019Impact). These interactions highlight the role of TPSAB1-encoded tryptases in modulating immune responses and contributing to various pathological conditions. The gene's involvement in forming complexes with other proteins underscores its significance in immune regulation and inflammation (Le2019Impact).
