# RTF2

## Overview
RTF2 is a gene that encodes the replication termination factor 2 protein, which plays a pivotal role in DNA replication and genomic stability. The protein is involved in the regulation of replication fork stability and restart, primarily by facilitating the removal of ribonucleotides embedded in DNA through its interaction with RNase H2. This function is crucial for maintaining normal replication speed and preventing DNA damage, thereby ensuring genomic stability (Conti2024RTF2). RTF2 is also implicated in replication repriming and ribonucleotide excision at the replisome, and its presence is necessary for efficient replication restart following fork stalling (Conti2024RTF2). Additionally, RTF2 interacts with various proteins, including PRIM1, and is involved in a regulatory pathway with DDI1/2 proteins, which influences replication stress responses and cellular proliferation (Conti2024RTF2). The gene's role extends to clinical significance, where its deficiency is linked to developmental issues, cancer, and immune response to viral infections (Suo2020NRIP3; Chia2020Loss).

## Function
The RTF2 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in DNA replication, particularly in the regulation of replication fork stability and restart. RTF2 is essential for the proper localization of RNase H2 to the replisome, which is crucial for the removal of ribonucleotides embedded in newly replicated DNA. This process is vital for maintaining normal replication speed and preventing DNA damage, thereby ensuring genomic stability (Conti2024RTF2).

RTF2 is involved in replication repriming and ribonucleotide excision at the replisome, facilitating the removal of ribonucleotides from DNA. This function is essential for maintaining genomic stability during DNA replication and is dynamically regulated by DDI proteins (Conti2024RTF2). The presence of RTF2 at replication forks is necessary for efficient replication restart following fork stalling, as it coordinates with RNase H2 and PRIM1 to manage replication stress (Conti2024RTF2).

In the absence of RTF2, cells exhibit slow replication fork speeds, increased genomic ribonucleotide load, and indicators of DNA damage, such as poly-ADP-ribosylation and γH2AX phosphorylation, highlighting its role in preventing replication-dependent DNA damage (Conti2024RTF2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the RTF2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. RTF2 is essential for DNA replication and cellular proliferation, and its deficiency can lead to developmental issues and cellular proliferation defects (Conti2024RTF2). In the context of cancer, RTF2 is involved in managing replication stress, and its removal is crucial for replication fork restart during DNA damage reactions. The NRIP3-PPARα-DDI1-RTF2 axis has been identified as a protective molecular pathway in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), where NRIP3 upregulation confers resistance to chemoradiotherapy by accelerating the removal of RTF2 (Suo2020NRIP3).

RTF2 also plays a role in the immune response to viral infections. Its loss enhances influenza virus replication, suggesting that RTF2 may act as a restriction factor affecting the influenza polymerase complex activity. RTF2 deficiency leads to lower induction of interferon-stimulated genes and reduced phosphorylation of STAT1, impairing the interferon-induced antiviral response (Chia2020Loss). These findings highlight the importance of RTF2 in both genomic stability and immune defense, with potential implications for understanding diseases related to replication stress and viral infections.

## Interactions
RTF2 interacts with several proteins and plays a crucial role in DNA replication and repair processes. It is essential for the proper localization of RNase H2 to the replisome, facilitating the removal of ribonucleotides embedded in DNA. This interaction is critical for maintaining normal replication speed and genome stability (Conti2024RTF2). RTF2 also interacts with PRIM1, a component of DNA polymerase α-primase, which is involved in replication restart processes. During replication stress, RTF2 and RNase H2 influence PRIM1-dependent restart, and their removal from stalled replication forks is necessary for efficient replication restart (Conti2024RTF2).

RTF2's interaction with RNase H2 is part of a regulatory pathway that includes the DDI1/2 proteins. In DDI1/2-competent cells, RTF2 is removed from stalled replication forks, aiding efficient restart. Conversely, in DDI1/2-depleted cells, RTF2 and RNase H2 are retained at stalled forks, opposing PRIM1 activity and slowing restart (Conti2024RTF2). Additionally, RTF2 is involved in a complex with NRIP3 and DDI1, which facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of RTF2, aiding in replication fork recovery and contributing to chemoradiotherapy resistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Suo2020NRIP3).
