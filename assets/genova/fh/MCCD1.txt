# MCCD1

## Overview
The MCCD1 gene encodes the mitochondrial coiled-coil domain 1 protein, which is integral to mitochondrial function. This protein is characterized by a coiled-coil domain at its C-terminus, a structural motif often involved in mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting its potential role in structural or signaling pathways within the mitochondria (Semple2003A). The protein is targeted to the mitochondria through an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, which is crucial for its proper localization (Semple2003A). MCCD1 is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the kidney and liver, indicating its possible significance in these organs (Semple2003A). The gene exhibits high polymorphism, with several single nucleotide polymorphisms that may influence protein function (Semple2003A). While the precise biological role of MCCD1 remains to be fully elucidated, its mitochondrial localization and structural features imply a role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity or function.

## Function
The MCCD1 gene encodes a coiled-coil mitochondrial protein that plays a role in mitochondrial function. This protein is localized to mitochondria, as demonstrated by its colocalization with MitoTracker dye in Cos-7 cells, indicating its involvement in mitochondrial processes (Semple2003A). The protein contains a coiled-coil domain at its C-terminus, which is a common feature for protein-protein interactions, suggesting that MCCD1 may participate in structural or signaling roles within the mitochondria (Semple2003A). The N-terminal region of MCCD1 includes a mitochondrial targeting sequence, essential for its localization to the mitochondria, as the N-terminal tag can interfere with this targeting (Semple2003A).

MCCD1 is expressed in various human tissues, with the highest levels observed in both fetal and adult kidney tissues, followed by fetal liver, indicating its potential importance in these organs (Semple2003A). The gene is highly polymorphic, with several single nucleotide polymorphisms identified, some of which result in nonsynonymous changes that could affect protein function (Semple2003A). While the exact function of MCCD1 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its mitochondrial localization and coiled-coil domain suggest a role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity or function (Semple2003A).
