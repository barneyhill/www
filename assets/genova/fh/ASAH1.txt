# ASAH1

## Overview
The ASAH1 gene encodes the enzyme N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 1, commonly known as acid ceramidase, which is a lysosomal enzyme involved in the metabolism of sphingolipids. This enzyme plays a critical role in hydrolyzing ceramide into sphingosine and free fatty acids, thus maintaining the balance of these bioactive lipids that regulate various cellular processes, including apoptosis, differentiation, and inflammation (Li1999The; Duarte2020Elusive). Acid ceramidase is categorized as a lysosomal hydrolase and is essential for cellular homeostasis, with its activity being optimal at acidic pH levels (Lucki2012Acid). The enzyme is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with particularly high levels in the heart and kidneys, underscoring its importance in normal physiological functions (Li1999The; Duarte2020Elusive). Mutations in the ASAH1 gene are associated with rare genetic disorders such as Farber disease and spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy, highlighting its clinical significance (Yu2018Acid; Zhou2012Spinal).

## Structure
The ASAH1 gene encodes acid ceramidase, a lysosomal enzyme involved in sphingolipid metabolism. The enzyme is initially synthesized as a precursor form of 53-55 kDa and is transported to the lysosome via the mannose-6-phosphate pathway. In the lysosome, it undergoes autoproteolytic processing into a non-glycosylated α-subunit (13-14 kDa) and a glycosylated β-subunit (40 kDa), which are linked by a disulfide bridge at Cys143 (Alves2013Molecular; Lucki2012Acid). The enzyme's activity is optimal at acidic pH, classifying it as an acid ceramidase (Lucki2012Acid).

ASAH1 is a glycoprotein, indicating that it undergoes glycosylation as a post-translational modification (Lucki2012Acid). The enzyme's structure includes specific domains that facilitate its enzymatic activity, although detailed information on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures is not provided in the context. The enzyme's function is modulated by sphingolipid activator proteins, primarily SAP-D, which are necessary for its maximal activity (Lucki2012Acid). The ASAH1 protein is also involved in nuclear processes, where it interacts with steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) to regulate gene transcription (Lucki2012Acid).

## Function
The ASAH1 gene encodes the enzyme acid ceramidase, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of sphingolipids by hydrolyzing ceramide into sphingosine and free fatty acid within the lysosomal compartment of cells (Li1999The; Duarte2020Elusive). This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining the balance between ceramide and sphingosine, which are key regulators of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and inflammation (Duarte2020Elusive). 

In healthy human cells, acid ceramidase activity is vital for preventing the accumulation of ceramide, a lipid molecule that can induce apoptosis and senescence (Sugano2019Overexpression; Alves2013Molecular). By converting ceramide to sphingosine, which can be further phosphorylated to form sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), acid ceramidase helps promote cell survival and proliferation, as S1P is known for its cytoprotective properties (Sugano2019Overexpression; Duarte2020Elusive). 

The enzyme is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with particularly high expression in the heart and kidneys, indicating its significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological processes (Li1999The; Duarte2020Elusive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ASAH1 gene, which encodes the enzyme acid ceramidase, are linked to several rare disorders, primarily Farber disease and spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME). Farber disease is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by subcutaneous nodules, joint pain, and hoarseness, often leading to early mortality. It results from the accumulation of ceramide due to deficient acid ceramidase activity, affecting multiple organs, including the liver, spleen, lungs, heart, and nervous system (Elsea2020ASAH1; Yu2018Acid; Zhou2012Spinal).

SMA-PME is marked by progressive muscle weakness, myoclonic epilepsy, and cognitive decline, typically manifesting in early childhood and leading to severe disability or death in adolescence. This condition is also caused by ASAH1 mutations, which result in reduced acid ceramidase activity and subsequent ceramide accumulation, primarily affecting the central nervous system (Rubboli2015Spinal; Zhou2012Spinal).

The ASAH1 gene has also been implicated in keloid formation, with certain variants associated with susceptibility to this condition, suggesting a potential role in skin fibrosis (SantosCortez2017Identification). Research is ongoing to explore therapeutic approaches, including gene therapy and enzyme replacement therapy, for these ASAH1-related disorders (Elsea2020ASAH1; Yu2018Acid).

## Interactions
ASAH1, also known as acid ceramidase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence gene transcription and cellular signaling. In H295R human adrenocortical cells, ASAH1 interacts directly with the steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), a nuclear receptor that regulates gene transcription. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays and is crucial for ASAH1's ability to repress SF-1-dependent gene transcription by binding to SF-1 (Lucki2012Acid). The interaction involves specific nuclear receptor-binding motifs within ASAH1, with the NR1 motif being particularly important for this repressive function (Lucki2012Acid).

ASAH1's interaction with SF-1 is modulated by coregulatory proteins such as SMRT and SRC-1. SMRT reduces the interaction, while SRC-1 facilitates it. ASAH1 inhibits SRC-1's ability to enhance SF-1-dependent promoter activity and enhances the repressive activity of SMRT (Lucki2012Acid). The catalytic activity of ASAH1, specifically its ceramidase activity, is necessary for its corepressive function, as demonstrated by the use of a ceramidase inhibitor that prevents ASAH1 from suppressing SF-1 activity (Lucki2012Acid).

In melanoma cells, ASAH1 influences cell migration and phenotype transition through the ITGαVβ5/FAK signaling cascade, where its silencing increases FAK phosphorylation and integrin beta 5 expression, promoting cell migration (Leclerc2018Lysosomal).
