# GABRA5

## Overview
The GABRA5 gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit alpha5, a critical component of the GABA A receptor, which is a ligand-gated chloride ion channel. This receptor is integral to inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system, facilitating rapid neuronal inhibition through chloride ion influx upon activation by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (Badalotti2024Gene). The alpha5 subunit is particularly prominent in the hippocampus, where it plays a significant role in synaptic transmission and plasticity, influencing cognitive functions such as learning and memory (Mulligan2012Complex). As a transmembrane receptor, the alpha5 subunit is involved in both tonic and phasic inhibition, interacting with various proteins to form complex receptor assemblies (Chen2024Proteome). Its involvement in specific GABAergic microcircuits and its association with neurological conditions such as epilepsy and anxiety disorders underscore its importance in maintaining normal brain function and its potential as a therapeutic target (Gataullina2019Gene; Lukow2021Cellular).

## Structure


## Function
The GABRA5 gene encodes the alpha5 subunit of the GABA A receptor, which is a ligand-gated chloride ion channel involved in mediating inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. This receptor plays a crucial role in rapid neuronal inhibition by facilitating chloride ion influx upon activation by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), leading to membrane hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability (Badalotti2024Gene). The alpha5 subunit is particularly significant in the hippocampus, where it influences synaptic transmission and plasticity, thereby affecting cognitive functions such as learning and memory (Mulligan2012Complex).

GABRA5 is co-expressed with the interneuron marker somatostatin (SST), suggesting its involvement in specific GABAergic microcircuits that regulate inhibitory neurotransmission (Lukow2021Cellular). The spatial distribution of GABRA5, along with other subunits, is associated with the binding of the GABA PET radiotracer [11C]Ro15-4513, indicating its role in the organization of GABAergic microcircuits in the brain (Lukow2021Cellular). This subunit is also implicated in the regulation of anxiety and depressive disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal brain function and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Lukow2021Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GABRA5 gene, which encodes the α5 subunit of the GABA A receptor, have been associated with several neurological conditions. In the context of epilepsy, mutations in GABRA5 are linked to the disorder, as the gene plays a crucial role in rapid neuronal inhibition in the brain (Badalotti2024Gene). Additionally, in Angelman syndrome, a chromosomal deletion can lead to haploinsufficiency of GABRA5, contributing to the epileptic phenotype observed in many patients with this condition (Gataullina2019Gene).

In brain tumors, particularly medulloblastoma, increased levels of GABRA5 have been observed in the aggressive Group 3 molecular subgroup. Experimental activation of GABA A receptors containing the α5-subunit has been shown to reduce cell survival in medulloblastoma, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Badalotti2024Gene). While the role of GABRA5 in gliomas is not explicitly detailed, the study indicates that higher expression of certain GABA A receptor subunits is generally associated with better prognosis, implying that down-regulation of these receptors may contribute to tumor progression (Badalotti2024Gene). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GABRA5 in various neurological and oncological conditions.

## Interactions
The GABRA5 gene encodes the alpha5 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, which is involved in inhibitory neurotransmission. The alpha5 subunit is known to interact with various proteins, forming part of complex receptor assemblies. In the hippocampus, the alpha5 subunit is predominantly found in extrasynaptic locations and is involved in tonic inhibition. It interacts with activated radixin, which facilitates receptor binding to cytoskeletal elements, receptor clustering, and recruitment (Chen2024Proteome). During early circuit development, alpha5-containing GABA-A receptors cluster at synaptic sites where they interact with Gephyrin (Gphn) and mediate phasic inhibition (Chen2024Proteome).

The alpha5 subunit also forms complexes with other GABA-A receptor subunits, such as alpha1, which is more abundant in the hippocampus compared to the olfactory bulb (Chen2024Proteome). In the olfactory bulb, the alpha5 subunit interacts with different subunits, including alpha3, beta3, and delta, indicating region-specific subunit compositions (Chen2024Proteome). The interaction with Neuroligin 2 (Nlgn2) is noted to be higher in the olfactory bulb, suggesting a role in synaptic adhesion and receptor clustering (Chen2024Proteome).
