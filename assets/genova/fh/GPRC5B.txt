# GPRC5B

## Overview
GPRC5B is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor class C group 5 member B, a member of the family C G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane α-helices, a common feature of GPCRs, and is involved in various cellular processes, including vascular regulation, lymphangiogenesis, and metabolic signaling (BräunerOsborne2000Sequence; Carvalho2020Orphan). As an orphan receptor, GPRC5B's endogenous ligand remains unidentified, yet it plays a significant role in modulating signaling pathways in smooth muscle cells, lymphatic endothelial cells, and adipocytes (Kim2012GPRC5B; Xu2022Orphan). The receptor's interactions with proteins such as Caveolin-1 and the tyrosine kinase Fyn highlight its involvement in complex signaling networks that influence inflammation and insulin resistance, with implications for conditions like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and certain neurological disorders (Passchier2024Megalencephalic; Kim2018Caveolin1).

## Structure
The GPRC5B protein is a member of the family C G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and is characterized by a short amino-terminal domain (ATD) of 53 amino acids, including a signal peptide cleaved between amino acids 19 and 20 (BräunerOsborne2000Sequence). The protein sequence includes seven transmembrane α-helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, and shows significant homology to other family C GPCRs, such as mGluR2 and RAIG1, with 26% and 33% sequence identity in the transmembrane domain, respectively (BräunerOsborne2000Sequence).

GPRC5B lacks the cysteine-rich region found in some other family C receptors and does not have consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation or potential palmitoylation sites, suggesting these post-translational modifications are uncommon (Kurtenbach2011Molecular). The protein contains conserved hydrophilic residues and non-transmembrane residues typical of family C GPCRs (BräunerOsborne2000Sequence). A conserved motif, WV(V/A)W, is present in TM6, aligning with motifs in other class C GPCRs, although the PKXY motif typical of class C GPCRs is absent (Kurtenbach2011Molecular).

Two splice variants of GPRC5B have been identified: GPRC5B v1, which is ubiquitously expressed, and GPRC5B v2, which is exclusively expressed in the brain (Sano2011Comparative).

## Function
The GPRC5B gene encodes a class C orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). In SMCs, GPRC5B negatively regulates prostacyclin receptor (IP) signaling, which is crucial for controlling vascular tone and differentiation. This regulation affects SMC contractility and differentiation, playing a role in conditions like arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis by modulating IP receptor signaling pathways (Carvalho2020Orphan).

In the context of lymphatic development, GPRC5B is essential for the proliferation and viability of LECs. Its expression is critical for normal lymphangiogenesis, particularly in the heart during the postnatal period. Knockdown of GPRC5B in human LECs leads to decreased cell proliferation and viability, highlighting its role in maintaining lymphatic function (Xu2022Orphan).

GPRC5B is also involved in metabolic regulation and inflammatory signaling in adipocytes. It interacts with the tyrosine kinase Fyn, enhancing its activity and contributing to obesity-associated inflammatory signaling. This interaction is crucial for processes like insulin signaling and inflammatory responses in adipocytes (Kim2012GPRC5B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GPRC5B gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of obesity and type 2 diabetes, GPRC5B is involved in inflammatory signaling in adipocytes. Its deficiency in mice leads to reduced inflammation in white adipose tissue, protecting against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance (Kim2012GPRC5B). GPRC5B overexpression in adipocytes increases the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, promoting macrophage infiltration and contributing to insulin resistance (Kim2012GPRC5B).

In pancreatic islets, GPRC5B acts as a negative modulator of insulin secretion. Its upregulation in individuals with type 2 diabetes is associated with reduced insulin secretion and beta-cell viability, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of diabetes (Soni2013GPRC5B).

GPRC5B has also been linked to neurological conditions. Dominant variants in GPRC5B are associated with megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC), a genetic brain disorder characterized by macrocephaly and motor problems. These variants are specific amino acid duplications in the fourth transmembrane domain of the receptor (Passchier2024Megalencephalic).

## Interactions
GPRC5B interacts with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular signaling pathways. It is primarily localized in membrane rafts and interacts with Caveolin-1 (Cav1) in the plasma membrane. This interaction is resistant to certain detergents but can be disrupted by sodium dodecyl sulfate. The interaction between GPRC5B and Cav1 is significant as Cav1 can inhibit GPRC5B-mediated NF-kB signaling by blocking GPRC5B phosphorylation. The cytoplasmic tail of GPRC5B directly interacts with the C-terminal domain of Cav1, suggesting a specific protein-protein interaction mechanism that does not involve typical caveolin-binding motifs (Kim2018Caveolin1).

GPRC5B also interacts with the tyrosine kinase Fyn, a member of the Src family kinases. This interaction is mediated through the SH2 domain of Fyn, which specifically binds to the phosphorylated C terminus of GPRC5B. The phosphorylation of GPRC5B, particularly at tyrosine residue 383, is crucial for this interaction, enhancing Fyn's kinase activity and promoting NF-kB signaling in adipocytes (Kim2012GPRC5B).

In addition, GPRC5B modulates the intracellular trafficking and membrane localization of the prostacyclin IP receptor. It physically interacts with the IP receptor, affecting its membrane abundance and co-localizing with it in intracellular regions such as the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (Carvalho2020Orphan).
