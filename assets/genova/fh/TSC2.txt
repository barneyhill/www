# TSC2

## Overview
The TSC2 gene encodes the protein tuberin, which is a critical component of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a tumor suppressor complex that plays a significant role in regulating cell growth and proliferation. Tuberin functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and is involved in the inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The TSC2 protein interacts with TSC1, forming a stable complex that modulates various signaling pathways, including those related to energy and oxygen sensing. Mutations in the TSC2 gene are associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of benign tumors in multiple organs. These mutations can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including neurological and renal complications, highlighting the gene's importance in human health (Rosset2017TSC1; Curatolo2015GenotypePhenotype; Huang2008The).

## Structure
The TSC2 gene encodes the protein tuberin, which is a crucial component of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) involved in regulating cell growth. Tuberin consists of 1807 amino acids and features several distinct domains, including a C-terminal GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain that is homologous to the Rap1/Rab5 GAP catalytic domains (Sudarshan2019Decoding). This GAP domain is responsible for the hydrolysis of GTP, a critical function for the regulation of the small GTPase Rheb, thereby influencing mTORC1 signaling (Hansmann2020Structure).

The protein's structure includes a series of HEAT repeats forming a right-handed superhelical fold, with the N-terminal and C-terminal HEAT repeats contributing to its overall conformation (Yang2020Structural). The TSC2 protein forms a pseudo-symmetric dimer through its dimerization domains, which are characterized by antiparallel β-sheets and flanking α-helices (Yang2020Structural). The GAP domain itself adopts a mixed α/β fold, with a central β-sheet surrounded by α-helices (Yang2020Structural).

Tuberin interacts with TSC1, forming a stable complex that is essential for its function. This interaction is mediated through multiple contacts, including the central region of TSC1 and various HEAT repeats of TSC2 (Yang2020Structural). The TSC2 protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its localization and function (Yang2020Structural).

## Function
The TSC2 gene encodes tuberin, a protein that forms a complex with hamartin, encoded by TSC1. This TSC1-TSC2 complex acts as a critical regulator of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is essential for controlling cell growth and proliferation. In healthy human cells, the TSC1-TSC2 complex functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the small G-protein Rheb, converting Rheb-GTP to Rheb-GDP, thereby inhibiting mTORC1 activity (Huang2008The; Inoki2002TSC2). This inhibition is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing excessive cell growth and tumor formation (Huang2008The).

TSC2 is involved in several signaling pathways, including those related to energy and oxygen sensing. Under conditions of energy depletion, TSC2 is phosphorylated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), enhancing its activity to inhibit mTORC1 and conserve energy (Huang2008The; Inoki2003TSC2). TSC2 also plays a role in cellular responses to hypoxia, where it is involved in the regulation of mTOR activity through the hypoxia-inducible gene REDD1 (Brugarolas2004Regulation). These functions highlight TSC2's role in integrating various environmental signals to regulate cell growth and energy balance.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TSC2 gene are associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of benign tumors, or hamartomas, in multiple organs, including the brain, skin, kidneys, and heart. TSC2 mutations are more prevalent than TSC1 mutations and are often linked to more severe clinical manifestations (Sancak2005Mutational; Niida1999Analysis). These mutations can lead to neurological complications such as epilepsy, cognitive impairments, autism, and other behavioral disorders (Rosset2017TSC1). 

TSC2 mutations are also associated with renal manifestations, including angiomyolipomas and renal cystic disease, which can be severe and lead to complications (Curatolo2015GenotypePhenotype). The TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene syndrome results in early-onset polycystic kidney disease (Curatolo2015GenotypePhenotype). Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, are more common in patients with TSC2 mutations (Curatolo2015GenotypePhenotype). 

Alterations in TSC2 expression or its interactions can affect the mTOR signaling pathway, leading to deregulated cell growth and proliferation, which contributes to tumorigenesis (Rosset2017TSC1). The TSC2 gene's role as a tumor suppressor is further evidenced by its involvement in conditions like lymphangioleiomyomatosis and renal angiomyolipomas (Rosset2017TSC1).

## Interactions
TSC2, also known as tuberin, interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that regulate various cellular processes. TSC2 forms a complex with TSC1, known as the tuberin-hamartin complex, which is crucial for regulating cell growth and preventing hamartomatous growths associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (Nellist2001TSC2). This complex is phosphorylated at multiple sites, including T1462 by AKT, which inhibits its function by sequestering it in the cytosol away from its substrate RHEB (HoogeveenWesterveld2012The).

TSC2 also interacts with AMPK, particularly through its C-terminal domain, which is enhanced by treatment with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). This interaction is crucial for the dephosphorylation of S6K in response to ATP depletion, indicating that TSC2 acts downstream of AMPK in the signaling pathway (Inoki2003TSC2).

TSC2 interacts with Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), forming a stable complex in cells. The death domain of DAPK is crucial for this interaction, and DAPK can phosphorylate TSC2, disrupting the TSC1-TSC2 complex and acting as a positive effector of mTORC1 signaling (Stevens2009Peptide).

TSC2 also interacts with Cyclin B1, retaining it in the cytoplasm during the G2/M transition, which delays mitotic onset. This interaction is independent of the Tuberin GAP domain and is influenced by phosphorylation states (Fidalgo2022Beyond).
