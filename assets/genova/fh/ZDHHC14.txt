# ZDHHC14

## Overview
ZDHHC14 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 14, a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyl acyltransferases. This protein is characterized by the presence of a conserved DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) cysteine-rich domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity in transferring palmitate to substrate proteins. As an integral membrane protein, ZDHHC14 is predominantly localized to the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a significant role in the palmitoylation of neuronal proteins such as PSD93 and Kv1-family potassium channels. This post-translational modification is essential for the proper localization and function of these proteins, particularly in the axon initial segment, a critical area for neuronal excitability and signal transmission. The protein's structure includes transmembrane domains and a PDZ ligand, facilitating interactions with other proteins and contributing to its role in modulating neuronal function (Liao2024The; Sanders2020The).

## Structure
ZDHHC14 is a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyl acyltransferases, characterized by the presence of a conserved DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) cysteine-rich domain. This domain is crucial for the enzyme's palmitoyltransferase activity, facilitating the transfer of palmitate to substrate proteins. The DHHC domain is predicted to have zinc ion binding capacity, forming a zinc finger motif that is important for the structural integrity of the protein, although zinc is not directly involved in catalysis (Liao2024The; Korycka2012Human).

ZDHHC14 is an integral membrane protein, typically localized to the Golgi apparatus, and is involved in the palmitoylation of proteins such as PSD93 and Kv1-family potassium channels. The protein includes predicted transmembrane domains, which are common among DHHC family members, allowing it to embed in cellular membranes (Sanders2020The).

The C-terminal region of ZDHHC14 contains a PDZ ligand, which is essential for substrate recognition and interaction with proteins like PSD93. This interaction is crucial for the palmitoylation and subcellular targeting of its substrates (Sanders2020The). The molecular structure of ZDHHC14, including its transmembrane domains and catalytic DHHC domain, supports its role in modulating neuronal excitability through the palmitoylation of key neuronal proteins (Sanders2020The).

## Function
ZDHHC14 is a palmitoyl acyltransferase that plays a crucial role in the palmitoylation of proteins, a post-translational modification that affects protein localization, stability, and function. In neurons, ZDHHC14 is predominantly localized to the Golgi apparatus, where it palmitoylates substrates such as Kv1 family potassium channels and the scaffold protein PSD93. This palmitoylation is essential for the proper targeting and clustering of these proteins at the axon initial segment (AIS), a critical region for neuronal excitability and signal transmission (Sanders2020The).

ZDHHC14 interacts with PSD93 in a PDZ ligand-dependent manner, facilitating the localization of Kv1 channels to the AIS. The loss of ZDHHC14 results in decreased outward potassium currents and increased neuronal excitability, highlighting its role in modulating neuronal function (Sanders2020The). Although ZDHHC14 is not directly associated with neuropathological conditions, its intolerance to loss of function mutations in humans underscores its essential role in maintaining neuronal function (Sanders2020The). The evolutionary conservation of ZDHHC14 and its substrates suggests its importance in the complex regulation of nervous systems (Sanders2020The).

## Clinical Significance
ZDHHC14 has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) and prostate cancer, ZDHHC14 is identified as a tumor suppressor gene, with its expression significantly down-regulated. This down-regulation is associated with increased tumorigenesis, as overexpression of ZDHHC14 in cell lines leads to decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway (Yeste‐Velasco2014Identification). In contrast, ZDHHC14 is upregulated in acute biphenotypic leukemia and subsets of acute myeloid leukemia, particularly in cases with the t(6;14) translocation. This upregulation is linked to the inhibition of cellular differentiation, suggesting a role in leukemogenesis (Yu2010Activation).

In preeclampsia, reduced methylation of the ZDHHC14 gene leads to its decreased expression, which is associated with impaired trophoblast cell proliferation and invasion, contributing to the pathophysiology of the condition (Zhu2018Reduced). Additionally, ZDHHC14 plays a role in neurological conditions by regulating the clustering of Kv1-family potassium channels at the axon initial segment, with dysregulation potentially contributing to disorders characterized by neuronal hyperexcitability (Sanders2020The).

## Interactions
ZDHHC14 interacts with the scaffold protein PSD93, a member of the Membrane-associated Guanylate Kinase (MaGUK) family, which is crucial for the clustering of Kv1-family potassium channels at the axon initial segment (AIS) in neurons. This interaction is mediated through a PDZ ligand-dependent mechanism, where ZDHHC14's C-terminal PDZ ligand (LSSV) binds to the PDZ3 domain of PSD93. This binding is essential for the palmitoylation and proper localization of PSD93 to the AIS, which in turn facilitates the clustering of Kv1 channels (Sanders2020The).

Although Kv1 channels do not directly bind to ZDHHC14, they possess Type-I PDZ ligands that interact with PSD93, suggesting that PSD93 acts as a scaffold for ZDHHC14 to regulate the palmitoylation and targeting of Kv1 channels. This interaction is crucial for maintaining neuronal excitability and proper ion channel function at the AIS (Sanders2020The).

ZDHHC14 is predominantly localized to the Golgi apparatus, indicating that it palmitoylates its substrates, including PSD93, earlier in their trafficking route before they reach the AIS (Sanders2020The).
