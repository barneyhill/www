# PIGQ

## Overview
The PIGQ gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class Q protein, which is a pivotal component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis pathway. This pathway is essential for the formation of GPI anchors, which are glycolipids that tether proteins to the cell membrane, facilitating their proper localization and function. The PIGQ protein is involved in the initial steps of GPI biosynthesis, particularly in stabilizing the enzyme complex necessary for this process, although it is not an essential component of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex (Wu2020The; Johnstone2020Early). The activity of PIGQ occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a critical role in the assembly of GPI anchors, impacting various cellular functions such as embryogenesis, cell signaling, and neurogenesis (Zanni2021PIGQRelated; Starr2019PIGQ). Defects in the PIGQ gene can lead to severe developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular processes and organismal outcomes (Johnstone2020Early).

## Structure


## Function
The PIGQ gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis pathway. This pathway is essential for the formation of GPI anchors, which are glycolipids that tether proteins to the cell membrane. PIGQ is specifically involved in the first step of GPI biosynthesis, where it stabilizes the enzyme complex necessary for this process, although it is not considered an essential component of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex (Wu2020The; Johnstone2020Early).

In healthy human cells, PIGQ contributes to the proper synthesis and attachment of GPI anchors to proteins, which is critical for their correct localization and function on the cell surface. These GPI-anchored proteins play significant roles in various cellular functions, including embryogenesis, cell signaling, immune response, and neurogenesis (Johnstone2020Early; Starr2019PIGQ). The activity of PIGQ occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it participates in the initial steps of GPI anchor assembly (Zanni2021PIGQRelated). The proper functioning of PIGQ is vital for maintaining normal cellular processes and organismal outcomes, as defects in this gene can lead to severe developmental disorders (Johnstone2020Early).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGQ gene are associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, a severe neurological disorder characterized by epileptic seizures, global developmental delay, hypotonia, and multiple congenital anomalies. Patients with PIGQ variants often experience a range of seizure types, including severe syndromes like epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS) (Johnstone2020Early). These mutations can lead to impaired expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs), which are crucial for various cellular functions. The impaired expression can be partially or fully reversed in vitro by introducing wild-type PIGQ cDNA, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach (Johnstone2020Early).

The phenotypic spectrum of PIGQ-related disorders is broad, with affected individuals exhibiting symptoms such as cortical visual impairment, facial dysmorphisms, and mild hearing deficits. MRI findings often show progressive cortical volume loss and myelination issues (Johnstone2020Early). Gastrointestinal issues, including chronic constipation and bowel obstruction, have also been observed, potentially linked to the gut-brain axis, which may explain the co-occurrence of digestive and neurological symptoms (Fitzsimmons2024Phenotypic).

PIGQ is part of the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway, and defects in this pathway can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, affecting intellectual development and causing seizures (Knaus2018Characterization).

## Interactions
PIGQ is a component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis pathway, where it plays a role in the N-acetylglucosamine transferase complex. This complex is crucial for the initial step of GPI biosynthesis, which is essential for anchoring proteins to the cell membrane. PIGQ interacts with other proteins in this pathway, including PIGA, PIGC, and PIGH, forming a multiprotein complex that facilitates the transfer of GPI to proteins (Liu2021A; Starr2019PIGQ). 

Although PIGQ is not considered an essential component of the GPI-GnT complex, it stabilizes the enzyme complex, allowing for some surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins even in PIGQ-defective cells (Wu2020The). The interactions within this complex are critical for the proper functioning of the GPI biosynthesis pathway, which is involved in various cellular processes, including embryogenesis and neurogenesis (Zanni2021PIGQRelated). 

The role of PIGQ in the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway highlights its importance in maintaining the stability and function of the enzyme complex, ensuring the proper anchoring and trafficking of proteins necessary for cell function (Liu2021A).
