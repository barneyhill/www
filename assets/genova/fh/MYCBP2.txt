# MYCBP2

## Overview
The MYCBP2 gene encodes the MYC binding protein 2, a large E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in neuronal development and function. This protein is characterized by its unique RING-Cys-Relay (RCR) mechanism, which is essential for its ubiquitin transfer activity and involvement in neurodevelopmental processes such as synaptic growth and axon guidance (Sampathkumar2010Structures; Mabbitt2020Structural). MYCBP2 is highly expressed in both peripheral and central neurons, where it regulates key signaling pathways, including cAMP and p38 MAPK, influencing synaptogenesis and neuronal outgrowth (Pierre2017Myc; Holland2011Regulation). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as the MYC oncoprotein and ROBO2, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer (James2013The; Venza2016miR92a3p).

## Structure
The MYCBP2 protein, also known as MYC binding protein 2, is a large E3 ubiquitin ligase with a complex molecular structure. It features a unique RING-Cys-Relay (RCR) mechanism, which is essential for its function in neurodevelopment and axon maintenance. The RCR domain includes a RING finger domain linked to a Tandem Cysteine (TC) domain, which contains two catalytic cysteine residues crucial for its ubiquitin transfer activity (Mabbitt2020Structural). The RING domain of MYCBP2 adopts a canonical interface with E2 enzymes, but with distinct molecular contacts that are critical for its function (Mabbitt2020Structural).

The protein also contains PHR domains, which exhibit a novel β-sandwich fold composed of 11 anti-parallel β-strands, forming three anti-parallel β-sheets. These domains are important for the protein's localization and function, particularly in synaptic growth and axon guidance (Sampathkumar2010Structures). The PHR domains do not possess catalytic activity but may play a structural role in protein interactions (Sampathkumar2010Structures).

MYCBP2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, which are vital for its activity. The protein has multiple splice variant isoforms, which can influence its function and interactions (Mabbitt2020Structural).

## Function
MYCBP2, also known as Myc binding protein 2, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in neuronal development and function. It is involved in several molecular processes, including the regulation of signaling pathways such as cAMP, mTOR, and p38 MAPK, which are crucial for synaptic growth, neuronal transmission, and cytoskeletal processes (Pierre2017Myc). MYCBP2 is highly expressed in both peripheral and central neurons, where it influences synaptogenesis and neuronal outgrowth by modulating pathways like cAMP and p38 MAPK (Holland2011Regulation).

In the context of axon guidance, MYCBP2 is essential for maintaining the proper topography of olfactory sensory axons in the olfactory bulb. It interacts genetically with ROBO2 to regulate axon guidance, ensuring correct innervation patterns in the olfactory system (James2013The). MYCBP2's role in axon guidance may involve regulating the turnover of axon guidance receptors, contributing to the maintenance of dorsal identity in olfactory sensory neurons (James2013The).

MYCBP2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, highlighting its broad impact on cellular and organismal biology (Pierre2017Myc).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MYCBP2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, MYCBP2 is involved in the regulation of c-myc, a well-known oncogene. In melanoma cells, MYCBP2 upregulation is necessary for enhancing c-myc's ability to repress c-FLIP, promoting apoptosis and increasing sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (Venza2016miR92a3p). In colon cancer, MYCBP2 is targeted by miR-1247, which acts as a tumor suppressor. High MYCBP2 expression is associated with worse survival in colorectal cancer patients, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis (Liang2018Epigenetically).

In thyroid cancer, high MYCBP2 expression correlates with better prognosis and a higher predicted response rate to immune checkpoint inhibitors, indicating its potential as a biomarker for immunotherapy outcomes (Wang2022MYCBP2). MYCBP2 mutations are also more prevalent in adolescent and young adult colon cancer compared to adult cases, suggesting a potential association with this condition (Tricoli2017A).

Despite its involvement in various cancers, MYCBP2 does not show a significant association with autism spectrum disorder, as studies have not found an over-representation of causal variants in MYCBP2 among affected individuals (Bahl2013Lack).

## Interactions
MYCBP2, also known as MYC binding protein 2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It interacts with the MYC oncoprotein, influencing transcriptional regulation and cellular processes (Venza2016miR92a3p). MYCBP2 is part of a complex with FBXO45, which targets the tumor suppressor protein FBXW7 for degradation during mitotic arrest. This interaction is significant for regulating mitotic cell fate and preventing mitotic slippage, which can lead to chemoresistance (Richter2018FBXO45MYCBP2).

In the context of axon guidance, MYCBP2 interacts with ROBO2, a receptor involved in neural development. This interaction is essential for maintaining the topography of olfactory sensory axons in the mouse olfactory system. MYCBP2 regulates the expression of ROBO2, affecting axon guidance and the proper targeting of olfactory sensory neurons (James2013The).

Structurally, MYCBP2 forms a RING-E2 interface that is crucial for its ubiquitin relay activity. This interaction involves specific residues that facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin, highlighting the unique mechanism of MYCBP2 compared to other E3 ligases (Mabbitt2020Structural).
