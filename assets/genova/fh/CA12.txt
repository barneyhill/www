# CA12

## Overview
The CA12 gene encodes the enzyme carbonic anhydrase XII (CAXII), a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of pH and ion transport across epithelial cells. This enzyme is part of the carbonic anhydrase family, which is characterized by its zinc-binding domain essential for catalyzing the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. CAXII is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the kidney, pancreas, and salivary glands, where it facilitates bicarbonate and fluid secretion, thereby maintaining electrolyte balance and systemic pH homeostasis (Waheed2017Carbonic). The protein's involvement in various physiological processes is underscored by its interactions with other proteins, such as the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger AE2 and aquaporin 5, which are crucial for fluid homeostasis (Hwang2018Carbonic; Hong2015Essential). Mutations in CA12, such as the E143K mutation, have been linked to clinical conditions like hyperchlorhidrosis and certain forms of cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Feldshtein2010Hyperchlorhidrosis; Zamanova2019Carbonic).

## Structure
The CA12 gene encodes a 354-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 39,448 Da. The protein is a type I membrane protein, featuring a 29-amino acid signal sequence, a 261-amino acid carbonic anhydrase (CA) domain, a short extracellular segment, a 26-amino acid hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a 29-amino acid C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Pastorekova2006Tumor‐associated). The CA domain includes three zinc-binding histidine residues, essential for its catalytic activity, and two potential sites for asparagine glycosylation (Ivanov1998Downregulation; Pastorekova2006Tumor‐associated).

The tertiary structure of CA12 is characterized by a nearly identical active site structure to CA II and CA IV, with a zinc ion located at the bottom of the active site cleft (Pastorekova2006Tumor‐associated). The quaternary structure of CA12 is distinct as it forms a dimer in solution and in the crystal (Aggarwal2012Structural; Pastorekova2006Tumor‐associated). The protein is a one-pass transmembrane CA with extracellular amino and intracellular carboxy termini (Ivanov1998Downregulation). The cytoplasmic domain shares 50% identity with the cytoplasmic domain of the CA9 gene product (Ivanov1998Downregulation).

## Function
The CA12 gene encodes the enzyme carbonic anhydrase XII (CAXII), which is a membrane-associated enzyme involved in the regulation of pH and ion transport in epithelial cells. CAXII plays a crucial role in the hydration and dehydration of carbon dioxide, contributing to bicarbonate (HCO3−) and proton homeostasis. This enzyme is expressed in various tissues, including the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells in the kidney, pancreas, and salivary glands, where it facilitates fluid and bicarbonate secretion (Waheed2017Carbonic).

CAXII is involved in the activation of the ductal Cl−-HCO3− exchanger AE2, which is essential for bicarbonate and fluid secretion in secretory epithelia. It enhances the activity of AE2 by generating HCO3− near the transport site, thus playing a significant role in maintaining electrolyte balance and fluid secretion in secretory glands (Hong2015Essential). The enzyme's activity is crucial for processes such as maintaining systemic and cellular pH, cell volume, and preventing tissue dehydration (Hong2015Essential).

Mutations in CA12, such as the E143K mutation, can disrupt its function, leading to impaired fluid secretion and altered electrolyte concentrations, which can result in conditions like dry mouth and altered sweat composition (Hong2015Essential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CA12 gene, which encodes carbonic anhydrase XII, are associated with several clinical conditions. A notable mutation, Glu143Lys, has been linked to hyperchlorhidrosis, a disorder characterized by excessive sweating. This mutation increases the enzyme's sensitivity to inhibition by anions, such as chloride, bromide, and iodide, and is thought to alter the hydrogen bonding network near the catalytic center (Feldshtein2010Hyperchlorhidrosis). The same mutation is also associated with a novel autosomal recessive form of isolated salt wasting in sweat, leading to severe infantile hyponatremic dehydration, hyperkalemia, and high sweat chloride concentration (Muhammad2010Autosomal).

Alterations in CA12 expression levels are linked to various cancers. In breast cancer, higher CA XII expression is associated with lower-grade tumors and better prognosis, while in brain tumors, it correlates with poor prognosis (Zamanova2019Carbonic). CA XII is also overexpressed in renal cell carcinomas, particularly clear cell type, suggesting a role in tumor pathogenesis (Türeci1998Human). Additionally, CA XII expression is regulated by hypoxia and estrogen, further implicating its role as a tumor marker (Waheed2017Carbonic).

## Interactions
Carbonic anhydrase 12 (CA12) is involved in various interactions with other proteins, influencing its function in cellular processes. CA12 is known to interact with the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger AE2, forming a metabolon that enhances bicarbonate transport, which is crucial for fluid homeostasis in epithelial cells (Waheed2017Carbonic; Hong2015Essential). The CA12 E143K mutation affects this interaction by reducing AE2 activity, leading to impaired fluid secretion (Hong2015Essential).

In the context of breast cancer, CA12 interacts with P-glycoprotein (Pgp) at the cell surface, contributing to multidrug resistance by altering the pH environment optimal for Pgp activity (Franke2019TFAP2C). This interaction highlights CA12's role in cancer cell survival and drug resistance.

CA12 also interacts with aquaporin 5 (AQP5) in salivary glands, where the CA12 E143K mutation leads to mislocalization of AQP5, affecting its expression and function in water permeability (Hwang2018Carbonic). Although no direct physical interaction between CA12 and AQP5 was observed, CA12's role in regulating AQP5 expression suggests an indirect interaction through intracellular pH modulation (Hwang2018Carbonic).
