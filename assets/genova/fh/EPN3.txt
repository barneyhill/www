# EPN3

## Overview
EPN3 is a gene that encodes the protein epsin 3, a member of the epsin family of endocytic adaptor proteins. Epsin 3 is characterized by its role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, where it facilitates the internalization of membrane proteins and lipids by binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and ubiquitinated cargo. The protein contains an Epsin N-Terminal Homology (ENTH) domain, ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs), and clathrin-binding motifs (CBMs), which are essential for its function in membrane curvature and vesicle formation (Ko2010Selective; Sen2012The). Epsin 3 is particularly significant in gastric parietal cells, where it is involved in the regulation of stomach pH through the trafficking of H/K ATPase-containing vesicles (Ko2010Selective). Beyond its physiological roles, EPN3 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where its overexpression is associated with enhanced cell migration, invasion, and poor prognosis (Wu2021Epsin).

## Structure
Epsin 3 (EPN3) is a member of the epsin protein family, characterized by its involvement in endocytosis and signaling. The molecular structure of EPN3 includes an Epsin N-Terminal Homology (ENTH) domain, which is conserved across the epsin family. This domain binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, a lipid found in the plasma membrane, and induces membrane curvature, facilitating the formation of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles (Sen2012The). 

EPN3 also contains ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) that bind ubiquitinated cargo, and clathrin-binding motifs (CBMs) that interact with the clathrin heavy chain. These motifs are crucial for the protein's role in endocytosis, allowing it to coordinate the recruitment of ubiquitinated cargo proteins with the formation of clathrin-coated pits (Ko2010Selective; Sen2012The). 

The C-terminal region of EPN3 is unstructured and contains binding motifs for clathrin, AP2, ubiquitin, and EH domains, which are essential for its localization and function at endocytic sites (Madhivanan2020MOLECULAR). EPN3 is known to undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions (Li2024Lowering).

## Function
Epsin 3 (EPN3) is a ubiquitin-binding endocytic adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in the endocytosis process within gastric parietal cells. These cells are specialized for acid secretion in the stomach and are characterized by their apical canaliculi, where epsin 3 is highly concentrated. Epsin 3 is localized at clathrin-coated pits of these canaliculi, suggesting its involvement in the endocytosis of the apical membrane, which is essential for the regulation of stomach pH through the trafficking of H/K ATPase-containing vesicles (Ko2010Selective).

In healthy human cells, epsin 3 coordinates bilayer curvature acquisition with coat recruitment and cargo selection, facilitating vesicle formation. It is enriched and colocalized with clathrin around apical canaliculi, indicating its role in the specialized traffic and membrane remodeling processes typical of gastric parietal cells. Although epsin 3 knockout mice did not exhibit major defects in gastric function, the elevated levels of EHD1 and EHD2 proteins in these mice suggest a compensatory mechanism, highlighting epsin 3's functional interplay with other proteins in the endocytic pathway (Ko2010Selective).

## Clinical Significance
EPN3 (epsin 3) has been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to alterations in its expression levels. In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) subtypes, EPN3 is significantly upregulated. This overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis, mediated through the NF-κB signaling pathway. High EPN3 expression correlates with shorter overall survival and recurrence-free survival in breast cancer patients, suggesting its role in poor prognosis and potential as a therapeutic target (Wu2021Epsin).

In glioblastoma, EPN3 overexpression enhances cell migration and invasion by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This process involves the upregulation of transcription factors such as Slug, Twist, and ZEB1, and the activation of Notch and WNT/β-catenin signaling pathways. These changes contribute to the aggressive behavior of glioblastoma cells, indicating EPN3 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in glioma treatment (Wang2018Overexpression).

EPN3 also plays a role in the regulation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. It negatively regulates HBV RNA levels, suggesting a potential antiviral function. EPN3 expression is induced in response to HBV replication, and its knockdown leads to increased HBV RNA levels, highlighting its role in the host's antiviral response (Li2022Interferonalpha).

## Interactions
EPN3 (epsin 3) is known to participate in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in endocytosis and cellular processes. EPN3 interacts with clathrin and adaptor protein complexes, such as AP-2, facilitating the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, which are essential for endocytosis (Spradling2001Epsin; Ko2010Selective). The protein contains DPW motifs that bind clathrin AP-2 and NPF motifs that interact with Eps15, indicating its involvement in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Spradling2001Epsin).

In gastric parietal cells, EPN3 is enriched and colocalized with clathrin at endocytic sites, suggesting a role in coordinating the recruitment of ubiquitinated cargo proteins with the nucleation and growth of endocytic clathrin-coated pits (Ko2010Selective). EPN3 also interacts with E-cadherin, promoting its internalization and turnover, which is significant in processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells (iavarone2014functional; Giangreco2020Specialised). This interaction is crucial for the destabilization of cell-cell junctions and the translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus, contributing to cancer cell invasiveness (Giangreco2020Specialised). These interactions highlight EPN3's role in cellular migration, invasion, and cancer progression.
