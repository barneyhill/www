# TIGD1

## Overview
TIGD1 is a gene that encodes the tigger transposable element derived 1 protein, which is characterized by its involvement in DNA binding and endonuclease activity. The protein contains distinct domains, including a helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain and a DDE endonuclease domain, suggesting its role in DNA interaction and potential regulatory functions (Xia2024Bioinformatics). TIGD1 is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer, where it is overexpressed in several types of malignancies such as liver, colorectal, and lung cancers (Yin2018TIGD1). The gene's expression is also associated with oncogenic pathways and cell cycle regulation, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Xia2024Bioinformatics). Additionally, TIGD1 has been linked to neurological conditions, including developmental delay in autism spectrum disorders, indicating its broader significance in human health and disease (Kong2012Characteristics).

## Structure
The TIGD1 gene encodes a protein that is characterized by several distinct domains. The primary structure of the TIGD1 protein includes three pfam domains: a DNA-binding helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain located between amino acids 9 and 60, a HTH CenpB-type DNA-binding domain spanning amino acids 80-147, and a DDE endonuclease domain extending from amino acid 216-403 (Xia2024Bioinformatics). These domains suggest that the protein may have roles in DNA binding and endonuclease activity, similar to the mammalian centromere protein B (CENP-B) (Xia2024Bioinformatics).

The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets typical of HTH motifs, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure would involve the 3D folding necessary for the functional conformation of these domains, but specific folding patterns are not detailed. There is no information on the quaternary structure or post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. The context does not mention splice variant isoforms, so it is unclear if TIGD1 has multiple isoforms with distinct functions. Overall, the TIGD1 protein's structure suggests a role in DNA interaction and possibly in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the context of cancer (Xia2024Bioinformatics).

## Clinical Significance
The TIGD1 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In liver cancer, TIGD1 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Yin2018TIGD1). Similarly, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TIGD1 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression correlates with high-grade tumors, lymph node metastasis, and poor overall survival, indicating its role in cancer progression and as a potential therapeutic target (Xia2024Bioinformatics). In colorectal cancer, TIGD1 expression is linked to tumor progression and metastasis, with high expression levels associated with poor prognosis (Xu2024Highthroughput).

TIGD1 mutations have also been identified in WHO grade 1 meningiomas, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of these tumors, although its exact function as a driver gene remains to be confirmed (GonzálezTablas2021WholeExome). Additionally, TIGD1 has been associated with developmental delay in autism spectrum disorders, highlighting its potential involvement in neurological conditions (Kong2012Characteristics). Despite these associations, further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance of TIGD1 mutations and expression alterations.

## Interactions
TIGD1, a gene derived from the tigger transposable element, is implicated in various protein-protein interactions within the human genome. In Homo sapiens, the BioGrid database identifies three protein-protein interactions for TIGD1, suggesting its integration into host cellular processes (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic). Although specific interaction partners are not detailed, the presence of these interactions indicates a potential role in cellular functions, possibly involving regulatory mechanisms or participation in multiprotein complexes.

In the context of cancer, TIGD1 has been associated with cell cycle progression and oncogenic processes. It is overexpressed in several types of cancer, including liver, colorectal, gastric, lung, and pancreatic cancers, where it may interact with other genes involved in these pathways (Yin2018TIGD1). The gene's expression and potential interactions are also explored in neuroblastoma, where it is part of an epigenetic and transcriptional factor (EP-TF) gene signature used for risk stratification. This suggests that TIGD1 might interact with other EP-TF genes, although specific interactions are not detailed (Zhang2024CRISPRCas9).

Overall, while TIGD1's specific protein or nucleic acid interaction partners remain largely undefined, its involvement in various cellular and oncogenic processes highlights its potential significance in human biology.
