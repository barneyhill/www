# MTHFD2

## Overview
MTHFD2 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+ dependent) 2, methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase, which plays a pivotal role in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism. This enzyme is crucial for nucleotide biosynthesis, amino acid homeostasis, and maintaining cellular redox balance. It functions as a homodimer, with each monomer containing dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase domains that facilitate the conversion of 5,10-methylene-THF to 10-formyl-THF, a reaction essential for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines (PardoLorente2024MTHFD2; Zhao2021Catalytic). MTHFD2 is particularly significant in rapidly proliferating cells, such as cancer cells, where it supports metabolic reprogramming and cell cycle progression. Its overexpression is associated with various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (PardoLorente2024MTHFD2; Cui2022Upregulation).

## Structure
The MTHFD2 protein is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in one-carbon metabolism, crucial for nucleotide biosynthesis. It functions as a homodimer, with each monomer comprising dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase domains. These domains form a cleft where the NAD+ cofactor and inorganic phosphate bind, essential for its dehydrogenase activity (Zhao2021Catalytic). The enzyme's structure includes α/β strands, with highly conserved amino acids contributing to its function (Rana2023Targeting).

The primary structure of MTHFD2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific secondary structures, including alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The tertiary structure results in a specific 3D conformation, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is significant for its function as a homodimer enzyme (Zhao2021Catalytic).

MTHFD2 contains NADP+ binding domains and is subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. These modifications can influence its activity and stability. The enzyme's structure also features a Rossmann fold, characteristic of dinucleotide-binding enzymes, which is involved in binding NAD+ and phosphate ions (Lee2021Xanthine). The presence of magnesium ions is crucial for stabilizing inorganic phosphate and facilitating catalysis (Zhao2021Catalytic).

## Function
MTHFD2 is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism pathway, which is crucial for nucleotide biosynthesis, amino acid homeostasis, and maintaining the redox state of the cell. It catalyzes the conversion of 5,10-methylene-THF to 10-formyl-THF, a reaction coupled with the oxidoreduction of NADP+ and NAD+ in the mitochondria (PardoLorente2024MTHFD2; Shin2017Human). This enzyme is essential for the synthesis of metabolites required for rapid cell proliferation, such as purines and pyrimidines (PardoLorente2024MTHFD2).

In healthy human cells, MTHFD2 contributes to the regulation of the nutritional status of the cell, affecting amino acid homeostasis, nucleotide precursor production, and epigenetic and redox states (PardoLorente2024MTHFD2). It is involved in maintaining DNA and histone methylation, which is essential for proper mitotic progression and genomic stability (PardoLorente2024MTHFD2). MTHFD2 also plays a role in redox homeostasis by regulating the NADP+/NADPH and NAD+/NADH ratios, protecting cells from oxidative stress (PardoLorente2024MTHFD2). Its activity is crucial for cell survival during hypoxic conditions, as downregulation leads to increased reactive oxygen species levels and cell death (PardoLorente2024MTHFD2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MTHFD2 gene are significantly associated with various cancers. MTHFD2 is consistently upregulated in numerous tumor types, including breast, colorectal, ovarian, and bladder cancers, contributing to cancer cell proliferation, tumor growth, migration, invasion, and metastasis (Cui2022Upregulation; PardoLorente2024MTHFD2; The; p&gt; Wei2019&lt). In colorectal cancer, MTHFD2 acts as a putative oncogene, with its overexpression linked to increased cell proliferation and migration, while its knockdown results in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis (The; p&gt; Wei2019&lt).

In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), MTHFD2 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. It serves as a prognostic biomarker and is involved in regulating ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death (Zhang2023Identification). MTHFD2 also plays a role in immune evasion by upregulating PD-L1, helping tumors escape immune detection (Shang2021The).

The gene's involvement in metabolic reprogramming and cell cycle regulation is crucial for cancer progression. MTHFD2's catalytic activity supports nucleotide synthesis and redox homeostasis, essential for cancer cell survival (PardoLorente2024MTHFD2). Its expression is linked to poor survival outcomes in ovarian cancer, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Cui2022Upregulation).

## Interactions
MTHFD2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in cancer cells. It has been shown to interact with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) in bladder cancer, leading to the phosphorylation of the Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and increased E2F1 transcriptional activity, which is crucial for cell cycle progression (PardoLorente2024MTHFD2). MTHFD2 also influences RNA methylation processes. In renal cell carcinoma, it modulates RNA methylation by interacting with HIF-2α, affecting the m6A methylation of HIF-2α mRNA, which in turn influences its translation and protein levels (Green2019MTHFD2).

MTHFD2 is involved in the regulation of PD-L1 expression through its role in protein O-GlcNAcylation. It promotes the transcription of PD-L1 by stabilizing the transcription factor cMYC via O-GlcNAcylation, which prevents its degradation (Shang2021The). This interaction is part of a mechanism that contributes to cancer immune evasion (Shang2021The). These interactions highlight MTHFD2's involvement in both metabolic and non-metabolic pathways, making it a potential target for cancer therapy.
