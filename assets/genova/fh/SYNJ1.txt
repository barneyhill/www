# SYNJ1

## Overview
Synaptojanin 1 (SYNJ1) is a gene that encodes the protein synaptojanin 1, a phosphoinositide phosphatase primarily involved in the nervous system. The protein plays a pivotal role in synaptic vesicle recycling, a process essential for efficient neurotransmission. Synaptojanin 1 is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes an N-terminal SAC1-like domain, a central inositol 5-phosphatase domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain, facilitating its enzymatic activity and interactions with other proteins (Paesmans2020A). The protein's function is critical for the dephosphorylation of phosphoinositides, which is necessary for the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles and their subsequent recycling (Mani2007The). Mutations in the SYNJ1 gene have been linked to neurological disorders such as early-onset Parkinson's disease and epilepsy, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal synaptic function and neuronal health (Lesage2021Clinical; Dyment2015Homozygous).

## Structure
Synaptojanin 1 (SYNJ1) is a phosphoinositide phosphatase with a complex molecular structure that plays a crucial role in synaptic vesicle recycling. The primary structure of SYNJ1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains, including an N-terminal SAC1-like domain, a central inositol 5-phosphatase (5PPase) domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain (Paesmans2020A). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function.

The tertiary structure of SYNJ1 forms a three-dimensional shape that is essential for its enzymatic activity. The 5PPase domain, spanning residues 528-873, has been crystallized, revealing its interaction with the substrate diC8-PI(3,4,5)P3. This structure provides insights into the enzyme's catalytic mechanism, highlighting key residues such as D730 and N732, which are involved in activating a water molecule for nucleophilic attack (Paesmans2020A).

SYNJ1's quaternary structure involves interactions with other proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions. SYNJ1 also has splice variant isoforms that contribute to its functional diversity, allowing it to participate in various cellular processes (Paesmans2020A).

## Function
Synaptojanin 1 (SYNJ1) is a multifunctional protein primarily active in the nervous system, where it plays a critical role in synaptic vesicle recycling. It is involved in the processes of endocytosis and postendocytic vesicle reavailability at nerve terminals. SYNJ1 contains two phosphoinositol phosphatase domains, the Sac1-like and 5-phosphatase domains, which are essential for the dephosphorylation of phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) (Mani2007The). This dephosphorylation is crucial for the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles, facilitating their recycling and reavailability for neurotransmitter release (Harris2000Mutations; Watanabe2018Synaptojanin).

SYNJ1 interacts with proteins like endophilin and amphiphysin through its proline-rich domain, which is important for its recruitment to endocytic sites and the regulation of endocytic protein binding (Mani2007The; Perera2006Two). The absence of SYNJ1 leads to elevated levels of PI(4,5)P2, accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles, and synaptic depression, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal synaptic function (Mani2007The). In synj1 knockout models, defects in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and recycling are observed, highlighting its essential role in synaptic transmission and cognitive functions (Mani2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SYNJ1 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, most notably early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD) and epilepsy. SYNJ1 mutations, such as the p.R258Q and p.Y832C variants, have been linked to early-onset parkinsonism, characterized by symptoms like tremor, dystonia, and bradykinesia, often accompanied by cognitive decline and seizures (Lesage2021Clinical; Drouet2014Synaptojanin). These mutations can lead to impaired dopamine transporter (DAT) regulation, affecting dopamine signaling and contributing to Parkinsonian pathogenesis (Saenz2024Parkinson’s).

In addition to Parkinson's disease, SYNJ1 mutations are implicated in severe neurodegenerative disorders with intractable seizures and tauopathies. For instance, the homozygous nonsense mutation c.406C>T, p.R136X is associated with intractable epilepsy and neurodegeneration, as observed in a case study involving a male infant with severe neurological symptoms and tau pathology (Dyment2015Homozygous).

Alterations in SYNJ1 expression are also linked to Down syndrome, where gene triplication is associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease due to synaptic dysfunction (Drouet2014Synaptojanin). These findings underscore the critical role of SYNJ1 in maintaining neuronal function and its involvement in various neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental conditions.

## Interactions
Synaptojanin 1 (SYNJ1) is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions that facilitate its role in synaptic vesicle recycling and endocytosis. SYNJ1 interacts with endophilin through its proline-rich domain (PRD), which binds to the SH3 domain of endophilin. This interaction is essential for the fission and uncoating of synaptic clathrin-coated vesicles, and disruption of this interaction inhibits endocytosis at the stage of invaginated clathrin-coated pits (Mani2007The; Gad2000Fission). 

SYNJ1 also interacts with amphiphysin and dynamin, forming a complex that is crucial for the invagination step of endocytosis. Amphiphysin binds to SYNJ1 via its C-terminal SH3 domain, and these proteins copolymerize at the neck of the budding vesicle (Barth2011Proteomic). The PRD of SYNJ1 contains multiple SH3 domain-binding consensus sequences, allowing interactions with other proteins involved in endocytosis and signaling, such as Grb2, syndapin/pacsin, and intersectin (Drouet2014Synaptojanin).

In addition to its presynaptic roles, SYNJ1 is involved in postsynaptic processes, such as the internalization of AMPA receptors, and interacts with proteins like dynamin and endophilin in non-neuronal cells, participating in endocytosis necessary for proper renal function (Drouet2014Synaptojanin).
