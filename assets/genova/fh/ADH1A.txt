# ADH1A

## Overview
The ADH1A gene encodes the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 1A (class I), alpha polypeptide, which is a member of the alcohol dehydrogenase family. This enzyme plays a critical role in the metabolism of ethanol and other alcohols, primarily in the liver. It catalyzes the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde, a key step in alcohol metabolism, and is also involved in the oxidation of retinol to retinal, contributing to retinoic acid biosynthesis. The protein is a dimeric enzyme, characterized by a catalytic domain containing a zinc ion and a coenzyme-binding domain with a Rossmann fold, essential for NAD+ binding (Eklund2008Medium; Lee2006Immunochemical). ADH1A is expressed prominently during early fetal development and decreases in expression during gestation and adult life (Chang2011The). Variations in the ADH1A gene can influence alcohol metabolism and are associated with alcohol dependence risk, highlighting its clinical significance (Lee2019The; Edenberg2018Alcohol).

## Structure
The ADH1A gene encodes the alpha subunit of class I alcohol dehydrogenase, which is involved in ethanol metabolism. The protein is a dimeric enzyme, with each subunit containing a catalytic domain and a coenzyme-binding domain. The coenzyme-binding domain features a Rossmann fold, which is crucial for binding NAD+ in an extended conformation (Eklund2008Medium; Lee2006Immunochemical). The catalytic domain contains a zinc ion that plays a key role in the enzyme's catalytic activity (Eklund2008Medium).

A significant structural feature of ADH1A is the substitution of Phe93 with Ala in the substrate pocket, which enlarges the active site near the catalytic zinc, enhancing specificity for branched substrates and secondary alcohols (Eklund2008Medium). The substitution of Gly for Arg at position 47 promotes greater domain closure, affecting substrate specificity (Eklund2008Medium).

The quaternary structure of ADH1A is similar to that of the horse liver enzyme, suggesting a dimeric organization (Eklund2008Medium). The enzyme's structure is characterized by long clefts separating the catalytic and coenzyme-binding domains, facilitating substrate and coenzyme interactions (Eklund2008Medium).

## Function
The ADH1A gene encodes the alpha subunit of class I alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), an enzyme primarily involved in the metabolism of ethanol in the liver. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, a crucial step in alcohol metabolism, which is then further metabolized to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzymes (Jelski2008Alcohol; Edenberg2006Association). Class I ADH enzymes, including those encoded by ADH1A, are composed of dimers formed by the association of different subunits, and they are primarily expressed in the liver, where they account for the majority of ethanol metabolism (Chang2011The).

In addition to ethanol metabolism, class I ADH enzymes are involved in the oxidation of retinol to retinal, the first step in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid, and participate in the metabolism of bioamines, prostaglandins, and the ω-oxidation of fatty acids (Jelski2008Alcohol). These enzymes play a significant role in detoxifying endogenous alcohols and products of lipid peroxidation, as well as some exogenous xenobiotics, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Jelski2008Alcohol). The expression of ADH1A is prominent during early fetal development, decreasing during gestation, and is weakly expressed during adult life (Chang2011The).

## Clinical Significance
The ADH1A gene is associated with alcohol metabolism, and variations in this gene can influence the body's reaction to alcohol, potentially affecting the risk of alcohol dependence. The ADH1A rs1229976 variant is significantly associated with higher blood acetaldehyde concentrations, suggesting a role in slower alcohol metabolism, which may contribute to increased blood acetaldehyde levels and influence alcohol dependence risk (Lee2019The). Although ADH1A is expressed at lower levels in the liver compared to ADH1B or ADH1C, its variations may still contribute to the genetic component of substance dependence (Edenberg2018Alcohol).

Noncoding SNPs in the region of ADH1A have been associated with alcoholism and the drinking phenotype, although direct associations between alcohol dependence and ADH1A have rarely been reported until recently (Lee2019The). The regulatory effects of genetic variants on ADH1A expression in various tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract and adipose tissues, may also play a role in alcohol dependence (Hibberd2020Genetic). These findings highlight the need for further research to explore the clinical significance of ADH1A variations in alcohol-related disorders.

## Interactions
ADH1A, or alcohol dehydrogenase 1A, is involved in energy transfer processes through its interaction with intermediate filaments (IFs) in biological systems. The protein forms a complex with NAD+ and binds ATP molecules, which are hydrolyzed to generate energy. This energy is then transferred to IFs, generating excitons that propagate along the filaments. The interaction with IFs is crucial for this energy transfer process, although the precise structural details of how ADH1A binds to IFs remain unknown (Khmelinskii2021Energy). The study of ADH1A's role in energy transfer highlights its potential relevance to neuronal interactions, suggesting a broader significance in cellular communication (Khmelinskii2021Energy).

The ADH1A protein is dimeric, with each monomer capable of binding an ATP molecule, allowing for simultaneous hydrolysis. This dimeric nature facilitates the generation of excitons, which are essential for the energy transfer along the IFs (Khmelinskii2021Energy). While the study does not detail interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its role in ATP hydrolysis and energy transfer, it underscores the importance of ADH1A in the context of cellular energy dynamics (Khmelinskii2021Energy).
