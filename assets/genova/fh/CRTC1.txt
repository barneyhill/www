# CRTC1

## Overview
CRTC1, or CREB regulated transcription coactivator 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as a transcriptional coactivator. This protein is primarily involved in modulating the activity of the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including energy balance, metabolism, and neuronal activity. CRTC1 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it influences appetite regulation and energy homeostasis by mediating hormonal and nutrient signals (Altarejos2011CREB; Tasoulas2019Adaptive). The protein is regulated through phosphorylation, which controls its localization and interaction with CREB, thereby affecting the transcription of target genes (Altarejos2011CREB). CRTC1's involvement in mitochondrial function and its interactions with other transcription factors underscore its significance in cellular signaling pathways (ParraDamas2017CRTC1; Canettieri2009The). Alterations in CRTC1 expression and function have been linked to various clinical conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, obesity, and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (ParraDamas2017CRTC1; Rossetti2022New).

## Structure
CRTC1 (CREB regulated transcription coactivator 1) is a protein involved in transcriptional coactivation with CREB. The primary structure of CRTC1 includes a sequence of amino acids encoded by the CRTC1 gene, but specific details on the sequence are not provided in the context. The secondary structure of CRTC1 is not detailed in terms of specific alpha helices or beta sheets, but the CRTC1-MAML2 fusion protein involves a helical motif within the MAML2 TAD1 region, which is crucial for its interaction with the KIX domain of CBP/p300 (Clark2015Molecular).

CRTC1 contains functional domains that facilitate its role in transcriptional regulation. The CRTC1-MAML2 fusion protein retains the N-terminal 42 residues of CRTC1, which are important for its constitutive nuclear localization and interaction with CREB (Clark2015Molecular). The fusion protein acts as a potent coactivator of CREB due to its ability to recruit CBP/p300 coactivators (Clark2015Molecular).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate the activity of CRTC1. Under basal conditions, CRTC proteins are hyper-phosphorylated and retained in the cytoplasm. De-phosphorylation allows them to enter the nucleus and interact with CREB (Clark2015Molecular). Information on splice variant isoforms of CRTC1 is not provided in the context.

## Function
CRTC1 (CREB regulated transcription coactivator 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes by acting as a coactivator for the transcription factor CREB. In healthy human cells, CRTC1 is primarily expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in regulating energy balance and metabolism. It mediates the effects of hormonal and nutrient signals on energy homeostasis, particularly in the hypothalamus, where it influences appetite regulation and satiety through the CREB-dependent expression of anorexigenic peptides like CART (Altarejos2011CREB).

CRTC1 is involved in enhancing CREB activity by associating with its bZIP domain, which increases CREB occupancy over cognate binding sites and promotes target gene activation. This process is regulated by phosphorylation-dependent interactions with 14-3-3 proteins, which sequester CRTC1 in the cytoplasm. Upon dephosphorylation, CRTC1 translocates to the nucleus, where it activates CREB target genes (Altarejos2011CREB).

CRTC1 also plays a role in mitochondrial oxidative capacity and adaptive mitochondrial biogenesis by upregulating the expression of PGC1α, a key regulator of energy metabolism (Altarejos2011CREB). In muscle cells, CRTC1 contributes to glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism, highlighting its role in global energy regulation (Tasoulas2019Adaptive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CRTC1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, CRTC1 dysfunction is associated with memory impairments and dendrite degeneration. Altered CRTC1-dependent transcription and nuclear translocation are linked to contextual memory deficits, and CRTC1 gene therapy has shown potential in ameliorating these deficits (ParraDamas2017CRTC1). In Alzheimer's disease, decreased methylation of the CRTC1 gene in the hippocampus correlates with reduced mRNA levels and is associated with p-tau deposition, a neuropathological marker of the disease (Mendioroz2016CRTC1).

CRTC1 is also involved in obesity and energy balance regulation. In obese patients, significant changes in CRTC1 methylation levels have been observed, and CRTC1 deficiency in mouse models leads to increased sensitivity to high-fat diet-induced obesity (Rossetti2022New). In psychiatric patients, CRTC1 gene modulation by psychotropic drugs is linked to early weight gain, and specific CRTC1 polymorphisms are associated with body mass index and fat mass, particularly in individuals with depression (Delacrétaz2019Psychotropic; Rossetti2022New). These findings suggest that CRTC1 plays a critical role in the shared biological pathways between obesity and depression.

## Interactions
CRTC1 (CREB regulated transcription coactivator 1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role as a transcriptional coactivator. CRTC1 interacts with the AP-1 transcription factor complex, specifically binding to the bZIP domains of c-Jun and c-Fos, which are components of AP-1. This interaction enhances the transcriptional activity of AP-1 target genes, such as MMP1, MTIIA, and TIMP1, particularly in response to TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) (Canettieri2009The).

CRTC1 also interacts with CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), binding to its bZIP domain. This interaction is essential for the activation of CREB target genes, particularly during neuronal activity, where CRTC1 undergoes dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation to bind CREB (ParraDamas2017CRTC1; Altarejos2011CREB).

In addition to its interactions with AP-1 and CREB, CRTC1 binds to MEIS1A, a transcription factor, through its N-terminal region. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminus of MEIS1A and is crucial for transcriptional activation in response to PKA signaling (Looi page 8 of 23; Looi page 21 of 23).

CRTC1's interactions with these transcription factors highlight its role in modulating transcriptional responses to various cellular signals, including those involved in proliferation and transformation (Canettieri2009The; Tasoulas2019Adaptive).
