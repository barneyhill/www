# DNAJB12

## Overview
DNAJB12 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B12, which is a type II transmembrane protein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein is a member of the Hsp40 family and functions as a co-chaperone, playing a critical role in protein folding and quality control within the ER and cytosol. DNAJB12 is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is essential for the degradation of misfolded proteins, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular stress response. The protein's J-domain, which faces the cytosol, is crucial for its interaction with Hsp70 chaperones, facilitating ATP hydrolysis and polypeptide binding. DNAJB12 also interacts with various proteins, including ubiquitin E3 ligase RMA1 and autophagy machinery, to enhance the degradation of misfolded proteins. Alterations in DNAJB12 expression have been linked to clinical conditions such as Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 and certain gastrointestinal carcinomas, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic biomarker and prognostic marker (He2020DNAJB12; Pohl2019Gene; Dabsan2023Chaperone).

## Structure
DNAJB12 is a type II transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), characterized by its J-domain facing the cytosol (Goodwin2014Expression; Sopha2012A). The J-domain is crucial for its function, containing a conserved His-Pro-Asp (HPD) motif that facilitates interaction with Hsp70 chaperones, promoting ATP hydrolysis and polypeptide binding (Solana2022The). This domain is essential for the formation of DJANGOS, a novel nuclear pore structure, as mutations in the HPD motif disrupt this process (Goodwin2014Expression).

DNAJB12's structure includes a cytoplasmic J-domain and a luminal portion, although the latter is not necessary for DJANGOS formation (Goodwin2014Expression). The protein's cytoplasmic domain, with its hydrophobic segment, may contribute to membrane curvature and the formation of these structures (Goodwin2014Expression). DNAJB12 also exists in different splice variant isoforms, such as DNAJB12-short, which, despite being ER-localized, provides protection against certain protein aggregations (Rozales2022Differential). The expression of these isoforms is low in adult human tissues, suggesting a role in response to specific environmental or physiological changes (Rozales2022Differential).

## Function
DNAJB12, a member of the Hsp40 family, functions as a co-chaperone in protein folding and quality control within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cytosol. It plays a crucial role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is responsible for the degradation of misfolded proteins, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular stress response (Sicari2019Control; Dabsan2023Chaperone). DNAJB12 is involved in the reflux of ER-resident proteins to the cytosol, a process that is independent of the unfolded protein response (UPR) activation. This reflux is facilitated by its interaction with cytosolic partners such as HSC70 and SGTA, which are recruited to assist in the translocation of proteins (Dabsan2023Chaperone).

In healthy human cells, DNAJB12 helps stabilize nascent polypeptides and prevents the aggregation of misfolded proteins, ensuring proper protein maturation and folding. It is localized to the ER membrane with a J-domain facing the cytosol, which is essential for its cochaperone activity (Dabsan2023Chaperone). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular proteostasis and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which can lead to various diseases (Sicari2019Control).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DNAJB12 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. In the context of Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1), DNAJB12 is one of the genes whose expression levels are linked to the CTG-repeat expansion characteristic of the disease. The expression of DNAJB12, along with other genes, is observed to return to more normal levels in DM1 patients who respond well to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), suggesting its potential as a therapeutic biomarker (van2022Clinical).

In gastrointestinal carcinomas, particularly oesophageal carcinoma, high expression levels of DNAJB12, in combination with high expression of the gene GSS, have been associated with poorer disease-free survival. This suggests that DNAJB12 expression may serve as a prognostic marker in these cancers (Pohl2019Gene).

DNAJB12 also plays a role in the degradation of misfolded proteins, such as the N1303K-CFTR variant associated with cystic fibrosis. It facilitates the degradation of these proteins through ER-associated autophagy, highlighting its importance in protein quality control and its potential impact on diseases related to protein misfolding (He2020DNAJB12).

## Interactions
DNAJB12, a member of the Hsp40 family, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its role in protein quality control and degradation. It interacts with Hsp70, a cytosolic chaperone, to facilitate the degradation of misfolded proteins through the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This interaction is mediated by the J-domain of DNAJB12, which activates the ATPase activity of Hsp70, allowing it to recognize and process client proteins (Sopha2012A).

DNAJB12 also interacts with the ubiquitin E3 ligase RMA1, enhancing the degradation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) by recruiting the Hsp70-CFTR complex to RMA1 (Shiber2014Chaperoning). This interaction is crucial for the triage decision-making process, determining whether CFTR is directed towards folding or degradation pathways.

In the context of ER stress, DNAJB12, along with DNAJB14, recruits cytosolic chaperones and cofactors such as HSC70 and SGTA to facilitate the reflux of ER proteins to the cytosol. This process is significant in inhibiting p53 activity, which is a potential target for cancer therapy (Dabsan2023Chaperone). DNAJB12's interaction with autophagy machinery, including Beclin-1, is also noted, particularly in the degradation of ERAD-resistant clients like N1303K-CFTR intermediates (He2020DNAJB12).
