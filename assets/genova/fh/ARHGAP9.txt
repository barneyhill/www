# ARHGAP9

## Overview
ARHGAP9 is a gene that encodes the Rho GTPase activating protein 9, a member of the RhoGAP family of proteins. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of Rho family GTPases, including Cdc42 and Rac1, which are integral to various cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton organization, cell morphology, and migration (Furukawa2001Isolation). The ARHGAP9 protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a Rho-GTPase activating protein (Rho-GAP) domain, an SH3 domain, a WW domain, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and phosphoinositides (Furukawa2001Isolation; Ceccarelli2007Noncanonical). Predominantly expressed in immune-related tissues such as peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, and thymus, ARHGAP9 is implicated in immune function and hematopoietic processes (Furukawa2001Isolation). It also acts as a novel MAP kinase docking protein, influencing actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cellular responses to external stimuli (Müller2020Systems; Ang2007ArhGAP9). Alterations in ARHGAP9 expression have been associated with various diseases, including coronary spastic angina, acute myeloid leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, and serous ovarian cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Shen2021Effect; He2021SOX4‐induced; Takefuji2009Mutation; Zhang2018ARHGAP9).

## Structure
The ARHGAP9 protein is characterized by several functional domains that contribute to its role as a Rho GTPase activating protein. It contains a Rho-GTPase activating protein (Rho-GAP) domain located in the C-terminal region, which is crucial for stimulating GTP hydrolysis of Cdc42Hs and Rac1, with lower activity for RhoA (Furukawa2001Isolation). The protein also includes an SH3 domain between codons 29 and 83, a WW domain between codons 219 and 249, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain between codons 323 and 431 (Furukawa2001Isolation). The WW domain is particularly important for interacting with MAP kinases such as Erk2 and p38α, although this domain is absent in the mouse version of ARHGAP9 (Ang2007ArhGAP9).

The PH domain of ARHGAP9 binds preferentially to phosphoinositides like PI(3,4,5)P3, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(4,5)P2, indicating a non-canonical binding mechanism involving a spectrin-like pocket (Ceccarelli2007Noncanonical). This domain structure is similar to that of spectrin, with a root mean square deviation of 1.3 Å, and it binds inositol phosphates through a common binding pocket (Ceccarelli2007Noncanonical). The protein's structure and domain composition suggest its involvement in complex signaling pathways, including interactions with MAP kinases and phosphoinositides, which may influence actin cytoskeleton remodeling and cell adhesion. The gene is located on chromosome 12 and consists of 18 exons (Furukawa2001Isolation).

## Function
The ARHGAP9 gene encodes a Rho GTPase activating protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of Rho family GTPases, particularly Cdc42 and Rac1, with less activity towards RhoA. These GTPases are essential for various cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton organization, cell morphology, migration, and cell cycle progression (Furukawa2001Isolation). ARHGAP9 facilitates the hydrolysis of GTP bound to these GTPases, thereby inactivating them and modulating their signaling pathways (Peck2002Human).

In healthy human cells, ARHGAP9 is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration, particularly in immune and inflammatory responses. It is predominantly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, and thymus, suggesting a role in immune function or hematopoietic processes (Furukawa2001Isolation). The protein also acts as a novel MAP kinase docking protein, interacting with Erk2 and p38α MAP kinases through its WW domain. This interaction inhibits MAP kinase activation, thereby influencing actin cytoskeleton dynamics and maintaining actin stress fibers in fibroblasts (Ang2007ArhGAP9). ARHGAP9's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular responses to external stimuli (Müller2020Systems).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARHGAP9 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In coronary spastic angina, a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ARHGAP9, known as Ala370Ser, has been associated with an increased risk of coronary artery spasm. This polymorphism affects the gene's ability to regulate cell migration and adhesion, potentially contributing to endothelial dysfunction and inflammation (Takefuji2009Mutation).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ARHGAP9 expression is significantly upregulated in tumor samples compared to normal samples. High expression levels are correlated with lower overall survival rates in AML patients. The gene's expression is regulated by SOX4, which binds to the ARHGAP9 promoter, suggesting a role in AML progression (He2021SOX4‐induced).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ARHGAP9 is downregulated, and its lower expression is associated with shorter overall survival. Overexpression of ARHGAP9 in HCC cells inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating a tumor suppressive role (Zhang2018ARHGAP9).

In serous ovarian cancer, high ARHGAP9 expression is linked to poor prognosis. It is associated with homologous recombination repair deficiency and immune infiltration, suggesting its involvement in the tumor microenvironment and immune response (Shen2021Effect).

## Interactions
ARHGAP9 interacts with MAP kinases, specifically Erk2 and p38α, through its WW domain. This interaction is mediated by complementarily charged residues, where the di-Arginine motif (R246 and R247) in ARHGAP9 binds to acidic residues in the Common Docking (CD) domains of Erk2 and p38α. This binding inhibits the activation of these kinases, affecting the actin cytoskeleton in fibroblasts (Ang2007ArhGAP9). The interaction is specific to Erk2 and p38α, as ARHGAP9 does not bind to Jnk1 (Ang2007ArhGAP9).

ARHGAP9 also competes with MAP kinase kinases (MAPKKs) for binding to these MAP kinases, thereby suppressing their activation. This competitive binding is demonstrated by the reduced interaction of ARHGAP9 with p38α in the presence of MKK6 (Ang2007ArhGAP9). The RhoGAP activity of ARHGAP9 is not required for this suppression, indicating its role as a docking protein is independent of its GAP activity (Ang2007ArhGAP9).

In addition to its interactions with MAP kinases, ARHGAP9 enhances the GTP hydrolysis activity of Rac1 and Cdc42, although it does not significantly interact with RhoA (Furukawa2001Isolation; Takefuji2009Mutation).
