# WNT2B

## Overview
WNT2B is a gene that encodes the Wnt family member 2B protein, which is part of the Wnt family of secreted signaling proteins. These proteins are characterized by their involvement in crucial developmental processes through the Wnt signaling pathways, both canonical and non-canonical. The Wnt family member 2B protein is a secreted protein that plays a significant role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, particularly within the context of embryonic development and tissue homeostasis (Katoh2001WNT2B2; Katoh2009Transcriptional). The WNT2B gene is known for producing multiple isoforms through alternative splicing, with the WNT2B2 isoform being notably conserved across species (Katoh2009Transcriptional). The protein's function is mediated through interactions with Frizzled receptors and other co-receptors, facilitating its role in both canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling and non-canonical pathways (Borges2024Noncanonical; Kubo2003Wnt2b). WNT2B has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including its overexpression in certain cancers and its involvement in congenital disorders, highlighting its importance as a potential therapeutic target (KOBAYASHI2012Intratumoral; Zhang2021Novel).

## Structure
The WNT2B protein is a member of the Wnt family, characterized by a conserved cysteine-rich domain in its primary structure, which is essential for its function in signaling pathways (Katoh2009Transcriptional). The secondary structure of WNT2B typically includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its complex folding pattern. The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining the protein's functional conformation (Katoh2009Transcriptional).

WNT2B undergoes several post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and palmitoylation. Palmitoylation is particularly important for its role in the Wnt signaling pathway, as it facilitates the interaction with Frizzled receptors, which is essential for signal transduction (Zhang2021Novel). The G241D substitution in WNT2B, located near a predicted palmitoylation site, disrupts this modification, leading to impaired protein function (Zhang2021Novel).

The WNT2B gene encodes multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the WNT2B2 isoform being evolutionarily conserved (Katoh2009Transcriptional). These isoforms may exhibit different functional properties, contributing to the diverse roles of WNT2B in developmental processes and disease states.

## Function
WNT2B is a member of the Wnt gene family, which encodes secreted signaling proteins that play a crucial role in various developmental processes. In healthy human cells, WNT2B is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a key regulator of cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. This pathway is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and is active during embryonic development, influencing organogenesis and cellular communication (Katoh2001WNT2B2).

WNT2B is expressed in the anterior rim of the optic vesicles in the retina, where it inhibits the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells by downregulating proneural genes. This action helps maintain these cells in an undifferentiated state, promoting their prolonged proliferation. This process is independent of Notch signaling, indicating that WNT2B can modulate cell fate decisions through distinct molecular mechanisms (Kubo2005Wnt2b).

In the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ) of the retina, WNT2B supports the proliferation of progenitor cells, contributing to the continuous addition of new neurons and glia. This activity is crucial for the development and maintenance of the retina, as it ensures a balance between cell proliferation and differentiation (Kubo2003Wnt2b).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the WNT2B gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), high expression of WNT2B is linked to increased tumor proliferation and reduced patient survival. The study by Kobayashi et al. found that 67.3% of MPM tumors were classified as WNT2B-high, correlating with higher Ki-67 proliferation indices and lower overall survival rates, suggesting WNT2B as a significant prognostic factor and potential therapeutic target in MPM (KOBAYASHI2012Intratumoral).

WNT2B mutations are also implicated in a multisystem disorder characterized by congenital enteropathy and ocular dysgenesis. Patients with these mutations present with neonatal-onset diarrhea, chronic gastrointestinal inflammation, and ocular abnormalities such as corneal clouding. These mutations affect WNT2B's role in gastrointestinal development and mucosal homeostasis, leading to severe clinical manifestations (Zhang2021Novel).

Additionally, WNT2B is upregulated in certain cancers, including diffuse-type gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, where it contributes to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and metastasis. This upregulation highlights its potential as a target for cancer therapy (Katoh2017Molecular).

## Interactions
WNT2B interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. In the context of non-canonical signaling, WNT2B forms complexes with glypican-4 (GPC4) and secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2). These complexes preferentially bind to the cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) of Frizzled receptors FZD3 and FZD6, which are associated with non-canonical signaling pathways, rather than FZD8, which is linked to canonical signaling (Borges2024Noncanonical). WNT2B also interacts with the extracellular domain of ROR2, a coreceptor for non-canonical WNTs, facilitating the activation of the Wnt/PCP pathway via RhoA (Borges2024Noncanonical).

In the canonical pathway, WNT2B can bind to Frizzled receptors such as FZD4 and FZD5, as demonstrated in studies involving retinal cell differentiation. This interaction leads to the activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, evidenced by increased levels of cytosolic β-catenin and upregulation of LEF1 mRNA (Kubo2003Wnt2b). These interactions highlight WNT2B's dual role in modulating both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways.
