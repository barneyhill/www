# SDAD1

## Overview
SDAD1 (SDA1 domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein integral to ribosome biogenesis, a fundamental cellular process essential for protein synthesis. The SDAD1 protein is predominantly localized in the nucleolus, where it contributes to the maturation and assembly of ribosomal subunits, thereby supporting cellular growth and proliferation. This protein is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cardiac hypertrophy and cancer, where its expression is often dysregulated. In cardiac hypertrophy, SDAD1 is upregulated, facilitating pathological cell enlargement through interactions with long non-coding RNAs and RNA-binding proteins (Jing2019Long). Additionally, SDAD1 has been identified as an oncogene in gastric and colon cancers, where it promotes cell proliferation and invasion (Zeng2017miR378). Beyond its role in disease, SDAD1 is involved in chromatin organization and gene regulation through interactions with proteins such as TOP2B, indicating its broader significance in cellular function (UuskülaReimand2016Topoisomerase).

## Structure


## Function
SDAD1 (SDA1 domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, a critical process for protein synthesis within cells. The SDAD1 protein is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it plays a significant role in the maturation and assembly of ribosomal subunits. This function is essential for maintaining cellular growth and proliferation, as ribosomes are responsible for translating mRNA into proteins, a fundamental process for cell function and survival.

In the context of cardiac hypertrophy, SDAD1 expression is upregulated, suggesting its involvement in the pathological enlargement of heart muscle cells. The interaction between the long non-coding RNA SNHG7 and HuR, an RNA-binding protein, stabilizes SDAD1 mRNA, facilitating cardiac hypertrophy by promoting cell enlargement and protein synthesis (Jing2019Long).

While SDAD1 has been identified as having oncogenic roles in several cancers, such as gastric and colon cancer, its specific function in healthy human cells remains less explored in the available literature. However, its fundamental role in ribosome biogenesis indicates its importance in normal cellular processes (Jing2019Long; Zeng2017miR378).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the SDAD1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In gastric cancer, SDAD1 is identified as a downstream target of miR-194-5p, with higher expression levels observed in cancerous tissues and cells. The knockdown of SDAD1 has been shown to reduce gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its role as an oncogene in this context (Ding2018LncRNA). Similarly, in colon cancer, SDAD1 is a direct target of miR-378. Overexpression of miR-378, which leads to the inhibition of SDAD1, results in decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion of colon cancer cells, suggesting that SDAD1 promotes these malignant processes (Zeng2017miR378).

Beyond cancer, SDAD1 has been associated with allergic rhinitis, as it is part of the inflammatory and immune response pathways implicated in the condition (Gupta2016Resolving). Additionally, SDAD1 is involved in the heat stress response in cattle, where its downregulation disrupts protein transport during heat stress, highlighting its broader impact on cellular processes (Singh2020Genome­wide). These findings underscore the potential clinical significance of SDAD1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
SDAD1 (SDA1 domain containing 1) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is known to interact with the TOP2B protein, particularly at topological domain borders, where it associates with cohesin and CTCF. This interaction suggests a role in chromatin organization and gene regulation (UuskülaReimand2016Topoisomerase).

In the context of cardiac hypertrophy, SDAD1 interacts with the long non-coding RNA SNHG7 and the RNA-binding protein HuR. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of SDAD1 mRNA, contributing to the progression of cardiac hypertrophy (Jing2019Long).

SDAD1 is also involved in the regulation of germ cell-specific genes through its interaction with RNA-binding proteins such as PUM2 and DAZL. These proteins bind to specific sequences within the 3′-UTR of the SDAD1 transcript, indicating a role in post-transcriptional regulation (Fox2024Germ).

In severe COVID-19, SDAD1 is identified as a key gene within protein-protein interaction networks, although specific interactions in this context are not detailed. It is suggested to be involved in processes like cell proliferation and immune responses (Sagulkoo2024Analysis).
