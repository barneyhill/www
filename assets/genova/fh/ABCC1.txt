# ABCC1

## Overview
The ABCC1 gene encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 1 (MRP1), a transmembrane protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. MRP1 is primarily involved in the ATP-dependent transport of a wide array of substrates, including drugs and organic anions, across cellular membranes, contributing to cellular detoxification and homeostasis (Mo2012Biochemistry). Structurally, MRP1 is characterized by three transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding domains, which facilitate its function as a transporter (Wang2021Multidrug; Li2019Extrusion). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with notable abundance in the lung, kidney, and placenta, and plays a critical role in protecting cells from toxic substances and oxidative stress (Mo2012Biochemistry). MRP1's involvement in multidrug resistance has significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where its expression is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor prognosis in various malignancies (Kunická2014Importance).

## Structure
The ABCC1 gene encodes the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. MRP1 is characterized by a complex structure that includes three transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) (Wang2021Multidrug; Li2019Extrusion). The transmembrane domains are organized into TMD0, TMD1, and TMD2, with TMD0 containing five transmembrane helices and an interfacial domain known as the lasso motif (Johnson2017Structural). TMD1 and TMD2 each consist of six transmembrane α-helices, forming the substrate translocation pathway (Wang2021Multidrug).

The nucleotide-binding domains are responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis, which power the transmembrane transport of substrates (Cole2014Targeting). The NBDs form composite ATPase sites, with ATP hydrolysis primarily occurring at the NBD2 site (Johnson2017Structural). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to form a functional transporter, with the NBDs located in the cytoplasm (Johnson2017Structural).

MRP1 also exhibits structural features such as a 'ball-and-socket' joint at the NBD2/TMD interface, and a key aromatic residue, F728, which is crucial for maintaining structural integrity (Johnson2017Structural). The protein's quaternary structure involves the assembly of these domains to form a functional transporter, although specific details are not extensively covered in the context provided. Splice variants of ABCC1 have been identified, with some variants associated with altered drug resistance (He2004Alternative).

## Function
The ABCC1 gene encodes the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. In healthy human cells, MRP1 plays a crucial role in detoxification processes by actively transporting a wide range of substrates, including drugs, organic anions, and conjugated metabolites, across cellular membranes. This transport is ATP-dependent, involving the hydrolysis of ATP to provide the necessary energy for substrate efflux (Mo2012Biochemistry).

MRP1 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with higher levels in the lung, kidney, testis, and placenta. It is particularly abundant in cells with specialized barrier functions, such as those in the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and in rapidly proliferating cells like reactive type 2 pneumocytes in the lung (Mo2012Biochemistry). The protein is also found in intracellular membranes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, suggesting it may serve as an intracellular pool ready to translocate to the plasma membrane (Mo2012Biochemistry).

MRP1 contributes to the protection of cells from toxic substances and maintains cellular homeostasis by exporting glutathione conjugates and other metabolites. It also plays a role in oxidative stress defense by exporting glutathione disulfide (GSSG), a product of peroxide reduction, from cells (Mo2012Biochemistry).

## Clinical Significance
The ABCC1 gene, also known as multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), plays a significant role in cancer drug resistance and prognosis. In neuroblastoma, a common childhood cancer, high ABCC1 expression is linked to MYCN oncogene amplification, rapid tumor progression, and poor prognosis. The T allele of the ABCC1 rs45511401 SNP is associated with improved clinical outcomes in neuroblastoma patients (Kunická2014Importance). In breast carcinoma, overexpression of ABCC1 correlates with resistance to chemotherapy and is considered a negative prognostic marker, particularly in aggressive subtypes (Kunická2014Importance).

In colorectal and lung carcinomas, ABCC1 expression is associated with chemotherapy resistance, especially in TP53-mutated tumors, and poor response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Kunická2014Importance). In ovarian carcinoma, high ABCC1 expression is linked to decreased overall survival (Kunická2014Importance).

Polymorphisms in ABCC1, such as the G2012T SNP, are associated with altered mRNA stability and expression, impacting clinical outcomes in neuroblastoma (Pajic2011ABCC1). These genetic variations can influence drug transport and resistance, highlighting the gene's role in modulating multidrug resistance and its implications for cancer therapy (Kunická2014Importance).

## Interactions
The human ABCC1 protein, also known as multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), is involved in several physical interactions with other proteins. Notably, ABCC1 interacts with ATP synthase α, forming a heterocomplex on plasma membranes, particularly in lipid rafts. This interaction is not cell line specific and has been observed in both HEK293 and HeLa cells. The binding site for ATP synthase α is located in the linker domain at the carboxyl core of ABCC1, and phosphorylation at the protein kinase A site enhances this binding. The interaction suggests a potential role for ABCC1 in regulating extracellular ATP levels and purinergic signaling cascades (Yang2012Human).

ABCC1 also interacts with elongation factor 1-α1, although ATP synthase α is the major associated protein. These interactions were identified through coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses (Yang2012Human). The study of these interactions expands the understanding of ABCC1's functional roles beyond its known involvement in drug resistance, suggesting its participation in broader cellular processes (Yang2012Human).
