# RAMP1

## Overview
RAMP1 (Receptor Activity Modifying Protein 1) is a gene that encodes a single-pass transmembrane protein involved in the modulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR). The protein, also known as receptor activity modifying protein 1, plays a pivotal role in determining ligand specificity and facilitating the functional expression of CLR by forming heterodimers with it. This interaction is crucial for the formation of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor, which is involved in various physiological processes such as vasodilation and cardiovascular regulation (Hay2016Receptor; Booe2015Structural). RAMP1's influence extends to receptor trafficking, signaling, and pharmacology, making it a significant focus in studies related to cardiovascular health, migraine pathophysiology, and cancer research (Dallmayer2019Targeting; Kotliar2022Elucidating).

## Structure
RAMP1 (Receptor Activity Modifying Protein 1) is a single-pass transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in modulating the function of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR). Structurally, RAMP1 consists of an extracellular N-terminal domain of approximately 90-100 amino acids, a single transmembrane helix, and a short intracellular C-terminal domain of about 9 amino acids (Hay2016Receptor). The extracellular domain (ECD) is involved in determining ligand selectivity and is critical for the functional expression of CLR (Booe2015Structural).

The ECD of RAMP1 is not glycosylated in humans, although potential glycosylation sites are present in other species like chick and zebrafish (Hay2016Receptor). A key residue, W84, in the ECD of RAMP1 is essential for the binding of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) to the CGRP receptor, highlighting its role in ligand specificity (Hay2016Receptor).

In terms of quaternary structure, RAMP1 forms heterodimers with CLR, which are sufficient for peptide binding and receptor function (Booe2015Structural). The interaction between RAMP1 and CLR involves specific hydrophobic contacts, such as between RAMP1 W84 and CGRP F37, which are crucial for the receptor's pharmacological specificity (Hay2016Receptor).

## Function
RAMP1 (receptor activity modifying protein 1) is a single transmembrane domain protein that plays a critical role in modulating the function of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CALCRL) to form the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor. This interaction is essential for the receptor's response to CGRP, a neuropeptide involved in various physiological processes, including vasodilation and cardiovascular regulation (Routledge2017The; Qi2010Structure–function).

RAMP1 is necessary for transporting CALCRL to the cell surface, enabling it to bind and be activated by CGRP. This process involves the coupling of CALCRL with Gαs proteins, which is crucial for the receptor's signaling function (Routledge2017The). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is involved in the regulation of chondroitin sulfate synthesis in intervertebral discs, contributing to extracellular matrix homeostasis (Kotliar2022Elucidating).

In addition to its role in receptor trafficking and signaling, RAMP1 influences ligand selectivity and receptor pharmacology by affecting the structure and dynamics of the receptor's extracellular domain. This modulation is important for the receptor's activation and function in response to ligand binding (Kotliar2022Elucidating).

## Clinical Significance
The RAMP1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in several diseases and conditions. Alterations in RAMP1 expression or mutations can impact cardiovascular health, contributing to conditions such as essential hypertension (EH). A study in a Japanese population identified a specific haplotype, T-A-T, that was more prevalent in individuals with EH, suggesting a genetic susceptibility linked to RAMP1 (Nakayama2017Haplotypebased).

RAMP1 is also implicated in migraine pathophysiology. It is a critical component of the CGRP receptor, which is involved in neurogenic inflammation and vasodilation, processes that are central to migraine attacks. Although specific SNPs in the RAMP1 gene were not significantly associated with migraine in a general population, there was a nominal association in male migraineurs, indicating potential sex-specific genetic influences (Sutherland2013Association).

In cancer research, the CALCB/RAMP1 axis has been shown to promote the growth of Ewing sarcoma cells. Knockdown of RAMP1 in these cells significantly reduced tumor growth, suggesting that targeting this axis could be a therapeutic strategy (Dallmayer2019Targeting). These findings highlight the diverse clinical implications of RAMP1 in various diseases.

## Interactions
RAMP1 interacts with the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CALCRL) to form a functional receptor complex known as the CGRP receptor, which is activated by the peptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) (Kotliar2022Elucidating). This interaction is crucial for the receptor's pharmacological specificity and function, as RAMP1 facilitates the transport of CALCRL to the cell surface and affects its glycosylation, which is important for receptor function (Born2002Functional). 

RAMP1 forms heterodimers with CALCRL, and these complexes are essential for the high-affinity binding of CGRP (Born2002Functional). The interaction between RAMP1 and CALCRL involves extensive contacts, with RAMP1's transmembrane domain fitting into an interface between CALCRL's transmembrane helices, and its extracellular domain interacting with CALCRL's extracellular loop (Kotliar2022Elucidating). 

RAMP1 also interacts with other proteins, such as the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), which affect GPCR trafficking and ubiquitination (Kotliar2022Elucidating). These interactions highlight RAMP1's role in modulating GPCR dynamics and pharmacology, influencing ligand interactions and receptor stability (Kotliar2022Elucidating).
