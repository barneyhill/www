# H4C3

## Overview
H4C3 is a gene that encodes the H4 clustered histone 3 protein, a core component of the nucleosome, which is essential for DNA packaging within the chromatin structure of eukaryotic cells. As a member of the histone H4 family, this protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation, thereby influencing cell cycle progression and maintaining genomic stability (Hsiao2020Characterizing). The H4C3 gene is part of the replication-dependent histone gene cluster, with its expression tightly regulated during the S phase of the cell cycle, underscoring its importance in DNA packaging during cell division (Hsiao2020Characterizing). Alterations in H4C3 expression have been linked to several pathological conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Jafari2022Screening; Clark2024NeuroTri2VISDOT:).

## Function
H4C3 encodes a histone protein, specifically histone H4, which is a core component of the nucleosome. In healthy human cells, histone H4 plays a crucial role in DNA packaging within the nucleus, facilitating chromatin structure and gene regulation. This protein is involved in essential cellular processes such as DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation, impacting cell cycle progression and genomic stability (Hsiao2020Characterizing).

H4C3 is part of the Histone gene cluster 1, H4 histone family, and is expressed mainly during the S phase of the cell cycle. This suggests that H4C3 is a replication-dependent histone gene, which is crucial for DNA packaging during cell division (Hsiao2020Characterizing). The expression of H4C3 is tightly regulated, and its cyclic expression pattern is significant for maintaining proper cell cycle progression (Hsiao2020Characterizing).

Histones, including those encoded by H4C3, are proteins that package and order DNA into structural units called nucleosomes, playing a critical role in gene regulation, DNA repair, and chromatin structure maintenance (Malatesta2024Differential). The proper functioning of H4C3 is essential for maintaining genomic integrity and ensuring accurate cell division.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the H4C3 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of Mendelian neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), mutations in H4C3, a replication-coupled histone gene, are associated with conditions such as Tessadori-Bicknell-van Haaften NDD. These disorders are linked to germline variants in histone-encoding genes, which play a crucial role in early brain development (Clark2024NeuroTri2VISDOT:).

In cancer research, H4C3 has been identified as a potential biomarker for pancreatic cancer. Studies have shown that H4C3, along with other histone genes, is downregulated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation suggests a role in cancer pathogenesis, possibly through its involvement in chromatin organization and gene silencing (Jafari2022Screening).

Additionally, H4C3 has been identified as a novel gene-disease association in a pediatric cohort with chronic endocrine diseases, although specific details about its clinical significance in these conditions are not fully elucidated (Gippert2023Exome). The gene has also been suggested to have a potential role in spontaneous abortion, as indicated by its presence in regions with significant copy number variants (Liu2024Analysis).

## Interactions
H4C3, a histone protein, is involved in the formation of nucleosomes, which are essential for DNA packaging into chromatin. It interacts with other histones, such as H2A, H2B, and H3, to form the nucleosome core, playing a crucial role in chromatin structure and function. In the context of severe dental fluorosis, H4C3 is significantly upregulated and is connected to the ion channel protein CFTR through a network analysis, suggesting a potential regulatory relationship. CFTR is involved in ion transport and pH regulation, which may be relevant to the pathophysiology of dental fluorosis (Gavila2024Salivary).

In pancreatic cancer, H4C3 is identified as a differentially expressed gene, downregulated compared to normal tissues. It is part of a protein-protein interaction network involving histone proteins, which are implicated in cancer pathogenesis. The study highlights the role of histones in cancer, noting that histone H1 is a known cancer promoter and biomarker (Jafari2022Screening).

In human fibroblasts exposed to ionizing radiation and simulated microgravity, H4C3 is downregulated, indicating its involvement in DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation (Malatesta2024Differential).
