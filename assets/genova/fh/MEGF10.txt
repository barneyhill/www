# MEGF10

## Overview
The MEGF10 gene encodes the multiple EGF-like domains 10 protein, a type I transmembrane receptor involved in various cellular processes, particularly in muscle and neural tissues. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and an EMI domain, contributing to its role in cell adhesion and signal transduction (Callebaut2003EMI; Suzuki2007The). MEGF10 is crucial for myoblast proliferation and migration, interacting with pathways such as Notch1 to regulate muscle development and regeneration (Saha2017Consequences; Li2020Megf10). In the nervous system, it functions as an engulfment receptor, facilitating the clearance of apoptotic cells and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Hamon2006Cooperation). Mutations in MEGF10 are linked to congenital myopathies, highlighting its clinical significance in neuromuscular disorders (Boyden2012Mutations).

## Structure
The MEGF10 protein is a type I transmembrane receptor characterized by a complex molecular structure. It features an N-terminal extracellular domain with 17 atypical epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, each containing eight cysteine residues that likely form disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Boyden2012Mutations; Suzuki2007The). The extracellular domain also includes an EMI domain, which is involved in multimerization and is essential for forming the protein's unique mosaic-like adhesion pattern (Callebaut2003EMI; Suzuki2007The).

The intracellular domain of MEGF10 contains 13 tyrosine residues, which are potential sites for phosphorylation. This post-translational modification is crucial for signal transduction and interaction with phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain-containing adaptor proteins, such as GULP, the mammalian ortholog of CED-6 (Mitsuhashi2013Cysteine; Hamon2006Cooperation). The NPXY motif within the cytoplasmic domain is particularly important for these interactions (Hamon2006Cooperation).

MEGF10 is expressed in various tissues, including the central nervous system and muscle satellite cells, where it plays roles in phagocytosis and muscle development (Saha2017Consequences). Mutations in the EGF-like domains, such as p.C326R and p.C774R, can disrupt the protein's structure and function, leading to congenital myopathy (Boyden2012Mutations).

## Function
The MEGF10 gene encodes a type I transmembrane receptor protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in muscle and neural tissues. In muscle cells, MEGF10 is crucial for myoblast proliferation and migration, essential for muscle development and regeneration. It interacts with the Notch1 signaling pathway, which is vital for maintaining satellite cells in a quiescent state and contributing to their self-renewal and homing to target myofibers (Saha2017Consequences; Li2020Megf10). MEGF10's interaction with Notch1 involves its intracellular domain, and this interaction is disrupted by mutations affecting tyrosine phosphorylation (Saha2017Consequences).

In the nervous system, MEGF10 is involved in the engulfment of apoptotic cells, a process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and clearing apoptotic cells in healthy human cells. It functions as an engulfment receptor, similar to the CED-1 receptor in nematodes, and interacts with proteins like ABCA1 to modulate the engulfment process (Hamon2006Cooperation). MEGF10's role in phagocytosis and cell adhesion is supported by its structural features, including multiple EGF-like domains and an NPxY module for potential tyrosine phosphorylation, which suggest a role in signal transduction (Hamon2006Cooperation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MEGF10 gene are associated with a range of congenital myopathies, most notably early-onset myopathy, areflexia, respiratory distress, and dysphagia (EMARDD). These conditions are characterized by severe muscle weakness, respiratory impairment, and other neuromuscular symptoms (AlMuhaizea2021Phenotypic; Pierson2013Novel). Specific mutations, such as p.C326R and p.C774R, disrupt the protein structure by altering cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges, leading to misfolding and functional impairment (Boyden2012Mutations). These mutations are linked to clinical features like diaphragmatic weakness, areflexia, and dysphagia, with phenotypic severity varying among individuals (Boyden2012Mutations).

MEGF10 mutations can also lead to minicore myopathy, characterized by structural abnormalities in muscle fibers (Boyden2012Mutations). The gene's role in muscle satellite cells suggests that its deficiency impairs muscle regeneration, contributing to persistent muscle weakness (Li2020Megf10). In zebrafish models, MEGF10 mutations result in morphological abnormalities, supporting its role in muscle and craniofacial development (Boyden2012Mutations).

Therapeutic interventions are being explored, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like sertraline showing potential in ameliorating MEGF10 myopathy by modulating the Notch signaling pathway (Saha2019Selective).

## Interactions
MEGF10 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as phagocytosis and muscle regeneration. It interacts with the adaptor protein GULP, which is mediated by the NPxY motif, similar to the CED-1/CED-6 interaction in C. elegans, suggesting a conserved mechanism for apoptotic cell clearance (Hamon2006Cooperation). MEGF10 also interacts with the ATP binding cassette transporter ABCA1, which modulates MEGF10-dependent engulfment. This interaction is not stable but transient, affecting the oligomerization of ABCA1 and enhancing phagocytic competence (Hamon2006Cooperation).

In muscle regeneration, MEGF10 interacts with signaling intermediates such as TAOK2, TIMAP, and Grb10, influencing pathways like MAPK and Rac1, which are crucial for satellite cell function and myogenic progression (holterman2007identification). MEGF10's interaction with Rac1 is particularly important, as it affects actin remodeling and inhibits terminal differentiation of myogenic cells (holterman2007identification). These interactions highlight MEGF10's role as a signaling molecule in various cellular contexts.
