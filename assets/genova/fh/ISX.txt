# ISX

## Overview
The ISX gene encodes the intestine specific homeobox protein, a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of vitamin A metabolism and lipid transport within the intestine. As a member of the homeobox superfamily, ISX is characterized by its ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. The protein is particularly significant in maintaining vitamin A homeostasis by acting as a transcriptional repressor of the BCMO1 gene, which is responsible for converting dietary β-carotene into vitamin A (Lobo2013Genetics). Additionally, ISX influences lipid metabolism by repressing the SR-BI gene, which is involved in the absorption of dietary lipids (Lobo2010ISX). The expression of ISX is modulated by dietary vitamin A levels, highlighting its role in the interplay between dietary retinoids and intestinal lipid absorption (Lobo2010ISX). Beyond its metabolic functions, ISX is implicated in cancer biology, where it interacts with various signaling pathways to influence tumorigenesis and progression (Bui2023Interaction; Hsu2013Proinflammatory).

## Structure


## Function
The ISX (intestine specific homeobox) gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in regulating vitamin A metabolism and lipid transport in the intestine. ISX functions as a retinoic acid (RA)-inducible gene, directly controlled by retinoic acid receptors (RARs), which bind to the ISX promoter to regulate its expression (Lobo2010ISX). In healthy human cells, ISX acts as a transcriptional repressor of the BCMO1 gene, which is responsible for converting dietary β-carotene into vitamin A. This regulation is part of a feedback mechanism that maintains vitamin A homeostasis by preventing excessive production of vitamin A from β-carotene-rich diets (Lobo2013Genetics).

ISX also represses the expression of the SR-BI gene, which is involved in the absorption of dietary lipids, including cholesterol and fatty acids, thus playing a role in lipid metabolism (Lobo2010ISX). The expression of ISX is influenced by dietary vitamin A levels, being higher in vitamin A sufficiency and lower in deficiency, indicating its role in the crosstalk between dietary retinoids and intestinal lipid absorption (Lobo2010ISX). Through these mechanisms, ISX helps maintain vitamin A and lipid homeostasis, which is crucial for normal physiological functions.

## Clinical Significance
The ISX gene, a member of the homeobox superfamily, has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in regulating gene expression related to tumorigenesis. In gastric cancer, ISX expression is induced by Helicobacter pylori infection, potentially leading to carcinogenesis through the NF-κB pathway (Bui2023Interaction). In lung cancer, ISX interacts with acetylated proteins to regulate tumor initiation and metastasis, and its high expression is associated with poor survival in pancreatic cancer, particularly among women (Bui2023Interaction). In colorectal cancer (CRC), ISX serves as a predictive marker for recurrence or metastasis, especially in patients treated with cetuximab regimens. The ISX rs361863 polymorphism is linked to progression-free survival in CRC patients (Bui2023Interaction).

ISX also plays a role in vitamin A metabolism, acting as a transcriptional repressor of the Bcmo1 gene, which is involved in converting beta-carotene to vitamin A. Alterations in ISX expression can lead to changes in vitamin A homeostasis, potentially impacting health by causing inflammatory disorders (Lobo2013Genetics). The ISX rs5755368 polymorphism, particularly the AA genotype, combined with high retinol intake, is associated with reduced CRC risk (Bui2023Interaction).

## Interactions
The ISX protein, a transcription factor, is involved in several interactions with nucleic acids and proteins. It directly binds to the cyclin D1 promoter, specifically between the -260 and -272 bp region, enhancing cyclin D1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. This interaction is crucial for cell proliferation and tumor growth, as ISX knockdown leads to decreased expression of cyclin D1, CDK4, and E2F1, along with reduced cell proliferation and tumorigenic activity (Hsu2013Proinflammatory).

ISX also interacts with the Bcmo1 promoter, acting as a transcriptional repressor. It binds to specific regions within the Bcmo1 promoter, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. This binding is modulated by retinoic acid, which influences ISX's role in regulating vitamin A production from dietary beta-carotene (Lobo2013Genetics).

In the context of HCC, ISX expression is regulated by interleukin-6 (IL6) through NF-kB signaling. IL6 increases NF-kB binding activity on the ISX promoter, which is essential for ISX transcriptional activation (Hsu2013Proinflammatory). These interactions highlight ISX's role in both cancer progression and nutrient metabolism.
