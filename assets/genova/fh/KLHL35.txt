# KLHL35

## Overview
KLHL35 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 35, which is part of the kelch-like family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their role as substrate adaptors in E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which are essential for the ubiquitination and degradation of specific proteins, thereby regulating protein stability and function within cells (Shi2019Kelchlike). KLHL35 is predominantly expressed in the brain and is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cytoskeletal organization, and cell cycle regulation, through its interaction with Cullin3 in the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics; Shi2019Kelchlike). Despite its significant role in cellular mechanisms, the full extent of KLHL35's impact on organismal physiology remains to be fully understood (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics).

## Function
KLHL35 is a member of the kelch-like family of proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes through their role as substrate adaptors in E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. These complexes are crucial for the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of specific proteins, a process that regulates protein stability and function within the cell (Shi2019Kelchlike). KLHL35, like other kelch-like proteins, contains specific domains that facilitate its interaction with Cullin3, forming part of the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction is essential for targeting proteins for ubiquitination, thereby influencing cellular processes such as signal transduction, cytoskeletal organization, and cell cycle regulation (Shi2019Kelchlike).

In healthy human cells, KLHL35 is preferentially expressed in the brain, although it lacks observable intragenic enhancer chromatin, which is typically associated with tissue-specific gene expression (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). The protein's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other proteins to mediate its functions. Despite its involvement in these molecular processes, the specific organismal outcomes of KLHL35's activity in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics).

## Clinical Significance
KLHL35 has been implicated in various cancers and conditions through alterations in its expression and methylation patterns. In hepatocellular carcinoma and renal tumors, KLHL35 is associated with hypermethylation, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Cheng2018Epigenomewide; Markunas2016Maternal). In gastric cancer, specific CpG sites related to KLHL35 show significant correlations with gene expression, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Wang2021A).

KLHL35 is also identified as a risk factor in colon cancer prognosis models, where its expression is linked to poor outcomes (Hu2023Construction). In colorectal cancer with liver metastasis, higher expression levels of KLHL35 correlate with worse prognostic outcomes, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for metastasis (Zou2022MultiOmics).

In lung adenocarcinoma with TP53 mutations, KLHL35 is part of a prognostic indicator model, where its expression is negatively correlated with immune cell infiltrates, affecting survival outcomes (Fu2021A). Additionally, KLHL35 methylation changes have been linked to maternal age at delivery and parenting stress, although the health implications of these changes remain unclear (Markunas2016Maternal; Wright2017Parenting).
