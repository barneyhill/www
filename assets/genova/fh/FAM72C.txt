# FAM72C

## Overview
FAM72C is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 72, specifically member C. This protein is involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation, playing a crucial role during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. It is co-regulated with other cell cycle genes and shares transcription factor binding sites with key proteins, indicating its involvement in promoting cell proliferation, potentially through the RAS signaling pathway (Ho2021FAM72). The FAM72C protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it may contribute to DNA damage response and repair mechanisms. Despite its structural divergence from other family members, such as FAM72A, which affects its interaction with UNG2, FAM72C remains highly conserved, suggesting important functional roles or evolutionary pressures (Kisselev2024Evolutionary). The precise functions of FAM72C in normal human physiology are still under investigation.

## Function
FAM72C is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. It is co-regulated with other cell cycle genes during the G2/M phase, sharing transcription factor binding sites with proteins such as GATA2, E2F4, E2F6, and TFDP1. These transcription factors suggest a coordinated expression pattern that promotes cell proliferation, potentially linked to the RAS signaling pathway (Ho2021FAM72). FAM72C is implicated in maintaining cell proliferation and may have roles in neural differentiation, although it is not expressed in the central nervous system (Kisselev2024Evolutionary).

The protein encoded by FAM72C is primarily active in the nucleus, where it may interact with other proteins to facilitate DNA damage response and repair mechanisms. However, unlike FAM72A, FAM72C does not participate in UNG2 degradation due to structural differences, specifically the presence of an arginine instead of a tryptophan at a critical position, which inhibits its ability to bind to UNG2 (Kisselev2024Evolutionary). Despite this divergence, FAM72C is highly conserved, suggesting alternative functional roles or evolutionary pressures maintaining its presence (Kisselev2024Evolutionary). The specific function of FAM72C in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.
