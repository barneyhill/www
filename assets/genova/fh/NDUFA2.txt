# NDUFA2

## Overview
NDUFA2 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A2, a crucial component of Complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein plays a significant role in cellular respiration by facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, thereby contributing to the proton gradient necessary for ATP synthesis. As a subunit of Complex I, NDUFA2 is integral to the assembly and stabilization of this complex within the inner mitochondrial membrane, ensuring efficient energy production in cells (Dieteren2011Defective). Mutations in the NDUFA2 gene can lead to mitochondrial disorders, such as mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy and Leigh syndrome, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal mitochondrial function and its potential involvement in various disease mechanisms (Perrier2017Recessive; Hoefs2008NDUFA2).

## Function
NDUFA2 is a subunit of Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, playing a crucial role in cellular respiration. It facilitates the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, contributing to the proton gradient used for ATP synthesis. This protein is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, essential for energy production in cells (Dieteren2011Defective).

In healthy human cells, NDUFA2 is involved in the assembly and stabilization of Complex I. It is thought to reside in the matrix-protruding arm of Complex I, and its incorporation does not alter the expression and activity of the complex, indicating that it functions similarly to the endogenous protein (Dieteren2011Defective). Mutations in NDUFA2 can lead to Complex I deficiency, affecting the maintenance and stabilization of the complex, which is crucial for its proper function (Dieteren2011Defective).

NDUFA2's role in maintaining normal mitochondrial function is underscored by its involvement in the assembly pattern of nuclear DNA-encoded Complex I subunits. The presence of NDUFA2 at the height of holo Complex I suggests its importance in the assembly and stability of the complex (Dieteren2011Defective).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFA2 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders, primarily affecting the function of complex I in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. These mutations can lead to mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy, characterized by cystic white matter changes in the brain. Patients with this condition often present with complex I deficiency, as seen in cases with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in NDUFA2 (Perrier2017Recessive). Another condition linked to NDUFA2 mutations is Leigh syndrome, a severe neurodegenerative disorder. This syndrome is associated with complex I deficiency and is characterized by progressive neurological deterioration and specific MRI findings. Mutations in NDUFA2 can result in impaired splicing, leading to truncated proteins and disturbed assembly of complex I, contributing to the pathology of Leigh syndrome (Hoefs2008NDUFA2).

In some cases, patients with NDUFA2-related disorders exhibit unique MRI patterns, such as cavitating and tigroid-like leukoencephalopathy, without systemic biochemical abnormalities typical of mitochondrial disorders. These patients may experience regression in motor and verbal skills and develop seizures, highlighting the gene's role in neurodegenerative conditions (Alagia2020Cavitating).

## Interactions
NDUFA2 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is involved in the electron transport chain. It participates in various protein-protein interactions essential for its function. NDUFA2 is part of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network that includes other complex I subunits such as NDUFA4 and NDUFA10. This network also involves interactions with proteins like UQCRC1, NNT, ITPR3, SLC25A3, RAB5C, GFAP, IDH3A, UGGT1, and LMAN1, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of head and neck paragangliomas (HNPGLs) (Wang2021High).

In the context of mitochondrial complex I assembly, NDUFA2 interacts with other subunits such as NDUFA9, NDUFS2, NDUFS3, and ND1, forming part of a 480-kDa complex. This interaction is crucial during the assembly process of complex I, where NDUFA2 integrates into additional complexes (Lazarou2007Analysis).

NDUFA2 is also identified as a hub protein in protein interaction networks related to painful diabetic neuropathy, indicating its significant role in the network and potential involvement in various pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation (AmiriDashatan2024Introducing). These interactions highlight the importance of NDUFA2 in maintaining mitochondrial function and its potential involvement in disease mechanisms.
