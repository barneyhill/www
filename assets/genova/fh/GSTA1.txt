# GSTA1

## Overview
GSTA1, or glutathione S-transferase alpha 1, is a gene that encodes a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, specifically the alpha class of enzymes. These enzymes are crucial in the detoxification of endogenous and exogenous compounds by catalyzing the conjugation of reduced glutathione to a variety of electrophilic substrates. The GSTA1 protein is predominantly expressed in the liver, with additional expression in the kidney, intestine, and testis, playing a vital role in cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress and toxic insults (Board2013Glutathione; MartínezGuzmán2020Activation). Structurally, GSTA1 is a homodimeric enzyme, with each monomer featuring a thioredoxin fold in the N-terminal domain and an all-alpha helical C-terminal domain (Unknownauthors1994Review; Balogh2009Structural). Beyond its detoxification role, GSTA1 is involved in modulating stress responses and apoptotic pathways, interacting with proteins such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to influence cellular processes like proliferation and DNA repair (Romero2006Human). Variations in the GSTA1 gene have been associated with susceptibility to diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Parsons2001GSTA1; Akhdar2016The).

## Structure
The human GSTA1 protein is a dimeric enzyme, with each monomer consisting of 221 amino acid residues. The monomer has a two-domain structure: an N-terminal domain, which is the glutathione binding domain, comprising 81 residues, and a C-terminal domain that is predominantly α-helical, consisting of about 110 residues (Unknownauthors1994Review). The N-terminal domain features a thioredoxin fold, a common structural motif in the glutathione S-transferase family, while the C-terminal domain is characterized by an all-alpha helical structure (Balogh2009Structural).

The quaternary structure of GSTA1 is a homodimer, which is typical for enzymes in this family (Unknownauthors1994Review). The protein's active site includes specific residues such as Tyr9 and Arg15, which are crucial for its catalytic activity. Mutagenesis experiments have shown that replacing Tyr9 with Phe significantly reduces catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of this residue (Unknownauthors1994Review).

GSTA1 also features a hydrophobic pocket underneath the C-terminal α-helix, which accommodates substrates like S-benzyl-glutathione. This pocket includes residues such as Met208, Leu213, Ala216, Phe220, and Phe222, and can accommodate about 10 atoms (Unknownauthors1994Review). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, which can influence its function. Splice variants of GSTA1 can lead to different isoforms, potentially affecting its activity and substrate specificity.

## Function
GSTA1 (glutathione S-transferase alpha 1) is a crucial enzyme in detoxification processes, primarily active in the liver, but also expressed in the kidney, intestine, and testis. It catalyzes the conjugation of reduced glutathione (GSH) to a wide range of electrophilic compounds, including xenobiotics, carcinogens, and products of oxidative stress, facilitating their excretion from the body (MartínezGuzmán2020Activation; Board2013Glutathione). This activity is essential for cellular defense mechanisms, protecting cells from damage and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

GSTA1 also plays a significant role in modulating stress responses and apoptotic signaling pathways. It interacts with c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), reducing its activation and subsequent apoptosis in response to stressors such as UV irradiation and oxidative stress (Romero2006Human). This modulation of JNK signaling is crucial for cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, and DNA repair, highlighting GSTA1's role in maintaining cellular integrity (Romero2006Human).

In addition to its detoxification role, GSTA1 is involved in binding hydrophobic ligands, such as bilirubin and steroid hormones, indicating its physiological importance in healthy human cells (Board2013Glutathione).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GSTA1 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3957357C>T in the GSTA1 gene is associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in European individuals. The TT genotype of this SNP is more frequent in HCC patients and is linked to a two-fold increase in HCC risk. This SNP reduces GSTA1 transcriptional activity, and lower GSTA1 expression is associated with worse outcomes in HCC, including larger tumor size and poor prognosis (Akhdar2016The).

In end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, the GSTA1*A/A genotype, which is associated with higher enzyme levels, modifies the effect of the GSTM1-null genotype on cardiovascular mortality. This interaction suggests that GSTA1 may influence oxidative stress responses, impacting cardiovascular risks in these patients (Suvakov2014Associations).

GSTA1 expression is also implicated in prostate cancer. It is significantly higher in proliferative inflammatory atrophy compared to normal prostate tissue, but low in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma. This reduced expression may contribute to carcinogenesis due to a lack of detoxification and antioxidant activity (Parsons2001GSTA1).

## Interactions
GSTA1 (glutathione S-transferase alpha 1) is known to interact with various proteins, influencing cellular responses to stress. One significant interaction is with the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), where GSTA1 forms complexes that modulate JNK activation. This interaction is particularly evident in Caco-2 cells, where GSTA1 expression increases with cell confluency, leading to reduced JNK activation in response to stress stimuli such as IL-1β, UV light, and H2O2. The formation of GSTA1-JNK complexes is significantly higher in post-confluent cells, suggesting a stable binding that reduces JNK-mediated signaling and apoptosis (Romero2006Human).

GSTA1 also interacts with the chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil (CBL) in the presence of glutathione (GSH). This interaction involves the conjugation of CBL with GSH, catalyzed by GSTA1, forming a monoglutathionyl derivative. The structural analysis reveals that the GSH moiety forms specific interactions with GSTA1, while the CBL moiety shows high mobility, indicating a dynamic interaction at the enzyme's active site (Karpusas2013The). These interactions highlight GSTA1's role in modulating stress responses and drug metabolism.
