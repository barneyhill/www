# RPUSD2

## Overview
RPUSD2 is a gene that encodes the protein RNA pseudouridine synthase domain containing 2, which is a pseudouridine synthase enzyme. This enzyme is involved in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA, specifically catalyzing the conversion of uridine to pseudouridine, a process crucial for RNA stability, translation, and splicing. The protein is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing, thereby impacting protein synthesis and cellular function (Carlile2019mRNA). Additionally, RPUSD2 has been implicated in mitochondrial RNA interactions, suggesting a broader role in cellular RNA dynamics (van2019A). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various cellular processes and diseases, including its upregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Jin2022Integrative).

## Function
RPUSD2 is a pseudouridine synthase involved in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA, specifically the conversion of uridine to pseudouridine. This modification plays a crucial role in RNA stability, translation, and splicing. RPUSD2 has been identified as modifying 17 mRNA sites among 427 novel human mRNA pseudouridines, indicating its significant role in mRNA pseudouridylation (Carlile2019mRNA). The enzyme is active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing, impacting protein synthesis and cellular function.

The pseudouridylation process facilitated by RPUSD2 affects RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions, which are essential for proper gene expression (Carlile2019mRNA). This modification is irreversible, highlighting its importance in maintaining RNA integrity and function (Ding2024Implications). Although the specific function of RPUSD2 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its role in pseudouridylation suggests it is integral to the regulation of RNA structure and function, potentially influencing various cellular processes such as splicing and translation (Martinez2020Pseudouridine). Further research is needed to elucidate the complete range of RPUSD2's functions in normal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
RPUSD2 has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through its role in RNA pseudouridylation. Alterations in RPUSD2 expression, particularly its upregulation, have been observed in advanced or poorly differentiated HCC tissues, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic marker (Jin2022Integrative). Copy number variations (CNVs) of RPUSD2, specifically deletions, are associated with poor overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in HCC patients, indicating its prognostic significance (Jin2022Integrative). The expression of RPUSD2 is also positively correlated with tumor mutational burden (TMB), which may further influence cancer progression (Jin2022Integrative).

While the specific clinical significance of RPUSD2 mutations is not fully detailed, the gene's involvement in cancer pathogenesis is highlighted by its association with cell cycle regulation, transcription pathways, and metabolic disorders (Jin2022Integrative). The study of RPUSD2 in the context of HCC suggests that it may play a broader role in influencing the tumor microenvironment and immune response, although further research is needed to elucidate these mechanisms (Jin2022Integrative).

## Interactions
RPUSD2 is involved in RNA modification, specifically pseudouridylation, and is predicted to interact with mitochondrial RNA. The study by van Esveld et al. identified RPUSD2 as a potential mitochondrial RNA-binding protein, suggesting its involvement in mitochondrial RNA interactions (van2019A). Although RPUSD2 is not previously known as a mitochondrial protein, immunofluorescent data and predictions from MitoMiner support its mitochondrial localization, indicating possible interactions with mitochondrial RNA (van2019A).

In vitro assays have demonstrated that RPUSD2 can modify specific mRNA sites, indicating its role in pseudouridylation of mRNA (Carlile2019mRNA). This suggests that RPUSD2 may interact with mRNA molecules to facilitate pseudouridylation, a modification that can influence RNA stability and function. However, specific protein interactions involving RPUSD2 have not been detailed in the available studies, and further research is needed to elucidate its precise interaction partners and mechanisms.

RPUSD2 is also upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting a potential role in cancer-related pathways, although specific interactions in this context are not detailed (Jin2022Integrative). Overall, while RPUSD2 is implicated in RNA interactions, detailed protein interaction partners remain to be identified.
