# AMN1

## Overview
The AMN1 gene encodes the protein antagonist of mitotic exit network 1 homolog, which plays a critical role in the regulation of the mitotic exit network (MEN) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This protein functions as a regulatory antagonist, primarily interacting with key components of the MEN pathway to control cell cycle progression and post-mitotic cell separation. AMN1 exerts its effects by binding to the Tem1 GTPase, inhibiting its interaction with the Cdc15 kinase, and facilitating its degradation through the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex (Devault2021Downregulation; Jonkers2009Lessons). Additionally, AMN1 targets the transcription factor Ace2 for degradation, a process that is modulated by cell type-specific factors (Fang2018Amn1). Through these interactions, AMN1 is integral to the precise regulation of mitotic exit and cell separation, underscoring its importance in yeast cell cycle control (Fang2018Amn1).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
The AMN1 protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is involved in several key interactions that regulate the mitotic exit network (MEN) and post-mitotic cell separation. AMN1 physically interacts with the Tem1 GTPase, inhibiting its function by preventing its binding to Cdc15, a kinase in the MEN pathway (Jonkers2009Lessons; Fang2018Amn1). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of Tem1 after cytokinesis, as AMN1 competes with Cdc15 for Tem1 binding and facilitates Tem1's degradation through an SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box-containing complex) ubiquitin ligase (Devault2021Downregulation).

AMN1 also interacts with the transcription factor Ace2, targeting it for degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system. This interaction involves a specific 11-residue domain in Ace2, which is essential for its ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis (Fang2018Amn1). The regulation of Ace2 by AMN1 is cell type-dependent, with different outcomes in haploid and diploid cells due to the presence of the a1-α2 heterodimer, which influences AMN1 expression (Fang2018Amn1). These interactions highlight AMN1's role in controlling cell cycle progression and cell separation in yeast.
