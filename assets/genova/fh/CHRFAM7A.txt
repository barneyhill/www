# CHRFAM7A

## Overview
CHRFAM7A is a human-specific gene that encodes a fusion protein combining elements of the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNA7) and FAM7A. This fusion protein, known as Dupα7, is a transmembrane protein that forms part of a ligand-gated ion channel. It is characterized by its unique structure, which includes four transmembrane domains and a substitution of 146 amino acids from CHRNA7 with a 27 amino acid peptide from FAM7A (Costantini2014CHRFAM7A). Functionally, CHRFAM7A acts as a dominant-negative regulator of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, modulating neurotransmission and inflammation by altering receptor function and ligand binding properties (Araud2011The; Sinkus2015The). The gene's expression is linked to various neuropsychiatric and inflammatory disorders, making it a significant focus of research for its potential therapeutic implications (Ihnatovych2024Translational; Di2022The).

## Structure
The CHRFAM7A gene encodes a protein that is a fusion of the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNA7) and FAM7A. The primary structure of the CHRFAM7A protein includes a predicted 42-45 kDa protein, which differs from the original CHRNA7 by the substitution of 146 amino acids with a 27 amino acid peptide derived from FAM7A (Costantini2014CHRFAM7A). The protein consists of 384 amino acids and includes four transmembrane domains, forming part of a ligand-gated ion channel transmembrane region (Costantini2014CHRFAM7A).

The secondary and tertiary structures are not detailed in the available literature, but the protein is predicted to participate in the pentameric arrangement typical of ion channels, retaining ligand and bungarotoxin binding capabilities (Costantini2014CHRFAM7A). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a heteropentameric channel, potentially altering sensitivity to acetylcholine or affinity for other ligands (Costantini2014CHRFAM7A).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which affects the molecular weight of the protein (Costantini2014CHRFAM7A). The gene can transcribe at least 11 different mRNAs, with 8 being alternatively spliced variants, although specific details on these variants are limited (Costantini2014CHRFAM7A).

## Function
The CHRFAM7A gene is a human-specific fusion gene that plays a significant role in modulating the function of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR), which is involved in neurotransmission and inflammation regulation. CHRFAM7A acts as a dominant-negative regulator of α7 nAChR, reducing the amplitude of acetylcholine-evoked currents and affecting receptor function by decreasing the number of agonist binding sites (Araud2011The; Sinkus2015The). This modulation results in a hypomorphic receptor with reduced calcium influx and decreased channel open probability, impacting various signaling pathways related to neurotransmitter release and neuroprotection (Ihnatovych2024Translational).

In the immune system, CHRFAM7A is expressed in human leukocytes and influences leukocyte function and α7 nAChR-regulated inflammation. It affects cell adhesion, trafficking, and transformation, suggesting a role in the human immune response (Costantini2015A). CHRFAM7A is also involved in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, where it modulates immune responses and inflammation, potentially offering therapeutic implications for diseases with an inflammatory component (Ihnatovych2024Translational).

In the brain, CHRFAM7A is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and cognitive functions. It influences calcium signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics, contributing to neuronal plasticity and brain resilience (Ihnatovych2024Translational; Jakimovski2024Human).

## Clinical Significance
The CHRFAM7A gene, a partial duplication of the CHRNA7 gene, is clinically significant due to its association with various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Mutations and alterations in the expression of CHRFAM7A have been linked to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A specific 2bp deletion in exon 6 of CHRFAM7A is associated with schizophrenia, contributing to sensory processing deficits and poor episodic memory (Araud2011The; Sinkus2015The). This deletion is more prevalent in Caucasians and acts as a dominant negative regulator of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) function, which is crucial in neurotransmitter release and cognitive processes (Araud2011The; Sinkus2015The).

CHRFAM7A is also implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), where its expression affects inflammatory responses and cholinergic system function. Genetic variations in CHRFAM7A, such as copy number variations, are over-represented in patients with mild cognitive impairment and late-onset AD (Di2022The). In inflammatory disorders, CHRFAM7A plays a role in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, influencing outcomes in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and COVID-19 (Di2022The). The gene's complex interactions and expression levels highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in these diseases.

## Interactions
The CHRFAM7A gene encodes a protein that interacts with the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAchR) by forming heteropentamers, which alters the receptor's function and ligand binding properties. This interaction decreases the binding affinity of α-bungarotoxin (α-BTX) to α7nAchR, suggesting that CHRFAM7A modifies the receptor's ligand binding sites (Chan2019CHRFAM7A; Jiang2019Global). The CHRFAM7A protein, known as Dupα7, acts as a dominant-negative regulator of α7nAchR, potentially sequestering the receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum and preventing its proper assembly and surface expression (Araud2011The).

CHRFAM7A also influences the receptor's response to amyloid-beta (Aβ 42), with receptors containing Dupα7 subunits showing altered binding affinities and potentially providing resistance to Aβ 42-related toxicity (Liu2021Structure). The presence of Dupα7 subunits affects the stability and stoichiometry of the receptor complexes, with configurations containing more than three Dupα7 subunits being unstable and likely non-functional (Liu2021Structure). These interactions suggest that CHRFAM7A plays a significant role in modulating α7nAchR function, which may have implications for neuropsychiatric disorders and therapeutic strategies targeting these receptors.
