# RAB11FIP5

## Overview
RAB11FIP5 is a gene that encodes the RAB11 family interacting protein 5, a key player in intracellular trafficking processes. This protein is categorized as a trafficking protein and is involved in the regulation of endosomal recycling, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It interacts with the Rab11 GTPase, facilitating the transport of proteins and lipids from recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane. RAB11FIP5 is a component of the FERARI complex, which coordinates Rab GTPase function with membrane fusion, and is involved in Rab11-dependent recycling pathways (Solinger2018FERARI:; Wilson2022Proximity). The protein's structure includes a Rab11-binding domain and an N-terminal C2 domain, which are crucial for its interactions with other proteins, such as the ORF45 protein of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (Wei2020Host). Mutations in the RAB11FIP5 gene have been linked to various diseases, including autism spectrum disorder and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Roohi2008A; Park2016Whole-exome).

## Structure
RAB11FIP5, also known as Rab11 family interacting protein 5, is a protein involved in intracellular trafficking and is part of the RAB11 family of interacting proteins. It contains a Rab11-binding domain (RBD) that facilitates its interaction with the Rab11 GTPase, which is crucial for its role in endosomal recycling (Wei2020Host). The protein is characterized by an N-terminal C2 domain, spanning amino acid residues 16-127, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins, such as the ORF45 protein of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (Wei2020Host). This domain is critical for the protein's function, as its deletion abolishes the interaction with ORF45, affecting the release of KSHV particles (Wei2020Host).

RAB11FIP5 is known to homodimerize via a conserved C-terminal coiled-coil structure, which is a common feature among Rab11 family interacting proteins (Wei2020Host). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its function, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. Multiple splice variants of RAB11FIP5 exist, potentially altering its structure and function, but specific details on these isoforms are not mentioned in the provided context.

## Function
RAB11FIP5, also known as RAB11 family interacting protein 5, plays a crucial role in intracellular trafficking processes, particularly in endosomal recycling. It interacts with the RAB11 GTPase, facilitating the transport of proteins and lipids from recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Solinger2018FERARI:; Wilson2022Proximity). RAB11FIP5 is a component of the FERARI complex, which coordinates Rab GTPase function with membrane fusion, and is involved in the Rab11-dependent recycling from sorting endosomes to the plasma membrane (Solinger2018FERARI:).

In healthy human cells, RAB11FIP5 is involved in the regulation of endocytic recycling pathways, which are crucial for processes such as cell migration and invasion, particularly in environments with varying fibronectin levels (Wilson2022Proximity). It also plays a role in the selective recycling of certain cargoes, such as integrins, and is involved in the regulation of recycling pathways in cells (Wilson2022Proximity). Additionally, RAB11FIP5 is implicated in the lysosomal degradation of proteins, such as the ORF45 protein associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, by facilitating their translocation to lysosomes (Wei2020Host).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RAB11FIP5 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a study identified a de novo balanced translocation interrupting the RAB11FIP5 gene in a proband with Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS), a subtype of ASD. This translocation suggests that RAB11FIP5 may play a role in the pathogenesis of ASD, as the gene is involved in protein trafficking and neurotransmitter release at synaptic junctions (Roohi2008A).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), RAB11FIP5 has been identified as one of the recurrent mutations in patients with refractory disease. These genetic alterations may contribute to treatment resistance, highlighting the potential role of RAB11FIP5 in cancer progression and therapy response (Park2016Whole-exome).

The interaction between RAB11FIP5 and ARL13B is crucial for ciliary function, and disruptions in this interaction can lead to ciliopathies. The ARL13B-RAB11FIP5 complex is essential for axoneme polyglutamylation, which regulates ciliary signaling. Alterations in this pathway could contribute to diseases such as Joubert syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (He2018Axoneme).

## Interactions
RAB11FIP5, also known as Rab11 family-interacting protein 5, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular trafficking. It interacts with the small GTPase Rab11, playing a significant role in endosomal recycling (Wei2020Host). RAB11FIP5 also forms a complex with Rab11-FIP1 and the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), which is essential for the transcytosis of polymeric immunoglobulin A (pIgA) in polarized mucosal epithelial cells (Fan2021Rab11FIP1). This interaction is mediated by TRIM21, which facilitates the polyubiquitination of Rab11-FIP5, promoting the transport of the pIgR-pIgA complex to the Golgi apparatus (Fan2021Rab11FIP1).

RAB11FIP5 also interacts with the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) protein ORF45. This interaction promotes the lysosomal degradation of ORF45, inhibiting the release of KSHV particles (Wei2020Host). The C2 domain of RAB11FIP5 is crucial for binding to ORF45, and this interaction affects the localization of ORF45, promoting its degradation in lysosomes (Wei2020Host). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of RAB11FIP5 in cellular processes and its potential implications in viral infections.
