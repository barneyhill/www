# KCNK15

## Overview
KCNK15 is a gene that encodes the potassium two-pore domain channel subfamily K member 15, commonly referred to as TASK-5. TASK-5 is a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, which is characterized by its unique 4TM/2P topology, featuring four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains per subunit (Renigunta2015Much; Enyedi2010Molecular). Unlike other K2P channels, TASK-5 does not form functional homodimers but can form heterodimers with TASK-1 and TASK-3, which are other members of the TASK subfamily. These heterodimeric complexes are functional and play a role in modulating the gating properties and pharmacological characteristics of the channels (Rinné2024Potassium). TASK-5 is involved in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability, with its expression observed in various human tissues, including the heart, lung, and kidney (Rinné2024Potassium). The gene's expression and function have been implicated in several clinical contexts, including cancer, where alterations in KCNK15 expression levels have been associated with disease progression (Williams2013Altered; Zou2022Integrative).

## Structure
The KCNK15 gene encodes the TASK-5 protein, a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family. TASK-5 is characterized by a 4TM/2P topology, meaning it has four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains per subunit, typical of K2P channels (Renigunta2015Much; Enyedi2010Molecular). While TASK-5 does not form functional homodimers, it can form heterodimers with TASK-1 and TASK-3, which are other members of the TASK subfamily. These heterodimeric complexes are functional and can reach the plasma membrane, altering the pharmacological properties and surface expression of the channels (Rinné2024Potassium).

The TASK-5 protein is involved in modulating the gating properties of these channels, particularly through mutations at specific residues such as R7 and R131, which are crucial for the stabilization of the inner gate in TASK-1 (Rinné2024Potassium). A notable polymorphism, G95E, affects TASK-5's function by altering drug sensitivity and suppressing TASK-1 and TASK-3 currents, changing the selectivity filter sequence from GYG to EYG (Rinné2024Potassium). Despite its structural similarity to other TASK channels, TASK-5's functional expression is primarily observed in heterodimeric forms.

## Function
The KCNK15 gene encodes the TASK-5 channel, a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, which is involved in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability. TASK-5 is part of the acid-sensitive subfamily of K2P channels, which also includes TASK-1 and TASK-3. While TASK-5 is non-functional as a homodimer, it can form functional heterodimeric channel complexes with TASK-1 and TASK-3. These heterodimers are located at the plasma membrane and exhibit unique single-channel conductance properties, altered pharmacology, and sensitivity to TASK modulators (Rinné2024Potassium).

TASK-5 negatively modulates the surface expression of TASK channels and affects Gq-coupled receptor-mediated channel inhibition. This modulation is significant in tissues where these channels are co-expressed, such as the human heart, pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells, and respiratory neurons. The heteromerization of TASK-5 with TASK-1 and TASK-3 is essential for its transport to the plasma membrane, where it becomes part of functional channel complexes (Rinné2024Potassium).

The expression of TASK-5 mRNA has been observed in various human tissues, including the adrenal gland, pancreas, liver, kidney, lung, ovary, testis, and heart, suggesting a regulatory function in modulating the activity of other TASK channels (Rinné2024Potassium).

## Clinical Significance
KCNK15 has been implicated in various cancer types due to alterations in its expression levels. In breast cancer, KCNK15 is significantly overexpressed in ductal breast carcinomas, with studies showing a median p-value of 0.008 and a mean fold increase of 5.37, suggesting a potential role in the pathology of this cancer type (Williams2013Altered). Similarly, KCNK15 is upregulated in breast cancer cell lines and tissues, indicating its involvement in breast cancer progression (Zou2022Integrative).

In contrast, KCNK15 is underexpressed in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, with a median p-value of 0.043, highlighting its differential expression across cancer types (Williams2013Altered). The role of KCNK15 in pancreatic cancer is also notable, where its expression is regulated by the long non-coding RNA KCNK15-AS1. This regulation impacts the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation and survival (He2021ALKBH5-mediated).

These findings suggest that KCNK15 expression alterations may contribute to cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions. However, specific clinical associations with KCNK15 mutations or other diseases beyond cancer remain under investigation.

## Interactions
The KCNK15 gene encodes the TASK-5 protein, which is part of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family. TASK-5 was initially considered non-functional as a homodimer but has been shown to form functional heterodimers with TASK-1 and TASK-3, other members of the K2P family. These heterodimers are essential for TASK-5's surface expression, as TASK-5 lacks certain motifs that facilitate transport to the plasma membrane. The interaction with TASK-1 and TASK-3 allows TASK-5 to reach the plasma membrane and modulate the function of these channels, altering their pharmacological properties (Rinné2024Potassium).

TASK-5's interaction with TASK-1 and TASK-3 is significant for drug development, particularly for conditions like pulmonary arterial hypertension and atrial fibrillation. The TASK-5 G95E polymorphism, which acts in a dominant-negative manner, affects the functionality and drug sensitivity of TASK-1/TASK-5 heterodimers, potentially impacting drug response in individuals with this polymorphism (Rinné2024Potassium). These interactions highlight the importance of considering TASK-5 in clinical and pharmacogenomics studies, as well as its potential role in diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders (Rinné2024Potassium).
