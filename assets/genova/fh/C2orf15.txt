# C2orf15

## Overview
C2orf15 is a gene located on human chromosome 2 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 2 open reading frame 15. This gene is part of a category of hypothetical open reading frames, which have been identified through computational methods but lack extensive experimental validation. The protein encoded by C2orf15 is not yet well-characterized, and its specific biological functions and cellular roles remain largely unknown. Preliminary in silico analyses suggest that C2orf15 may be involved in transcriptional processes, although its coding potential is considered weak (Selvarajan2016Insilico). The study of C2orf15 is significant as it may contribute to understanding the broader roles of hypothetical genes in human growth, development, and cellular maintenance (Selvarajan2016Insilico). Further research, including experimental validation and advanced bioinformatics approaches, is necessary to elucidate the precise functions and interactions of the C2orf15 protein.

## Structure


## Function
C2orf15, located on human chromosome 2, is a gene with currently limited functional characterization. The study by Selvarajan suggests that C2orf15 has weak coding potential and is involved in transcription processes, although detailed functional annotation is lacking (Selvarajan2016Insilico). The gene is part of a group of hypothetical open reading frames that have been computationally analyzed to predict potential functions, but experimental validation is necessary to confirm these predictions (Selvarajan2016Insilico).

The research highlights the importance of understanding hypothetical genes like C2orf15, as they may play roles in growth, development, and maintenance of human cells (Selvarajan2016Insilico). While the specific molecular activities and cellular locations of the C2orf15 protein remain to be elucidated, the study underscores the potential for these genes to be involved in significant biological processes. Further analysis using techniques such as co-expression patterns and phylogenetic profiling could provide more insights into the function of C2orf15 (Selvarajan2016Insilico).
