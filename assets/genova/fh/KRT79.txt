# KRT79

## Overview
KRT79 is a gene that encodes keratin 79, a type II cytokeratin protein, which is a member of the intermediate filament family. This protein is primarily involved in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of epithelial cells, particularly in the skin and hair follicles. Keratin 79 is characterized by its central alpha-helical rod domain, which facilitates the formation of coiled-coil dimers and higher-order filament structures essential for cellular stability. The expression of KRT79 is notably higher in sebaceous gland-rich regions of the skin, contributing to the distinct barrier functions of these areas. Additionally, keratin 79 plays a role in epithelial cell differentiation and motility, influencing processes such as capillary morphogenesis and tissue regeneration. Alterations in KRT79 expression have been associated with various skin disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in dermatological research (Xu2023Multiomics; Béke2018Immunotopographical).

## Structure
Keratin 79 (KRT79) is a type II cytokeratin that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells. The primary structure of KRT79 consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This configuration is typical of intermediate filament proteins, allowing for the formation of stable coiled-coil dimers (Ho2022Update). 

The secondary structure of KRT79 is characterized by these coiled-coil motifs, which facilitate the dimerization process. These dimers can further assemble into antiparallel tetramers, which are the basic building blocks for the higher-order assembly of intermediate filaments (Ho2022Update). 

In terms of tertiary structure, KRT79, like other keratins, forms intermediate filaments that provide mechanical support to cells. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of these filaments through both longitudinal and lateral interactions, which are essential for the formation of a robust cytoskeletal network (Ho2022Update).

Post-translational modifications of KRT79 may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions within the cell. These modifications are common in keratins and play a role in regulating their assembly and disassembly dynamics (Ho2022Update).

## Function
KRT79, or keratin 79, is a type II keratin protein that plays a significant role in the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells. It is involved in the formation of intermediate filaments, which are crucial for providing mechanical support and resilience to cells, particularly in the skin and hair follicles. In healthy human skin, KRT79 is expressed at higher levels in sebaceous gland-rich (SGR) regions compared to sebaceous gland-poor (SGP) regions, contributing to the distinct barrier functions observed in these areas (Béke2018Immunotopographical). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular stability and tissue homeostasis.

KRT79 is also involved in the differentiation and motility of epithelial cells, playing a role in capillary morphogenesis and regeneration in newly migrating epithelial cell populations (Xu2023Multiomics). Its expression is critical for maintaining sebaceous stem cells, and its absence can lead to abnormalities in sebaceous and eyelid-lid glands. The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of epithelial tissues, influencing both cellular and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
KRT79 (keratin 79) has been implicated in several skin disorders due to its altered expression levels. In keratoconus (KC), an ocular disorder, KRT79 is edited with higher frequencies compared to healthy controls, suggesting a potential link to the disease's pathology. The study by Bortoletto et al. highlights that keratin proteins, including KRT79, are overexpressed in KC, although their precise role in the disease remains unclear (Bortoletto2023MetaAnalysis).

In basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the eyelid, KRT79 is among the genes with altered expression, indicating its potential involvement in the disease. The study by Yunoki et al. identified KRT79 as upregulated in BCC tissues compared to normal controls, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Yunoki2018Gene).

KRT79 expression is also altered in epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), a condition characterized by skin fragility. The study by Bchetnia et al. mentions KRT79 as one of the genes with altered expression in EBS subgroups, although the specific impact of these changes on the disease is not fully detailed (Bchetnia2011Expression). These findings underscore the clinical significance of KRT79 in various skin-related conditions.

## Interactions
KRT79, or keratin 79, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that contribute to its role in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells. In the context of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), KRT79 is part of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network that includes significant alterations in keratin family genes. This network analysis revealed that KRT79, along with other keratins, shows altered expression in normal sun-exposed skin, actinic keratosis, and cSCC tissues compared to normal non-sun-exposed skin (Zou2021Identification).

In the study of Inner Mongolia cashmere goats, KRT79 was identified as one of the proteins expressed specifically in guard hair. The PPI networks constructed using STRING software indicated interactions among several keratins, with KRT1 showing connections to KRT79. This suggests that KRT79 may play a role in the structural composition of hair fibers, although specific interactions involving KRT79 were not detailed (Zhang2023Labelfree).

In eosinophilic esophagitis, KRT79 expression is influenced by IL-13, a cytokine involved in allergic inflammation, which downregulates KRT79 along with other keratins. This highlights the role of KRT79 in the inflamed esophageal microenvironment (KC2015In).
