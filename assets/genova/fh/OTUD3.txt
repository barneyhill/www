# OTUD3

## Overview
OTUD3 is a gene that encodes the protein OTU deubiquitinase 3, a member of the deubiquitinating enzyme family characterized by its OTU (ovarian tumor) domain. This protein plays a critical role in the regulation of ubiquitin-dependent cellular processes by removing ubiquitin moieties from specific substrates, thereby modulating their stability and function. OTU deubiquitinase 3 is involved in various cellular pathways, including mTORC1 signaling, energy metabolism, and the PI3K-AKT pathway, contributing to its function as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts (Xu2023Deubiquitinase; Li2024OTUD3). The protein is expressed ubiquitously, with higher levels in neuro-derived tissues, and is primarily located in the cytoplasm, although it can also translocate to the nucleus (Xu2023Deubiquitinase). OTUD3's activity is regulated through post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and ubiquitylation, which influence its stability and enzymatic function (Zhang2020Ubiquitin; Zhang2020AcetylationDependent).

## Structure
OTUD3 is a deubiquitinase characterized by its OTU (ovarian tumor) domain and a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain. The OTU domain is crucial for its deubiquitinating activity, featuring a cysteine protease catalytic triad composed of cysteine, aspartate, and histidine residues, which is essential for its function (Xu2023Deubiquitinase). The UBA domain, consisting of 40 residues, is responsible for ubiquitin-binding functions (Xu2023Deubiquitinase).

The molecular structure of OTUD3 includes an N-terminal helix within its catalytic domain, which is important for its function as a deubiquitinase (Zhang2020AcetylationDependent). The crystal structure of the OTU domain highlights the S1 Ub-binding site, with key residues involved in binding identified as Asn136, Gln154, Trp160, Ile162, Tyr177, and Tyr183, which form hydrogen bonds, π-stacking, and hydrophobic interactions (Zhang2023Discovery).

OTUD3 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as acetylation at the Lys129 residue, which is crucial for its deubiquitinating activity (Zhang2020AcetylationDependent). The protein is also subject to ubiquitylation, specifically Lys48-linked ubiquitylation, which is associated with its degradation (Zhang2020Ubiquitin).

## Function
OTUD3 (OTU deubiquitinase 3) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is essential for cell growth and metabolism. OTUD3 achieves this by deubiquitinating KPTN, a component of the KICSTOR complex, thereby modulating the activity of the mTORC1 pathway without affecting KPTN protein levels (Li2024OTUD3). This regulation is important for maintaining controlled cell proliferation and metabolic balance, potentially acting as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting excessive cell growth (Li2024OTUD3).

OTUD3 also stabilizes the tumor suppressor protein PTEN, which inhibits the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, further contributing to its tumor suppressor functions (Li2024OTUD3). Beyond its role in mTORC1 signaling, OTUD3 is involved in energy metabolism, particularly glycolipid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, through the stabilization of PPARδ, a metabolism-associated factor (Xu2023Deubiquitinase). OTUD3 is expressed in all cells, with higher levels in neuro-derived tissues, and is mainly distributed in the cytoplasmic interstitial space bound to microtubules, although it can also enter the nucleus to mediate deubiquitination of nuclear substrates (Xu2023Deubiquitinase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OTUD3 gene are linked to various diseases. In cancer, OTUD3 plays a dual role, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context. In breast cancer, OTUD3 stabilizes the tumor suppressor proteins PTEN and p53, inhibiting tumor growth and proliferation (Xu2023Deubiquitinase; Pu2020Tumor). Conversely, in lung cancer, OTUD3 promotes tumorigenesis by stabilizing GRP78, a protein involved in cancer cell survival, and its high expression is associated with poor survival outcomes (Zhang2020Ubiquitin; Du2019The). In colorectal cancer, OTUD3 enhances the stability of YY1, promoting tumor progression and correlating with poor prognosis (Wu2024Phosphorylationdependent).

OTUD3 is also implicated in Parkinson's disease, where its deficiency leads to impaired motor coordination and neuronal degeneration due to disrupted iron metabolism and increased oxidative stress (Jia2022Deubiquitylase). The c.863G>A mutation in OTUD3 is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, affecting the gene's stability and catalytic activity, and increasing the risk of diabetic retinopathy (Xu2023Deubiquitinase). Additionally, OTUD3 is linked to inflammatory diseases like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and its interaction with specific noncoding RNAs affects conditions such as recurrent spontaneous abortion (Xu2023Deubiquitinase).

## Interactions
OTUD3 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. It stabilizes iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) by deubiquitinating it, which is crucial for maintaining intracellular iron balance and has implications in Parkinson's disease (Jia2022Deubiquitylase). OTUD3 also interacts with PTEN in the cytoplasm, stabilizing it and inhibiting tumor growth in breast cancer by negatively regulating the PI3K/p-AKT/mTOR pathway (Xu2023Deubiquitinase). In breast cancer cells, OTUD3 stabilizes the p53 protein by preventing its degradation through deubiquitination, counteracting the effects of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 (Pu2020Tumor).

OTUD3 is involved in the mTORC1 signaling pathway through its interaction with KPTN, a component of the KICSTOR complex. It deubiquitinates KPTN, affecting mTORC1 signaling without altering KPTN protein levels (Li2024OTUD3). OTUD3 also interacts with the transcription factor YY1 in colorectal cancer cells, stabilizing YY1 and affecting the expression of downstream target genes (Wu2024Phosphorylationdependent). Additionally, OTUD3 modulates the host antiviral response by interacting with MAVS, hydrolyzing Lys63-specific ubiquitin chains to repress MAVS aggregation and signaling (Zhang2020AcetylationDependent).
