# KCNH5

## Overview
KCNH5 is a gene that encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 5, also known as Kv10.2, which is a transmembrane protein belonging to the ether-a-go-go (EAG) subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels. These channels are integral to the regulation of neuronal excitability and play a significant role in the electrophysiological properties of the brain. The Kv10.2 protein is characterized by its structure, which includes six transmembrane segments that form both the voltage-sensing and pore domains, essential for the selective passage of potassium ions. Predominantly expressed in the adult central nervous system, particularly in excitatory neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, Kv10.2 is crucial for maintaining proper neuronal signaling and excitability. Mutations in KCNH5 have been associated with severe epileptic encephalopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodevelopmental disorders (Veeramah2013Exome; Happ2022Missense; Happ2023Neurodevelopmental).

## Structure
The KCNH5 gene encodes the Kv10.2 protein, a member of the voltage-gated potassium channel family, specifically the ether-a-go-go (EAG) subfamily. The protein structure includes six transmembrane segments (S1-S6), with the S1-S4 segments forming the voltage-sensing domain and the S5-S6 segments forming the pore domain, which is crucial for the selective passage of potassium ions (Happ2022Missense; Happ2023Neurodevelopmental). The voltage-sensing domain detects changes in membrane potential, triggering the opening or closing of the channel (Happ2023Neurodevelopmental).

The Kv10.2 channel is a homotetramer, meaning it is composed of four identical subunits, a common structural feature of voltage-gated potassium channels (Happ2023Neurodevelopmental). The protein shares 72% amino acid identity with KCNH1 (Kv10.1), and its structural modeling is based on the cryo-EM structure of Kv10.1, as the exact 3D structure of Kv10.2 has not been resolved (Happ2022Missense; Happ2023Neurodevelopmental).

Missense variants in the voltage-sensing and pore domains can lead to gain-of-function effects, which are associated with epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders (Happ2022Missense; Happ2023Neurodevelopmental). The protein is predominantly expressed in the adult central nervous system (Happ2023Neurodevelopmental).

## Function
The KCNH5 gene encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel EAG2/Kv10.2, which is part of the ether-a-go-go (EAG) subfamily of potassium channels. These channels are critical for controlling neuronal excitability and regulating electrophysiological properties in the brain. KCNH5 is predominantly expressed in excitatory neurons in the upper layer IV of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, where it plays a role in controlling the electrical coupling between cell bodies and distal dendrites (Happ2022Missense; Happ2023Neurodevelopmental).

The Kv10.2 protein consists of four transmembrane domains (S1-S4) that make up the voltage-sensing domain and two transmembrane domains and a reentrant loop (S5-S6) that comprise the pore module. This structure is typical of potassium channels, which are essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential and shaping action potentials in neurons (Happ2022Missense; Happ2023Neurodevelopmental). The channel's function is crucial for maintaining proper neuronal signaling and excitability, which is essential for normal brain function (Happ2023Neurodevelopmental).

KCNH5 channels are involved in regulating cell excitability by allowing potassium ions to flow along their electrochemical gradient upon membrane depolarization. This process is vital for normal synaptic and neuronal function, preventing hyperexcitability and maintaining proper neuronal signaling (Allen2020Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNH5 gene have been linked to severe epileptic encephalopathy. A specific nonsynonymous mutation, resulting in a p.Arg327His substitution, disrupts a conserved arginine residue in the S4 transmembrane segment of the Kv10.2 channel, which is crucial for its voltage sensor function. This disruption affects the channel's role in neuronal excitability, contributing to the development of epilepsy (Veeramah2013Exome).

KCNH5 is the first member of the eag-related subfamily H to be associated with epilepsy. Eag K+ channels, including KCNH5, are selectively expressed in layer IV of the cerebral cortex, particularly in excitatory interneurons, and are implicated in synaptic plasticity. The mutation in KCNH5 leads to a loss-of-function phenotype, similar to the convulsion-like phenotype observed in Drosophila, which underscores its role in maintaining normal neuronal function (Veeramah2013Exome).

While other potassium channel genes, such as KCNA1, KCNQ2, and KCNQ3, have been previously associated with epilepsy, KCNH5's involvement highlights the genetic heterogeneity and complexity of epilepsy-related disorders (Veeramah2013Exome).
