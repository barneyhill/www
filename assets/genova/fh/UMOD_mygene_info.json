This protein may act as a constitutive inhibitor of calcium crystallization in renal fluids. Excretion of this protein in urine may provide defense against urinary tract infections caused by uropathogenic bacteria. Defects in this gene are associated with the renal disorders medullary cystic kidney disease-2 (MCKD2), glomerulocystic kidney disease with hyperuricemia and isosthenuria (GCKDHI), and familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy (FJHN). Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.
