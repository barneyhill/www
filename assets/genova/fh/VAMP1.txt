# VAMP1

## Overview
VAMP1, or vesicle-associated membrane protein 1, is a gene that encodes a member of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein family, which is integral to the process of vesicle fusion in cellular transport mechanisms. The protein product of VAMP1, also known as synaptobrevin, is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, facilitating neurotransmitter release at neuronal synapses. This function is critical for synaptic transmission and muscle contraction, underscoring its importance in neural communication. VAMP1 is predominantly localized in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, where it interacts with other SNARE proteins, such as syntaxin and SNAP-25, to form a complex essential for vesicle docking and fusion. Mutations in the VAMP1 gene have been linked to neurological disorders, including congenital myasthenic syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Ohno2023Clinical; Sevlever2015Geneticallycontrolled).

## Structure
VAMP1 (vesicle associated membrane protein 1) is a member of the SNARE protein family, which plays a crucial role in vesicle fusion. The primary structure of VAMP1 consists of a single polypeptide chain with a hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a soluble cytosolic portion, making it amphiphilic (Yassine2010Effect). The secondary structure of VAMP1 includes both α-helices and β-sheets, with transitions between these structures observed under varying conditions, such as changes in surface pressure and lipid composition (Yassine2010Effect). 

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices, and the quaternary structure includes interactions with other SNARE proteins to form a complex essential for vesicle fusion. VAMP1 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may affect its function in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. 

VAMP1 has splice variant isoforms, including VAMP-1A and VAMP-1B. VAMP-1B is an alternatively spliced form that differs from VAMP-1A by the carboxy-terminal sequence, which includes a mitochondrial targeting signal. This isoform is targeted to mitochondria due to its unique sequence, which includes a shortened hydrophobic membrane anchor and additional charged residues (Isenmann1998A).

## Function
VAMP1 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 1) is a crucial component of the SNARE complex, which is essential for the fusion of vesicles with target membranes, a process vital for neurotransmitter release in synaptic transmission. In healthy human cells, VAMP1 is primarily active in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, where it facilitates synaptic vesicle exocytosis, thereby playing a significant role in neural communication and muscle contraction (Sevlever2015Geneticallycontrolled).

VAMP1 is involved in vesicular transport processes, where it contributes to the targeting and fusion of transport vesicles to their target membranes. This function is critical for maintaining synaptic homeostasis and plasticity, as it ensures the proper release of neurotransmitters at synaptic junctions (Isenmann1998A). The protein's activity is not limited to synaptic vesicles; it also plays a role in the exocytosis of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathology (Sevlever2015Geneticallycontrolled).

The localization of VAMP1 is intrinsic to its function, with its carboxy-terminal hydrophobic sequence anchoring it to specific cellular membranes. This precise localization is essential for its role in vesicular trafficking and the fusion of vesicles with their target membranes (Isenmann1998A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VAMP1 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, most notably congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). CMS is characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, and myasthenia from birth or early infancy. Patients with VAMP1-CMS often exhibit symptoms such as external ophthalmoplegia and bulbar palsy, with clinical features including decremental and incremental CMAP responses to low- and high-frequency RNS, respectively (Ohno2023Clinical). Biallelic loss-of-function variants of VAMP1 lead to a neonatal onset of CMS, as seen in animal models where Vamp1-deficient mice show significant shrinkage of the motor endplate and reduced endplate potentials (Ohno2023Clinical).

Recessive mutations in VAMP1, such as frameshift and nonsense mutations, result in severe CMS with symptoms like generalized hypotonia, muscle weakness, and developmental delays. These mutations impair presynaptic neuromuscular junction transmission, leading to profound muscle weakness and feeding difficulties (Polavarapu2021Recessive).

Altered VAMP1 expression is also implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Genetic variations in VAMP1, such as the rs2072376 polymorphism, are associated with altered expression levels, potentially affecting Aβ secretion and contributing to Alzheimer's disease susceptibility (Sevlever2015Geneticallycontrolled).

## Interactions
VAMP1, also known as synaptobrevin, is a vesicle-associated membrane protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic vesicle docking, activation, and fusion. It is a key component of the SNARE complex, interacting specifically with t-SNAREs such as syntaxin and SNAP-25 to form a stable complex essential for vesicle transport and fusion in neuronal synapses (Söllner1993A). This complex can also bind synaptotagmin, which acts as a 'clamp' to prevent fusion in the absence of a signal, and is displaced by a-SNAP, allowing NSF to bind and hydrolyze ATP, leading to the disassembly of the SNARE complex and initiation of membrane fusion (Söllner1993A).

VAMP1 specifically binds to the cytoplasmic domains of syntaxin 1A and 4, but not to syntaxin 2 or 3, indicating a role in the specificity of vesicular trafficking (Calakos1994ProteinProtein). The interactions between VAMP1 and syntaxins are mediated by coiled-coil domains, which are crucial for the specific matching of v-SNAREs with t-SNAREs (Söllner1993A). Additionally, VAMP1 interacts with VAP-33, a broadly expressed protein that binds to VAMP and is involved in vesicle fusion beyond neuronal cells (WEIR1998Identification).
