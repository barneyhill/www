# LYRM9

## Overview
LYRM9 is a gene that encodes the protein LYR motif containing 9, which is part of the LYRM family known for its involvement in mitochondrial function. The LYRM9 protein is associated with mitochondrial ribosomes and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes, suggesting a role in the assembly and function of mitochondrial protein complexes (Angerer2015Eukaryotic; Pei2021Human). Although the specific functions of LYRM9 in human cells are not fully understood, it is predicted to interact with mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, such as MRPL57, indicating a potential role in regulating translation and other ribosome-related activities (Pei2021Human). Experimental evidence suggests that LYRM9 is part of the NDUFAB1 interactome, yet knockout studies indicate that it may not be critical for the mitochondrial proteome under certain conditions, pointing to possible redundant or condition-specific roles (Dibley2020The). Further research is needed to clarify the functional significance of LYRM9 within mitochondrial processes.

## Function
LYRM9 is a protein associated with mitochondrial function, specifically within the context of mitochondrial ribosomes and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes. It is part of the LYRM (leucine/tyrosine/arginine motif) family, which is known for its involvement in the assembly and function of mitochondrial protein complexes (Angerer2015Eukaryotic; Pei2021Human). Although the precise function of LYRM9 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, it is predicted to interact with mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, such as MRPL57, suggesting a potential role in the regulation of translation and other mitochondrial ribosome-related functions (Pei2021Human).

Experimental studies have shown that LYRM9 is enriched in the NDUFAB1 interactome, indicating its involvement in mitochondrial processes. However, knockout studies suggest that LYRM9 might not play a critical role in the mitochondrial proteome under certain conditions, as its absence did not significantly impact the overall mitochondrial protein profile (Dibley2020The). This suggests that LYRM9 may have redundant or condition-specific roles in mitochondria, potentially contributing to the stability or assembly of mitochondrial complexes without being essential under all circumstances (Dibley2020The).

## Interactions
LYRM9, a member of the LYRM protein family, is involved in mitochondrial processes and has been identified to interact with several proteins. Notably, LYRM9 is predicted to interact with MRPL57, a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, with a RoseTTAFold score of 0.907, although the AlphaFold2 scores for this interaction are low. This suggests a potential role for LYRM9 in the regulation of translation and other functions related to mitochondrial ribosomes (Pei2021Human).

Additionally, LYRM9 has been shown to interact with NDUFAB1, a protein essential for cell viability and separate from its role as a subunit of complex I. This interaction was identified through affinity-enrichment quantitative mass spectrometry (AE-MS), where LYRM9 was specifically enriched in the NDUFAB1 pull-down, indicating a potential interaction (Dibley2020The). Despite these interactions, knockout studies of LYRM9 suggest that its absence does not significantly alter the mitochondrial proteome, implying a potentially non-essential role in the processes studied (Dibley2020The). These findings highlight the need for further research to fully elucidate the functional significance of LYRM9's interactions within the mitochondrial context.
