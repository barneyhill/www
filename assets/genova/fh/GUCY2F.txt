# GUCY2F

## Overview
GUCY2F is a gene that encodes the protein guanylate cyclase 2F, retinal (GC-F), which is a member of the guanylate cyclase family. This protein is predominantly expressed in the retina and plays a critical role in the phototransduction pathway, which is essential for vision. GC-F is a transmembrane protein that functions as a homodimer and is involved in the synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The protein's activity is regulated by guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs) in a calcium-dependent manner, which is crucial for the recovery of photoreceptors to their dark state after light exposure (Kuhn2016Molecular). Mutations in GUCY2F are linked to X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative retinal disease, underscoring the gene's importance in maintaining retinal health and function (StiebelKalish2012Gucy2f).

## Structure
The GUCY2F gene encodes a protein that is part of the guanylate cyclase family, specifically expressed in the retina. The protein structure includes a transmembrane domain, which separates the extracellular and intracellular portions, and an intracellular domain that contains a juxtamembranous protein kinase-homology domain (KHD) and a cGMP-forming cyclase domain (Kuhn2016Molecular). The KHD is similar to protein kinases but does not exhibit kinase activity, playing a crucial role in signal transduction (Kuhn2016Molecular). 

The protein is a homodimer, with each subunit consisting of a polypeptide chain of approximately 1,050 amino acids (Kuhn2016Molecular). The structure of GUCY2F shares common features with other particulate guanylyl cyclases, including a COOH-terminal catalytic domain and a proline-rich COOH-terminal portion specific to retinal guanylyl cyclases, which may aid in protein interactions and compartmentalization in photoreceptors (Kuhn2016Molecular). 

Although specific post-translational modifications for GUCY2F are not detailed, guanylyl cyclases often undergo phosphorylation. The gene may also produce different isoforms through alternative splicing, although specific variants are not described in the provided context.

## Function
GUCY2F encodes a retinal guanylyl cyclase, specifically known as GC-F, which plays a crucial role in the phototransduction process in the retina. This protein is primarily localized in the outer segments of rod photoreceptors, where it is involved in the synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) (Kuhn2016Molecular). cGMP acts as a secondary messenger that regulates ion channels, facilitating the conversion of light into electrical signals, which is essential for vision (Kuhn2016Molecular).

GC-F functions as a homodimer and is activated in a calcium-dependent manner by guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs), which modulate its activity in response to changes in intracellular calcium levels (Kuhn2016Molecular). This regulation is vital for the recovery of photoreceptors to their dark state after light exposure, ensuring proper visual function (Kuhn2016Molecular). While GC-F is primarily associated with rod photoreceptors, it also plays a role in maintaining photoreceptor viability, with some compensatory function for GC-E in rods (Kuhn2016Molecular). The precise roles of GC-F outside the retina remain less understood (Kuhn2016Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GUCY2F gene are associated with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease characterized by progressive vision loss. This condition results from the disruption of the phototransduction pathway in retinal cells, where GUCY2F plays a crucial role. Alterations in the expression or function of GUCY2F can lead to retinal dystrophies, affecting the normal visual processes and contributing to the degeneration of retinal structures.

Research using zebrafish models has provided insights into the clinical significance of GUCY2F. The zebrafish ortholog, Gucy2f, has been studied to understand its role in vision and its potential link to human retinal diseases. Knockdown experiments in zebrafish have shown that reduced expression of Gucy2f leads to impaired visual acuity and retinal dystrophy, mirroring the effects seen in human conditions like Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) when GUCY2D, a related gene, is mutated (StiebelKalish2012Gucy2f). These findings suggest that similar mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of diseases associated with GUCY2F mutations, highlighting the importance of this gene in maintaining retinal health and function (StiebelKalish2012Gucy2f).
