# HRH3

## Overview
The HRH3 gene encodes the histamine receptor H3, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in the central nervous system by modulating neurotransmitter release. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, and is primarily expressed in the brain, where it functions as an inhibitory presynaptic receptor. The histamine H3 receptor is involved in regulating the release of several neurotransmitters, including histamine, dopamine, and serotonin, thereby influencing various physiological processes such as arousal, attention, and learning (NietoAlamilla2016The; Lovenberg1999Cloning). The HRH3 gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that can vary in function (Bongers2007Molecular). Alterations in HRH3 expression and function have been implicated in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis and autism spectrum disorder, as well as in cancer progression (Krementsov2013Histamine; Janikowska2023Histaminergic; Wright2017Altered).

## Structure
The HRH3 gene encodes the human histamine H3 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven transmembrane (TM) domain structure. The receptor includes an extracellular amino terminus (NT) and an intracellular carboxyl terminus (CT), with three extracellular (ECL) and three intracellular (ICL) loops (NietoAlamilla2016The). The primary structure of the HRH3 protein consists of 445 amino acids (Wiedemann2002StructureofthehumanhistamineH3receptorgene(HRH3)andidentificationofnaturallyoccurringvariations page 1 of 2). 

The secondary structure is typical of GPCRs, featuring alpha helices that span the cell membrane. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, forming a binding site crucial for ligand interaction. Key residues such as Asp114 and Glu206 are involved in ligand binding, particularly with histamine (NietoAlamilla2016The).

The HRH3 receptor undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at Asn11 and palmitoylation at Cys428, which facilitates the formation of helix 8 (NietoAlamilla2016The). The receptor also forms a disulfide bond between Cys107 and Cys188 (NietoAlamilla2016The).

The HRH3 gene produces multiple isoforms through alternative splicing, affecting regions such as the N-terminal tail, transmembrane domains, and the third intracellular loop (Bongers2007Molecular). These isoforms can vary in function and may not activate typical H3R signaling pathways (NietoAlamilla2016The).

## Function
The HRH3 gene encodes the histamine H3 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. This receptor plays a critical role in modulating neurotransmitter release, including histamine, dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and acetylcholine, by functioning as an inhibitory presynaptic receptor. It regulates neurotransmitter release by inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity, which in turn reduces cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in neurons (Lovenberg1999Cloning).

The H3 receptor is primarily active in the brain, with high expression levels in regions such as the thalamus and caudate nucleus. It acts as an autoreceptor for histamine, controlling histamine turnover, and as a heteroreceptor in neurons containing other neurotransmitters (Takahashi2002Targeted; Lovenberg1999Cloning). This receptor's activity is crucial for maintaining normal brain functions related to arousal, attention, and learning, and it has been implicated in regulating sleep-wake cycles, cognition, and appetite (Morisset2000High).

The H3 receptor's modulation of neurotransmitter release and its involvement in various physiological processes highlight its importance in maintaining homeostasis within the central nervous system (Takahashi2002Targeted).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the HRH3 gene, which encodes the histamine receptor H3, have been implicated in various neurological and autoimmune disorders. In the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), the HRH3 gene is associated with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS. The gene's polymorphisms, such as the G293D mutation, have been linked to differences in disease susceptibility between mouse strains, suggesting a role in autoimmune disease progression (Krementsov2013Histamine). HRH3 signaling is involved in the neurogenic control of immune responses, and its modulation could potentially prevent MS progression by limiting new lesion formation (Krementsov2013Histamine).

In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), altered expression of HRH3 and other histamine signaling genes has been observed, indicating a potential link to the condition's pathophysiology. The gene set including HRH3 showed significant alterations in expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals with ASD, suggesting its involvement in neuroinflammation and microglial regulation (Wright2017Altered).

In colorectal cancer, HRH3 expression is decreased across all cancer stages compared to normal tissues, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Janikowska2023Histaminergic).

## Interactions
The histamine H3 receptor (HRH3) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that primarily interacts with Gi/o proteins, leading to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and a subsequent decrease in cAMP levels. This interaction affects various biological responses, including neurotransmitter release and gene expression (Bongers2007Molecular). HRH3 can also activate phospholipase A2, resulting in the release of arachidonic acid, which plays a role in tissue relaxation (Bongers2007Molecular). 

HRH3 is involved in activating the Akt/GSK-3b kinases through phospho-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) activation via Gbg-subunits of Ga i/o proteins, which is independent of Src/EGF receptor transactivation and MAP kinase activation. This signaling pathway is implicated in neuronal migration and protection against apoptosis (Bongers2007Molecular). 

The receptor's interactions with ligands, such as histamine and ciproxifan, involve specific binding sites and structural dynamics. These interactions are characterized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, which are crucial for receptor activation and stabilization (HerreraZúñiga2020Molecular). The receptor's conformational changes are also influenced by lipid interactions, which stabilize its state (HerreraZúñiga2020Molecular).
