# HTRA2

## Overview
HTRA2 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial serine protease known as HtrA serine peptidase 2, or Omi. This protein is a member of the HtrA family of serine proteases, characterized by their serine protease and PDZ domains, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity and protein-protein interactions, respectively (Li2002Structural; Gray2000Characterization). HtrA2 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of apoptosis and cellular stress responses by interacting with and degrading inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), thereby facilitating caspase activation and promoting cell death (Hegde2002Identification; Yang2003OmiHtrA2). The protein is also involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, as evidenced by its interactions with components of the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) complex (Botham2019Global). Mutations in the HTRA2 gene have been linked to various neurodegenerative and mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as Parkinson's disease and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type VIII (Gurusamy2024Biallelic; Unal2014Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The HTRA2 gene encodes a mitochondrial serine protease involved in apoptosis and cellular stress response. The mature HtrA2 protein consists of 458 amino acids and includes a serine protease domain and a PDZ domain (Li2002Structural; Gray2000Characterization). The serine protease domain features a catalytic triad composed of His198, Asp228, and Ser306, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Singh2011The; Chakraborty2022Unraveling). The PDZ domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and substrate recognition, playing a crucial role in regulating protease activity (Li2002Structural; Singh2011The).

Structurally, HtrA2 forms a homotrimer, with each monomer comprising seven alpha-helices and 19 beta-strands, adopting a chymotrypsin-like fold (Li2002Structural; Singh2011The). The trimerization is mediated by the serine protease domain, with the PDZ domains positioned at the base of the trimer (Li2002Structural; ZurawaJanicka2017Structural). The PDZ domain's peptide-binding groove is occupied in the inactive conformation, restricting access to the catalytic site (Li2002Structural; ZurawaJanicka2017Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and the presence of splice variants contribute to the functional diversity of HtrA2 (Gray2000Characterization). The protein's structure and activity are tightly regulated, with conformational changes in the active site loops playing a significant role in its activation (Merski2017Molecular).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HTRA2 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative and mitochondrial disorders. Biallelic variants in HTRA2 have been linked to 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type VIII (MGCA8), a rare mitochondrial disorder characterized by symptoms such as lactic acidemia, brain atrophy, and disturbed mitochondrial structure. Patients with MGCA8 often exhibit increased apoptosis sensitivity, abnormal mitochondria, and infantile neurodegeneration, with clinical features resembling Leigh syndrome, including neonatal-onset symptoms, neurodevelopmental delay, and early lethality (Gurusamy2024Biallelic; Oláhová2016Pathogenic).

In adults, mutations in HTRA2 have been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). The p.G399S mutation, for instance, is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased protease activity, contributing to the pathogenesis of PD. This mutation has been observed in individuals with essential tremor and Parkinson's disease, suggesting a genetic link between these conditions (Unal2014Mitochondrial). The role of HTRA2 in PD is supported by studies showing that its loss of function increases sensitivity to apoptosis and affects mitochondrial dynamics, although the exact mechanisms remain controversial (Oláhová2016Pathogenic).

## Interactions
HTRA2, also known as Omi, is a mitochondrial serine protease that plays a significant role in apoptosis through its interactions with various proteins. It interacts with inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) such as XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP2, disrupting their ability to inhibit caspases, which are crucial for the execution of apoptosis (Hegde2002Identification; Vande2008The). The interaction with XIAP is mediated by the AVPS motif of HTRA2, which is essential for binding and promoting apoptosis by enhancing caspase-9 activity (Hegde2002Identification).

HTRA2 is released from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm during apoptosis, where it can cleave and degrade IAPs, thereby facilitating caspase activity and promoting cell death (Yang2003OmiHtrA2). It also interacts with the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) complex, particularly with components like IMMT, suggesting a role in maintaining mitochondrial cristae structure (Botham2019Global). The protease activity of HTRA2 is crucial for its function, as it can cleave specific substrates such as IMMT, indicating its involvement in regulating mitochondrial structure and function (Botham2019Global).
