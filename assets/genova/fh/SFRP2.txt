# SFRP2

## Overview
SFRP2, or secreted frizzled-related protein 2, is a gene that encodes a member of the secreted frizzled-related protein family, which plays a crucial role in modulating the Wnt signaling pathway. The protein product of SFRP2 is characterized by its ability to act as a Wnt antagonist, primarily by binding to Wnt ligands and preventing their interaction with Frizzled receptors, thereby influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Jones2002Secreted; Galli2006Differential). SFRP2 is involved in various physiological processes, including bone formation and skeletal stem cell differentiation, and has been implicated in the regulation of the extracellular matrix (de2021Secreted; Sercan2010Expression). Clinically, SFRP2 is significant due to its role in cancer, where its expression is often altered through promoter hypermethylation, leading to its inactivation in several cancer types, such as breast, colorectal, and gastric cancers (Veeck2008Promoter; Cheng2007Frequent). This dual role in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions underscores the importance of SFRP2 in cellular signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Structure
SFRP2 is a member of the secreted frizzled-related protein family, characterized by its role in modulating Wnt signaling. The protein is composed of 295 amino acids, making it the smallest among the SFRP family, with a theoretical molecular weight of approximately 33.5 kDa (Jones2002Secreted). The primary structure of SFRP2 includes a signal peptide sequence at the N terminus, which is rich in hydrophobic residues, facilitating its secretion (Jones2002Secreted).

The protein contains a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), also known as the Frizzled domain, which spans 120 amino acids near the N terminus and includes 10 conserved cysteines. This domain is crucial for potential interactions with Wnt ligands (Jones2002Secreted). The CRD shares homology with the Frizzled receptors, suggesting a role in ligand binding (Jones2002Secreted).

Towards the C-terminal region, SFRP2 features a netrin-like domain, which shows homology to the axonal guidance protein netrin and may play a role in inhibiting extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (Jones2002Secreted). Potential post-translational modifications of SFRP2 include glycosylation, particularly in the C-terminal half (Jones2002Secreted). The protein may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
SFRP2 (secreted frizzled-related protein 2) is a member of the SFRP family, which modulates the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical pathway involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. SFRP2 functions primarily as a Wnt antagonist by binding to Wnt ligands, thereby preventing their interaction with Frizzled receptors. This regulation is essential for maintaining tissue development and homeostasis (Galli2006Differential). In the context of bone marrow-derived skeletal stem cells (BMSCs) and skeletal stem cells (SSCs), SFRP2 acts as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling, enhancing osteogenic differentiation and bone formation. It is highly expressed in a subset of multipotent BMSCs, indicating its significant role in skeletal stem cell self-renewal and differentiation during bone healing (de2021Secreted).

SFRP2 is also involved in the extracellular matrix, influencing various cellular functions. In bone marrow, its expression is not constitutive and may vary due to factors like donor age or hormonal status (Sercan2010Expression). Despite its role in modulating Wnt signaling, SFRP2's specific function in healthy human cells remains less clear, as its expression is not consistently observed in all bone marrow samples (Sercan2010Expression).

## Clinical Significance
SFRP2 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in the Wnt signaling pathway. In breast cancer, SFRP2 is frequently inactivated by promoter hypermethylation, leading to reduced expression. This epigenetic alteration is observed in a high percentage of breast cancer cases and is associated with increased proliferation rates in breast cell lines, suggesting a tumor suppressive role for SFRP2 (Veeck2008Promoter). In colorectal cancer, SFRP2 promoter methylation is also a significant factor, with its silencing linked to cancer progression. Treatment with demethylating agents can restore SFRP2 expression, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Boughanem2024Identification; Surana2014Secreted).

In gastric cancer, SFRP2 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression frequently silenced by promoter methylation. Restoration of SFRP2 expression in gastric cancer cell lines can suppress tumor growth and induce apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cheng2007Frequent). SFRP2's role in cancer is complex, as it can exhibit both tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting activities depending on the cancer type and context (Surana2014Secreted).

## Interactions
SFRP2 (secreted frizzled-related protein 2) is known to interact with various components of the Wnt signaling pathway, influencing both canonical and non-canonical pathways. It acts as an antagonist to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by binding to Wnt ligands, such as Wnt3a, and preventing their interaction with Frizzled receptors. This interaction inhibits the accumulation of β-catenin, thereby modulating cell proliferation and migration (Lan2024SFRP2; Galli2006Differential). SFRP2 is a potent inhibitor of Wnt3a, achieving significant inhibition at low concentrations, which highlights its role in regulating Wnt signaling (Galli2006Differential).

In the context of the tumor microenvironment, SFRP2 interacts with WNT16B, enhancing its signaling capabilities. This interaction is facilitated by the formation of receptor complexes involving Frizzled receptors and LRP6 co-receptors on cancer cell surfaces, promoting β-catenin stability and nuclear translocation. This synergistic effect contributes to therapeutic resistance and cancer progression (Sun2016SFRP2). SFRP2's expression is regulated by the NF-κB complex, which binds to motifs in the SFRP2 promoter region, indicating a transcriptional regulation mechanism under genotoxic stress (Sun2016SFRP2). These interactions underscore SFRP2's role in modulating Wnt signaling and its potential impact on cancer and other diseases.
