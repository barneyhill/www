# GRM3

## Overview
The GRM3 gene encodes the glutamate metabotropic receptor 3 (mGlu3), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in neurotransmission. As a member of the Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGlu3 is primarily involved in modulating synaptic glutamate levels, which is crucial for maintaining proper neurotransmission and cognitive functions (Ribeiro2017Metabotropic; Niswender2010Metabotropic). The receptor is predominantly expressed in astrocytes and is integral to the regulation of glutamate transporters, influencing pathways that promote neuroprotection and synaptic homeostasis (Aronica2003Expression; Egan2004Variation). Beyond its neurological roles, GRM3 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including schizophrenia and certain cancers, where its mutations and expression levels can affect disease progression and therapeutic responses (Prickett2011Exon; Yi2017The).

## Structure
The GRM3 gene encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGlu3), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in neurotransmission. The primary structure of mGlu3 includes a sequence of amino acids forming the receptor protein, with a large extracellular N-terminal domain known as the Venus flytrap domain (VFT) that binds glutamate (Gregory2020International; Niswender2010Metabotropic). This domain consists of two lobes that enclose the ligand in a cleft, inducing conformational changes necessary for receptor activation (Niswender2010Metabotropic).

The receptor's secondary structure includes seven transmembrane alpha-helical domains typical of GPCRs, which are crucial for signal transduction across the cell membrane (GarcíaBea2017A). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of these domains, facilitating interactions with G proteins (Niswender2010Metabotropic). The quaternary structure of mGlu3 includes its assembly as a constitutive dimer, which is important for its function (Niswender2010Metabotropic).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may affect receptor function and signaling (Gregory2020International). GRM3 also undergoes alternative splicing, producing isoforms like GRM3Δ4, which lacks the transmembrane domain and may act as a negative modulator of the full-length receptor (GarcíaBea2017A).

## Function
The GRM3 gene encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), which is a G-protein coupled receptor involved in modulating synaptic glutamate levels, crucial for neurotransmission in the brain. mGluR3 is primarily expressed in astrocytes and plays a significant role in regulating the expression of the glial glutamate transporter EAAT2, essential for the removal of synaptic glutamate and maintaining proper neurotransmission (Egan2004Variation). This receptor is part of Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors, which are involved in inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity, thereby reducing cAMP levels and influencing various signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways, which promote neuroprotection (Ribeiro2017Metabotropic).

mGluR3 is also implicated in the regulation of glutamate transporter proteins GLAST and GLT-1 in astrocytes, where its activation increases their expression, contributing to glutamate uptake and homeostasis in the brain (Aronica2003Expression). The receptor's activity is crucial for cognitive processes, as it affects prefrontal and hippocampal physiology, influencing cognition and potentially impacting the risk for schizophrenia (Egan2004Variation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GRM3 gene have been implicated in several cancers, including melanoma and colon cancer. In melanoma, GRM3 is frequently mutated, with a notable hotspot at p.Glu870Lys. These mutations lead to increased cell proliferation and migration, contributing to melanoma tumorigenesis. Mutant GRM3 activates the MEK1/2 pathway, enhancing cell migration and proliferation, and is associated with increased sensitivity to MEK inhibitors like AZD-6244, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Prickett2011Exon).

In colon cancer, GRM3 is significantly upregulated, interacting with the TGFβ signaling pathway. This interaction antagonizes TGFβ-mediated tumor suppressor functions, promoting tumorigenesis. GRM3 expression is regulated by miR-487b-3p, which suppresses its translation. Alterations in this regulatory axis contribute to colon cancer progression, making GRM3 a promising target for treatment (Yi2017The).

GRM3 has also been studied in the context of schizophrenia, where polymorphisms in the gene have been investigated for associations with the disorder. However, a meta-analysis found no significant association between GRM3 polymorphisms and schizophrenia risk in the overall population (Yang2015Association).

## Interactions
GRM3, or glutamate metabotropic receptor 3, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are significant for its function in neurotransmission. One notable interaction is with its isoform mGlu3Δ4, which lacks exon 4 and is implicated in schizophrenia. This isoform can exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms and primarily localizes to cell membranes. It physically interacts with the canonical mGlu3 receptor, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction reduces the binding of the selective mGlu2/3 antagonist [3H]LY341495 to mGlu3, suggesting that mGlu3Δ4 acts as a negative modulator of mGlu3. This modulation is associated with a decreased abundance of mGlu3 in the membrane, without a compensatory increase in the cytoplasm (GarcíaBea2017A).

The interaction between mGlu3 and mGlu3Δ4 may alter receptor function through mechanisms such as altered intracellular trafficking or heterodimerization, which are known to affect G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activity (GarcíaBea2017A). These interactions are significant for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying schizophrenia and the potential therapeutic targeting of GRM3 (GarcíaBea2017A).
