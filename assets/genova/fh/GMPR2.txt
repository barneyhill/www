# GMPR2

## Overview
GMPR2, or guanosine monophosphate reductase 2, is a gene that encodes the enzyme guanosine monophosphate reductase 2, which is a crucial component of nucleotide metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as an oxidoreductase and is primarily involved in the conversion of guanosine monophosphate (GMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP) using NADPH as a cofactor. The GMPR2 protein is characterized by a (β/α)8 barrel structure, which is essential for its enzymatic function, and it forms a homotetramer in its active state (Li2006Crystal; Patton2011Cofactor). The activity of GMPR2 is vital for maintaining the balance of purine nucleotide pools within cells, thereby influencing DNA and RNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and differentiation (Hedstrom2012The). The enzyme's preference for NADPH over NADH and its ability to function in high ammonia environments underscore its role in cellular homeostasis and adaptability (Patton2011Cofactor).

## Structure
The human GMPR2 protein is characterized by a (β/α)8 barrel structure, a common motif in many enzymes, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Li2006Crystal; Patton2011Cofactor). The primary structure of GMPR2 consists of 338 amino acid residues, forming a monomer that includes 11 α-helices and 14 β-sheets (Li2006Crystal). The protein forms a homotetramer, with dimensions of 85 Å x 85 Å x 50 Å, and the monomers interact along their edges, particularly between the α6 of one subunit and the α8 of the next, as well as along their N and C termini (Li2006Crystal).

The active site of GMPR2 is located at the C-terminal ends of the β sheets, featuring a catalytic Cys residue within the sequence motif GIGPGSICTT on the loop between β6 and α6 (Hedstrom2012The). Specific interactions within the active site include hydrogen bonds between Asp219 and Met240, and between Cys186 and Gly183 (Li2006Crystal). A disulfide bond between Cys68 and Cys95 may contribute to the stabilization of the tetramer (Li2006Crystal).

GMPR2 exhibits a preference for NADPH over NADH, with the cofactor binding site showing distinct conformations that influence the enzyme's catalytic activity (Patton2011Cofactor). The protein may have different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which could affect its function and regulation (Bairagya2020Structural).

## Function
GMPR2 (guanosine monophosphate reductase 2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in nucleotide metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of guanosine monophosphate (GMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP) in the presence of NADPH. This reaction is essential for maintaining the balance of purine nucleotide pools within the cell, which is crucial for DNA and RNA synthesis (Hedstrom2012The; Patton2011Cofactor). GMPR2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it helps regulate purine nucleotide levels, impacting cell proliferation and differentiation (Hedstrom2012The).

The enzyme operates through a (β/α)8 barrel structure, with a catalytic site that facilitates the deamination of GMP. This process involves a ternary complex formation with GMP and NADPH, where the hydride transfer is a rate-limiting step (Hedstrom2012The). The presence of NADPH induces a conformational change necessary for the deamination reaction, highlighting the importance of cofactor mobility in determining the reaction outcome (Patton2011Cofactor).

GMPR2's activity is significant in environments with high ammonia concentrations, where it can efficiently synthesize GMP from IMP and ammonia, bypassing the need for other enzymes like IMPDH and GMPS (Patton2011Cofactor). This function is particularly relevant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting life in ammonia-rich environments.
