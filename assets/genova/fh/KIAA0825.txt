# KIAA0825

## Overview
KIAA0825 is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which has been implicated in the development of postaxial polydactyly, a condition characterized by the presence of extra digits. The KIAA0825 protein is not yet fully characterized in terms of its specific biological function, but it is known to interact with other proteins, such as C1orf16, suggesting a role in cellular processes related to limb development (Ahmad2023Identification). Structural studies have identified several variants within the KIAA0825 gene that lead to significant alterations in the protein's structure and interactions, potentially affecting its function and contributing to the manifestation of polydactyly (Hayat2020Identification). These findings underscore the importance of KIAA0825 in developmental biology and its clinical relevance in genetic disorders affecting limb formation.

## Structure
The KIAA0825 protein is associated with postaxial polydactyly and has been studied for its structural characteristics. The primary structure of KIAA0825 includes a novel missense variant identified in exon 19, which is classified as a variant of uncertain significance (Ahmad2023Identification). This variant is predicted to cause significant changes in the protein's secondary structure, potentially affecting its function (Hayat2020Identification). Structural modeling using I-TASSER has shown that the wildtype and mutant KIAA0825 proteins have a low identity percentage and do not completely superimpose, indicating alterations in the tertiary structure (Ahmad2023Identification).

The interaction of KIAA0825 with other proteins is also affected by these structural changes. Docking analysis revealed that the mutant KIAA0825 protein interacts differently with the interactor C1orf16, forming more hydrogen bonds compared to the wildtype, which suggests alterations in the quaternary structure (Ahmad2023Identification). The leucine at position 17 is highly conserved across species, highlighting its importance in maintaining the protein's structural integrity (Hayat2020Identification). These structural insights suggest that variants in KIAA0825 may contribute to its role in limb development and the manifestation of polydactyly.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KIAA0825 gene have been linked to postaxial polydactyly type A (PAPA), a condition characterized by the presence of extra digits. Several studies have identified different types of mutations in KIAA0825 that contribute to this phenotype. Yao et al. discovered novel compound heterozygous splice site variants, c.-1-2A>T and c.2247-2A>G, in a fetus with PAPA. These variants disrupt normal splicing, leading to truncated proteins and suggesting a significant role for KIAA0825 in the development of PAPA (Yao2022Prenatal).

Hayat et al. identified a novel biallelic missense variant, c.50T>C, resulting in a p.(Leu17Ser) amino acid change, which is associated with PAPA in a family. This variant causes significant changes in the protein's secondary structure, potentially impairing its function (Hayat2020Identification).

Ullah et al. reported two rare homozygous variants, c.591dupA and c.2173A>T, which lead to premature termination codons and are predicted to result in loss-of-function due to nonsense-mediated decay. These findings further support the involvement of KIAA0825 in PAPA (Ullah2019Variants).

These studies highlight the clinical significance of KIAA0825 mutations in limb development and their contribution to the PAPA phenotype.

## Interactions
The KIAA0825 protein has been shown to interact with the protein C1orf16. Structural modeling using I-TASSER revealed that the wildtype KIAA0825 protein interacts with C1orf16 through three hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges. In contrast, a missense variant in KIAA0825, identified in a study of a family with postaxial polydactyly, alters these interactions. The mutant form of KIAA0825 interacts with C1orf16 via seven hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges, indicating significant changes in interaction dynamics due to the mutation (Ahmad2023Identification). These alterations in protein interactions may contribute to the disease phenotype observed in the affected family members. The specific role of these interactions in cellular processes or signaling pathways remains to be fully elucidated, as the function of KIAA0825 is not well-characterized. However, the interaction changes suggest a potential impact on protein stability and function, which could be relevant to the development of limb abnormalities associated with the gene (Ahmad2023Identification).
