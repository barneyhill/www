# HOXA1

## Overview
HOXA1 is a gene that encodes the homeobox A1 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the HOX family, which plays a pivotal role in early embryonic development and cellular differentiation. The HOXA1 protein is characterized by its homeodomain, a structured DNA-binding domain that facilitates its function in regulating gene expression patterns essential for morphogenesis and differentiation (Bondos2020Contextdependent; Rezsohazy2015Cellular). This protein is involved in the development of cranial structures and neural tissues, and its expression is typically restricted to specific regions in healthy human cells, such as the basal and suprabasal cells of the oral epithelium (Bitu2012HOXA1). HOXA1's interactions with other proteins, such as PBX1 and O-GlcNAc transferase, underscore its complex regulatory roles in cellular processes (Draime2018The; Fernandez2008The). Clinically, mutations and dysregulation of HOXA1 are associated with various genetic disorders and cancers, highlighting its significance in both developmental biology and disease pathology (Li2018Overexpressed; Wang2024Role).

## Structure
The HOXA1 protein is characterized by a high degree of intrinsic disorder, with many disordered regions outside its homeodomain (Lambert2010Pentapeptide). The homeodomain is a well-structured DNA-binding domain essential for both DNA-binding and transcriptional activation, folding into a triple helicoidal structure (Rezsohazy2015Cellular). The N-terminal region of HOXA1 is crucial for transcriptional activation and shares sequence conservation with other Hox proteins, interacting with specific partner proteins and general transcription factors (Lambert2010Pentapeptide). The C-terminal region, rich in serine, threonine, and proline, modulates the protein's transactivation potential and is predicted to be disordered, with phosphorylation sites for CKII and PKC (Lambert2010Pentapeptide).

The hexapeptide sequence in HOXA1 is critical for interaction with Pbx proteins, and mutations in this region can lead to loss of function (Lambert2010Pentapeptide). The protein's structure allows for cooperative DNA binding with Pbx proteins, which is essential for its function (Remacle2004Loss). The study of pentapeptide insertions in HOXA1 revealed its permissiveness to such modifications, with most insertions having no apparent effect on its activity, except those in the homeodomain, which led to a severe loss of function (Lambert2010Pentapeptide).

## Function
HOXA1 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in early embryonic development, particularly in the development of the head and cranial structures. It is part of the HOX family of genes, which are crucial for establishing body patterns during embryogenesis. HOXA1 is involved in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival, contributing to the proper formation of body segments and organs (Wang2024Role). In healthy human cells, HOXA1 expression is typically limited to specific regions, such as the basal and suprabasal cells of the normal oral epithelium, where it helps maintain tissue homeostasis (Bitu2012HOXA1).

HOXA1 functions as a transcription factor by binding to DNA through its homeodomain, influencing the expression of genes involved in morphogenesis and differentiation (Bondos2020Contextdependent). It is active in the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression patterns essential for neural and craniofacial development (Wang2024Role). The gene's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its involvement in developmental processes underscore its importance in normal physiological functions (Bitu2012HOXA1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the HOXA1 gene are implicated in several genetic disorders and diseases. HOXA1-related syndromes, such as Bosley-Salih-Alorainy Syndrome, are characterized by facial weakness, hearing impairment, and cardiac malformations, predominantly affecting Middle Eastern populations (Wang2024Role). Athabascan Brain Dysgenesis Syndrome, primarily affecting Native Americans, includes symptoms like mental retardation and heart defects (Wang2024Role). In autism research, the HOXA1 A218G polymorphism has been studied for its potential link to head circumference variations, though its association with autism remains debated (Wang2024Role).

HOXA1 is also involved in various cancers. Its upregulation is observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, and glioblastoma, where it often promotes tumor growth and metastasis (Wang2024Role). In glioblastoma, the long non-coding RNA HOTAIRM1 upregulates HOXA1, contributing to tumor growth and invasion (Li2018Overexpressed). HOXA1's involvement in cancer is linked to its role in several signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K-AKT, which are crucial in cancer development and progression (Wang2024Role).

## Interactions
HOXA1, a transcription factor, engages in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in gene regulation and cellular processes. It interacts with the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) protein, where the N-terminal portion of HOXA1, particularly the 11-His repeat and a sequence between residues 71 and 199, are essential for this interaction. The tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of OGT is necessary for maintaining this interaction, which occurs primarily in the nucleus when both proteins are intact (Draime2018The).

HOXA1 also forms complexes with other homeobox proteins, such as PBX1, through its hexapeptide motif. The truncated version of HOXA1, Hoxa1-399, can interact with Hoxa1-993 and PBX1, forming a trimeric complex that modulates the activity of Hoxa1-993 and PBX1 by affecting their DNA binding ability (Fernandez2008The).

The poly-histidine motifs in HOXA1 facilitate interactions with cysteine-rich proteins, such as MDFI, RBCK1, and TRAF2. These interactions are influenced by the length of the poly-histidine repeat and require metal ions, which are crucial for the regulatory role of HOXA1 in transcriptional activity (Marchese2024A).

HOXA1 also interacts with the estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) in the nucleus, with the homeodomain of HOXA1 being critical for this interaction (Belpaire2021HOXA1).
