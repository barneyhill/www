# H2BC15

## Overview
The H2BC15 gene encodes the H2B clustered histone 15 protein, which is a member of the histone H2B family. Histones are fundamental components of chromatin, playing a critical role in the organization and regulation of DNA within the nucleus. The H2B clustered histone 15 protein is involved in the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes, thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene expression. This protein's function is essential for maintaining genomic stability and regulating transcriptional activity. Alterations in the expression or function of H2BC15 have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential role in oncogenesis and as a target for therapeutic intervention (Yin2022Drug; Hwang2023Unveiling).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The H2BC15 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), significant sex differences in the expression of genes related to the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint and homology-directed repair, including H2BC15, have been observed in patients over 60. This suggests a potential role for H2BC15 in the differential response to DNA damage in ESCC, with drugs like decitabine and MK1775 showing stronger inhibitory effects on male-derived ESCC cell lines (Yin2022Drug).

In the context of prostate cancer, H2BC15 has been identified as a direct interactor with FOXA1, a gene associated with oncogenesis. This interaction highlights the potential involvement of H2BC15 in the molecular landscape of prostate cancer, although specific mutations or expression alterations in H2BC15 were not detailed (Hwang2023Unveiling).

While the role of H2BC15 in other diseases is not explicitly detailed, its involvement in chromatin structure and gene expression suggests that alterations in its function could contribute to various pathologies, particularly those involving dysregulated gene expression and chromatin remodeling. However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from H2BC15 mutations or expression changes remain to be fully elucidated.
