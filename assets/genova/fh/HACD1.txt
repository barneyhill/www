# HACD1

## Overview
The HACD1 gene encodes the enzyme 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 1, which is a crucial component of the fatty acid elongation process, specifically involved in the dehydration step of very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) synthesis. This enzyme is categorized as a dehydratase and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it interacts with other components of the fatty acid elongation machinery, including elongases and reductases (Konishi2010Characterization; Blondelle2015HACD1). The protein plays a significant role in the synthesis of membrane lipids, such as phospholipids and sphingolipids, which are essential for maintaining cellular membrane composition and fluidity. HACD1 is highly expressed in skeletal muscles and the heart, underscoring its importance in muscle development and function. Mutations or altered expression of HACD1 have been linked to various muscle-related disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Blondelle2015HACD1; Wei2022A; Jabbarpour2023Identification).

## Function
The HACD1 gene encodes the enzyme 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 1, which plays a critical role in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) within the endoplasmic reticulum. This enzyme specifically catalyzes the dehydration step in the fatty acid elongation cycle, a crucial process for the synthesis of membrane lipids such as phospholipids and sphingolipids (Konishi2010Characterization; Blondelle2015HACD1). VLCFAs are essential for various cellular processes, including maintaining membrane composition and fluidity, which are vital for myoblast fusion and skeletal muscle growth (Blondelle2015HACD1).

HACD1 is highly expressed in skeletal muscles and the heart, indicating its significant role in these tissues (Jabbarpour2023Identification). In muscle cells, HACD1 is involved in regulating lipid balance by reducing lysophosphatidylcholine content, an inhibitor of myoblast fusion, and promoting the increase of monounsaturated fatty acids, which enhances membrane fluidity and facilitates myoblast fusion (Blondelle2015HACD1). The enzyme's activity is crucial for normal muscle development and regeneration, as it supports the proper fusion of myoblasts into myotubes, thereby contributing to muscle fiber growth and maintenance (Blondelle2015HACD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HACD1 gene are associated with several muscle-related disorders. In both humans and dogs, HACD1 deficiency leads to congenital myopathies characterized by muscle weakness and fiber size disproportion. This is due to impaired myoblast fusion, which results in early-onset hypotrophy of myofibers (Blondelle2015HACD1). In Labrador Retrievers, an insertion mutation in the HACD1 gene causes centronuclear myopathy, marked by skeletal muscle atrophy and a deficiency in type II muscle fibers (Kihara2012Very).

In humans, a point mutation in the HACD1 gene has been implicated in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), a heart disease characterized by the gradual loss of right ventricular myocardium. Although the mutation was found in affected individuals, it was also present in normal controls, and the mutant protein exhibited normal enzyme activity, suggesting that its role in ARVD is not fully understood (Kihara2012Very).

Altered expression of HACD1 has also been linked to cancer. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), higher expression levels of HACD1 correlate with worse prognosis and reduced sensitivity to the drug sunitinib, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Wei2022A).

## Interactions
HACD1, a protein involved in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids, interacts with several components of the fatty acid elongation machinery. It is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and forms part of a complex with elongases (ELOVL1-7) and reductases (KAR and TER), which are essential for the elongation process (Konishi2010Characterization; Blondelle2015HACD1). Both the wild type and the K64Q mutant of HACD1 maintain these interactions, indicating that the mutation does not disrupt the formation of the elongase complex (Konishi2010Characterization).

In myogenic cells, different isoforms of HACD1, including HACD1-FL, HACD1-D5, and HACD1-167, also localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and interact with other proteins of the elongation complex. However, HACD1-D5 does not interact with TER (Blondelle2015HACD1). HACD1-FL is particularly important for muscle development, as it catalyzes the dehydration of 3-hydroxypalmitoyl-CoA and is necessary for myoblast fusion, a process crucial for muscle fiber growth (Blondelle2015HACD1). These interactions highlight HACD1's role in modulating lipid composition and membrane fluidity, which are vital for cellular processes such as myoblast fusion and muscle regeneration (Blondelle2015HACD1).
