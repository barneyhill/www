# AIRIM

## Overview
The AIRIM gene encodes the AFG2 interacting ribosome maturation factor, a protein that plays a critical role in the biogenesis of ribosomes. This protein is primarily involved in the maturation of ribosomal subunits, a process essential for efficient cellular protein synthesis. AIRIM interacts with AFG2, a protein linked to mitochondrial ribosome assembly, suggesting its involvement in the formation of multiprotein complexes necessary for ribosome assembly. The dynamic nature of AIRIM's interactions, potentially with other ribosomal proteins or RNA components, underscores its significance in maintaining the integrity and functionality of ribosomes within the cell (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
AIRIM, or AFG2 interacting ribosome maturation factor, is involved in ribosome biogenesis through its interactions with AFG2, a protein associated with mitochondrial ribosome assembly. This interaction suggests that AIRIM plays a role in the maturation of ribosomal subunits, potentially by participating in multiprotein complexes essential for this process. AIRIM may also engage in transient interactions with other ribosomal proteins or RNA components during ribosome assembly, indicating its dynamic role in ribosome biogenesis. These interactions are crucial for the proper assembly and function of ribosomes, highlighting AIRIM's importance in cellular protein synthesis.
