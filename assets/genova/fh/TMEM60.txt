# TMEM60

## Overview
TMEM60, or transmembrane protein 60, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology, where it has been implicated in the progression and prognosis of gliomas, a type of brain tumor. TMEM60 is notably upregulated in glioma tissues, and its expression is associated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression, suggesting a role in modulating the tumor microenvironment (Yang2023The). Beyond oncology, TMEM60 has been studied for its potential involvement in kidney function and its genetic variants' effects on conditions such as sickle cell disease (Köttgen2010GenomeWide; NgoBitoungui2021Investigations). The gene's expression and functional interactions make it a potential target for therapeutic interventions, particularly in glioma treatment (Yang2023The).

## Structure


## Function
TMEM60 (transmembrane protein 60) is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of glioma, a type of brain tumor. It is significantly upregulated in glioma tissues compared to normal brain tissues, with higher expression levels correlating with increased tumor grade and poor prognosis (Yang2023The). TMEM60 expression is associated with immune cell infiltration, including CD8+ T-cells and macrophages, and is linked to the expression of immune checkpoints such as PD-L1 and CTLA4, suggesting a role in modulating the immune response within the tumor microenvironment (Yang2023The).

Functional enrichment analysis of TMEM60-related genes indicates involvement in biological processes like neutrophil-mediated immunity and cellular components such as mitochondrial protein complexes. These genes are also associated with pathways related to the proteasome, DNA replication, and cell cycle, highlighting TMEM60's potential role in cellular proliferation and survival (Yang2023The). In glioma cell lines, silencing TMEM60 results in decreased cell viability, proliferation, and colony formation, underscoring its role in promoting tumor growth (Yang2023The). These findings suggest that TMEM60 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in glioma treatment.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM60 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly gliomas and glioblastomas, where its expression levels are associated with prognosis. In gliomas, TMEM60 expression is significantly higher in IDH wild-type and 1p/19q non-codeleted tumors, correlating with poor prognosis and higher WHO grades. High TMEM60 expression is linked to increased immune cell infiltration and elevated levels of immune checkpoints such as CD96, PD-L1, and CTLA4, suggesting a role in immune evasion (Yang2023The). 

In glioblastoma, TMEM60 is identified as a risk factor, with high expression associated with adverse outcomes, including increased tumor proliferation and drug resistance. It is part of a gene signature used to predict overall survival and recurrence in glioblastoma patients (Li2022Identification; Liu2024Unraveling). 

TMEM60 has also been studied in the context of kidney function. It is mentioned as a locus potentially affecting creatinine production and secretion, although its specific role in kidney diseases remains unclear (Köttgen2010GenomeWide). In sickle cell disease, a variant of TMEM60, rs6465825, is associated with a protective effect against micro-albuminuria, though its relevance to African populations is uncertain (NgoBitoungui2021Investigations).
