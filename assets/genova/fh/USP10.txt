# USP10

## Overview
USP10, or ubiquitin specific peptidase 10, is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in the regulation of protein homeostasis within human cells. The protein product of USP10 is categorized as a deubiquitinating enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in the removal of ubiquitin moieties from target proteins, thereby preventing their degradation and modulating their cellular functions. This enzyme is primarily localized in the cytoplasm but can translocate to the nucleus in response to DNA damage, where it stabilizes key proteins such as the tumor suppressor p53. USP10 is also involved in the regulation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and plays a significant role in autophagy by deubiquitinating proteins essential for autophagosome formation. The gene's involvement in various cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cystic fibrosis (Bomberger2009The; Yuan2010USP10; Bhattacharya2020When).

## Structure
USP10 is a deubiquitinating enzyme composed of 798 amino acids, located on chromosome 16q24.1. It features an Ataxin2C domain and a USP domain. The Ataxin2C domain, approximately 250 residues long, is situated at the C-terminus and is associated with eukaryotic ataxin-2 (Ye2022Ubiquitinspecific). The USP domain includes a catalytic site, protein-protein interaction sites, and localization domains, essential for its deubiquitinating activity. This domain contains six conserved boxes, with boxes 1, 5, and 6 housing catalytic Cys, His, and Asp/Asn residues, respectively. Boxes 3 and 4 contain a Cys-X-X-Cys motif, functioning as a zinc-binding motif that aids in the folding of the USP core (Ye2022Ubiquitinspecific).

USP10 also has a conserved deubiquitinase (DUB) domain at its carboxyl terminal and a non-structured region at its amino terminal, known as ΔDUB. The ΔDUB region is divided into four segments, with S2 responsible for binding to Axin1, a component of the β-catenin destruction complex (Wang2022USP10). The interaction between USP10 and Axin1 is facilitated by electrostatic interactions, highlighting the structural complexity of USP10 in cellular processes (Wang2022USP10).

## Function
USP10 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 10) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of several key proteins by removing ubiquitin moieties, thereby preventing their degradation and influencing their cellular localization and activity. USP10 is primarily active in the cytoplasm but can translocate to the nucleus, especially following DNA damage, where it stabilizes the tumor suppressor protein p53 by deubiquitinating it, counteracting the effects of Mdm2, and promoting its nuclear retention. This stabilization is crucial for p53's role in transcriptional activity, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (Yuan2010USP10).

USP10 also regulates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) by deubiquitinating it in early endosomes, enhancing its recycling to the plasma membrane and maintaining its function in chloride secretion (Bomberger2009The). Additionally, USP10 is involved in autophagy by deubiquitinating LC3B and Beclin1, which are essential for autophagosome formation and function, thus promoting autophagic activity and cellular stress responses (Bhattacharya2020When; Jia2021The). These activities highlight USP10's role in cellular homeostasis and stress response mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
USP10 is implicated in various diseases due to its role in deubiquitination and protein stabilization. In cancer, USP10 can function as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, depending on the context. High expression of USP10 is associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma multiforme, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. In prostate cancer, USP10 influences the p53-G3BP2 complex and androgen receptor signaling, while in breast cancer, it affects the PI3K pathway and stabilizes ITCH, impacting MEK1 and PTEN proteins (Bhattacharya2020When). In lung cancer, USP10 acts as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing PTEN, thereby inhibiting the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival (He2021The; Sun2017USP10).

USP10 is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer's disease, USP10 is upregulated and contributes to Tau protein aggregation by reducing its ubiquitination, which is a key feature of the disease (Wei2022USP10). This interaction suggests that USP10 could be a target for therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing Tau pathology in Alzheimer's (Wei2022USP10). Additionally, USP10 plays a role in cystic fibrosis by enhancing CFTR deubiquitination, which aids in chloride channel function and mucociliary clearance (Bhattacharya2020When).

## Interactions
USP10, a ubiquitin-specific protease, engages in several significant protein interactions that influence its function and regulatory roles in cellular processes. USP10 interacts with G3BP, a Ras-GAP SH3 domain-binding protein, forming a complex that co-immunoprecipitates with ubiquitinated species. This interaction is specific to USP10 and does not occur with other USPs like USP8 or USP4. G3BP inhibits USP10's deubiquitinating activity without binding to its catalytic domain, suggesting a regulatory role in USP10's function (Soncini2001Ras–GAP).

USP10 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, stabilizing it by deubiquitination. This interaction is specific and does not involve Mdm2, another regulator of p53. USP10's role in p53 regulation is distinct from that of HAUSP, another deubiquitinating enzyme (Yuan2010USP10).

Additionally, USP10 interacts with SIRT6, protecting it from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This interaction stabilizes SIRT6, a protein involved in genomic stability and tumor suppression (Lin2013USP10).

USP10 also plays a role in the regulation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) by deubiquitinating it, which affects its post-endocytic sorting and recycling in airway epithelial cells (Bomberger2009The).
