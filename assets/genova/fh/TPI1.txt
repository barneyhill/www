# TPI1

## Overview
The TPI1 gene encodes the enzyme triosephosphate isomerase 1, a critical component of the glycolytic pathway. This enzyme is classified as a glycolytic enzyme and is responsible for the interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), facilitating efficient glucose metabolism and energy production (Oliver2017In). Triosephosphate isomerase 1 is a homodimeric protein, with its dimeric form being essential for its catalytic activity and stability (Orosz2006Triosephosphate). Beyond its primary metabolic role, TPI1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including potential non-metabolic functions in nerve cells and involvement in cancer pathogenesis (Myers2023Newly; Oliver2017In). Mutations in the TPI1 gene can lead to triosephosphate isomerase deficiency, a severe autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hemolytic anemia and neuromuscular degeneration (Selamioğlu2023Triosephosphate). The enzyme's diverse roles and clinical significance underscore its importance in both normal physiology and disease states.

## Structure
The human triosephosphate isomerase 1 (TPI1) enzyme is a crucial glycolytic enzyme encoded by a single gene located on chromosome 12p13. The enzyme is a stable homodimer, with each subunit consisting of 248 amino acids and having a molecular weight of approximately 27 kDa (Orosz2006Triosephosphate). The primary structure of TPI1 includes specific amino acid residues that are critical for its function, such as Lys13, His95, and Glu165, which form the active site (Orosz2006Triosephosphate).

The secondary structure of TPI1 is characterized by the TIM barrel fold, a common motif in enzymes that facilitates its catalytic activity. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional arrangement of these elements, which is essential for the enzyme's stability and function. The quaternary structure of TPI1 is a homodimer, and the enzyme is catalytically active only in this dimeric form (Orosz2006Triosephosphate).

Mutations in TPI1 can affect its dimerization and stability, leading to functional impairments. For instance, the Glu104Asp mutation disrupts the dimer interface, causing enzyme instability and dissociation into inactive monomers (Ralser2006Triose; Orosz2006Triosephosphate). These structural changes are crucial for understanding the molecular basis of TPI1-related deficiencies.

## Function
The TPI1 gene encodes the enzyme triose phosphate isomerase (TPI), which is crucial in the glycolytic pathway. TPI catalyzes the interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), a key step in glycolysis that ensures the efficient utilization of glucose for ATP production during anaerobic metabolism (Myers2023Newly; Oliver2017In). This enzyme is considered 'kinetically perfect', with its activity limited only by the diffusion rates of its substrates and products (Oliver2017In).

TPI is active in the cytoplasm and is expressed in all human tissues, existing as a stable homodimer necessary for its stability and catalytic function (Oliver2017In). Beyond its primary role in glycolysis, TPI may have additional functions, such as involvement in sperm-egg recognition and non-metabolic roles in nerve cells (Oliver2017In). Emerging evidence suggests TPI also has significant non-catalytic roles, including potential nuclear functions that may impact cancer pathogenesis and chemotherapy resistance (Myers2023Newly). These findings indicate that TPI's functions extend beyond glycolysis, contributing to cellular stability and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TPI1 gene lead to triosephosphate isomerase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, progressive neuromuscular degeneration, and increased susceptibility to infections. This condition often results in early childhood death, typically before the age of six, due to respiratory failure (Selamioğlu2023Triosephosphate; Myers2024Neuromuscular). The most common mutation associated with this deficiency is the p.E105D substitution, accounting for over 80% of cases (Selamioğlu2023Triosephosphate; Arya1997Evidence).

The deficiency is linked to decreased enzyme activity, leading to the accumulation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) in erythrocytes. This accumulation can result in the formation of methylglyoxal, a neurotoxic agent contributing to neurological impairments (Oliver2017In; Orosz2006Triosephosphate). TPI deficiency is also associated with abnormal dimerization and potential toxic protein aggregation in the brain, which may initiate neurodegenerative processes (Oláh2002Triosephosphate).

Despite the severity of the disorder, there is a surprisingly high frequency of healthy heterozygote carriers, suggesting possible prenatal lethality in homozygous cases (Oliver2017In). Currently, no effective therapy exists beyond supportive care (Oliver2017In).

## Interactions
TPI1 (triosephosphate isomerase 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and role in cellular processes. In human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells, TPI1's multimeric state is regulated by phosphorylation at serine 21, affecting its dimerization. The S21A mutation stabilizes the dimer, while the S21D and S21C mutations lead to a monomeric state, impacting its structural state and activity (Stein2023LKB1Dependent).

In breast cancer (BRCA) cells, TPI1 interacts with CDCA5, stabilizing its expression and activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which promotes cancer progression. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays (Jin2022TPI1). TPI1 also interacts with sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1)/p62, which facilitates its ubiquitination and degradation, affecting its protein stability (Jin2022TPI1).

In the context of Candida species, TPI1 acts as a moonlighting protein, binding to human extracellular matrix proteins such as vitronectin and fibronectin. This interaction is significant for the pathogenicity of Candida, as it aids in adhesion to host tissues (Satala2021Candida). These interactions highlight TPI1's diverse roles beyond its enzymatic activity in glycolysis.
