# RNF19A

## Overview
RNF19A is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 19A, RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, commonly referred to as Dorfin. This protein is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a type of enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by tagging proteins for degradation, thus regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Rivkin2009Rnf19a). The RNF19A protein is characterized by its RING finger domains, which are essential for its interaction with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and its ligase activity (Rivkin2009Rnf19a; Park2015Mice). It is involved in various cellular processes, including immune response modulation, DNA damage repair, and neuronal development (Park2015Mice; Zhu2021RNF19Amediated; Wu2017NLRP11). RNF19A's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, where its expression and activity can influence disease progression and treatment outcomes (Park2015Mice; Cheng2021Ring).

## Structure
The RNF19A protein, also known as Dorfin, is characterized by its RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is crucial for its role in protein ubiquitination. The protein structure includes two RING domains flanking an In-Between-RING (IBR) domain, which are essential for its interaction with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and its ligase activity (Rivkin2009Rnf19a; Park2015Mice). These domains are located in the N-terminal half of the protein, followed by two putative transmembrane domains and a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif (Park2015Mice).

The RING domains are cysteine- and histidine-rich, contributing to the protein's ability to bind zinc ions, which is a common feature in proteins with ubiquitin ligase activity (Rivkin2009Rnf19a). The presence of these domains suggests a highly conserved structure across species, as indicated by the high sequence identity with mouse and human RNF19A (Rivkin2009Rnf19a).

RNF19A is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which can regulate its activity and interactions with other proteins (Park2015Mice). The protein's interaction with PSD-95, a synaptic scaffolding protein, highlights its role in synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis (Park2015Mice).

## Function
RNF19A, also known as ring finger protein 19A, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where it tags proteins for degradation, thus regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Rivkin2009Rnf19a). In healthy human cells, RNF19A is active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for modulating immune responses. It facilitates the K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of TRAF6, a key adaptor protein in toll-like receptor signaling pathways, thereby attenuating NF-κB signaling and controlling inflammatory responses (Wu2017NLRP11).

RNF19A also interacts with BARD1, influencing the BRCA1/BARD1-dependent homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway. This interaction is essential for DNA damage response, as RNF19A-mediated ubiquitination of BARD1 affects the recruitment of repair proteins to DNA damage sites, thereby regulating HR efficiency (Zhu2021RNF19Amediated). Additionally, RNF19A is involved in neuronal development and function, where it interacts with proteins like PSD-95, impacting synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis (Park2015Mice). These functions highlight RNF19A's role in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis through its involvement in protein degradation and DNA repair processes.

## Clinical Significance
RNF19A, also known as ring finger protein 19A, is implicated in various diseases due to its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RNF19A is overexpressed and acts as an oncogene by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis through the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. This degradation facilitates cancer growth and is associated with shorter overall survival in NSCLC patients (Cheng2021Ring).

In breast cancer, RNF19A overexpression affects the BRCA1/BARD1 complex, crucial for homologous recombination (HR) repair. RNF19A-mediated ubiquitination of BARD1 disrupts this complex, leading to compromised HR and increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, which are used in cancer therapy. This suggests that RNF19A expression levels could influence treatment responses and prognosis in breast cancer patients (Zhu2021RNF19Amediated).

In neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease, RNF19A, also known as Dorfin, is involved in the ubiquitination of mutant proteins, potentially affecting protein aggregation and neuronal survival (Park2015Mice).

## Interactions
RNF19A, a RING finger protein, is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with BARD1 through its RING1 domain, a connection essential for regulating homologous recombination (HR) repair and the cellular response to PARP inhibitors. This interaction is necessary for the recruitment of BRCA1/BARD1, RPA32, and RAD51 to DNA damage sites, which are crucial steps in HR repair (Zhu2021RNF19Amediated). RNF19A also mediates the ubiquitination of BARD1, affecting the retention of the BRCA1/BARD1 complex at DNA damage sites and influencing the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of BARD1 (Zhu2021RNF19Amediated).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RNF19A interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, promoting its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This interaction is evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and is crucial for regulating p53 stability and function, thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation (Cheng2021Ring).

RNF19A also interacts with Psmc3, a component of the 26S proteasome, during rat spermatid development. This interaction suggests a role in protein ubiquitination and degradation, contributing to spermatid head shaping and acrosome biogenesis (Rivkin2009Rnf19a).
