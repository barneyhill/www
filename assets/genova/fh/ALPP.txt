# ALPP

## Overview
The ALPP gene encodes the enzyme alkaline phosphatase, placental (PLAP), which is a membrane-bound glycoprotein primarily expressed in the placenta. This enzyme belongs to the alkaline phosphatase family, characterized by its role in catalyzing the hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters, a process essential for maintaining phosphate homeostasis and energy metabolism in cells (Sharma2013Alkaline). Structurally, PLAP is a dimeric enzyme with a unique tertiary structure that includes a crown domain and is anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (Millán2006Alkaline). The enzyme is notable for its heat stability and genetic polymorphism, with multiple allelozymes resulting from point mutations. These genetic variations can influence enzyme activity and have been associated with various clinical conditions, including pregnancy-related complications and certain cancers (Bellazi2010A; Sharma2013Alkaline).

## Structure
The human placental alkaline phosphatase (ALPP) is a dimeric enzyme, with each monomer consisting of 484 amino acids. The primary structure includes five cysteine residues per subunit, forming two disulfide bonds (Cys121-Cys183 and Cys467-Cys474), while Cys101 remains free, which are crucial for the enzyme's activity (Millán2006Mammalian). The secondary structure features an extended beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices, with an additional N-terminal alpha-helix not found in Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (ECAP), contributing to dimerization (Millán2006Alkaline; Millán2006Mammalian).

The tertiary structure of ALPP includes a crown domain formed by a 60-residue segment (366-430) with two small interacting beta-sheets and flexible loops, which contribute to isozyme-specific properties (Millán2006Alkaline). The quaternary structure is characterized by a strong monomer-monomer interface stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, with the N-terminal arm and crown domain playing roles in stabilization (Millán2006Alkaline). ALPP is anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, a common post-translational modification in mammalian alkaline phosphatases (Millán2006Alkaline). The enzyme also contains a non-catalytic calcium-binding site, which is a novel feature not present in ECAP (Millán2006Alkaline).

## Function
The ALPP gene encodes the placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), a membrane-bound glycoprotein involved in the hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters at basic pH values. This enzyme is primarily active in the placenta, where it is present at high levels and is known for its heat stability (Sharma2013Alkaline). ALPP is a polymorphic enzyme with up to 18 allelozymes resulting from point mutations, and it can be re-expressed by cancer cells as the Regan isoenzyme (Sharma2013Alkaline).

In healthy human cells, ALPP plays a role in dephosphorylation, a critical process for maintaining phosphate homeostasis and energy metabolism. The enzyme's activity is crucial for various cellular processes, including metabolism and signal transduction. The sugar moieties of ALPP are hypothesized to protect the enzyme from rapid removal from circulation by binding to asialoglycoprotein receptors in the liver, suggesting a role in maintaining enzyme stability and function in the bloodstream (Sharma2013Alkaline). While the specific function of ALPP in healthy cells is not extensively detailed, its expression and activity in the placenta indicate its importance in fetal development and maternal-fetal nutrient exchange.

## Clinical Significance
The ALPP gene encodes placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), an enzyme with significant genetic variability, including three main alleles (Pl 1, Pl 2, and Pl 3) and several rare variants. Among these, the D allele is associated with spontaneous abortions, occurring in 0.8% to 1.4% of PLAP alleles (Bellazi2010A). Variations in circulating alkaline phosphatase levels during pregnancy have been linked to conditions such as premature birth, low birth weight, and pre-eclampsia, although the molecular mechanisms remain unclear (Bellazi2010A).

The differential expression of ALPP alleles, particularly Pl 1 and Pl 2, is influenced by a sequence variation in the gene's promoter region, specifically the rs2014683G>A polymorphism. This variation affects allele-specific binding to placental nuclear proteins, potentially contributing to placenta-related pathologies (Bellazi2010A). The c.692G>C polymorphism also impacts gene expression, with the C allele generally less expressed than the G allele, suggesting that cis DNA elements might be responsible for these differences (Bellazi2010A). These genetic variations in ALPP can lead to differences in gene expression and enzyme activity, which may have clinical implications (Bellazi2010A).
