# PABPC3

## Overview
PABPC3, or poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 3, is a gene that encodes a testis-specific protein involved in mRNA metabolism, particularly during the process of spermatogenesis. The protein, categorized as a poly(A)-binding protein, is primarily expressed in round spermatids and plays a critical role in regulating mRNA stability and translation, which are essential for sperm cell development (OZTURK2018Potential; Feral2001Human). Unlike its ubiquitous counterpart PABPC1, PABPC3 binds poly(A) sequences with slightly lower affinity, potentially due to differences in its RNA-binding domains (Feral2001Human). The gene is intronless, likely originating from a retroposon, and is expressed under the control of a testis-specific promoter (Feral2001Human). PABPC3's specialized function in testicular cells underscores its importance in male fertility, and alterations in its expression have been linked to conditions such as non-obstructive azoospermia and certain cancer predispositions (Ozturk2016The; Hamdi2018Family).

## Structure


## Function
PABPC3 (poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 3) is a testis-specific poly(A)-binding protein that plays a crucial role in mRNA metabolism, particularly during spermatogenesis. It is primarily expressed in round spermatids, where it is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation (OZTURK2018Potential; Feral2001Human). PABPC3 binds to the poly(A) tail of mRNA molecules, influencing their stability and translation efficiency, which is essential for the proper development of sperm cells (Sharma2023Uncovering).

The protein is similar to the ubiquitous PABPC1 but binds poly(A) sequences with slightly lower affinity, possibly due to amino acid substitutions in its RNA-binding domains (Feral2001Human). PABPC3 is thought to facilitate active mRNA translation in spermatids by bypassing the translational repression mediated by PABPC1, thus playing a role in maintaining mRNA stability and enhancing translation during the later stages of spermatogenesis (Feral2001Human).

PABPC3 is synthesized from an intronless gene, likely a retroposon, and its expression is driven by a tissue-specific promoter that is active in the testis (Feral2001Human). This specific expression pattern underscores its specialized function in testicular cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PABPC3 gene have been associated with male infertility, particularly in cases of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). Studies have shown that PABPC3 expression is highest in the hyposperm group and decreases progressively in groups with more severe spermatogenic impairments, such as round spermatid (RS) arrest and Sertoli cell-only (SCO) syndrome. This suggests that PABPC3 may play a role in the progression of spermatogenesis, and its altered expression could contribute to the development of NOA (Ozturk2016The).

In the context of cancer, PABPC3 has been implicated in genetic predisposition to breast cancer in Tunisian families. A frameshift deletion variant of PABPC3 was identified in some Tunisian and Egyptian families, suggesting a potential ethnic-specific genetic predisposition model due to high consanguinity and endogamy rates (Hamdi2018Family). Additionally, PABPC3 mutations have been noted in malignant ovarian germ cell tumors, although they are less frequent in patients resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy compared to sensitive ones (Hlaváč2022Wholeexome). These findings indicate that PABPC3 may have a role in certain cancer predispositions and treatment responses.

## Interactions
PABPC3 (poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 3) is known to participate in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, primarily through its role in mRNA metabolic processes. It binds to the poly(A) tail of mRNA molecules, a critical interaction that influences mRNA stability, translation, and degradation. PABPC3 is capable of forming complexes with other poly(A) binding proteins, which suggests a collaborative role in regulating mRNA dynamics. These interactions are essential for the proper functioning of mRNA processing and translation initiation.

The protein also interacts with translation initiation factors, which are crucial for the initiation phase of protein synthesis. By associating with these factors, PABPC3 likely plays a role in facilitating the recruitment of ribosomes to mRNA, thereby influencing the efficiency and regulation of translation. These interactions highlight the importance of PABPC3 in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, as it modulates the stability and translation of mRNA through its binding activities and protein partnerships. The precise nature and regulatory mechanisms of these interactions remain an area of active research, underscoring the complexity of mRNA metabolic processes in which PABPC3 is involved.
