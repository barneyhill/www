# ASAH2

## Overview
ASAH2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme neutral ceramidase, also known as N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 2. This enzyme is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of sphingolipids by catalyzing the hydrolysis of ceramides into sphingosine and fatty acids. Neutral ceramidase is predominantly expressed in the small intestine, where it contributes to the digestion and absorption of dietary sphingolipids. The enzyme's activity is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell signaling, growth regulation, and apoptosis, and it is involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity. ASAH2's expression is regulated by transcription factors such as c-Jun/AP-1 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4a), which influence its role in the intestinal system (Duarte2020Elusive; Maltesen2010Identification; Kono2006Neutral).

## Structure
The ASAH2 gene encodes the enzyme neutral ceramidase, which is involved in the hydrolysis of ceramide into sphingosine and fatty acids. The protein is a single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein, initially identified as a 763 amino acid protein, but a longer isoform of 782 amino acids, known as ASAH2B, has also been identified, suggesting alternative transcription start sites (Coant2019Neutral; Coant2017Ceramidases). The enzyme's structure includes a catalytic domain spanning residues 99-626, a short linker region from 627-641, and an immunoglobulin-like domain from 642-780 (Coant2019Neutral; Coant2017Ceramidases).

The active site of ASAH2 is a narrow, 20 Å deep hydrophobic pocket with a Zn2+ ion at the base, essential for its catalytic activity. Key residues such as His194, His303, Glu540, Tyr579, His196, Arg257, and Tyr591 are critical for catalysis and stabilizing the transition state (Coant2019Neutral). The enzyme is glycosylated with complex-type N-glycans and O-glycans, which are common post-translational modifications (Ito2014New). The primary structure of neutral ceramidase is conserved across species, indicating a shared reaction mechanism (Ito2014New).

## Function
The ASAH2 gene encodes neutral ceramidase, an enzyme crucial for the degradation of sphingolipids in the human intestinal system. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramides into sphingosine and fatty acids, a process essential for the metabolism of dietary sphingolipids (Maltesen2010Identification; Kono2006Neutral). Neutral ceramidase is highly expressed in the small intestine, particularly in the jejunum, and is localized to the brush border membrane of intestinal epithelial cells (Kono2006Neutral). 

In humans, ASAH2 is synthesized as 118 kDa and 142 kDa isoforms and functions as a transmembrane glycoprotein. It regulates the conversion of ceramide into sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate, which are important for cell signaling and growth regulation (Duarte2020Elusive). The enzyme's activity is linked to various cellular processes, including cell-cycle arrest, growth regulation, and apoptosis, and it is associated with maintaining mitochondrial integrity (Duarte2020Elusive). 

The expression and activity of ASAH2 are regulated by factors such as c-Jun/AP-1 signaling and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4a), which binds to the ASAH2 promoter, influencing its expression in the small intestine (Maltesen2010Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the ASAH2 gene, which encodes neutral ceramidase, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In traumatic brain injury (TBI), increased ASAH2 activity leads to sphingosine accumulation in mitochondria, reducing cytochrome oxidase activity and impairing brain function (Parveen2019Role). In colorectal cancer, ASAH2 is involved in tumor growth and development. Inhibition of ASAH2 increases ceramide levels, promoting apoptosis and autophagy, and suppressing cancer-related pathways such as β-catenin and ERK (García‐Barros2016Role; Parveen2019Role). ASAH2 deficiency in colon cancer models results in fewer tumors and protection against aberrant crypt foci development, suggesting its role in early cancer stages (García‐Barros2016Role).

In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ASAH2 is crucial for maintaining membrane integrity and barrier function. Loss of ASAH2 activity leads to increased sphingosine-1-phosphate levels and systemic inflammation (Parveen2019Role). ASAH2 is also linked to metabolic disorders, with its expression affecting conditions like type 2 diabetes mellitus and lipotoxicity. Overexpression of ASAH2 can inhibit palmitate-induced apoptosis, indicating its potential therapeutic role (Duarte2020Elusive). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ASAH2 in various pathological contexts.
