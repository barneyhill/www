# DUXB

## Overview
DUXB is a gene that encodes the double homeobox B protein, which is a member of the homeobox family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by the presence of a homeodomain, a DNA-binding domain that allows them to regulate the expression of other genes. The double homeobox B protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression during early embryonic development and cellular differentiation. Although the specific functions of DUXB are not fully elucidated, it is believed to be involved in the regulation of developmental processes and may have implications in certain pathological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
