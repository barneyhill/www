# TSHB

## Overview
The TSHB gene encodes the beta subunit of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), a glycoprotein hormone crucial for the regulation of thyroid function. TSH is a heterodimer composed of a common alpha subunit and a unique beta subunit, the latter of which is encoded by the TSHB gene and confers biological specificity to the hormone. The TSHB protein is essential for the stimulation of the thyroid gland, leading to the production of thyroid hormones such as triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), which are vital for metabolic regulation, growth, and development (Shupnik1986Transcriptional; Shupnik2000Thyroidhormonesuppressionofpituitaryhormonegeneexpression). The gene's expression is tightly regulated by thyroid hormones through a negative feedback mechanism, ensuring hormonal balance within the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (H-P-T) axis (Wondisford1989Thyroid). Mutations in the TSHB gene can lead to congenital hypothyroidism, highlighting its clinical significance in endocrine health (Doeker1998Congenital; Kaplan2022Novel).

## Structure
The human TSHB gene encodes the beta subunit of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), a glycoprotein hormone essential for thyroid function. The primary structure of the TSHB protein consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that determine its unique properties (Wondisford1988Isolation). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Bodenner1991A). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the polypeptide chain, which is crucial for its biological activity (Bodenner1991A). 

In its quaternary structure, the TSHB subunit associates with the alpha subunit to form the functional TSH hormone, which is necessary for its activity in stimulating the thyroid gland (Wondisford1988Isolation). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common and play a significant role in the stability and activity of the TSHB protein (Bodenner1991A).

A notable splice variant of TSHB is TSHβv, which is produced by hematopoietic cells and leukocytes. TSHβv retains functional activity and can form a dimer with TSHα, facilitated by an eighteen amino acid 'seatbelt' region coded by human exon 3 (Klein2019Novel).

## Function
The TSHB gene encodes the beta subunit of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), a glycoprotein hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland. TSH is a heterodimer composed of a common alpha subunit and a unique beta subunit, the latter providing biological specificity to the hormone. This specificity allows TSH to effectively stimulate the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones, primarily triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), which are crucial for regulating metabolism, growth, and development in the body (Shupnik1986Transcriptional; Shupnik2000Thyroidhormonesuppressionofpituitaryhormonegeneexpression).

The expression of the TSHB gene is tightly regulated by thyroid hormones through a negative feedback mechanism. High levels of thyroid hormones suppress the transcription of the TSHB gene, thereby reducing TSH secretion and maintaining hormonal balance (Shupnik2000Thyroidhormonesuppressionofpituitaryhormonegeneexpression). This regulation is mediated by thyroid hormone receptors that bind to specific DNA sequences within the TSHB gene, particularly in the first exon, which contains elements responsive to thyroid hormone inhibition (Wondisford1989Thyroid).

In healthy human cells, the TSHB gene plays a critical role in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (H-P-T) axis, ensuring precise control of thyroid hormone levels and contributing to overall endocrine homeostasis (Ohba2011GATA2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TSHB gene are associated with various forms of congenital hypothyroidism, particularly central congenital hypothyroidism (CCH). CCH is characterized by low levels of thyroid hormones due to insufficient stimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), often resulting from mutations in the TSHB gene. One such mutation is c.217A>C, p.(Thr73Pro), which has been linked to CCH and pituitary hyperplasia, a condition where the pituitary gland is enlarged (Kaplan2022Novel). Another mutation, c.373delT, p.(Cys125Valfs*10), also contributes to CCH by causing a frameshift and premature stop codon, leading to a truncated and non-functional TSHβ protein (Kaplan2022Novel).

Other mutations, such as a single base pair deletion in codon 105, result in a frameshift and premature stop codon, causing isolated TSH deficiency and severe hypothyroidism symptoms like developmental delay and muscle hypotonia (Doeker1998Congenital). The R75G variant is prevalent among Bene Israel Indian Jews and leads to low or undetectable TSH levels, although FT4 levels remain normal (Shaki2022TSHB). These mutations often follow an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and can result in significant clinical manifestations if not diagnosed and treated early.

## Interactions
The thyroid stimulating hormone subunit beta (TSHB) is a critical component of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which interacts with the TSH receptor (TSHR) on thyroid cells to stimulate the production of thyroid hormones. TSHB forms a heterodimer with the common alpha subunit, which is essential for the activation of TSHR, a member of the leucine-rich repeat G protein-coupled receptor family. This interaction is crucial for the biological specificity and function of TSH, as the beta subunit confers hormonal specificity to the heterodimer (Querat2021Unconventional).

TSHB is also involved in unconventional actions where individual subunits can elicit cellular responses without the receptor for the dimeric hormones, suggesting potential interactions beyond the classical receptor-mediated pathways (Querat2021Unconventional). Additionally, the TSHB gene is regulated by various transcription factors, including Pit-1 and GATA-2, which bind to specific DNA elements within the gene, influencing its expression and interaction with nuclear proteins (Shupnik1992Thyrotropin; Shupnik2000Thyroidhormonesuppressionofpituitaryhormonegeneexpression). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing TSHB's role in thyroid function and its broader physiological implications.
