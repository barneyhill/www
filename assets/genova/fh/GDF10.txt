# GDF10

## Overview
Growth differentiation factor 10 (GDF10) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily, which is involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including cell differentiation, development, and repair. The GDF10 protein functions as a signaling molecule and plays a critical role in the development of the cerebellum, metabolic regulation, and cardiovascular health. It is particularly important in the differentiation and migration of glial cells in the cerebellum and acts as an adipokine influencing metabolic pathways such as insulin response and lipid metabolism. Additionally, GDF10 is implicated in the modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells, contributing to conditions like atherosclerosis. The gene's expression and function are regulated through complex interactions with other proteins and noncoding RNAs, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases (Mecklenburg2014Growth; Brandt2022SingleCell; Song2023GDF10).

## Function
Growth differentiation factor 10 (GDF10) is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily, involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, development, and repair. In the cerebellum, GDF10 plays a crucial role in the development of Bergmann glial cells, which are essential for proper cerebellar function. It is expressed in the ventricular zone (VZ) and the rhombic lip (RL) of the cerebellum, regions responsible for generating neurons and glial cells. GDF10 expression is regulated by Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling, and its downregulation in Shh mutants leads to defects in cerebellar development, particularly affecting the differentiation and migration of glial cells (Mecklenburg2014Growth).

GDF10 is also involved in metabolic regulation, acting as an adipokine derived from subcutaneous adipose tissue. It is associated with metabolic processes such as insulin response, glucose homeostasis, and lipid metabolism. Higher expression levels of GDF10 in subcutaneous adipose tissue are linked to obesity-related changes, suggesting its role in regulating these metabolic pathways (Song2023GDF10).

In the context of cardiovascular health, GDF10 is implicated in the phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), contributing to vascular calcification and atherosclerosis. It promotes the transdifferentiation of VSMCs into osteoblast-like cells, which is associated with plaque instability in atherosclerotic conditions (Brandt2022SingleCell).

## Clinical Significance
GDF10, or growth differentiation factor 10, plays a significant role in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In the context of cardiovascular diseases, GDF10 is implicated in the phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), contributing to atherosclerosis and vascular calcification. It is associated with the transdifferentiation of VSMCs into osteoblast-like cells, which can lead to plaque instability and increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) events (Brandt2022SingleCell). 

In cancer, GDF10 has been identified as a tumor suppressor. In lung cancer, its expression is downregulated through hypermethylation, suggesting a role in inhibiting proliferation and differentiation (Bresson2010Gene). In prostate cancer, GDF10 expression is regulated by the PGM5-AS1/miR-587 axis, where its upregulation inhibits cancer cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis (Du2021PGM5AS1). In hepatocellular carcinoma, GDF10 is involved in cell invasion through its regulation by miR-139 and the long noncoding RNA ZFPM2-AS1, which acts as a miRNA sponge (He2020Long). These findings highlight the diverse roles of GDF10 in disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
Growth Differentiation Factor 10 (GDF10) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its biological functions. GDF10 interacts with the TGF-beta receptor type III (TGFBR3), a transmembrane protein crucial for angiogenesis and cell migration, particularly in the context of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). This interaction is significant as both GDF10 and TGFBR3 are poorly expressed in DFU, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for improving wound healing (Zhao2023Growth).

In the context of cancer, GDF10 expression is regulated by interactions involving long noncoding RNAs and microRNAs. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, the long noncoding RNA ZFPM2-AS1 acts as a competing endogenous RNA that binds to miR-139, preventing it from inhibiting GDF10. This interaction allows for the upregulation of GDF10 expression, which is otherwise suppressed by miR-139 (He2020Long). Similarly, in prostate cancer, the long noncoding RNA PGM5-AS1 binds to miR-587, preventing it from targeting GDF10, thereby upregulating its expression (Du2021PGM5AS1).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory networks involving GDF10, which play critical roles in various physiological and pathological processes.
