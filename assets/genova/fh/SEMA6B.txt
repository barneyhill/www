# SEMA6B

## Overview
SEMA6B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein semaphorin 6B, which is a member of the semaphorin family known for its role in axonal guidance and cell signaling. Semaphorin 6B is characterized by a semaphorin domain, an immunoglobulin-like domain, and a transmembrane region, which contribute to its function in neural development and axon pathfinding (Xiaozhen2021Novel). The protein interacts with plexin receptors, such as Plexin-A2 and Plexin-A4, to mediate repulsive guidance cues essential for proper neural circuit formation (Andermatt2014Semaphorin; Tawarayama2010Roles). Mutations in SEMA6B have been associated with neurological disorders, including progressive myoclonic epilepsy, and its expression levels have implications in various cancers, highlighting its significance in both neurological and oncological contexts (Hamanaka2020De; Li2021SEMA6B).

## Structure
The SEMA6B gene encodes the semaphorin 6B protein, which is part of the semaphorin family involved in axonal guidance and cell signaling. The primary structure of semaphorin 6B includes a semaphorin domain, an immunoglobulin-like domain, and a transmembrane region (Xiaozhen2021Novel). The semaphorin domain is characterized by a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, which is a common feature among semaphorins (Rozbesky2020Structural). 

The tertiary structure of semaphorin 6B is affected by specific mutations, such as the missense variant p.Gly495Trp, which alters the protein's structure and function (Xiaozhen2021Novel). This mutation is located in the semaphorin domain, an important functional region of the protein (Xiaozhen2021Novel). 

Post-translational modifications of semaphorin 6B may include glycosylation, which is typical for proteins in this family, although specific modifications for SEMA6B are not detailed in the provided context. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to splice variants, which may result in distinct functional properties (Xiaozhen2021Novel). 

The quaternary structure of semaphorin 6B, like other semaphorins, may involve interactions with plexin receptors, although specific details for SEMA6B are not provided in the context.

## Function
SEMA6B, or semaphorin 6B, is a transmembrane protein involved in axon guidance and neural development. It plays a critical role in the projection of hippocampal mossy fibers by acting as a repellent, guiding these fibers to their correct locations in the hippocampus. This repulsive activity is mediated through its interaction with plexin-A4 (PlxnA4), ensuring proper neural circuit formation by preventing aberrant projections into inappropriate laminae such as the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens (Tawarayama2010Roles).

In the spinal cord, SEMA6B functions as a receptor in post-crossing commissural axon guidance. It interacts with plexin-A2 (PlxnA2) to facilitate the transition of axons from attraction to repulsion at the midline, ensuring correct axonal pathfinding (Andermatt2014Semaphorin). This interaction involves both cis and trans interactions, which regulate axonal responsiveness to repulsive cues, allowing axons to cross the midline effectively (Andermatt2014Semaphorin).

SEMA6B is also implicated in axon navigation and neuronal migration, with its interactions with plexin receptors either stimulating or inhibiting cellular processes depending on the context (Wagner2023Semaphorin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SEMA6B gene have been linked to progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME), a severe neurological disorder characterized by myoclonus, seizures, and progressive neurological decline. De novo truncating variants in the last exon of SEMA6B are associated with this condition, as they escape nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, potentially leading to dominant-negative or gain-of-function effects. These mutations result in the loss of the intracellular domain of the SEMA6B protein, disrupting normal neuronal function and contributing to epilepsy development (Hamanaka2020De).

SEMA6B mutations are also implicated in adult-onset progressive myoclonic epilepsy-11 (EPM-11), as demonstrated by a missense variant in a Chinese family, highlighting the gene's role in both childhood and adult-onset forms of the disease (Chen2023A). Additionally, SEMA6B is involved in various cancers, including colorectal cancer, where its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. High SEMA6B levels correlate with increased invasiveness and worse outcomes in several cancers, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wagner2023Semaphorin; Li2021SEMA6B).

## Interactions
SEMA6B, a member of the semaphorin family, interacts with several plexin receptors, primarily Plexin-A2 (PlxnA2) and Plexin-A4 (PlxnA4). These interactions are crucial for its role in axon guidance and neuronal development. SEMA6B acts as a receptor in post-crossing commissural axon guidance, where it binds to PlxnA2, a floorplate-derived ligand, facilitating axonal navigation at the midline (Andermatt2014Semaphorin). The interaction between SEMA6B and PlxnA2 is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and cell-binding assays, although the binding is weaker compared to SEMA6A (Andermatt2014Semaphorin).

In the hippocampus, SEMA6B interacts with PlxnA4, mediating the repulsive guidance of mossy fibers. This interaction is essential for the lamina-restricted projection of these fibers, preventing their misprojection into inappropriate layers (Tawarayama2010Roles). SEMA6B's interaction with PlxnA4 also involves the collapse of growth cones in a dose-dependent manner, highlighting its role in axonal growth regulation (Tawarayama2010Roles).

Mutations in SEMA6B, such as the Gly495Trp variant, can alter its interaction with PlxnA2, potentially contributing to neurological conditions like epilepsy (Xiaozhen2021Novel). These interactions underscore SEMA6B's involvement in complex signaling networks that influence neuronal and cellular processes.
