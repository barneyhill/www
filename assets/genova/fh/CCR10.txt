# CCR10

## Overview
CCR10 is a gene that encodes the C-C motif chemokine receptor 10, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This receptor plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating the migration and localization of immune cells, particularly IgA antibody-secreting cells, to mucosal tissues and the skin. The CCR10 protein interacts with specific chemokines, such as CCL27 and CCL28, facilitating immune cell trafficking to sites like the skin and mucosal surfaces, which is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and responding to inflammation. Additionally, CCR10 is involved in processes such as wound healing and tumor progression, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Homey2000Cutting; BONINI1997Cloning; Morteau2008An).

## Structure
CCR10 is a member of the CC chemokine receptor family and is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure typical of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (BONINI1997Cloning). The primary structure of CCR10 consists of 384 amino acids, with a full cDNA sequence of 1,152 base pairs (BONINI1997Cloning). The protein shares 72% amino acid identity with the rat CCR10-related receptor (rCCRlOrR) (BONINI1997Cloning).

The secondary structure includes seven hydrophobic regions, indicative of the seven-transmembrane helices that are a hallmark of GPCRs (BONINI1997Cloning). The amino terminus of CCR10 contains a potential N-linked glycosylation site at asparagine 19, which may play a role in protein folding and stability. The carboxyl terminus has potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and casein kinase-2, which could be involved in receptor regulation and signaling (BONINI1997Cloning).

Unique motifs in CCR10 include the "DKYLEIVHA" sequence following the third transmembrane domain and the "APGTA" sequence near the carboxyl terminus, which are shared only with rCCRlOrR (BONINI1997Cloning). These motifs may contribute to the receptor's specific functional properties.

## Function
CCR10, a chemokine receptor, plays a significant role in the immune system by mediating the migration and localization of IgA antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) to mucosal tissues. It is particularly involved in the homing of these cells to the mammary gland during lactation, which is crucial for providing passive immune protection to newborns through breast milk (Morteau2008An). CCR10 interacts with its ligand CCL28, facilitating the trafficking of IgA-secreting B cells to various mucosal sites, including the salivary gland, small intestine, and tonsils, thereby contributing to mucosal immunoprotection (Kunkel2003CCR10).

In the skin, CCR10 binds to the chemokine CCL27, which is secreted by keratinocytes. This interaction is essential for the migration of immune cells to the skin, playing a role in skin homeostasis and potentially in inflammatory responses (Homey2000Cutting). CCR10 is expressed in various cell types, including melanocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, and is involved in the autocrine regulation of re-epithelialization after skin injury, promoting keratinocyte migration necessary for wound healing (Kroeze2012Autocrine). This receptor is part of a complex network that ensures effective immune surveillance and response in both mucosal and cutaneous tissues.

## Clinical Significance
CCR10 is implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In cancer, the CCL27/CCL28-CCR10 signaling axis is involved in tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis, which can influence cancer metastasis. This pathway is particularly significant in cancers such as melanoma and glioblastoma, where it promotes lymphatic endothelial cell migration and lymphatic vessel formation, potentially aiding tumor progression and metastasis (Karnezis2019CCL27CCL28–CCR10).

In inflammatory and autoimmune skin diseases, CCR10 is expressed in T cells and skin-derived Langerhans cells, playing a role in skin homeostasis and inflammatory responses. Its interaction with CCL27 is crucial in conditions like psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, where it contributes to T-cell migration during cutaneous inflammation (White2013CC; Homey2000Cutting).

CCR10 also plays a role in the recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells to the skin, which is important for tissue regeneration and repair. Alterations in the CCL27-CCR10 axis can affect the efficiency of MSC homing to the skin, impacting therapeutic strategies for cutaneous disorders (Alexeev2013Analysis).

## Interactions
CCR10, a G-protein-coupled receptor, interacts with the S100A10 protein, a member of the S100 family of Ca2+ binding proteins. This interaction is significant for the regulation of CCR10's cell surface presentation. S100A10 binds directly to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CCR10, specifically within amino acid residues 326-340, without involving the typical S100A10 interaction motif found in other proteins like annexin A2 (anxA2) (Hessner2016CC). The interaction between CCR10 and S100A10 is direct and specific, and it does not require the presence of anxA2, although a tripartite complex involving CCR10, S100A10, and anxA2 may form (Hessner2016CC).

The anxA2-S100A10 complex is known to regulate the trafficking and plasma membrane expression of various ion channels and receptors. In the case of CCR10, this complex influences its trafficking to the cell surface. The interaction is modulated by GPCR activation, which affects second messenger-dependent protein kinases like PKA and PKC, influencing the anxA2-S100A10 interaction (Hessner2016CC). This regulatory mechanism suggests that S100A10 modulates the availability of CCR10 on the cell surface, impacting its role in immune responses and tumor progression (Hessner2016CC).
