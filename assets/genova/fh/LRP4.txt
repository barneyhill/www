# LRP4

## Overview
The LRP4 gene encodes the LDL receptor-related protein 4, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including bone metabolism and neuromuscular junction formation. As a member of the LDL receptor family, LRP4 is characterized by its complex extracellular domain, which facilitates interactions with multiple ligands such as sclerostin, agrin, and MuSK. These interactions are crucial for modulating signaling pathways like Wnt/β-catenin, which are essential for bone density regulation and neuromuscular development (Leupin2011Bone; Barik2014LRP4). Mutations in the LRP4 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, including Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome and neuromuscular disorders, underscoring its significance in maintaining normal physiological functions (Shen2015LRP4; Al‐Qattan2018Cenani–Lenz).

## Structure
LRP4 (LDL receptor-related protein 4) is a transmembrane protein that is part of the LDL receptor family. Its molecular structure includes a large extracellular domain (ECD) characterized by eight LDL receptor class A (LDLa) repeats at the N-terminus, followed by four YWTD motif-containing β-propeller domains, which are separated by EGF-like modules (Barik2014LRP4). The β-propeller domains are crucial for the protein's interaction with various ligands, including sclerostin, agrin, and MuSK, which are involved in bone formation and neuromuscular junction signaling (Leupin2011Bone; Zong2012Structurala).

The first β-propeller domain of LRP4 is particularly important for binding neural agrin, forming a complex that is essential for the activation of MuSK and subsequent neuromuscular junction development (Zong2012Structurala). The agrin-LRP4 complex forms a 2:2 tetrameric structure, indicating a specific quaternary arrangement necessary for its signaling functions (Zong2012Structurala).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are common in LRP4, contributing to its structural and functional integrity. Mutations in the ECD of LRP4 can disrupt its interactions and lead to various diseases, highlighting the importance of its structural domains in maintaining normal physiological functions (Barik2014LRP4).

## Function
The LRP4 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in bone metabolism and development. In healthy human cells, LRP4 is expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes, where it facilitates the function of sclerostin, a protein that inhibits bone formation by interacting with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Leupin2011Bone; Choi2009Lrp4). This interaction is essential for maintaining normal bone density and structure, as LRP4 acts as a negative regulator of bone formation by enhancing sclerostin's inhibitory effects (Leupin2011Bone).

LRP4 is also involved in modulating extracellular cell signaling pathways, particularly in bone growth and turnover. It serves as a receptor for dickkopf 1 (Dkk1) and sclerostin, both of which are inhibitors of the Wnt signaling pathway, crucial for bone development and maintenance (Choi2009Lrp4). The gene's function extends to the regulation of bone mineral density and content, as evidenced by studies on LRP4-deficient models, which show reduced bone growth and increased bone turnover markers (Choi2009Lrp4).

In addition to its role in bone biology, LRP4 is implicated in various neurodevelopmental processes, including the modulation of WNT signaling during early forebrain development (Geng2023Balancing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LRP4 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. LRP4 mutations have been linked to Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome (C-L syndrome), characterized by limb malformations such as syndactyly, phocomelia, and disorganization of the phalanges and carpal bones. These mutations often involve homozygous and compound heterozygous missense and splice site mutations, leading to a range of phenotypes from mild to severe (Al‐Qattan2018Cenani–Lenz).

LRP4 is also implicated in neuromuscular disorders. Mutations or malfunctions in LRP4 can lead to congenital myasthenic syndrome and myasthenia gravis, where the gene's role in neuromuscular junction formation is disrupted, affecting muscle contraction and leading to muscle weakness (Shen2015LRP4).

In bone-related conditions, LRP4 mutations can result in sclerosteosis type 2, characterized by increased bone formation due to impaired interaction with sclerostin, a protein that normally inhibits bone growth. This leads to excessive activation of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, causing abnormal bone density and growth (Leupin2011Bone; Bukowska‐Olech2020A).

## Interactions
LRP4 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation and bone homeostasis. At the NMJ, LRP4 acts as a receptor for agrin, a protein released by motor neurons. This interaction facilitates the binding of agrin to MuSK (muscle-specific kinase), forming a complex that is essential for the clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChR) on the muscle cell surface. The agrin-LRP4-MuSK complex forms a tetrameric structure, which is necessary for MuSK activation and subsequent AChR clustering, a critical step in NMJ development (Ohno2023Clinical; Zong2012Structural; Shen2015LRP4).

LRP4 also interacts with sclerostin, a protein that inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is important for bone formation. LRP4 enhances the inhibitory effect of sclerostin on this signaling pathway, thereby regulating bone mass. This interaction is direct and has been confirmed through various biochemical assays, including ELISA and surface plasmon resonance, demonstrating a high affinity between LRP4 and sclerostin (Leupin2011Bone; Bullock2019Lrp4). Mutations in LRP4 can impair its interaction with sclerostin, leading to bone overgrowth and other skeletal abnormalities (Leupin2011Bone).
