# BRPF1

## Overview
BRPF1 (bromodomain and PHD finger containing 1) is a gene that encodes a multidomain scaffold protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. The BRPF1 protein is characterized by the presence of a bromodomain, PHD fingers, a PWWP domain, and a C2H2 zinc finger, which collectively facilitate its role in recognizing specific histone modifications and interacting with other proteins to form histone acetyltransferase complexes. These complexes, including MOZ and MORF, are crucial for the acetylation of histones, a key process in epigenetic regulation that influences gene expression. BRPF1 is particularly important in developmental processes, such as brain and hematopoietic stem cell development, by regulating genes necessary for cell differentiation and function. Mutations in the BRPF1 gene have been associated with intellectual developmental disorders and various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Viita2023The; You2015Deficiency; Klein2020Molecular).

## Structure
The BRPF1 protein is a multidomain protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It contains several key domains, including a bromodomain, PHD fingers, a PWWP domain, and a C2H2 zinc finger. The bromodomain is responsible for recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histone tails, such as H2AK5ac, H4K12ac, and H3K14ac, and adopts a left-handed four-helix bundle topology (Lubula2014Structural). The PHD fingers are involved in transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling, with PHD1 recognizing unmodified histone H3 tails (Poplawski2014Molecular). The PWWP domain is essential for association with condensed chromatin and recognizes H3K36me3 (Zu2022BRPF1KAT6AKAT6B).

BRPF1 forms a multiunit complex with other proteins, including MOZ, ING5, and hEaf6, indicating a quaternary structure (Poplawski2014Molecular). This complex is involved in histone acetylation, a key mechanism in epigenetic regulation. The protein's structure facilitates the recruitment of KAT6A/KAT6B to active chromatin sites (Zu2022BRPF1KAT6AKAT6B). The bromodomain's binding pocket is characterized by a hydrophobic pouch that accommodates acetylated lysine residues, with key residues such as N83 playing a crucial role in ligand binding (Lubula2014Structural).

## Function
BRPF1 (bromodomain and PHD finger containing 1) is a crucial component of the MOZ/MORF histone acetyltransferase complexes, which are involved in the acetylation of histones, particularly lysine 23 of histone H3 (H3K23). This acetylation is essential for regulating gene expression by modifying chromatin structure (You2015Deficiency; Klein2020Molecular). BRPF1 functions as a scaffold within these complexes, facilitating the interaction of subunits and enhancing acetyltransferase activity, which is vital for transcriptional regulation (You2015The).

In healthy human cells, BRPF1 plays a significant role in brain development, particularly in the forebrain and dentate gyrus, by regulating the transcription of genes necessary for neural stem cell function and neuronal migration (You2015Deficiency; You2015The). It is also essential for the development and function of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the fetal liver and bone marrow, where it regulates genes important for HSC stemness and hematopoiesis (You2016BRPF1).

BRPF1 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific histone marks through its bromodomain and PWWP domain, contributing to chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (Laue2008The). Its interaction with MOZ and MORF is crucial for maintaining proper acetylation levels, which are necessary for various developmental processes (Viita2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BRPF1 gene are linked to intellectual developmental disorder with dysmorphic facies and ptosis (IDDDFP), an autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder. This condition is characterized by intellectual disability, delayed motor and language development, and distinct facial features such as ptosis and blepharophimosis (Viita2023The; Liu2024Genetic). Patients with BRPF1 mutations often exhibit varying degrees of intellectual disability, skeletal deformities, and ocular abnormalities, although epilepsy is rare (Liu2024Genetic). 

BRPF1 mutations can lead to truncated proteins that lack essential functional domains, affecting histone acetylation processes. For instance, the p.Val351Glyfs*8 mutation results in a protein that fails to stimulate H3K23 acetylation, a critical modification for gene regulation (Mattioli2017Mutations). These mutations are associated with altered expression of HOX genes, which are important for skeletal development (Mattioli2017Mutations).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, somatic mutations in BRPF1 have been identified in various cancers, including medulloblastoma and leukemia. These mutations can disrupt histone modification processes, affecting H3K23 acylation and potentially leading to oncogenic transformations (Yan2020Deficient). The phenotypic variation associated with BRPF1 mutations underscores its broad impact on human health (Yan2020Deficient).

## Interactions
BRPF1 (bromodomain and PHD finger containing 1) is a scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in forming and stabilizing multiprotein complexes involved in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. It interacts with several key proteins, including MOZ (KAT6A), MORF (KAT6B), ING5, and EAF6, forming tetrameric histone acetyltransferase complexes. These interactions are essential for the nuclear localization and acetyltransferase activity of the complexes (Ullah2008Molecular; You2015The).

BRPF1 contains multiple domains that facilitate its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. The N-terminal EPC-like motif of BRPF1 interacts with the MYST domain of MOZ and MORF, while the C-terminal motif associates with ING5 and EAF6 (Zu2022BRPF1KAT6AKAT6B; You2015The). The BN1 and BN2 subdomains of BRPF1 are particularly important for binding to MOZ and MORF, with the BN2 subdomain being crucial for these interactions (Ullah2008Molecular).

BRPF1 also interacts with chromatin through its bromodomain and PWWP domain. The bromodomain recognizes acetylated histones, such as H2AK5ac, H4K12ac, and H3K14ac, which is important for targeting the MOZ HAT complex to active chromatin sites (Lubula2014Structural; Poplawski2014Molecular). The PWWP domain binds histones H2A and H2B, regardless of their acetylation status, and is essential for chromatin association and function (Laue2008The).
