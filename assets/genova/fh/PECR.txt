# PECR

## Overview
The PECR gene encodes the enzyme peroxisomal trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase, which is a key player in lipid metabolism, specifically within the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a reductase and is crucial for the conversion of trans-2-enoyl-CoA to acyl-CoA, facilitating the breakdown of very long-chain fatty acids and contributing to cellular energy homeostasis (Piórkowska2017Evolution). The protein is localized in peroxisomes, organelles that are essential for various metabolic processes, including fatty acid degradation and the synthesis of signaling molecules (Moser2013Diverse). Beyond its metabolic functions, PECR is involved in the conversion of phytol to phytanoyl-CoA, potentially influencing adipocyte differentiation through nuclear receptor pathways (Piórkowska2017Evolution). The gene's regulatory interactions and its implications in clinical conditions such as alcohol dependence and certain carcinomas underscore its biological and medical significance (Guo2022Integrated; Reilly2017Genetic; Qiu2022Transcriptomic).

## Structure


## Function
The PECR gene encodes the enzyme peroxisomal trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase, which plays a critical role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway. This enzyme is involved in the elongation of fatty acids by converting trans-2-enoyl-CoA to acyl-CoA, a process essential for the breakdown of very long-chain fatty acids and the maintenance of cellular energy balance (Piórkowska2017Evolution). PECR is active in peroxisomes, cellular organelles responsible for various metabolic functions, including the degradation of fatty acids and the production of signaling molecules (Moser2013Diverse).

In addition to its role in fatty acid metabolism, PECR is implicated in the conversion of phytol to phytanoyl-CoA, which may influence adipocyte differentiation through the activation of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) (Piórkowska2017Evolution). The enzyme's activity is considered a rate-limiting step in the β-oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, highlighting its importance in lipid metabolic pathways (Piórkowska2017Evolution). The gene's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in maintaining lipid homeostasis and energy production in human cells.

## Clinical Significance
The PECR gene, encoding peroxisomal trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase, has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in fatty acid metabolism. Genetic studies have identified associations between PECR and alcohol dependence. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a German sample of males with early-onset DSM-IV alcohol dependence found two SNPs, rs7590720 and rs1344694, in the 3'-flanking region of the PECR gene that met genome-wide significance. These findings suggest that genetic variation in PECR may influence alcohol dependence through neuroinflammatory processes, potentially affecting stress-related neurocircuitry (Reilly2017Genetic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PECR is part of a prognostic gene signature associated with overall survival. Higher expression of PECR is linked to better survival outcomes, indicating its role as a protective gene in HCC (Qiu2022Transcriptomic). In uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), PECR is upregulated and included in a prognostic risk model. Alterations in PECR expression or mutations may contribute to UCEC prognosis, serving as a potential biomarker for patient stratification (Guo2022Integrated). These studies highlight the clinical significance of PECR in various diseases, particularly in relation to its role in fatty acid metabolism and peroxisome function.

## Interactions
The PECR gene, encoding peroxisomal trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase, is involved in fatty acid metabolism and interacts with various proteins and regulatory elements. In Polish pig populations, a polymorphism in the PECR gene's promoter region, specifically the c.-145T>C substitution, affects transcription factor binding. This mutation results in the loss of a binding site for X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and the creation of new binding sites for transcription factors such as BHLHE40, ARP1, and ARNTL, which are involved in different regulatory pathways (Piórkowska2017Evolution).

In the context of lipid metabolism, bta-miR-124a, a microRNA, directly targets the PECR gene, leading to its downregulation. This interaction affects the expression of the ELOVL gene, which is part of the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, indicating a regulatory role of bta-miR-124a in lipid synthesis and secretion (Shen2019BtamiR124a).

In Drosophila, the dPECR gene, a homolog of PECR, is involved in neuroprotection and ethanol consumption preference. It interacts with the hang gene, which encodes a neuronal RNA-binding protein, suggesting a role in cellular stress regulation and behavior related to alcohol use (Velo2021ERR).
