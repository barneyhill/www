# BMI1

## Overview
The BMI1 gene encodes the BMI1 proto-oncogene, a polycomb ring finger protein that is a pivotal component of the Polycomb group (PcG) family, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression, maintaining stem cell self-renewal, and preventing cellular senescence by repressing tumor suppressor genes such as p16 Ink4a and p19 Arf (Park2003Bmi-1; Jacobs1999The). Structurally, BMI1 contains an N-terminal RING finger domain, a central helix-turn-helix domain, and a C-terminal PEST-like domain, which are essential for its function in the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) (Cohen1996Transformation; Sahasrabuddhe2016BMI1:). The protein is implicated in various cancers due to its role in promoting cell proliferation and survival, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Riis2010Expression; Sahasrabuddhe2016BMI1:).

## Structure
The BMI1 protein, encoded by the BMI1 gene, is a 37 kDa protein composed of 326 amino acids and is highly conserved evolutionarily (Sahasrabuddhe2016BMI1:). Its primary structure includes several key domains: an N-terminal RING finger domain, a central helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain, and a C-terminal PEST-like domain (Cohen1996Transformation; Sahasrabuddhe2016BMI1:). The RING finger domain is crucial for its role in the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), facilitating interactions with RING1B E3 ligase, which is essential for PRC1 activity (Sahasrabuddhe2016BMI1:). This domain also plays a significant role in the protein's subnuclear localization and oncogenic activity (Cohen1996Transformation).

The HTH domain is involved in DNA binding and is necessary for transcriptional suppression (Cohen1996Transformation). The PEST domain, rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine, is associated with rapid protein degradation, influencing BMI1's stability and oncogenic potential (Sahasrabuddhe2016BMI1:).

Post-translational modifications of BMI1 include phosphorylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination, which regulate its function and stability (Sahasrabuddhe2016BMI1:). These modifications can affect BMI1's role in DNA repair and its oncogenic potential, making it a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Sahasrabuddhe2016BMI1:).

## Function
The BMI1 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) family, which plays a critical role in regulating gene expression through chromatin remodeling. In healthy human cells, BMI1 is primarily involved in maintaining cell proliferation and preventing premature senescence by repressing the ink4a locus, which encodes the tumor suppressor proteins p16 and p19 Arf. This repression delays cellular senescence and allows continued cell proliferation (Park2003Bmi-1; Jacobs1999The).

BMI1 is essential for the self-renewal of adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by preventing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. It achieves this by targeting p16 Ink4a to allow HSC proliferation and p19 Arf to inhibit apoptosis through p53 (Park2003Bmi-1). The protein is also involved in maintaining chromosomal integrity and DNA damage response. It is rapidly recruited to DNA damage foci, where it contributes to homologous recombination DNA repair and checkpoint recovery, thus preventing genomic instability (Chagraoui2011An).

In the nucleus, BMI1 forms part of the Polycomb repression complex 1 (PRC1), which is crucial for transcriptional repression over specific chromatin regions, thereby influencing cellular proliferation and differentiation (Chagraoui2011An; Jacobs1999The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BMI1 gene are implicated in various malignancies and other diseases. Overexpression of BMI1 is frequently observed in several types of cancer, including hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). In these cancers, high BMI1 expression is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive disease phenotypes (Sahasrabuddhe2016BMI1:). BMI1 is also overexpressed in solid tumors like breast cancer, where it is linked to poor prognosis and may serve as a marker for early neoplastic changes (Riis2010Expression).

In esophageal adenocarcinoma, high BMI1 expression is associated with early carcinogenesis and differentiation of cancer cells, although it does not correlate with overall survival (Choy2012Clinicopathologic). BMI1's role in cancer is partly due to its ability to promote cell survival and proliferation by repressing tumor suppressor pathways, such as those involving p16 Ink4a and p19 Arf (Park2004Bmi1; Jacobs1999The).

BMI1 dysregulation is also linked to stem cell dysfunction, as it is crucial for the self-renewal of hematopoietic and neuronal stem cells. Deficiency in BMI1 can lead to defects in hematopoiesis and neurological functions (Park2004Bmi1). These findings highlight BMI1 as a potential therapeutic target in cancer and other diseases related to stem cell dysfunction.

## Interactions
BMI1 is a core component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. BMI1 interacts with human homologs of the Drosophila Polyhomeotic protein, specifically HPH1 and HPH2, forming a multimeric protein complex. These interactions are mediated through conserved homology domains, with both intact homology domains I and II required for interaction with BMI1 (Gunster1997Identification).

BMI1 also interacts with the Mph1/Rae-28 protein, forming part of a multiprotein complex with M33 and Mel18 in mouse embryos and human cells. The central domain of BMI1 interacts with the carboxyl terminus of Mph1, which is necessary for the formation of these complexes (Alkema1997Identification).

In addition, BMI1 directly interacts with the PHC2 protein, binding to its HD1 domain. This interaction is significant for the architecture and activity of the PRC1 complex, as it involves the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain of BMI1, which also facilitates homo-oligomerization necessary for PRC1's function (Gray2016BMI1). These interactions highlight BMI1's role in regulating gene expression through complex formation and protein-protein interactions.
