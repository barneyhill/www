# CELF4

## Overview
CELF4, or CUGBP Elav-like family member 4, is a gene that encodes a neuronal RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of mRNA metabolism, particularly within the nervous system. The CELF4 protein is primarily expressed in excitatory neurons, such as the large pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, where it plays a critical role in maintaining mRNA stability and regulating excitatory neurotransmission (Wagnon2012CELF4). As a member of the CELF family, CELF4 is involved in the regulation of translation and local abundance of mRNAs, particularly those associated with synaptic function. The protein is known to bind to a significant portion of the transcriptome, with a preference for the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs, and is essential for proper neuronal development and function (Wagnon2012CELF4). Dysregulation of CELF4 has been implicated in various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal synaptic activity and neuronal health (Wagnon2012CELF4).

## Function
CELF4 (CUGBP Elav-like family member 4) is a neuronal RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in mRNA metabolism, particularly within the nervous system. It is primarily expressed in excitatory neurons, including large pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, where it regulates excitatory neurotransmission and maintains mRNA stability and availability for translation (Wagnon2012CELF4). CELF4 is involved in the regulation of translation and local abundance of a wide array of mRNAs, particularly those associated with synaptic function. It binds to a significant portion of the transcriptome, with specificity for the mRNA 3' untranslated region, and its target mRNAs encode proteins essential for neuron development and function (Wagnon2012CELF4).

In healthy human cells, CELF4 is critical for regulating synaptic plasticity and transmission, which are vital for proper neuronal function. It is part of large RNA-protein complexes that regulate mRNA translation, similar to the CELF orthologue Bruno in Drosophila, which forms large RNPs to inhibit translation (Wagnon2012CELF4). CELF4's role in synaptic function is underscored by its binding to mRNAs enriched for synaptic roles, and its dysfunction is linked to neurological disorders like epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability (ID) (Wagnon2012CELF4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the CELF4 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, including epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability (ID). CELF4 is crucial for regulating synaptic function and neurotransmission, and its dysfunction can lead to increased cortical excitability and seizures. In Celf4-deficient mice, this manifests as both convulsive and non-convulsive seizures, with the severity influenced by genetic background and gene dosage (Sun2012Aberrant; Wagnon2011Etiology; Wagnon2012CELF4).

CELF4 mutations can lead to aberrant sodium channel activity, particularly involving the Na v 1.6 channel, which increases neuronal excitability and seizure susceptibility (Sun2012Aberrant). The gene is located in a genomic region associated with del(18q) syndrome, which includes symptoms like seizures and mental retardation (Sun2012Aberrant). Haploinsufficiency of CELF4 at 18q12.2 is linked to developmental and behavioral disorders, seizures, obesity, and eye manifestations (Halgren2012Haploinsufficiency).

CELF4 shares approximately 30% of its RNA targets with FMRP, another RNA-binding protein linked to synaptic function and autism, suggesting a significant overlap in the genetic basis of these conditions (Wagnon2012CELF4). Variants in human CELF4 could contribute to epilepsy, ASD, and ID, as evidenced by the spectrum of symptoms seen in del(18q) syndrome and a recent patient with a CELF4 translocation (Wagnon2012CELF4).

## Interactions
CELF4 is a neuronal RNA-binding protein that interacts with a variety of nucleic acids and potentially other proteins to regulate mRNA translation and localization. CELF4 binds to approximately 20% of the CA1 transcriptome, including genes such as Htr2c, Snca, and Nsf, and is associated with large RNA granules rather than ribosomes, indicating its role in mRNA transport and localized translation (Wagnon2012CELF4). The presence of CELF4 in these granules is RNA-dependent, as treatment with RNase A destabilizes the granules and causes a loss of CELF4 (Wagnon2012CELF4).

CELF4 shares a significant portion of its RNA targets with FMRP, another RNA-binding protein involved in synaptic function, suggesting potential interactions or overlapping functions in forming ribonucleoprotein particles (Wagnon2012CELF4). CELF4 binds mRNAs in the 3' untranslated region at a (U)GU motif, which is characteristic of CELF RNA-binding proteins, and this binding is enriched in the 3' UTRs (Wagnon2012CELF4). CELF4's interactions with RNA are crucial for its role in regulating the stability, translation, and localization of mRNAs, particularly those associated with synaptic neurotransmission (Wagnon2012CELF4).
