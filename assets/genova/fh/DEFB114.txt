# DEFB114

## Overview
DEFB114 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 114, a member of the β-defensin family known for its role in the innate immune response. Defensin beta 114 is a small, cationic antimicrobial peptide that contributes to the body's defense mechanisms by exhibiting antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens, including bacteria and fungi. This protein is characterized by its complex disulfide bond patterns, which are crucial for maintaining its structural integrity and biological function. The disulfide bonds facilitate the protein's ability to regulate inflammation and protect sperm motility, highlighting its multifaceted role in human health (Yu2013The). As a β-defensin, defensin beta 114 typically features a 'defensin-like' topological fold, with a core structure consisting of β-strands and an α-helix stabilized by disulfide bridges (Pazgier2006Human).

## Structure
The DEFB114 protein is a human β-defensin characterized by its complex disulfide bond patterns, which are typical of β-defensins and crucial for its structural integrity and function (Yu2013The). The primary structure of DEFB114 includes six conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, essential for maintaining its three-dimensional structure (Yu2013The). These disulfide bonds are critical for the protein's ability to regulate inflammation and protect sperm motility (Yu2013The).

While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of DEFB114 are not explicitly provided, general characteristics of β-defensins suggest that they typically include three β-strands arranged in an antiparallel sheet, constrained by disulfide bridges, and flanked by an α-helical segment (Pazgier2006Human). The tertiary structure is often described as a 'defensin-like' topological fold, with a core consisting of the β-sheet and an α-helix stabilized by disulfide bridges (Pazgier2006Human).

DEFB114 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as the formation of disulfide bonds, which are essential for its function, particularly in neutralizing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammation (Yu2013The). The protein's structure and function are closely linked, with intact disulfide bonds being necessary for its biological activity (Yu2013The).
