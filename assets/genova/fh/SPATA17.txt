# SPATA17

## Overview
SPATA17 is a gene that encodes the protein spermatogenesis associated 17, which plays a crucial role in the process of spermatogenesis. The protein is involved in the regulation of apoptosis in spermatogenic cells and is implicated in the structural assembly of the sperm axoneme, particularly in the C1a projection, through its interactions with proteins such as SPAG6 and calmodulin. These interactions suggest that SPATA17 may function as a calmodulin-binding protein, highlighting its importance in calcium-mediated signaling pathways during sperm development (Salinas‐Torres2020Whole; Zhu2024Incell). Mutations and epigenetic modifications in the SPATA17 gene have been linked to male infertility, including conditions like non-obstructive azoospermia and oligoasthenospermia, underscoring its significance in reproductive health (Nakamura2017Next‐generation; Zhang2024DNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SPATA17 gene have been associated with male infertility, particularly in conditions such as non-obstructive azoospermia and oligoasthenospermia. A heterozygous splice donor site mutation in SPATA17, specifically c.872+1G>A, was identified in a patient with non-obstructive azoospermia, suggesting its potential role as a pathogenic variant (Nakamura2017Next‐generation). Another variant, a heterozygous missense substitution (c.G4A, p.(Ala2Thr)), was classified as a risk SNP, although its frequency in patients was similar to that in the general population, indicating it may not be a rare variant (Nakamura2017Next‐generation).

In addition to genetic mutations, SPATA17 has been implicated in epigenetic alterations. It was identified as a hypomethylated gene in patients with asthenospermia and oligoasthenospermia, conditions characterized by impaired sperm motility and number. This differential methylation suggests that SPATA17 may play a significant role in the pathology of these conditions, potentially affecting gene expression and function in sperm (Zhang2024DNA). These findings highlight the importance of SPATA17 in male reproductive health and its potential impact on fertility.

## Interactions
SPATA17, or spermatogenesis associated 17, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in spermatogenesis. One notable interaction is with the Prader-Willi Syndrome associated long non-coding RNA, PWRN1. This interaction is significant as SPATA17 has been linked to the apoptosis of spermatogenic cells, and hypogonadism is a known symptom of Prader-Willi Syndrome, suggesting a functional link between this non-coding RNA and the associated human disease (Siprashvili2012Identification).

SPATA17 also plays a critical role in the assembly of the C1a projection in the mammalian sperm axoneme. It binds to SPAG6 and is associated with three calmodulin densities located on its helical region, indicating the importance of calcium in regulating the conformation or dynamics of the C1a projection (Zhu2024Incell).

Additionally, SPATA17 has been identified as a modifier impact variant in the context of familial gastroschisis, with its molecular functions associated with calmodulin binding. This suggests potential interactions with calmodulin, although specific biological processes involving SPATA17 remain to be fully elucidated (Salinas‐Torres2020Whole).
