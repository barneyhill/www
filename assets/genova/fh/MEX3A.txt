# MEX3A

## Overview
MEX3A is a gene that encodes the protein mex-3 RNA binding family member A, which is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. This protein is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and plays a significant role in maintaining the self-renewal capacity of stem cells, particularly within the intestinal epithelium, by regulating the stability and translation of specific mRNA targets (Naef2020The). MEX3A is expressed in various tissues and is crucial for processes such as neurogenesis and tissue homeostasis, with its activity being linked to the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (Naef2020The). The gene's expression is known to decrease with age, indicating a potential involvement in aging processes (Naef2020The). Additionally, MEX3A has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, acting as an oncogene by promoting cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition through various signaling pathways (Xu2024MEX3A).

## Structure


## Function
MEX3A is an RNA-binding protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in post-transcriptional gene expression regulation. In healthy human cells, particularly within the intestinal epithelium, MEX3A is involved in maintaining the self-renewal capacity of intestinal stem cells. It is expressed in a slowly cycling subpopulation of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells located at the crypt base, where it promotes the expression of stem cell markers such as LGR5, BML1, and MS1, while impairing intestinal differentiation (Naef2020The). 

MEX3A's activity is linked to its ability to bind RNA molecules, influencing their stability and translation, which is essential for regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. This protein is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in maintaining the proliferative state of neuroblasts during neurogenesis, as demonstrated in studies using Xenopus and mouse embryos (Naef2020The). The gene's expression is downregulated with age, suggesting a potential role in aging processes (Naef2020The). MEX3A's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in tissue development and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MEX3A gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it often acts as an oncogene. In colorectal cancer (CRC), MEX3A is significantly upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis, advanced tumor stage, and lymph node metastasis. It promotes CRC progression by enhancing cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Xu2024MEX3A). In breast cancer, MEX3A overexpression contributes to tumor progression by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis, potentially through the regulation of the PIK3CA gene, which is part of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Shi2021MEX3A).

In ovarian cancer, MEX3A mediates the degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, suppressing ferroptosis and facilitating tumorigenesis, particularly in cases with wild-type p53 (Wang2022MEX3A). MEX3A is also upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma, where it promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and is associated with poor survival outcomes (Liang2020Mex3a). These findings suggest that MEX3A plays a critical role in cancer progression and could serve as a potential therapeutic target across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
MEX3A is an RNA-binding protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing mRNA stability and translation. It is known to colocalize with the human mRNA decapping enzyme hDcp1a and Argonaute proteins (Ago1 and Ago2) in processing bodies (P bodies), which are involved in mRNA turnover and degradation (BuchetPoyau2007Identification). MEX3A interacts with CDX2 mRNA, leading to decreased CDX2 protein levels through a specific MEX-3 response element in the CDX2 3' UTR, highlighting its role in post-transcriptional regulation (Pereira2013CDX2).

In lung adenocarcinoma, MEX3A binds to LAMA2 mRNA, increasing its instability and promoting metastasis through the PI3K-AKT pathway (Liang2020Mex3a). In colorectal cancer, MEX3A interacts with circMPP6, enhancing the assembly of processing bodies by binding with components such as MOV10, PABP1, and UPF1, which is crucial for its role in cancer progression (Chen2024Mex3). MEX3A also interacts with RIG-I in grass carp, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby negatively regulating the antiviral innate immune response (Jiang2022Grass). These interactions underscore MEX3A's involvement in diverse cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.
