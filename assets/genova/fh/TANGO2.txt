# TANGO2

## Overview
TANGO2 is a gene that encodes the protein transport and Golgi organization 2 homolog, which plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as ER-to-Golgi transport, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism. The TANGO2 protein is involved in the trafficking of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, and it influences mitochondrial morphology and lipid homeostasis. Variants in the TANGO2 gene can lead to significant disruptions in these processes, contributing to a rare autosomal recessive disorder known as TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias. This disorder is characterized by metabolic crises, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurological symptoms. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the outer mitochondrial membrane protein Tom20, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic processes (Lujan2023Defects; Lalani2016Recurrent; Milev2020The).

## Structure


## Function
The TANGO2 protein plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, including ER-to-Golgi transport and mitochondrial function. It is involved in the trafficking of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, with specific variants leading to delays in this transport process. This delay can be rescued by expressing wild-type TANGO2, indicating its essential role in maintaining normal cellular transport functions (Milev2020The). TANGO2 is also implicated in mitochondrial morphology, where its variants are associated with changes such as a decrease in mean mitochondrial area and an increase in the number of mitochondria per cell, suggesting a role in mitochondrial organization (Milev2020The).

In addition to its role in transport and mitochondrial morphology, TANGO2 is involved in lipid metabolism. It affects lipid homeostasis by influencing the balance of specific lipids, such as lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid, which are crucial for maintaining cellular lipid composition (Lujan2023Defects). TANGO2's involvement in lipid metabolism is further highlighted by its impact on lipid droplet size and reactive oxygen species levels, particularly under nutrient starvation conditions (Lujan2023Defects). These functions collectively underscore TANGO2's importance in cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TANGO2 gene are associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder known as TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias. This condition is characterized by recurrent metabolic crises, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurological symptoms such as developmental delay and seizures (Mingirulli2019Clinical; Lalani2016Recurrent). The disorder often presents with severe metabolic disturbances, including hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and hyperammonemia, which can lead to life-threatening cardiac events like tachyarrhythmias (Kremer2016Biallelic; Heiman2022Mitochondrial).

The clinical presentation of TANGO2-related disease is variable, with some patients experiencing acute episodes triggered by stressors such as infections or fasting, while others have more chronic neurological impairments (Hoebeke2021Clinical; Jennions2019TANGO2). Common mutations include point mutations, copy-number variants, and large deletions, with certain mutations being more prevalent in specific populations, such as the c.460G>A (p.Gly154Arg) mutation in the Hispanic-Latino population (Mingirulli2019Clinical; Lalani2016Recurrent).

The pathophysiology of the disorder involves disruptions in cellular energy metabolism and ion homeostasis, potentially due to the role of TANGO2 in ER-Golgi trafficking and mitochondrial function (Heiman2022Mitochondrial; Bérat2020Clinical). Despite the severe clinical manifestations, the exact molecular mechanisms remain unclear, necessitating further research to understand the disease process fully (Dines2019TANGO2:).

## Interactions
TANGO2 is involved in various cellular processes, including interactions with other proteins that influence its function in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics. The protein predominantly localizes to mitochondria and is suggested to interact with the outer mitochondrial membrane protein Tom20, as indicated by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy, which confirms the proximity of TANGO2 to Tom20 (Lujan2023Defects). This interaction suggests a role for TANGO2 in mitochondrial function, despite the absence of a transmembrane domain, implying that TANGO2 may cycle between the cytoplasm and the mitochondrial membrane.

TANGO2 is also implicated in ER-to-Golgi transport, where it may interact with components of the ER-Golgi network. Variants in TANGO2 lead to a delay in ER-to-Golgi transport, which can be rescued by expressing wild-type TANGO2, indicating its functional interaction with the transport machinery (Milev2020The). The protein's dual role in ER-to-Golgi transport and mitochondrial localization suggests that TANGO2 may participate in multiprotein complexes or transient interactions that are crucial for its function in these cellular pathways (Milev2020The). These interactions are essential for maintaining cellular energy levels and membrane trafficking.
