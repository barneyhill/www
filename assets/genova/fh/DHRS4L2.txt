# DHRS4L2

## Overview
The DHRS4L2 gene encodes the dehydrogenase/reductase 4 like 2 protein, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This protein is primarily involved in oxidoreductase activity, playing a significant role in the metabolism of retinoids, steroids, and xenobiotic carbonyl compounds. It functions as an NADPH-dependent retinol oxidoreductase, contributing to redox reactions that are vital for maintaining cellular redox balance and homeostasis (Florio2018Evolution; Su2016CpG). The expression of DHRS4L2 is observed in various human tissues, including nervous, cervical, hepatic, and esophageal tissues, indicating its broad functional significance (Su2010Bioinformatic). The gene's transcriptional activity is intricately regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as the hypermethylation of CpG islands, which is crucial for maintaining gene dosage balance and preventing pseudogene formation (Su2016CpG).

## Function
The DHRS4L2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, which is involved in oxidoreductase activity. This protein is implicated in the metabolism of retinoids, steroids, and xenobiotic carbonyl compounds, playing a role in cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenesis (Yang2016Enhancer; Su2016CpG). DHRS4L2 is thought to function as an NADPH-dependent retinol oxidoreductase, participating in redox reactions crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance and homeostasis (Florio2018Evolution).

In healthy human cells, DHRS4L2 is expressed in various tissues, including nervous, cervical, hepatic, and esophageal tissues, suggesting a broad functional role (Su2010Bioinformatic). The gene's expression is regulated by complex epigenetic mechanisms, including the hypermethylation of CpG islands, which suppresses its transcriptional activity despite a high promoter activity score (Su2016CpG). This regulation is essential for maintaining gene dosage balance and preventing the development of pseudogenes (Su2016CpG). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm may influence cellular redox balance, contributing to overall cellular homeostasis (Florio2018Evolution).
