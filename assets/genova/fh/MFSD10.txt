# MFSD10

## Overview
MFSD10 is a gene that encodes the protein major facilitator superfamily domain containing 10, which is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters. This protein functions as a membrane transporter, specifically classified as a drug:H+ antiporter, and is involved in the transport of organic anions across cell membranes by utilizing proton gradients (Drew2021Structures). The MFSD10 protein plays a significant role in cellular detoxification processes, potentially aiding in the protection of cells from oxidative stress by exporting toxic compounds. It is expressed in eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, suggesting its involvement in immune responses and possibly in allergic inflammation (Motoi2012Establishment). The gene's expression and the protein's function are conserved across species, indicating its essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Structure
MFSD10 is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), characterized by a canonical fold with 12 transmembrane segments arranged into two six-helix bundles connected by a cytosolic loop (Drew2021Structures). The structure of MFSD10 has been determined using single-particle cryoelectron microscopy, revealing an outward-open conformation with a resolution of 2.40 Å (Drew2021Structures). This transporter is classified as a drug:H+ antiporter in the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) (Drew2021Structures).

The MFS transporters, including MFSD10, typically operate using mechanisms such as the rocker-switch, which involves symmetrical movements of the helical bundles around a substrate-binding site, alternating exposure to each side of the membrane (Drew2021Structures). This structural dynamic is crucial for the transport function of MFS proteins.

MFSD10 may undergo post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, which can influence its function and regulation. The gene encoding MFSD10 can produce different splice variant isoforms, potentially altering its structure and function, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the available context. The protein's role and structural adaptations are still under investigation, with ongoing research needed to fully elucidate its functions and interactions.

## Function
MFSD10, a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), functions as a membrane transporter involved in the uptake and efflux of organic anions. It is classified as an atypical solute carrier (SLC) and operates as a drug:H+ antiporter, facilitating the transport of substances across cell membranes by utilizing proton gradients (Drew2021Structures). The protein is implicated in cellular detoxification processes, potentially playing a role in protecting cells from oxidative stress by exporting toxic compounds. This function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing damage from reactive substances.

In humans, MFSD10 shares a high degree of sequence identity with its mouse counterpart, suggesting a conserved function across species. The protein is specifically expressed in eosinophils, a type of white blood cell involved in immune responses, indicating its role in immune function and possibly in allergic inflammation (Motoi2012Establishment). The expression of MFSD10 in eosinophils is higher in the small intestine compared to bone marrow, suggesting that its activity may be influenced by cellular activation and developmental processes (Motoi2012Establishment).
