# C20orf173

## Overview
C20orf173 is a gene located on chromosome 20 in humans, encoding the protein known as chromosome 20 open reading frame 173. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by C20orf173 is categorized as a non-kinase, non-receptor protein, suggesting it may play a role in intracellular signaling or structural functions within the cell. Research into C20orf173 has indicated potential interactions with other proteins, which may implicate it in broader biological pathways and processes (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further studies are required to understand the full scope of its biological significance and potential implications in human health and disease.
