# BTN1A1

## Overview
BTN1A1 is a gene that encodes the protein butyrophilin subfamily 1 member A1, a type I transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its modular domain structure, which includes extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic B30.2 domain, facilitating diverse protein-protein interactions (Redwan2018Prediction; Smith2010BTN1A1). BTN1A1 plays a crucial role in lactation by mediating the secretion of milk-lipid droplets and is also involved in immune regulation by inhibiting T cell activation (Ogg2004Expression; Smith2010BTN1A1). The protein's ability to modulate immune responses and its expression in various tissues, including the mammary gland and thymus, underscore its multifunctionality (Redwan2018Prediction; Smith2010BTN1A1). BTN1A1's interactions with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and its potential role in cancer immunotherapy highlight its clinical significance, particularly in tumors resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 therapies (Yoo2023BTN1A1; Kim2024BTN1A1).

## Structure
The BTN1A1 protein is a type I transmembrane protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It features a modular domain organization, including two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (IgV and IgC), a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic B30.2 or PRYSPRY domain (Redwan2018Prediction; Smith2010BTN1A1). The Ig domains of BTN1A1 show sequence homology with other Ig superfamily molecules involved in T cell responses and differentiation, and they share structural similarities with mouse butyrophilin-like (BTNL)2, which is known to coinhibit T cell activation (Smith2010BTN1A1).

The B30.2 domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and is also found in many tripartite motif (TRIM) genes, suggesting a diverse range of functions (Smith2010BTN1A1). BTN1A1 is glycosylated, as indicated by higher molecular mass bands observed in Western blots (Smith2010BTN1A1). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the mammary gland, spleen, and thymus, and is crucial for milk lipid droplet secretion during lactation (Redwan2018Prediction; Smith2010BTN1A1).

BTN1A1 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which contributes to its functional diversity (Redwan2018Prediction). The protein also contains intrinsically disordered regions, which may facilitate its multifunctionality and binding promiscuity (Redwan2018Prediction).

## Function
BTN1A1, a member of the butyrophilin family, plays a significant role in both lactation and immune regulation. In the mammary gland, BTN1A1 is crucial for the secretion of milk-lipid droplets. It interacts with xanthine oxidase to facilitate the formation of milk fat globules, ensuring the proper assembly and secretion of lipid droplets during lactation (Ogg2004Expression). BTN1A1 is expressed on the apical plasma membrane of mammary epithelial cells, where it is involved in the terminal steps of lipid secretion (Ogg2004Expression).

Beyond its role in lactation, BTN1A1 is involved in immune regulation. It is expressed in the thymus and can inhibit T cell activation by binding to receptors on T cells, reducing cytokine production and cell proliferation (Smith2010BTN1A1). This inhibitory function is observed in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and is thought to involve the IgV and IgC domains of BTN1A1 (Smith2010BTN1A1). BTN1A1's presence in exosomes in breast milk suggests a potential role in modulating immune responses in neonates, although its function in this context remains uncertain (Smith2010BTN1A1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the BTN1A1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of immune regulation and cancer. BTN1A1 functions as an immune checkpoint protein, similar to PD-L1, and is involved in suppressing T-cell activation. Its expression is upregulated in various solid tumors, including head and neck, bladder, and non-small cell lung cancers, where it contributes to immune evasion by tumor cells (Kim2024BTN1A1). The mutual exclusivity of BTN1A1 and PD-L1 expression suggests that BTN1A1 could be a target for cancer immunotherapy, especially in patients who do not respond to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (Kim2024BTN1A1).

In the immune system, BTN1A1 inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation, affecting both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. This inhibition is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis, and its dysregulation could lead to autoimmune disorders (Smith2010BTN1A1). BTN1A1 knockout studies in mice have shown autoimmune phenotypes, further supporting its role as an immune checkpoint (Kim2024BTN1A1). Additionally, BTN1A1's role in milk lipid secretion suggests that mutations could impact lactation, potentially affecting neonatal nutrition and survival (Ogg2004Expression).

## Interactions
BTN1A1 is involved in several interactions that influence immune regulation. It can bind to activated T cells, suggesting the presence of specific receptors on these cells, and inhibit their activation and proliferation, particularly affecting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Smith2010BTN1A1). BTN1A1's inhibitory effects on T cell activation are mediated through its extracellular domains, which are similar to those of other T cell regulatory molecules (Smith2010BTN1A1).

BTN1A1 also interacts with the Janus-activated kinase (JAK)1, specifically binding between amino acids 330-380, which includes a JAK binding motif. This interaction suppresses the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, leading to decreased PD-L1 expression (Yoo2023BTN1A1; Kim2024BTN1A1). The suppression of this pathway by BTN1A1 results in the downregulation of JAK/STAT-induced genes, including PD-L1, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and GBP1 (Kim2024BTN1A1).

In tumor cells, BTN1A1's interaction with JAK1 disrupts JAK/STAT signaling, which is crucial for PD-L1 upregulation, thereby playing a role in immune evasion (Yoo2023BTN1A1). These interactions highlight BTN1A1's potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy, particularly in tumors resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 therapies (Kim2024BTN1A1).
