# BPIFA1

## Overview
BPIFA1, also known as the BPI fold containing family A member 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein primarily expressed in the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. The protein, often referred to as SPLUNC1, is characterized by a unique structural fold that includes a 'super-roll' composed of β-sheets and α-helices, which facilitates its diverse biological functions (Ning2014Structural; Walton2016Structural). As a member of the BPI fold-containing family, BPIFA1 is involved in maintaining airway surface liquid homeostasis, modulating airway smooth muscle contraction, and participating in immune responses. It achieves these roles through interactions with various proteins, such as the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and the calcium channel Orai1, influencing processes like sodium absorption and calcium entry (GarciaCaballero2009SPLUNC1; Wu2017Identification). Clinically, alterations in BPIFA1 expression or function have been associated with respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, and otitis media, highlighting its significance in respiratory health and disease (Mulay2018Loss; Saferali2020Immunomodulatory; Wu2017Identification).

## Structure
The BPIFA1 protein, also known as SPLUNC1, is characterized by a 'super-roll' fold composed of a curved β-sheet flanked by α-helices, which encloses a hydrophobic core primarily made of leucine residues (Walton2016Structural). The structure begins with an alpha helix (α1), followed by a short helix (α2), a large flexible loop, and a series of antiparallel beta strands (β1 to β6). It includes a long bent helix (α3) and a unique C-terminal helix (α4), which is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and a disulfide bridge linking α3 and β5 (Ning2014Structural). The α4 helix is crucial for the protein's bacteriostatic, surfactant, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding activities (Walton2016Structural).

BPIFA1 shares structural similarities with proteins like equine latherin and the dust mite allergen Der p 7, which also have leucine-rich loops (Walton2016Structural). The protein's surface properties differ from those of the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), suggesting different lipid-binding capabilities (Ning2014Structural). BPIFA1 binds phospholipids, specifically sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine, as identified through high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (Ning2014Structural). The protein is expressed in the upper respiratory tract and may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, with several isoforms resulting from alternative splicing (Ahmad2022Molecular).

## Function
BPIFA1, also known as SPLUNC1, is a multifunctional protein primarily expressed in the airway epithelium. It plays a crucial role in maintaining airway surface liquid homeostasis by regulating the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). BPIFA1 binds to ENaC subunits, preventing their cleavage by serine proteases, which is essential for controlling fluid absorption in the airways (GarciaCaballero2009SPLUNC1). This regulation helps maintain the volume and composition of the mucosal lining fluid, protecting against infection and aiding in mucus clearance (GarciaCaballero2009SPLUNC1).

BPIFA1 also functions as an epithelium-derived smooth muscle relaxing factor. It inhibits store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) by binding to and internalizing Orai1, a calcium channel protein. This interaction reduces calcium influx into airway smooth muscle cells, decreasing myosin light chain phosphorylation and smooth muscle contractility. This function is particularly relevant in the context of asthma, where BPIFA1 levels are reduced, leading to increased airway hyperresponsiveness (Wu2017Identification).

BPIFA1 is secreted both apically and basolaterally from airway epithelial cells, indicating its role in modulating airway smooth muscle contraction and maintaining normal respiratory function (Wu2017Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the BPIFA1 gene, also known as SPLUNC1, have been linked to several respiratory diseases. In cystic fibrosis (CF), polymorphisms in the BPIFA1 gene, particularly the rs1078761 variant, are associated with lung disease severity. Patients with the G allele of this polymorphism exhibit reduced BPIFA1 protein levels, which correlates with decreased lung function (Saferali2020Immunomodulatory). BPIFA1's role in CF may involve modulating inflammation rather than direct antimicrobial activity, as it does not inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa, a common CF pathogen (Saferali2020Immunomodulatory).

In asthma, BPIFA1 levels are significantly reduced, contributing to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and increased airway smooth muscle contraction. This reduction is linked to enhanced activity of the calcium influx channel Orai1, which BPIFA1 normally inhibits (Wu2017Identification). BPIFA1 deficiency in asthma is associated with increased mucus dehydration and hypersecretion, exacerbating symptoms (Wu2017Identification).

BPIFA1 is also implicated in otitis media (OM), where its loss exacerbates the severity of the condition in certain mouse models, suggesting a role in modulating inflammation and epithelial remodeling in the middle ear (Mulay2018Loss).

## Interactions
BPIFA1, also known as SPLUNC1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in the respiratory tract. It interacts with the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) by binding to its beta subunit, which negatively regulates sodium absorption across airway epithelia. This interaction is mediated by the S18 region of BPIFA1 located at the N-terminus (Wu2017Identification).

BPIFA1 also interacts with the calcium channel Orai1. The C-terminal alpha helix 6 of BPIFA1 binds to Orai1, leading to its internalization and inhibition of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). This interaction reduces calcium influx, which in turn decreases myosin light chain phosphorylation and airway smooth muscle contractility. The interaction between BPIFA1 and Orai1 has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and super-resolution microscopy (Wu2017Identification).

In the context of breast cancer, BPIFA1 has been identified as an interactor with PIK3CA, a gene frequently mutated in cancers. BPIFA1 acts as a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway by inhibiting PIK3CA kinase activity, particularly in its wild-type form (Kim2021A).
