# CALCRL

## Overview
The CALCRL gene encodes the calcitonin receptor-like receptor, a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in the cardiovascular and lymphatic systems. This receptor is integral to the physiological actions of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and adrenomedullin (ADM), both of which are involved in vasodilation and blood pressure regulation. The functional specificity of CALCRL is determined by its interaction with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), which dictate whether it acts as a CGRP or ADM receptor. CALCRL is widely expressed in various human tissues, including the cardiovascular system, lungs, and kidneys, underscoring its involvement in diverse physiological processes. Clinically, alterations in CALCRL expression are associated with significant health implications, such as cardiovascular defects and acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (McLatchie1998RAMPs; Hagner2002Calcitonin; Larrue2021AdrenomedullinCALCRL).

## Structure
The calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CALCRL) is a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a canonical seven transmembrane helix (7TM) motif, typical of GPCRs, and a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) (Kusano2011Structural). The ECD of CALCRL contains three conserved disulfide bonds, contributing to its structural stability (Kusano2011Structural). The receptor forms a heterodimer with receptor activity-modifying protein 2 (RAMP2), which is essential for its function as an adrenomedullin receptor (Kusano2011Structural).

The CRLR-RAMP2 complex adopts a 'side-by-side' orientation, with CRLR featuring an N-terminal alpha helix, two anti-parallel beta strands, and five loop regions, stabilized by three intramolecular disulfide bonds (Kusano2011Structural). RAMP2 adopts a three-helix bundle fold, and the interface between CRLR and RAMP2 involves significant surface area burial, with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions (Kusano2011Structural).

Post-translational modifications include N-glycosylation, with CRLR having three N-glycosylation sites, one of which is essential for CRLR-RAMP2 trafficking to the cell surface (Kusano2011Structural). The cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of CRLR is crucial for receptor internalization and cAMP production, with specific residues forming an eighth helix perpendicular to the transmembrane helices (Kuwasako2010Function).

## Function
The calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CALCRL) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and adrenomedullin (ADM), both of which are involved in vasodilation and blood pressure regulation. CALCRL functions as either a CGRP receptor or an ADM receptor, depending on its association with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs). When co-expressed with RAMP1, CALCRL forms a receptor for CGRP, while co-expression with RAMP2 results in an ADM receptor (McLatchie1998RAMPs; Hagner2002Calcitonin).

The receptor is widely distributed in human tissues, including the cardiovascular system, lungs, digestive tract, kidneys, and endocrine organs, indicating its involvement in various physiological processes beyond vascular control (Hagner2002Calcitonin). In the cardiovascular system, CALCRL is found in endothelial cells and heart muscle cells, where it mediates vasodilatory effects, contributing to the regulation of local blood flow and vascular homeostasis (Hagner2002Calcitonin).

The cytoplasmic tail of CALCRL is essential for receptor function, particularly in adrenomedullin-induced signaling pathways. It is involved in cAMP production and receptor internalization, processes that are crucial for the receptor's role in cellular signaling and function (Kuwasako2010Function).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CALCRL gene have significant clinical implications. In embryonic development, the absence of CALCRL leads to severe cardiovascular defects and embryonic lethality in mice, suggesting its critical role in cardiovascular development. Homozygous knockout embryos exhibit hydrops fetalis and disorganized heart structures, indicating that mutations in CALCRL could be associated with similar developmental issues in humans (Dackor2006Hydrops).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CALCRL is overexpressed in leukemic stem cells and is linked to poor prognosis, chemoresistance, and relapse. High CALCRL expression correlates with shorter survival and lower remission rates in AML patients. The CALCRL-ADM axis is crucial for the survival and proliferation of AML cells, and its depletion reduces cell proliferation and increases apoptosis. Targeting CALCRL could therefore be a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome chemoresistance and prevent relapse in AML (Larrue2021AdrenomedullinCALCRL).

In adult mice, temporal deletion of CALCRL results in multi-organ lymphangiectasia, highlighting its role in maintaining lymphatic function. This condition is characterized by disorganized lymphatic endothelial cell junctions and increased permeability, which can lead to lymphatic dysfunction similar to human lymphangiectasia (Hoopes2012Characteristics).

## Interactions
The calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CALCRL) interacts with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) to form functional receptor complexes. These interactions are crucial for the receptor's ligand specificity and transport to the cell surface. CALCRL, when associated with RAMP1, functions as a receptor for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), while association with RAMP2 or RAMP3 forms a receptor for adrenomedullin (ADM) (McLatchie1998RAMPs). The presence of RAMPs influences the glycosylation state of CALCRL, which is essential for its maturation and cell surface expression (Hilairet2001ProteinProtein).

CALCRL also interacts with the CGRP-receptor component protein (RCP), which couples the receptor to the cellular signal transduction pathway, facilitating CGRP and adrenomedullin-mediated signaling (Evans2000CGRPRCP). The interaction with RAMP1 is necessary for the terminal glycosylation of CALCRL, allowing it to function effectively as a CGRP receptor (McLatchie1998RAMPs).

In primary human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells, CALCRL interacts with various proteins, including calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CAMK2D) and nucleoporin 93 (NUP93), as identified through proteomic analyses (Manolis2023Novel). These interactions highlight the complex network of proteins that modulate CALCRL's function and signaling pathways.
