# SNX4

## Overview
The SNX4 gene encodes the protein sorting nexin 4, which is a member of the sorting nexin (SNX) family characterized by the presence of a Phox homology (PX) domain and a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain. Sorting nexin 4 is involved in intracellular trafficking processes, particularly in the recycling of endosomal proteins and the regulation of autophagy. The PX domain facilitates binding to phosphoinositides, while the BAR domain is crucial for membrane curvature and tubule formation. SNX4 forms heterodimeric complexes with other SNX-BAR proteins, such as SNX7 and SNX30, which are essential for its function in endosomal trafficking and autophagosome assembly. The protein is expressed in various cell types, including neurons, where it plays a role in synaptic processes and neurotransmission. Dysregulation of SNX4 has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as in cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Antón2020A; VazquezSanchez2020The; Poppinga2024Endosomal).

## Structure
Sorting nexin 4 (SNX4) is a protein characterized by the presence of a Phox homology (PX) domain, which is essential for binding phosphoinositides and localizing to peripheral membranes (VazquezSanchez2020The; Teasdale2011Insights). The PX domain of SNX4 includes key residues such as R106, Y107, K132, and R155, which are involved in binding phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) (Teasdale2011Insights). SNX4 also contains a BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain, which facilitates the formation of membrane tubules by binding to curved membranes upon dimerization (VazquezSanchez2020The; van2010SNX–BAR).

SNX4 forms heterodimers with other proteins, such as SNX7 and SNX30, which are crucial for its role in autophagy and endosomal trafficking (Antón2020A). The BAR domain is involved in these interactions, although the precise molecular details of the dimer interface are not fully elucidated (Antón2020A). SNX4's interactions with proteins like dynein and clathrin are influenced by 3-phosphoinositide-mediated membrane association, which can be affected by inhibitors such as wortmannin (van2010SNX–BAR). SNX4 is also subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may regulate its function and interactions.

## Function
Sorting nexin 4 (SNX4) is a protein involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the recycling of endosomal proteins back to the plasma membrane. It is part of the SNX-BAR subfamily, characterized by a BAR domain that binds to curved membranes, facilitating the formation of tubules during the transition from early to late endosomes and from early recycling endosomes to the endosome recycling compartment (VazquezSanchez2020The; VazquezSanchez2019The). SNX4 is expressed in various cell types, including neurons, where it localizes to synaptic areas, particularly presynaptic terminals, and is involved in synaptic processes such as neurotransmission and synapse assembly (VazquezSanchez2020The).

In neurons, SNX4 plays a role in the recycling of the transferrin receptor, preventing its degradation in lysosomes, although its depletion does not affect transferrin receptor levels in neuronal cells, suggesting a potentially different role in these cells (VazquezSanchez2019The). SNX4 is also involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle docking and release, acting as a negative regulator by limiting synaptic vesicle docking at the active zone and sustained vesicle release, which is crucial for effective neurotransmission (Poppinga2024Endosomal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SNX4 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer's disease, SNX4 levels are significantly reduced in severe cases, which may lead to the mistargeting of beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1) to late endosomal compartments. This mislocalization can impact amyloid-β production, a key factor in Alzheimer's pathology (VazquezSanchez2020The). Dysregulation of SNX4 is also associated with other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, and has been linked to cancer (Hanley2021Snx4assisted).

SNX4's role in autophagy is crucial, as it forms heterodimeric complexes with SNX7 and SNX30, which are essential for autophagosome assembly. Disruption in SNX4 expression can impair autophagic processes, leading to cellular stress and potentially contributing to disease states (Antón2020A). The protein's involvement in synaptic function suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to synaptic dysfunction observed in various psychological disorders and mitochondrial disorders (VazquezSanchez2020The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SNX4 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential role in the pathogenesis of several diseases.

## Interactions
SNX4 (sorting nexin 4) is known to form heterodimeric complexes with other proteins in the SNX-BAR family, particularly SNX7 and SNX30. These interactions are crucial for its role in autophagy and endosomal trafficking. SNX4 forms strong heterodimers with SNX7 and SNX30, which are essential for autophagosome assembly and the coordination of ATG9A trafficking. SNX4 does not form homodimers or interact with other SNX-BAR proteins like SNX8 (Antón2020A).

The SNX4:SNX7 complex is particularly important for efficient autophagosome assembly, as it coordinates the trafficking of ATG9A to the autophagosome assembly site. This complex is required for the recruitment of ATG5 at WIPI2-positive structures, which is a critical step in autophagosome formation (Antón2020A).

SNX4 also interacts with components involved in membrane traffic, such as amphiphysin 2, KIBRA, dynein, clathrin heavy chain, and tubulin. These interactions are dependent on 3-phosphoinositide-mediated membrane association and are disrupted by inhibitors like wortmannin. SNX4's interaction with the dynein motor, both directly and indirectly through KIBRA, links membrane carrier formation to motor-driven movement along microtubules (van2010SNX–BAR).
