# GPS1

## Overview
GPS1, or G protein pathway suppressor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex, a multi-protein assembly involved in the regulation of various cellular processes. The GPS1 protein functions primarily as a negative regulator within signal transduction pathways mediated by G proteins and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, playing a pivotal role in modulating cellular responses to external stimuli (Spain1996Two). As a component of the CSN complex, GPS1 is involved in the regulation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), which are crucial for protein degradation and transcriptional regulation, thereby influencing cell cycle control, DNA replication, and the DNA damage response (Horváth2020Interaction). The protein's ability to inhibit JNK1 activity and repress Jun-dependent promoter activity underscores its role in stress response pathways and cellular homeostasis (Tomoda2002The; Li2007Akyrin). GPS1's interactions and regulatory functions make it a significant player in maintaining proper cell function and responding to cellular stress.

## Function
GPS1 (G protein pathway suppressor 1) is a component of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including signal transduction pathways mediated by G proteins and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. In healthy human cells, GPS1 functions as a negative regulator of these pathways, modulating cellular responses to external stimuli (Spain1996Two).

The COP9 signalosome, of which GPS1 is a part, is involved in the regulation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), influencing protein degradation and transcriptional regulation. This complex is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting processes such as cell cycle control, DNA replication, and the DNA damage response (Horváth2020Interaction). GPS1, specifically, has been shown to inhibit JNK1 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) activity, which is a key player in stress response pathways, and to repress Jun-dependent promoter activity, suggesting its role in modulating signaling pathways related to cell growth and stress responses (Tomoda2002The; Li2007Akyrin).

Through its involvement in these pathways, GPS1 contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring proper cell function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GPS1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly breast cancer. GPS1 is significantly upregulated in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with a worse prognosis in certain subtypes, such as Luminal B and low- to intermediate-grade breast cancers (Wei2024Bioinformatics). The gene's expression is notably higher in breast cancers with TP53 mutations, suggesting a role in affecting the stability and mutational status of TP53, a critical tumor suppressor gene (Wei2024Bioinformatics). GPS1's methylation status, particularly hypomethylation, is linked to poorer prognosis, indicating its potential as a biomarker for breast cancer prognosis (Wei2024Bioinformatics).

In addition to its role in cancer, GPS1 is involved in the replication of certain viruses, including the influenza virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). It supports viral polymerase activity through the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, suggesting that GPS1 could be a target for antiviral drugs (Kuwahara2019G). The gene's involvement in these pathways highlights its significance in both oncogenic processes and viral infections.

## Interactions
GPS1 (G protein pathway suppressor 1) is a component of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex and participates in various protein interactions. It interacts with NSMCE4A, a component of the SMC5/6 complex, which is involved in DNA damage repair and chromosome segregation. This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays. The interaction is crucial for the regulation of DNA repair processes, as GPS1 affects the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of NSMCE4A and colocalizes with it during mitosis, suggesting a role in chromosome condensation regulation (Horváth2020Interaction).

GPS1 also interacts with the M2 protein of the influenza virus, which is essential for efficient virus replication. This interaction occurs specifically with the FLAG-tagged M2 protein and is crucial for activating the NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby enhancing viral polymerase activity. Downregulation of GPS1 significantly reduces virus titers, indicating its importance in the virus life cycle (Kuwahara2019G).

Additionally, GPS1 is involved in the polyubiquitination of IκB, a negative regulator of NF-κB, supporting the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This interaction is important for the transcription and replication of the influenza virus genome (Kuwahara2019G).
