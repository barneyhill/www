# MT-CO3

## Overview
The MT-CO3 gene is a mitochondrial gene that encodes the protein cytochrome c oxidase subunit III (COX3), a critical component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV (CIV). This protein is integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a pivotal role in the electron transport chain, which is essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. Although COX3 does not directly participate in the catalytic activity of the complex, it is crucial for the structural stability and proper assembly of the cytochrome c oxidase complex, working in conjunction with other subunits such as MT-CO1 and MT-CO2. Mutations in MT-CO3 can lead to mitochondrial dysfunctions, manifesting in clinical conditions such as MELAS syndrome, characterized by neurological and muscular symptoms due to impaired energy metabolism (Brischigliaro2021Cytochrome; Xu2021Identification).

## Structure
The MT-CO3 gene encodes cytochrome c oxidase subunit III, a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV (CIV). This protein is integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a crucial role in electron transport. The primary structure of MT-CO3 consists of amino acid sequences encoded by mitochondrial DNA. Its secondary structure includes transmembrane segments, which are influenced by interactions with other subunits such as MT-CO1 and MT-CO2 within the cytochrome c oxidase complex (Pei2021Human).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional shape, which is essential for its function within the complex. The quaternary structure of MT-CO3 is characterized by its assembly with other subunits in the complex, such as COX1, COX5B, COX6A, and COX7A, which are crucial for the integrity and function of the cytochrome c oxidase complex (Wang2021A).

Post-translational modifications of MT-CO3 may include phosphorylation and acetylation, which can affect its function and interactions within the mitochondrial membrane. The protein's structure and interactions are vital for maintaining the proper function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and energy production.

## Function
The MT-CO3 gene encodes subunit III of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which is Complex IV of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This complex is crucial for oxidative phosphorylation, a process that generates ATP, the primary energy currency in cells. MT-CO3, along with MT-CO1 and MT-CO2, forms the catalytic core of COX, facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, which is essential for maintaining the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane (James2024Altered; Hejzlarová2015Alteration).

Although MT-CO3 does not have a direct catalytic role, it is integral to the structural stability of the COX complex. It helps ensure proper assembly and function of the enzyme, which is vital for efficient electron transport and ATP synthesis (signes2019identification). The protein is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it contributes to cellular energy metabolism by supporting the electron transport chain's function (James2024Altered).

Mutations in MT-CO3 can lead to various mitochondrial dysfunctions, affecting COX activity and resulting in clinical symptoms such as exercise intolerance and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal energy homeostasis (Brischigliaro2021Cytochrome; Xu2021Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MT-CO3 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders, most notably MELAS syndrome (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes). This condition is characterized by symptoms such as stroke-like episodes, lactic acidosis, and mitochondrial encephalopathy. Specific mutations, such as the m.9553G > A nonsense variant, result in a truncated COX3 protein, leading to impaired cytochrome c oxidase (COX) function and reduced COX respiration activity (Wang2021A). Another mutation, m.9396G > A, affects a highly conserved amino acid, disrupting the interaction between MT-CO3 and MT-CO1, which impairs the assembly and function of complex IV (CIV) in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Xu2021Identification).

These mutations lead to significant mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced CIV activity and the presence of COX-deficient muscle fibers. The heteroplasmic nature of these mutations, with varying mutation loads in different tissues, influences the clinical presentation and severity of the disease (Wang2021A; Xu2021Identification). While MELAS is a common mitochondrial disorder, cases caused by MT-CO3 mutations are relatively rare, highlighting the importance of identifying novel variants to understand their impact on mitochondrial function (Xu2021Identification).

## Interactions
MT-CO3 is a subunit of the cytochrome c oxidase complex (Complex IV) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It is involved in the assembly and function of this complex through interactions with other subunits and assembly factors. MT-CO3 is part of a late assembly group that includes COX6A1, COX6B1, and COX7A2, forming a distinct assembly module within the cytochrome c oxidase complex. This modular assembly model contrasts with the traditional sequential incorporation model, suggesting that MT-CO3 and its associated subunits form a distinct assembly module (Vidoni2017MR1S).

MT-CO3 also interacts with nuclear-encoded subunits, such as COX6A1, which may be functionally significant for the structural integrity of the cytochrome c oxidase complex (Horan2013Quaternary). The interactions of MT-CO3 with other subunits are crucial for the proper assembly and stability of the complex, as mutations affecting these interactions can significantly impact protein assembly and stability (Horan2013Quaternary).

In the context of chemoresistance in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) cells, MT-CO3 is targeted by miR-5787, a mitochondrial miRNA. This interaction enhances the translation of MT-CO3, which is associated with reversing chemoresistance by affecting glucose metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation (Chen2019Decreased).
