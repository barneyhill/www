# POLR2F

## Overview
POLR2F is a gene that encodes a protein subunit shared by RNA polymerases I, II, and III, which are essential components of the transcription machinery in eukaryotic cells. The protein, known as RNA polymerase II, I, and III subunit F, plays a pivotal role in the transcription of DNA into RNA, a fundamental process for gene expression and cellular function. This subunit is integral to the assembly and stability of the polymerase complexes, facilitating the synthesis of various types of RNA, including messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) (Hoerndli2004Reference; Muste2023Deregulations). POLR2F is categorized as a transcription factor due to its involvement in the transcription process. Its expression is notably stable across different cellular conditions, making it a reliable reference gene in gene expression studies (Hoerndli2004Reference). The gene's deregulation has been implicated in various cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Järvelä2021Exome; Muste2023Deregulations).

## Function
POLR2F encodes a subunit of RNA polymerases II, I, and III, which are essential for the transcription of DNA into RNA in eukaryotic cells. This gene plays a critical role in synthesizing messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and small nuclear RNA (snRNA), thereby influencing gene expression, cell growth, differentiation, and response to environmental signals (Muste2023Deregulations). The protein encoded by POLR2F is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the assembly and stability of the polymerase complexes, ensuring the proper transcription of genetic information (Hoerndli2004Reference).

In healthy human cells, POLR2F is involved in maintaining the stability of gene expression across various conditions, as evidenced by its use as a stable reference gene in gene expression studies. Its expression remains consistent regardless of differentiation status or treatment conditions, highlighting its fundamental role in cellular processes (Hoerndli2004Reference). The stability of POLR2F expression is crucial for accurate normalization in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) experiments, which are used to detect subtle changes in gene expression (Hoerndli2004Reference).

## Clinical Significance
The POLR2F gene, encoding a subunit shared by RNA polymerases I, II, and III, is implicated in various diseases through its altered expression and mutations. In cancer, POLR2F is significantly overexpressed in colorectal carcinoma, correlating with early disease occurrence and relapse, and is upregulated in metastatic colorectal cancer cell lines (Muste2023Deregulations). Its overexpression is also linked to cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer and is significantly upregulated in triple-negative breast cancer, where it is identified as a potential oncogene (Muste2023Deregulations). In prostate cancer, increased POLR2F expression is associated with poorer prognosis and adverse outcomes in androgen deprivation therapy (Muste2023Deregulations). Conversely, in glioblastoma, POLR2F expression is lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, affecting overall survival, although it is overexpressed in glioblastoma with IDH1 mutations, where it acts as a survival gene (Muste2023Deregulations).

In neurodevelopmental disorders, a de novo splice variant in POLR2F has been linked to profound intellectual disability, as observed in a patient with a specific phenotype from birth (Järvelä2021Exome). This suggests a potential role for POLR2F variants in neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
POLR2F, a subunit shared among RNA polymerases I, II, and III, plays a crucial role in the transcription machinery by interacting with various proteins and complexes. It is a common subunit that interacts with other polymerase subunits to form the core enzyme complex, facilitating transcription initiation and elongation (Muste2023Deregulations).

In the context of human RNA polymerase II, POLR2F has been identified as a protein partner of the isoforms hRPB11bβ and hRPB11cβ, which are products of the POLR2J gene family. These interactions suggest a coordination between transcription and RNA interference processes in human cell nuclei (Shematorova2013Novel). The study highlights the role of these interactions in transcription and mRNA biogenesis, as well as the potential evolutionary significance of the POLR2J gene family in higher primates (Shematorova2013Novel).

In cancer research, POLR2F is noted for its deregulation in various cancers, including colorectal carcinoma, gastric cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer, where it is often overexpressed. This overexpression is linked to early disease occurrence, relapse, and resistance to certain treatments, indicating its potential role in cancer progression and as a therapeutic target (Muste2023Deregulations).
