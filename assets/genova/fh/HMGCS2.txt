# HMGCS2

## Overview
The HMGCS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2, which is a key player in the metabolic pathway of ketogenesis. This enzyme is categorized as a synthase and is primarily involved in the conversion of acetyl-CoA into 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), a precursor for ketone bodies. These ketone bodies serve as an alternative energy source during periods of fasting or low carbohydrate intake, particularly benefiting tissues such as the brain and heart (Rescigno2017Involvement; Grabacka2016Regulation). The enzyme's structure is characterized by a unique thiolase fold and functions as a homodimer, with its activity regulated by various transcriptional and posttranslational modifications (Shafqat2010Crystal; Grabacka2016Regulation). Beyond its metabolic role, HMGCS2 is implicated in cellular processes such as cancer cell migration and differentiation, highlighting its broader significance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and cellular energy balance (Chen2016HMGCS2; Kim2019Regulation).

## Structure
The human gene HMGCS2 encodes the mitochondrial enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2, which plays a crucial role in ketogenesis. The enzyme's structure is characterized by a thiolase fold in its upper region, a feature conserved among acyl-condensing enzymes, and is built upon a compact five-layered αβαβα core with 2-fold internal symmetry (Shafqat2010Crystal). The lower region is unique to HMGCS enzymes and consists of several α-helices and β-strands, forming a tunnel that constitutes the active site (Shafqat2010Crystal).

The enzyme functions as a homodimer, with the active-site tunnels of the two monomers oriented away from each other, similar to bacterial and plant HMGCS structures (Shafqat2010Crystal). This dimeric arrangement buries approximately 15% of the total molecular surface, with conserved interactions at the dimer interface (Shafqat2010Crystal).

Alternative splicing of the HMGCS2 gene results in splice variants, such as the deletion of exon 4, which affects a core area of the protein and potentially impacts substrate interaction and monomer interaction (Puisac2011Characterization). These variants are more prevalent in non-ketogenic tissues, suggesting a regulatory role in enzyme activity (Puisac2011Characterization).

## Function
The HMGCS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2, which plays a pivotal role in ketogenesis, a metabolic pathway that produces ketone bodies from fatty acids. This process primarily occurs in the liver, particularly during periods of fasting or low carbohydrate intake, when glucose availability is limited (Rescigno2017Involvement; Grabacka2016Regulation). HMGCS2 catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA into 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), a critical step in the formation of ketone bodies such as acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate (Rescigno2017Involvement; Grabacka2016Regulation).

These ketone bodies serve as an alternative energy source for peripheral tissues, including the brain, heart, and kidneys, especially during prolonged fasting (Rescigno2017Involvement). The enzyme's activity is regulated by various factors, including transcriptional and posttranslational modifications, which influence its interaction with other proteins and its enzymatic activity (Grabacka2016Regulation). HMGCS2 is also involved in the regulation of intestinal cell differentiation, where its expression is modulated by the Wnt/β-catenin/PPARγ signaling pathway (Kim2019Regulation). This regulation highlights its broader role in maintaining cellular energy balance and metabolic homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HMGCS2 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 enzyme, lead to a rare metabolic disorder known as HMG-CoA synthase deficiency. This condition is characterized by an impaired ability to produce ketone bodies, crucial for energy production during fasting. As a result, affected individuals experience hypoketotic hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and encephalopathy, particularly during periods of fasting or illness (Pitt2014Mitochondrial; Zhang2019Novel; Ago2020Japanese).

Clinical manifestations of HMGCS2 deficiency include severe metabolic disturbances such as hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and hepatomegaly. These symptoms can lead to life-threatening conditions like coma and multiple organ failure if not promptly managed (Liu2019Severe; Wu2022Clinical). The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is often diagnosed through genetic analysis due to the non-specific nature of its biochemical markers (Pitt2014Mitochondrial; Ago2020Japanese).

The condition is typically observed in early childhood, with episodes of metabolic decompensation diminishing with age. However, the prognosis is favorable if metabolic crises are managed effectively (Pitt2014Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
HMGCS2 interacts with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), a transcriptional activator of the Src gene, which is involved in cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activation of Src, enhancing cancer cell motility and invasion in colorectal cancer (CRC) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) (Chen2016HMGCS2). HMGCS2 acts as a coactivator with PPARα, upregulating Src transcriptional activity by directly activating the Src promoter through a PPARα-binding site (Chen2016HMGCS2). Immunoprecipitation-Western analysis confirmed the physical interaction between HMGCS2 and PPARα in CRC and OSCC models, indicating that this interaction is necessary for the observed effects on cell motility (Chen2016HMGCS2).

In addition to its role in cancer, HMGCS2 is involved in ketogenesis, where it catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA into HMG-CoA. The enzyme's active site features interactions with key residues such as Cys129/166, His264/301, and Glu95/132, which are essential for its catalytic function (Shafqat2010Crystal). These interactions are primarily with substrates and products within its active site, rather than with other proteins or nucleic acids (Shafqat2010Crystal).
