# C1orf167

## Overview
C1orf167 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 167. This protein is currently not categorized into a specific class such as kinases or receptors, and its precise biological function remains to be fully elucidated. However, emerging research suggests that C1orf167 may play a role in various physiological and pathological processes. Notably, it has been implicated in conditions such as mandibular prognathism and non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke, indicating its potential involvement in craniofacial development and cardiovascular health (Genno2019Three; Ding2023Biomarker). Further studies are required to better understand the molecular mechanisms and pathways in which C1orf167 is involved.

## Clinical Significance
C1orf167 has been implicated in several conditions, although its specific clinical significance is still under investigation. In the context of mandibular prognathism (MP), a condition characterized by mandibular overgrowth, C1orf167 has been identified as a potential candidate gene. This association is based on its rare frequency in the normal population and its potential role in jaw formation, as suggested by genetic studies in Eastern Mediterranean families (Genno2019Three). The gene's involvement in MP is supported by findings of an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern and its potential link to macrognathism, a condition of enlarged jaw size (Genno2019Three).

In addition to its role in MP, C1orf167 has been associated with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke (NCIS). A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in C1orf167, rs61773952, is predicted to be deleterious and is implicated in cardiovascular disease. This SNP is associated with the positive regulation of the apoptotic process, suggesting a potential role in disease mechanisms related to apoptosis (Ding2023Biomarker).

Despite these associations, the precise function of C1orf167 in these conditions remains unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in pathological processes.
