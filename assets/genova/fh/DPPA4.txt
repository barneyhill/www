# DPPA4

## Overview
DPPA4 (Developmental Pluripotency Associated 4) is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in early embryonic development and chromatin remodeling. The protein, also named DPPA4, is characterized by a SAP domain, which facilitates its role as a chromatin modifier and epigenetic priming factor. This protein is crucial for the transition between pluripotency and differentiation during embryogenesis, although it is not essential for maintaining embryonic stem cell identity. DPPA4 is expressed during preimplantation development and plays a pivotal role in activating the zygotic genome by regulating transcription factors such as Dux. Its interactions with other proteins, including those in the Polycomb Repressor Complex and pluripotency factors like NANOG and OCT4, highlight its involvement in a pluripotency-associated sub-network. Alterations in DPPA4 expression or methylation have been linked to developmental disorders, emphasizing its clinical significance (Madan2009The; EckersleyMaslin2018Dppa2; Auvinen2022Chromatin).

## Function
The DPPA4 gene encodes a nuclear protein that plays a significant role in early embryonic development and chromatin remodeling. It contains a SAP domain, which is a putative DNA/RNA binding motif crucial for its nuclear localization and association with transcriptionally active chromatin (Madan2009The). DPPA4 is involved in the regulation of gene expression, potentially at the transcriptional level or by influencing transcript stability. It is associated with the regulation of numerous genes, with a notable impact on those involved in germ cell development and fertility (Madan2009The).

DPPA4 functions as a chromatin modifier and epigenetic priming factor, facilitating the transition between pluripotency and differentiation in embryonic development (Auvinen2022Chromatin). It is expressed during preimplantation development and is necessary for inducing an early embryonic transcriptional network by directly regulating the transcription factor Dux, which is crucial for the zygotic genome activation (ZGA) transcriptional program (EckersleyMaslin2018Dppa2). Despite its role in early development, DPPA4 is not essential for maintaining embryonic stem cell identity or germ cell development, but it is critical for embryogenesis, as its deficiency leads to developmental defects and perinatal death (Madan2009The).

## Clinical Significance
DPPA4 has been implicated in various developmental disorders and diseases due to its role in chromatin modification and pluripotency. Alterations in the expression or methylation of DPPA4 have been associated with alcohol-induced developmental disorders. Studies have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to hypomethylation in the regulatory regions of DPPA4, potentially affecting developmental programming and contributing to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) (Auvinen2022Chromatin). These epigenetic changes in DPPA4 may serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis of FASD (Auvinen2022Chromatin).

In embryogenesis, DPPA4 is essential for normal development, as its deficiency can result in skeletal malformations and lung abnormalities in embryos, despite being dispensable for maintaining embryonic stem cell identity (Madan2009The). Although DPPA4-deficient mice can develop normal germ cells, female mice exhibit reduced fertility, suggesting a role in preimplantation development (Madan2009The). The gene's involvement in regulating gene expression related to germ cell development further underscores its significance in embryogenesis (Madan2009The).

## Interactions
DPPA4 (Developmental Pluripotency Associated 4) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for maintaining pluripotency and regulating embryogenesis. DPPA4 interacts with PCGF1, a component of the variant Polycomb Repressor Complex 1 (vPRC1), in a neural progenitor cell line. This interaction is independent of other vPRC1 complex members, suggesting that DPPA4 may be part of a distinct high mass complex separate from the variant PRC1 (Oliviero2015The). DPPA4 also interacts with the transcription factor Dux, directly binding to the Dux repeat, which is essential for the activation of 2C-like transcripts in embryonic stem cells (EckersleyMaslin2019Dppa2).

DPPA4, along with its related family member DPPA2, is expressed in pluripotent cells and developing germ lines. These proteins physically interact and bind to euchromatin, playing a role in the regulation of the zygotic genome activation (ZGA) transcriptional program (EckersleyMaslin2019Dppa2). The interaction of DPPA4 with other pluripotency factors, such as NANOG and OCT4, has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation analysis, although the signal was weak, indicating a part of a pluripotency-associated sub-network (Oliviero2015The).
