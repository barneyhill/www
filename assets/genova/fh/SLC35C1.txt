# SLC35C1

## Overview
The SLC35C1 gene encodes the solute carrier family 35 member C1, a transmembrane protein that functions as a GDP-fucose transporter. This protein is integral to the Golgi membrane and plays a critical role in the transport of GDP-fucose from the cytosol into the Golgi lumen, facilitating the fucosylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. Fucosylation is a vital post-translational modification that influences various biological processes, including protein folding, stability, and cell-cell interactions (FörsterFromme2016Functional; Hellbusch2007Golgi). The SLC35C1 protein operates as an antiporter, exchanging GDP-fucose with nucleoside monophosphate, and is essential for the proper functioning of the immune system and other physiological processes (Skurska2021Insights). Mutations in the SLC35C1 gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, such as Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Type II, characterized by severe immune deficiencies and developmental abnormalities (Helmus2006Leukocyte; Knapp2020Biallelic).

## Structure
The SLC35C1 gene encodes a transmembrane GDP-fucose transporter protein, which is crucial for transporting GDP-fucose from the cytoplasm into the Golgi apparatus. The protein is composed of two exons, each approximately 500 bases long, and features ten transmembrane domains with cytosolic N-and C-termini (Knapp2020Biallelic). The molecular structure of SLC35C1 was modeled based on the GDP-mannose transporter Vrg4, using SWISS-MODEL, and the protein schematic was created using Protter software (Knapp2020Biallelic).

Missense mutations in SLC35C1 tend to cluster within the transmembrane domains, while truncating mutations are more dispersed. Structural modeling indicates that substitutions in SLC35C1 cluster near the dimerization interface, but generally do not affect dimerization, except for the Phe168 mutation, which is crucial for homodimerization through pi-stacking interactions with Tyr169 (Knapp2020Biallelic). The Asn297 side-chain, along with other missense mutations like Arg147 and Thr308, points into the central channel, and substitutions here could alter the channel's charge and shape, potentially affecting transport (Knapp2020Biallelic). Despite these mutations, there is no clear correlation between mutation types or locations and phenotypic outcomes, suggesting a tissue-specific threshold for disease mutations (Knapp2020Biallelic).

## Function
The SLC35C1 gene encodes a GDP-fucose transporter protein located in the Golgi membrane, which is essential for the transport of GDP-fucose from the cytosol into the Golgi lumen (FörsterFromme2016Functional; Hellbusch2007Golgi). This transport is crucial for the fucosylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids, a modification that affects various biological processes, including protein folding, stability, and receptor-ligand interactions (Hellbusch2007Golgi). Fucosylation involves the attachment of fucose residues to glycoproteins, catalyzed by fucosyltransferases using GDP-fucose as a donor substrate (Hellbusch2007Golgi).

In healthy human cells, SLC35C1 ensures proper fucosylation, which is vital for normal physiological functions and cellular interactions, such as the formation of AB0 blood group antigens and the regulation of leukocyte adhesion (Skurska2021Insights). The transporter functions as an antiporter, exchanging GDP-fucose with nucleoside monophosphate across the Golgi membrane (Skurska2021Insights). Proper functioning of SLC35C1 is necessary for the generation of key fucosylated molecules, which are important for immune response and other biological processes (Knapp2020Biallelic). Deficiencies in this transporter can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, affecting multiple organ systems (Knapp2020Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC35C1 gene are associated with Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type IIc (CDG-IIc), also known as Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Type II (LAD II). This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by severe recurrent infections, intellectual disability, reduced growth, and the Bombay blood group phenotype. The condition arises from a deficiency in the transport of GDP-fucose into the Golgi apparatus, which is crucial for the generation of fucosylated molecules necessary for proper immune function (Helmus2006Leukocyte; Knapp2020Biallelic).

Patients with LAD II exhibit symptoms such as global developmental delay, poor weight gain, hypotonia, microcephaly, and recurrent infections. These clinical manifestations are due to mutations that result in a nonfunctional GDP-fucose transporter, leading to the absence of fucosylated glycoconjugates essential for selectin ligand expression (Helmus2006Leukocyte). 

Recent studies have identified biallelic variants in SLC35C1 in individuals with isolated short stature and intellectual disability, broadening the clinical presentation of this syndrome. These findings suggest that SLC35C1 should be considered in cases of short stature with intellectual disability, even in the absence of significant immune deficiencies (Knapp2020Biallelic).

## Interactions
The SLC35C1 protein is involved in interactions with enzymes related to GDP-fucose biosynthesis. These enzymes are likely located in close proximity to SLC35C1 within mammalian cells, facilitating efficient GDP-fucose biosynthesis and utilization (Skurska2021Insights). The study suggests that SLC35C1 interacts with components of the fucosylation machinery, indicating a complex network of interactions within the Golgi complex (Skurska2021Insights). 

Mutations in the SLC35C1 gene can lead to mislocalization of the GDP-fucose transporter protein, affecting its interactions. For instance, in leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II (LADII) patients, the truncated GDP-fucose transporter is mislocalized to the endoplasmic reticulum instead of the Golgi, where it is needed for proper function. This mislocalization is due to the recognition by the ER-resident protein quality control system (Helmus2006Leukocyte). The proper localization and function of the GDP-fucose transporter require specific domains, such as the 10th transmembrane domain and a membrane-proximal C-terminal cytoplasmic region, which are crucial for its interactions and activity (Helmus2006Leukocyte).
