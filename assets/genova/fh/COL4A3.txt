# COL4A3

## Overview
The COL4A3 gene encodes the collagen type IV alpha 3 chain, a crucial component of the basement membrane, particularly within the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) of the kidneys. This protein is part of the collagen IV α345 hexamer, which plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the GBM, acting as a permselective filter essential for kidney function (Pokidysheva2021Collagen; Hudson1993Type). The alpha 3 chain is characterized by its collagenous domain, which forms a triple-helical structure typical of collagen proteins, and its noncollagenous (NC1) domain, which is crucial for the assembly and stability of the collagen network (Kobayashi2003Characterization; Khoshnoodi2008Mammalian). Mutations in COL4A3 are linked to kidney-related disorders such as Alport syndrome and thin basement membrane nephropathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Longo2002COL4A3COL4A4; Pescucci2004Autosomaldominant).

## Structure
The COL4A3 gene encodes the alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen, which is a critical component of basement membranes. The primary structure of the alpha 3(IV) collagen chain includes a 5010-bp open reading frame, encoding a protein with 1642 amino acid residues. This structure features a 28-residue signal peptide, a 1410-residue collagenous domain with 23 interruptions in the Gly-X-Y repeat sequence, and a 232-residue NC1 domain (Mariyama1994Complete). The collagenous domain is characterized by a triple-helical structure formed by Gly-X-Y repeats, which is typical of collagen proteins (Khoshnoodi2008Mammalian).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of the NC1 domain, which is crucial for the stability and assembly of the collagen chains (Kobayashi2003Characterization). The quaternary structure of the alpha 3(IV) chain involves its association with the alpha 4(IV) and alpha 5(IV) chains to form a heterotrimeric structure, essential for the function of the glomerular basement membrane (Khoshnoodi2008Mammalian).

Post-translational modifications of the alpha 3(IV) chain include hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues, glycosylation, and the formation of disulfide bonds, which contribute to the stability and function of the collagen network (Khoshnoodi2008Mammalian).

## Function
The COL4A3 gene encodes the alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen, which is a critical component of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in the kidneys. This protein is part of the collagen IV α345 hexamer, a structural element essential for maintaining the GBM's integrity and function. The GBM acts as a permselective filter, allowing the passage of certain molecules while preventing others, which is vital for kidney function (Pokidysheva2021Collagen; Hudson1993Type).

In healthy human cells, the collagen IV α345 hexamer is involved in signaling and organizing macromolecular complexes necessary for GBM assembly and function. It plays a role in forming a network that provides structural support and filtration functions, particularly in the kidneys (Cosgrove1996Collagen). The α3 chain, along with α4 and α5 chains, is localized to the GBM, indicating its specific tissue distribution and functional roles (Hudson1993Type).

The α345 hexamer's noncollagenous (NC1) domains are involved in intracellular trimerization followed by extracellular hexamerization, facilitating interactions that are crucial for GBM biology. These interactions include binding partners within the basement membrane and cell surface receptors, which induce signaling pathways important for maintaining the GBM's structure and function (Pokidysheva2021Collagen).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COL4A3 gene are associated with a range of kidney-related conditions, most notably Alport syndrome and thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN). Alport syndrome is a hereditary nephritis characterized by progressive kidney disease, hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities. It can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive manner, with mutations in COL4A3 contributing to both forms (Longo2002COL4A3COL4A4; Pescucci2004Autosomaldominant). In autosomal dominant Alport syndrome (ADAS), patients may experience a wide spectrum of symptoms, from isolated hematuria to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Groen2023Kidney; Imafuku2020How).

TBMN, often considered a milder condition, is characterized by hematuria and thinning of the glomerular basement membrane. However, some patients with TBMN may progress to more severe kidney disease, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and ESRD (Pierides2009Clinicopathological; Imafuku2020How). The clinical presentation of these conditions can vary significantly, even among individuals with the same genetic mutation, complicating diagnosis and management (Groen2023Kidney; Imafuku2020How). The phenotypic variability is thought to be influenced by additional genetic and environmental factors (Pierides2009Clinicopathological).

## Interactions
The COL4A3 gene encodes the α3 chain of type IV collagen, which is a critical component of the basement membrane. This protein interacts with other collagen IV chains, such as COL4A4 and COL4A5, to form the α345 hexamer, a key structural element of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) (Pokidysheva2021Collagen; Cosgrove1996Collagen). The α345 hexamer is involved in quaternary and quinary interactions with other macromolecules and cell surface receptors, which are essential for the GBM's function as a permselective filter (Pokidysheva2021Collagen).

The noncollagenous (NC1) domains of the α-chains, including COL4A3, are responsible for the specific composition and assembly of the hexamer. These domains facilitate the formation of a complex network that interacts with other basement membrane components such as laminin, nidogen, and proteoglycans, contributing to the structural integrity and biological activity of the basement membrane (TIMPL1989Structure).

In the context of disease, mutations in COL4A3 can lead to structural abnormalities in the GBM, affecting its interactions and leading to conditions such as Alport syndrome and Goodpasture's disease (Pokidysheva2021Collagen; Cosgrove1996Collagen). These interactions and the integrity of the collagen network are crucial for maintaining normal kidney function and preventing disease progression.
