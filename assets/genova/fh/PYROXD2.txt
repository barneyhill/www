# PYROXD2

## Overview
PYROXD2 is a gene that encodes the pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase domain 2 protein, which is integral to mitochondrial function. This protein is categorized as a mitochondrial enzyme involved in redox reactions, specifically within the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase domain-containing protein family. It plays a critical role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and energy metabolism by catalyzing the NAD/NADH-dependent reduction of cysteine residues in substrates, thereby regulating the NAD+/NADH balance essential for mitochondrial function (Van2022Biallelic). The PYROXD2 protein is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane/matrix and interacts with COX5B, a subunit of mitochondrial complex IV, indicating its involvement in the electron transport chain and mitochondrial respiratory processes (Wang2019Pyridine). Mutations in the PYROXD2 gene have been linked to severe metabolic disorders and various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Wang2019Pyridine; Van2022Biallelic).

## Structure
The PYROXD2 protein is involved in mitochondrial function and is encoded by the PYROXD2 gene. It is a mitochondrial inner membrane/matrix-residing protein, lacking a typical mitochondrial targeting signal peptide. However, the region between amino acids 151-230 is crucial for its mitochondrial localization (Wang2019Pyridine). The protein interacts with COX5B, a subunit of mitochondrial complex IV, which suggests its involvement in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Wang2019Pyridine).

The PYROXD2 protein contains a pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase domain, which is involved in redox reactions. Structural modeling has highlighted regions affected by specific variants, such as a missense mutation (p.Gly426Ser) and a frameshift mutation (p.Val498Cysfs*79). These mutations impact highly conserved regions, including an amino-oxidase domain, and alter the 3D structure by affecting a beta strand and two alpha helices (Van2022Biallelic).

The protein's structure is crucial for its function in maintaining mitochondrial integrity, as evidenced by its role in regulating mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species production, and ATP content (Wang2019Pyridine). However, specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context.

## Function
PYROXD2 is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and energy metabolism. It is part of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase domain-containing protein family, which regulates the redox status and cellular energy by catalyzing the NAD/NADH-dependent reduction of cysteine residues in substrates. This activity is essential for regulating the NAD+/NADH balance, which is critical for mitochondrial function (Van2022Biallelic).

PYROXD2 is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane/matrix, where it interacts with COX5B, a subunit of mitochondrial complex IV, indicating its involvement in the electron transport chain. This interaction is crucial for the activity of Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) or complex IV, a key component of the electron transfer chain. In cells lacking PYROXD2, COX IV activity is significantly reduced, highlighting its specific regulatory role in this complex (Wang2019Pyridine).

The protein also influences mitochondrial biogenesis, as its absence leads to reduced cell proliferation, ATP levels, and mitochondrial DNA copy number. Overexpression of PYROXD2 results in increased mitochondrial DNA copy number and improved mitochondrial structure, such as the reconstitution of cristae and the proportion of rod-shaped mitochondria, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and structure (Wang2019Pyridine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PYROXD2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. Biallelic variants in PYROXD2 are associated with a severe infantile metabolic disorder that affects mitochondrial function. This disorder presents with symptoms such as metabolic acidosis, seizures, poor weight gain, hypotonia, and microcephaly, resembling Leigh syndrome, a neurometabolic disorder. The condition is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, including reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased ATP levels, and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Van2022Biallelic).

In cancer biology, PYROXD2 is identified as a tumor suppressor gene. Its low expression is observed in various tumor tissues, including hepatocellular carcinoma, lung, and bladder cancers. PYROXD2 promotes apoptosis in cancer cells and its knockout leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is linked to cancer development. The gene's role in regulating mitochondrial ROS levels and maintaining mitochondrial DNA copy number is crucial for its tumor-suppressing function (Wang2019Pyridine).

Additionally, genetic variants in PYROXD2 have been associated with trimethylamine metabolism, implicating it in trimethylaminuria, a condition characterized by a fish-like body odor due to the accumulation of trimethylamine (Montoliu2012Current).

## Interactions
PYROXD2 is involved in mitochondrial function and interacts with several proteins. It has been shown to interact with the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx), which is known for its oncogenic activity. This interaction suggests a potential role for PYROXD2 in viral pathogenesis or cancer development (Van2022Biallelic). PYROXD2 also interacts with COX5B, a subunit of complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Knockout studies of PYROXD2 have demonstrated decreased activity of complex IV, indicating that PYROXD2 may play a role in maintaining the function of this complex (Van2022Biallelic).

The study of PYROXD2 knockout cell lines has revealed reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased ATP levels, and increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Proteomic analyses have shown decreased levels of mitoribosomal subunits and complex I subunits, suggesting that PYROXD2 may influence mitochondrial translation and complex I biogenesis (Van2022Biallelic). These findings highlight the importance of PYROXD2 in mitochondrial protein complexes and its potential impact on cellular energy metabolism and redox balance. However, specific physical interactions with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies.
