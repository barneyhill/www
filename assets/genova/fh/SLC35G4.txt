# SLC35G4

## Overview
SLC35G4 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member G4, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) group of membrane transport proteins. These proteins are integral to the transport of a wide variety of substrates across cellular membranes, playing crucial roles in cellular homeostasis and metabolism. The SLC35G4 protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter, although its specific substrates and physiological roles remain to be fully elucidated. Research into the SLC35G4 gene and its encoded protein is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its potential involvement in various biological pathways and its implications in human health and disease.
