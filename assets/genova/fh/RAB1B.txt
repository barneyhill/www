# RAB1B

## Overview
RAB1B is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein, which is a member of the RAS oncogene family. The RAB1B protein plays a critical role in intracellular vesicular trafficking, particularly in the early secretory pathway between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. As a small GTPase, RAB1B functions as a molecular switch, cycling between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state, thereby regulating various cellular processes. The protein is involved in the transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi and between Golgi compartments, facilitating vesicle fission and fusion. RAB1B's interactions with multiple effectors and its post-translational modifications, such as AMPylation and isoprenylation, are crucial for its function in vesicular trafficking and autophagy. Alterations in RAB1B expression and function have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Plutner1991Rab1b; Yong2021Cancerdriving; Monetta2007Rab1b).

## Structure
RAB1B is a small GTPase involved in vesicular trafficking, characterized by a conserved primary structure that includes a short N-terminal sequence and a 'G box' motif essential for guanine nucleotide binding and GTP hydrolysis (Yang2016Rab1). The secondary structure of RAB1B features a central six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices, which is typical of its fold (Kaspers2023Dephosphocholination). 

The tertiary structure of RAB1B involves the switch II region, which undergoes significant conformational changes upon interaction with various effectors and modifications. For instance, adenylylation at Tyr77 stabilizes RAB1B in an active conformation by altering the electrostatic environment and reducing solvation of inactive conformations (Luitz2016Adenylylation). 

RAB1B undergoes several post-translational modifications, including AMPylation at Tyr77 by the Legionella effector DrrA, which locks it in an active state by inhibiting GTPase-activating proteins (Müller2010The). Phosphocholination at Ser76 by AnkX and subsequent dephosphocholination by Lem3 also affect its interactions and structural dynamics (Kaspers2023Dephosphocholination). Additionally, RAB1B is isoprenylated by geranylgeranyltransferase, which is crucial for its membrane association (Wilson1993Isoprenylation). These modifications play significant roles in regulating RAB1B's function and interactions within the cell.

## Function
The RAB1B gene encodes a small GTPase that is crucial for intracellular vesicle trafficking, particularly in the early secretory pathway between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. RAB1B is involved in the transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi, as well as between successive Golgi compartments, playing a key role in vesicle fission and fusion processes (Plutner1991Rab1b). It interacts with multiple effectors at the ER exit sites (ERES), vesicular-tubular clusters (VTCs), and the Golgi complex, which are essential for cargo sorting and vesicle tethering (Martinez2016SpatialTemporal).

RAB1B modulates the recruitment of coat protein I (COPI) complexes, which are necessary for vesicle formation and transport. It interacts with GBF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, to stabilize Arf1 on membranes, facilitating COPI vesicle formation and maturation of pre-Golgi intermediates into Golgi elements (Monetta2007Rab1b). RAB1B is also associated with ATG9A vesicles, playing a role in autophagosome formation, which is critical for autophagy (Kakuta2017Small). These functions highlight RAB1B's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein processing in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the RAB1B gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, RAB1B expression levels can vary significantly, playing a context-dependent role. For instance, RAB1B is downregulated in highly metastatic triple-negative breast cancer cells, which promotes cancer progression by increasing levels of TGF-β receptor 1, a key player in oncogenic signaling (Yong2021Cancerdriving). Conversely, RAB1B expression is upregulated in colorectal cancer, where it, along with MMP9, serves as a predictor for tumor progression and metastasis (Yong2021Cancerdriving). The interaction between RAB1B and PITPNC1 is crucial for cancer metastasis, as PITPNC1 recruits RAB1B to the Golgi network, enhancing the secretion of pro-metastatic proteins (Halberg2016PITPNC1).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, RAB1B is involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Alterations in RAB1B function, particularly its phosphorylation by LRRK2, may disrupt cellular trafficking pathways, contributing to disease progression (Gao2018The). Additionally, RAB1B is implicated in RUNX1 haplodeficiency, a condition associated with thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, due to its role in ER-to-Golgi transport in megakaryocytes (Jalagadugula2018Defective).

## Interactions
RAB1B, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in vesicular trafficking and autophagy. RAB1B interacts with the Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3), acting as an effector in a nucleotide-dependent manner. This interaction is stronger when RAB1B is in its GTP-bound active state, suggesting a regulatory role in vesicular transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (Cavieres2020Human).

RAB1B also interacts with GBF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, enhancing its membrane association at the endoplasmic reticulum exit sites. This interaction modulates COPI recruitment and Arf1 dynamics, which are essential for maintaining Golgi structure and function (Monetta2007Rab1b).

In the context of autophagy, RAB1B is associated with ATG9A vesicles, which are involved in autophagosome formation. The presence of RAB1B on these vesicles suggests its role in the transport and formation of autophagosomes, as its depletion leads to the accumulation of phagophore membranes, indicating a regulatory function in autophagy (Kakuta2017Small).

These interactions highlight RAB1B's multifaceted role in cellular processes, particularly in vesicular trafficking and autophagy regulation.
