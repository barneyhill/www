# C2orf73

## Overview
C2orf73 is a gene located on chromosome 2 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 2 open reading frame 73. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by C2orf73 is not currently categorized under any specific protein family such as kinases or receptors, indicating that it may have unique or less well-characterized roles within the cell. Research into C2orf73 and its protein product is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its potential interactions and implications in human health and disease.
