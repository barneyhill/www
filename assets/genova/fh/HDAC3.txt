# HDAC3

## Overview
HDAC3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme histone deacetylase 3, a member of the class I histone deacetylases. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression by removing acetyl groups from lysine residues on histone proteins, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression. Histone deacetylase 3 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and chromatin assembly, and is ubiquitously expressed in human cells, predominantly located in the nucleus (Zhang2005Histone; Emiliani1998Characterization). The protein interacts with nuclear receptor corepressors such as N-CoR and SMRT, which are essential for its activation and function in transcriptional repression (Guenther2000A). HDAC3's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Zhang2005Histone). The gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest due to their involvement in various diseases, including neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting their potential as targets for therapeutic interventions (D’Mello2020Histone; Yoon2024De).

## Structure
HDAC3 is a class I histone deacetylase with a complex molecular structure that includes distinct functional domains. The protein's C-terminal region is crucial for its deacetylase activity and transcriptional repression, as it undergoes a conformational change necessary for activation by nuclear receptor corepressors such as NCoR and SMRT (Li2021A; Yang2002Functional). This region is also involved in the interaction with inositol tetraphosphate (IP4), which is essential for HDAC3's enzymatic activity (Arrar2012Structural).

The N-terminal portion of HDAC3 is necessary for oligomerization, allowing the protein to form homodimers and homotrimers (Yang2002Functional). The central portion contains a nuclear export signal, while the C-terminal part aids in nuclear localization (Yang2002Functional). The active site of HDAC3 features a tunnel-like structure formed by loops L1-L7, which is crucial for substrate recognition (Li2021A).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at Ser 424, regulate HDAC3's activity, enhancing its deacetylase function (Li2021A). The protein's interaction with corepressors and IP4 induces significant conformational changes, stabilizing its active form (Arrar2012Structural). HDAC3's structure and function are distinct from other HDACs due to these unique interactions and modifications.

## Function
Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is a crucial enzyme involved in the regulation of gene expression through chromatin remodeling. It functions by removing acetyl groups from lysine residues on histone proteins, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression (Zhang2005Histone; Emiliani1998Characterization). HDAC3 is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and is predominantly located in the nucleus, although it can also be found in the cytoplasm (Emiliani1998Characterization; Yang2002Functional).

HDAC3 plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and chromatin assembly (Yang2002Functional). It is part of the nuclear receptor corepressor complex, interacting with corepressors such as N-CoR and SMRT, which recruit HDAC3 to DNA-bound transcription factors and enhance its enzymatic activity (Zhang2005Histone). The activity of HDAC3 is modulated by phosphorylation, particularly at serine 424, which is crucial for its deacetylase function (Zhang2005Histone).

HDAC3 also interacts with and deacetylates non-histone proteins, such as the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), thereby repressing MEF2-dependent transcription and influencing muscle differentiation (Grégoire2007Histone). These molecular activities of HDAC3 contribute to its role in regulating organismal outcomes like development and differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HDAC3 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. De novo variants in HDAC3 have been linked to a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, congenital heart defects, and skeletal abnormalities. These variants often result in reduced deacetylation activity and disrupted interactions with multi-protein complexes, which are crucial for normal cellular function (Yoon2024De). 

In neurodegenerative diseases, HDAC3 is implicated in promoting neuronal death. It is involved in Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, where its neurotoxic activity is often due to posttranslational modifications rather than increased expression. Inhibition of HDAC3 has shown neuroprotective effects in models of these diseases (Qu2018Proteomic; D’Mello2020Histone). 

HDAC3 also plays a role in cardiac function, where its deletion in mice leads to severe cardiac hypertrophy and metabolic abnormalities. This is due to its role in maintaining myocardial energy metabolism and regulating nuclear receptor activity (Montgomery2008Maintenance). These findings highlight the clinical significance of HDAC3 in various diseases, emphasizing the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
HDAC3 (histone deacetylase 3) is involved in various protein interactions that regulate its activity and function. It interacts with Hsp90, a chaperone protein, in the nucleus, suggesting a role in regulating nuclear functions. This interaction is implicated in the regulation of gene transcription and chromatin stabilization (Kotwal2020Hsp90). HDAC3 also forms a complex with protein serine/threonine phosphatase 4 (PP4), which negatively regulates HDAC3 by dephosphorylating it at Ser 424, affecting its enzymatic activity (Zhang2005Histone).

HDAC3 interacts with the nuclear receptor corepressors SMRT and N-CoR, forming a complex that enhances its deacetylase activity. This complex is involved in transcriptional repression and is crucial for HDAC3's function in gene regulation (Guenther2000A). HDAC3 also associates with myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) proteins, specifically deacetylating MEF2D, which keeps MEF2 in a transcriptionally inactive state (Grégoire2007Histone).

Additionally, HDAC3 interacts with the nuclear-envelope protein LAP2β at the nuclear periphery, leading to histone H4 deacetylation and transcriptional repression (Somech2005The). These interactions highlight HDAC3's role in modulating transcription and chromatin structure through its association with various proteins.
