# GPR31

## Overview
GPR31 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 31, a transmembrane receptor involved in various cellular signaling pathways. This receptor is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is known for its role in transmitting signals from the extracellular environment to the interior of the cell. GPR31 is primarily located in the plasma membrane and is activated by specific ligands, such as the bioactive lipid 12(S)-HETE, influencing processes like platelet reactivity and arterial thrombosis (Guo2011Identification; Van2021Lipid). Additionally, GPR31 interacts with KRAS4B, a GTPase involved in cell growth and cancer progression, by facilitating its membrane association (Fehrenbacher2017The). The receptor also plays a role in immune regulation by promoting oral tolerance through interactions with pyruvate (Liu2022Pyruvate). GPR31's involvement in various diseases, including cancer and acute kidney injury, highlights its potential as a therapeutic target (Honn201612‐HETER1GPR31; Sharma2022Modulation).

## Function
GPR31, a G protein-coupled receptor, plays a significant role in various cellular processes by interacting with specific ligands to activate intracellular signaling pathways. It is primarily active in the plasma membrane of cells. One of its key functions is as a receptor for the bioactive lipid 12(S)-HETE, produced by 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX). This interaction enhances platelet reactivity and arterial thrombosis through Gi signaling pathways, leading to the activation of Rap1 and p38, although it does not directly induce platelet aggregation (Guo2011Identification; Van2021Lipid).

GPR31 also interacts with KRAS4B, a member of the RAS family of GTPases, promoting its membrane association in a prenylation-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization and function of KRAS4B, which is involved in cell signaling related to growth and cancer progression (Fehrenbacher2017The).

In the immune system, GPR31 is involved in enhancing oral tolerance through its interaction with pyruvate. It facilitates the extension of dendrites by CX3CR1 high myeloid cells into the intestinal lumen, which is essential for the induction of oral tolerance and the maintenance of regulatory T cells in the intestine (Liu2022Pyruvate).

## Clinical Significance
GPR31, a G protein-coupled receptor, is implicated in several diseases due to its role in cell signaling and interaction with bioactive lipids. In cancer, GPR31 is significantly up-regulated in prostate cancer tissues, correlating with tumor aggressiveness and progression. Its expression is associated with higher Gleason scores and advanced clinical stages, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in prostate cancer (Honn201612‐HETER1GPR31). GPR31 also plays a critical role in the progression of colorectal cancer, where its overexpression is linked to poorer patient outcomes (Napolitano2019The).

In addition to its role in cancer, GPR31 is involved in gentamicin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). It acts as a downstream effector in the 12-HETE signaling pathway, which regulates inflammatory cytokines and contributes to tubular injury. Alterations in GPR31 expression or function can exacerbate AKI, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sharma2022Modulation).

GPR31 is also implicated in skin tumors, where its expression varies across different types, such as squamous cell carcinomas and basal cell carcinomas. Its involvement in KRAS membrane association suggests a role in KRAS-dependent tumor proliferation and survival (Förch2021Expression).

## Interactions
GPR31, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular signaling pathways. One significant interaction is with the small GTPase KRAS4B. GPR31 acts as a trafficking chaperone for KRAS4B, facilitating its delivery to the plasma membrane. This interaction is dependent on the farnesylation of KRAS4B, as demonstrated by the lack of interaction with a KRAS4B mutant and inhibition by farnesyltransferase inhibitors. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the protein-protein interaction between GPR31 and KRAS4B, particularly on the endoplasmic reticulum (Fehrenbacher2017The).

GPR31 also forms a stable heteromeric complex with the protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) on the surface of human platelets. This interaction is specific, as GPR31 does not associate with PAR1. The GPR31/PAR4 complex plays a role in modulating platelet activation and thrombosis, with GPR31 signaling through the Gi protein to enhance PAR4-mediated platelet activation (Van2021Lipid).

These interactions highlight GPR31's role in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking and platelet reactivity, through its specific binding with other proteins.
