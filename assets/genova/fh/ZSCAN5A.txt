# ZSCAN5A

## Overview
ZSCAN5A is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 5A protein, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can bind to DNA, RNA, proteins, or other small molecules, and are often involved in transcriptional regulation. The SCAN domain is a leucine-rich region that facilitates protein-protein interactions, suggesting that ZSCAN5A may play a role in transcriptional regulation through complex formation with other proteins. The specific biological functions and pathways involving ZSCAN5A remain to be fully elucidated, but its involvement in transcriptional regulation indicates potential roles in cellular differentiation and development. Further research is needed to clarify its interactions and clinical significance.
