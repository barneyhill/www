# IQCB1

## Overview
The IQCB1 gene encodes the protein IQ motif containing B1, also known as nephrocystin-5, which is integral to the function and maintenance of primary cilia in human cells. This protein is categorized as a ciliary protein due to its critical role in ciliary processes, particularly in the retina and kidneys. Nephrocystin-5 localizes to the connecting cilia of photoreceptors, where it forms part of a multiprotein complex essential for the transport of cargo molecules, thereby supporting photoreceptor function and vision. The protein's interactions with other ciliary proteins, such as CEP290 and Epb41l5, underscore its importance in maintaining ciliary integrity and function. Mutations in the IQCB1 gene are associated with ciliopathies, including Senior-Løken syndrome and Leber congenital amaurosis, highlighting its clinical significance in genetic disorders affecting the kidneys and eyes (Wang2011Wholeexome; EstradaCuzcano2011IQCB1Mutations; Ronquillo2012Senior–Løken).

## Function
The IQCB1 gene encodes a protein known as nephrocystin-5, which plays a crucial role in ciliary function. In healthy human cells, IQCB1 is involved in the maintenance and function of primary cilia, which are essential for cellular communication and sensory functions. The protein localizes to the connecting cilia of photoreceptors, where it interacts with other proteins such as RPGR and CEP290, forming part of a multiprotein complex that regulates the transport of cargo molecules to the outer segment of the photoreceptor (Wang2011Wholeexome; EstradaCuzcano2011IQCB1Mutations).

IQCB1 is also involved in centrosomal localization, a critical component of ciliary function. Its efficient localization to the centrosome requires both the coiled-coil domain and the CEP290 interacting domain. The protein Epb41l5 regulates the association of IQCB1 with the centrosome, indicating a role in maintaining ciliary integrity (Yu2020Epb41l5).

In the retina, IQCB1 is implicated in modulating photoreceptor cilia length and facilitating the transport of membrane and soluble proteins along the cilium. This function is vital for the structural integrity and function of photoreceptors, which are crucial for vision (Vincent2017Specific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IQCB1 gene, also known as nephrocystin-5, are clinically significant as they are associated with several genetic disorders, primarily affecting the kidneys and eyes. IQCB1 mutations are a known cause of Senior-Løken syndrome (SLSN), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by nephronophthisis, a form of kidney disease, and retinal degeneration leading to vision loss (EstradaCuzcano2011IQCB1Mutations; Ronquillo2012Senior–Løken). In patients with SLSN, mutations in IQCB1 are thought to lead to the syndrome in 100% of cases, making it a classic gene associated with this condition (Ronquillo2012Senior–Løken).

IQCB1 mutations are also implicated in Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a severe early-onset retinal dystrophy. Some patients with IQCB1 mutations present with LCA without renal involvement, although there is a risk of developing kidney disease later in life (Wang2011Wholeexome; EstradaCuzcano2011IQCB1Mutations). The gene's role in retinal degeneration is linked to its function in the photoreceptor connecting cilia, where it interacts with other proteins involved in ciliary function (Oh2017EarlyOnset). Variability in the onset and severity of renal disease in patients with IQCB1 mutations suggests the influence of other genetic or environmental factors (EstradaCuzcano2011IQCB1Mutations).

## Interactions
IQCB1, also known as nephrocystin-5, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in ciliary processes. It interacts with the protein CEP290, forming part of a multiprotein complex at the connecting cilium of photoreceptors, which is essential for the transport of cargo molecules to the outer segment of the photoreceptor. This interaction is significant in the context of ciliopathies such as Leber congenital amaurosis and Senior-Løken syndrome (EstradaCuzcano2011IQCB1Mutations).

IQCB1 also interacts with Epb41l5, an adaptor protein that affects its localization at the ciliary base. Epb41l5 binds to the IQ-coiled-coil domain of IQCB1, suppressing its centrosomal association and reducing its interaction with CEP290. This interaction is thought to regulate ciliary function by modulating the localization and interaction of IQCB1 and CEP290 at the centrosome (Yu2020Epb41l5).

In addition, a mutation in the CNNM4 gene has been shown to enhance its interaction with IQCB1, suggesting a potential role in disease pathology related to retinal dystrophy (Li2018Identification). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein interactions in which IQCB1 is involved, underscoring its role in ciliary function and related disorders.
