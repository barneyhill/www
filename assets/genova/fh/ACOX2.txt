# ACOX2

## Overview
The ACOX2 gene encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA oxidase 2, a peroxisomal enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the beta-oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids and bile acid intermediates. This enzyme is categorized as an oxidase and is essential for the conversion of C27-bile acid intermediates into mature C24 bile acids, a process crucial for maintaining normal physiological functions and preventing the accumulation of toxic intermediates. Acyl-CoA oxidase 2 is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, with additional expression in other tissues such as the heart and skeletal muscle. The enzyme functions as a homodimer, with each subunit containing a noncovalently-bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) molecule necessary for its activity. Disruptions in ACOX2 function can lead to metabolic disorders, highlighting its importance in lipid metabolism and energy production (Vilarinho2016ACOX2; Ferdinandusse2018A; Monte2017ACOX2).

## Function
The ACOX2 gene encodes a peroxisomal enzyme known as acyl-CoA oxidase 2, which plays a critical role in the beta-oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids and bile acid intermediates within peroxisomes. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, with additional expression in tissues such as the heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas (Ferdinandusse2018A; Monte2017ACOX2). ACOX2 is involved in the oxidation of CoA esters of 2-methyl-branched fatty acids and C27-bile acid intermediates, facilitating their conversion into mature C24 bile acids, which are essential for normal physiological functions (Vilarinho2016ACOX2; Monte2017ACOX2).

The enzyme functions as a homodimer, with each subunit containing a noncovalently-bound FAD molecule necessary for its activity (Monte2017ACOX2). ACOX2's activity is crucial for the peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway, which is important for lipid metabolism and energy production. The enzyme's role in converting C27 to C24 bile acids is vital for maintaining normal bile acid levels and preventing the accumulation of toxic intermediates, which can lead to metabolic disorders if disrupted (Vilarinho2016ACOX2; Monte2017ACOX2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ACOX2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. ACOX2 deficiency, an inborn error of bile acid synthesis, leads to the accumulation of C27-bile acid intermediates, resulting in liver dysfunction and neurological symptoms. Patients with ACOX2 deficiency often present with persistent hypertransaminasemia, liver fibrosis, ataxia, and cognitive impairment (Vilarinho2016ACOX2; Monte2017ACOX2). The deficiency is characterized by a complete loss of ACOX2 protein expression, which disrupts the normal peroxisomal beta-oxidation of bile acid intermediates (Ferdinandusse2018A).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), altered expression of ACOX2 is correlated with mutations in genes such as TP53, KRAS, and CDKN2A. These mutations are significantly associated with changes in ACOX2 expression, impacting immune cell infiltration and potentially influencing cancer progression (Sui2022Altered).

ACOX2 deficiency has also been linked to liver cancer. Acox2 knockout mice developed liver cancer with significant lymphocytic infiltration, suggesting a potential role of ACOX2 in tumorigenesis. Low ACOX2 expression is associated with decreased survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients (Zhang2022Acox2).

## Interactions
ACOX2, or acyl-CoA oxidase 2, is known to interact with several proteins, as identified through tandem-affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) analysis in MHCC97H and HEK-293T cell lines. Approximately 40% of the top 30 interacting proteins for ACOX2 overlapped in these cell lines. Notably, ACOX2 interacts with four classic biotin-dependent carboxylases, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACACA) and 2 (ACACB), methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase subunit alpha (MCCA) and beta chain (MCCB), propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunit alpha (PCCA) and subunit beta (PCCB), and pyruvate carboxylase (PC). The interaction between ACOX2 and MCCC2 (MCCB) was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in HEK-293T cells (Zhang2022Acox2).

ACOX2 also interacts with DNA topoisomerases, including TOP2A and TOP2B, in MHCC97H cells (Zhang2022Acox2). These interactions suggest a role for ACOX2 in various cellular processes beyond its enzymatic function in peroxisomal beta-oxidation. The study of these interactions provides insights into the broader functional network in which ACOX2 operates, potentially linking it to regulatory pathways involving protein post-translational modifications and DNA damage responses (Zhang2022Acox2).
