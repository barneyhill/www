# PLEKHF2

## Overview
PLEKHF2 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology and FYVE domain containing 2, commonly referred to as Phafin2. This protein is characterized by the presence of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a FYVE domain, which are crucial for its role in binding phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) (Tang2023Phafins; Tang2017Structural). Phafin2 is involved in several cellular processes, including autophagy, endosomal trafficking, and macropinocytosis, and is known for its interactions with the serine threonine kinase Akt, which are essential for autophagy induction (MatsudaLennikov2014Lysosomal; Noguchi2014Lysosomal). The protein is broadly expressed in human tissues, suggesting its significant role in immune responses and cellular homeostasis (Tang2023Phafins). Alterations in PLEKHF2 expression and genetic variations have been linked to various diseases, including prostate and breast cancer, as well as systemic lupus erythematosus, highlighting its clinical significance (Shamsara2020Bioinformatics; Kariuki2014Genetic).

## Structure
The PLEKHF2 gene encodes the Phafin2 protein, which is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a central FYVE domain, both of which are involved in phosphoinositide binding, specifically phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) (Tang2023Phafins; Tang2017Structural). The PH domain is a globular module with seven β-strands forming two perpendicular anti-parallel β-sheets and a short α-helix at the C-terminus (Tang2020The). The FYVE domain is a small zinc-binding module with two double-stranded antiparallel β-sheets and two α-helices, which binds constitutively to PtdIns(3)P (Tang2023Phafins; Tang2020The).

Phafin2 is an α/β protein with approximately 23% α-helix, 21% β-strand, 15% β-turn, and 41% random coil content, indicating a moderately elongated monomeric structure (Tang2017Structural; Tang2024The). The protein also contains a C-terminal poly aspartic acid (polyD) motif, which is involved in autoinhibition of the PH domain's binding to PtdIns(3)P, regulating membrane targeting (Tang2023Phafins; Hasan2022The). The polyD motif is similar to the C-terminal tail of AKT, enriched in acidic residues, and can be phosphorylated to modulate PH domain interactions (Hasan2022The). The protein's molecular mass is approximately 28 kDa (Tang2017Structural).

## Function
Phafin2, encoded by the PLEKHF2 gene, is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including autophagy, endosomal cargo transportation, and macropinocytosis. It contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a central FYVE domain, and a C-terminal poly aspartic acid (polyD) motif, which are essential for its membrane-binding capabilities, particularly to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) found on early endosomes and lysosomal surfaces (Tang2023Phafins; Hasan2022The).

In autophagy, Phafin2 interacts with the serine threonine kinase Akt, accumulating in lysosomes after autophagy induction, a process dependent on lysosomal PtdIns(3)P. This interaction is crucial for the induction of autophagy, as both active and inactive forms of Akt interact with Phafin2 (MatsudaLennikov2014Lysosomal). Phafin2 also plays a role in macropinocytosis by coordinating actin organization at forming macropinosomes, facilitating the entry of nascent macropinosomes through the subcortical actin matrix (Tang2023Phafins; Schink2021The).

Phafin2 is broadly expressed in human tissues such as bone marrow and lymph nodes, suggesting its involvement in immune responses and cellular homeostasis (Tang2023Phafins). Its evolutionary presence in animals indicates its specialized functions in complex cellular processes (Hasan2022The).

## Clinical Significance
PLEKHF2 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and genetic variations. In prostate cancer, PLEKHF2 is associated with the progression to metastatic disease, particularly involving lymph nodes. Amplification of PLEKHF2 is linked to decreased overall and disease/progression-free survival in prostate cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Shamsara2020Bioinformatics). The gene's amplification is also associated with increased metastatic features, possibly regulated by androgen, which enhances its expression (Shamsara2020Bioinformatics).

In breast cancer, PLEKHF2 is frequently coamplified with the MYC oncogene in the 8p11-p12 chromosomal region. This coamplification, along with DNA hypomethylation, contributes to the aggressive phenotype of breast carcinomas, characterized by increased proliferation rates and reduced patient survival (Parris2014Frequent).

PLEKHF2 is also associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where it is linked to interferon-alpha (IFN-α) activity. This association is observed in different ancestral backgrounds, indicating its potential role in the disease's pathogenesis and its pharmacogenomic implications (Kariuki2014Genetic).

## Interactions
PLEKHF2, also known as Phafin2, is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes such as autophagy and apoptosis. Phafin2 interacts with the serine threonine kinase Akt, specifically Akt1 and Akt2, but not Akt3. This interaction is crucial for the induction of autophagy and occurs through both the pleckstrin homology (PH) and FYVE domains of Phafin2. The interaction is not dependent on phosphorylation and is essential for the lysosomal localization of the Akt-Phafin2 complex, which is a critical step in autophagy induction (Noguchi2014Lysosomal).

Phafin2 also interacts with phosphoinositides, particularly PtdIns(3)P, which facilitates its role in endosomal trafficking and autophagy. This interaction is mediated by its PH and FYVE domains, which bind to PtdIns(3)P, enabling Phafin2 to localize to lysosomes and participate in autophagy processes (Noguchi2014Lysosomal; Tang2024The).

In the context of apoptosis, Phafin2 enhances TNF-α-induced apoptosis by translocating to the endoplasmic reticulum, disrupting calcium homeostasis, and activating caspase cascades (Li2008EAPFPhafin2; Tang2024The). These interactions highlight Phafin2's multifaceted role in cellular signaling pathways.
