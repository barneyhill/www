# PTGDR2

## Overview
PTGDR2, also known as CRTH2, is a gene that encodes the prostaglandin D2 receptor 2, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in various physiological and pathological processes. This receptor is part of the seven-transmembrane receptor family, which is characteristic of GPCRs, and plays a crucial role in mediating immune responses by binding to prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). PTGDR2 is primarily expressed in T helper type 2 (Th2) cells, eosinophils, and basophils, where it facilitates chemotaxis and the production of Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which are essential for immune function (Hirai2001Prostaglandin; Tian2024Advances). Beyond its role in immunity, PTGDR2 is implicated in cancer biology, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Tian2024Advances). The receptor's involvement in both immune regulation and cancer highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in related diseases.

## Structure
PTGDR2, also known as CRTH2, is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is part of the seven-transmembrane receptor family, a characteristic feature of GPCRs. The receptor is composed of 395 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 43 kDa. It is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11 q12) (Tian2024Advances). The structure of PTGDR2 includes two N-glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain of the N-terminal, which are important for protein folding and stability. The receptor also features a long cytoplasmic tail region containing multiple protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites, which are believed to contribute to the receptor's desensitizing effect (Tian2024Advances).

PTGDR2 is involved in the immune response by binding to prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which leads to the recruitment of Th2 cells and other leukocytes. This interaction results in the induction of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. The receptor inhibits adenylate cyclase via the Giα protein, reducing intracellular cAMP levels and activating immune cells (Tian2024Advances). The receptor's structure and post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, play crucial roles in its function and signaling capabilities.

## Function
PTGDR2, also known as CRTH2, is a G-protein coupled receptor that plays a significant role in the immune response by mediating the effects of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) in various immune cells. It is primarily expressed in T helper type 2 (Th2) cells, eosinophils, and basophils, where it facilitates chemotaxis, a process critical for directing these cells to sites of inflammation or infection (Hirai2001Prostaglandin). PTGDR2 activation by PGD2 leads to the mobilization of calcium ions, which is essential for cell signaling and the subsequent migration of immune cells (Hirai2001Prostaglandin).

In healthy human cells, PTGDR2 is involved in the recruitment of Th2 cells and other leukocytes, promoting the production of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which are crucial for the immune response (Tian2024Advances). The receptor also inhibits adenylate cyclase via the Giα protein, reducing intracellular cAMP levels and activating immune cells (Tian2024Advances). PTGDR2's role in immune cell migration and cytokine production underscores its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and responding to inflammatory stimuli.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PTGDR2 gene, also known as prostaglandin D2 receptor 2, have been linked to various cancers and inflammatory conditions. In gastric cancer, lower expression levels of PTGDR2 are associated with poor prognosis and high mortality, indicating its potential role in tumor suppression (Tian2024Advances). Similarly, in breast and lung cancers, reduced PTGDR2 expression correlates with increased malignancy and worse prognosis (Tian2024Advances). In contrast, higher PTGDR2 expression in colon and pancreatic cancers is associated with better prognosis and longer survival, suggesting a protective role (Tian2024Advances).

In the context of inflammation, PTGDR2 is involved in immune responses, particularly in conditions characterized by altered Th2 activity, such as asthma and allergic inflammation (Tian2024Advances). The gene's expression is also implicated in sleep regulation and neuroprotection, with knockout studies showing its involvement in insomnia and depression-related behavior (Urade2021Biochemical).

In HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer, hypermethylation of PTGDR2 is linked to reduced disease-free survival, highlighting its potential as an epigenetic biomarker for prognosis and treatment monitoring (Misawa2020G). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PTGDR2 in both cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
PTGDR2, also known as CRTH2, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in immune response and disease processes. It is part of a protein-protein interaction network that includes HRH4, ALOX15, CYSLTR2, GPR34, IL5RA, and FCRL5, which are associated with immunological processes and asthma pathology (GarcíaSánchez2021PTGDR2). These interactions suggest that PTGDR2 may collaborate with these proteins in modulating immune responses, particularly in the context of asthma.

In cancer biology, PTGDR2 interacts with signaling pathways that influence tumor progression. It is known to inhibit the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway in gastric cancer, reducing the self-renewal ability of cancer cells and downregulating stemness-associated proteins (Tian2024Advances). PTGDR2 also interacts with YAP (Yes-associated protein) in gastric cancer cells, where its expression is negatively correlated with YAP. Overexpression of PTGDR2 can counteract YAP's pro-tumor effects, suggesting an inhibitory interaction that affects cancer cell proliferation and self-renewal (Bie2020YAP).

These interactions highlight PTGDR2's role in both immune regulation and cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in related diseases.
