# NINJ1

## Overview
NINJ1, or ninjurin 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, nerve regeneration, and inflammation. The protein, also named ninjurin 1, is characterized by its structural composition of two transmembrane helices and its ability to form α-helical filaments that facilitate plasma membrane rupture during cell death (Degen2023Structural; Lee2024Structural). NINJ1 plays a significant role in nerve regeneration by promoting neurite outgrowth and mediating cell-to-cell adhesion through homophilic binding (Cho2013Ninjurin1; Araki1997Mechanism). Additionally, it acts as a negative regulator of angiogenesis and is involved in bone homeostasis and myogenic differentiation (Liu2020The). NINJ1's interactions with the tumor suppressor protein p53 highlight its involvement in cellular processes related to tumorigenesis and inflammation (Cho2013Ninjurin1; Yang2017Ninjurin). The gene's expression is implicated in various diseases, including non-small cell lung cancer, liver diseases, and inflammatory bowel disease, underscoring its clinical significance (Choi2020Ninjurin1; Kayagaki2023Inhibiting; Hyun2022Ninjurin1).

## Structure
The NINJ1 protein is characterized by its structural composition, which includes two transmembrane helices with termini located in the extracellular space (Degen2023Structural). The protein forms long, α-helical filaments that are crucial for its function in plasma membrane rupture during cell death. These filaments are composed of four α-helices (α1-α4), with α3 and α4 forming the core backbone of the filament. Helices α1 and α2 contribute to a robust polymerization interface, with interactions such as the K45-D53 salt bridge playing a key role (Degen2023Structural; Lee2024Structural).

The NINJ1 filaments exhibit a hydrophilic and hydrophobic dichotomy, typical of pore-forming proteins, which allows them to cap membrane edges and facilitate lipid bilayer rupture (Degen2023Structural; Lee2024Structural). The protein transitions from an inactive monomeric state to an active polymeric state, with helices α1 and α2 inserting into the membrane to form kinked conformations that bridge neighboring protomers (Degen2023Structural).

Mutational analysis has identified key residues involved in filament formation and membrane interaction, with certain mutations disrupting filament formation and reducing cell lysis (Degen2023Structural; Lee2024Structural). The structural model of NINJ1 filaments is supported by molecular dynamics simulations, which confirm their stability at membrane edges (Degen2023Structural).

## Function
NINJ1 (ninjurin 1) encodes a cell surface adhesion molecule involved in various cellular and physiological processes. It plays a crucial role in nerve regeneration, particularly following nerve injury, by promoting neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion neurons and Schwann cells (Cho2013Ninjurin1; Araki1997Mechanism). NINJ1 mediates cell-to-cell adhesion through homophilic binding, which is essential for its function in tissue development and maintenance (Araki1997Mechanism). This adhesion is characterized by interactions between ninjurin molecules on different cells, requiring a functional cytoskeleton and divalent cations (Araki1997Mechanism).

NINJ1 is also involved in regulating angiogenesis, acting as a negative regulator in endothelial cell tube formation, which impacts processes like wound healing and tumor progression (Liu2020The). In bone homeostasis, it influences osteoclast survival, affecting conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis (Liu2020The). In muscle tissue, NINJ1 is expressed in cardiomyocytes and is involved in myogenic differentiation and myocyte growth (Liu2020The).

NINJ1 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, forming a feedback loop that regulates p53 expression and influences cell survival, senescence, and response to DNA damage (Cho2013Ninjurin1; Yang2017Ninjurin). This interaction highlights its role in modulating cellular processes related to tumorigenesis and inflammation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NINJ1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), elevated NINJ1 expression is associated with increased tumor formation and progression. NINJ1 promotes cancer stem cell phenotypes, enhancing survival and proliferation under stress conditions, such as hypoxia and chemotherapy, and is linked to poor prognosis in NSCLC patients (Hyun2022Ninjurin1).

In liver diseases, NINJ1 is involved in apoptosis-associated plasma membrane rupture (PMR), contributing to liver inflammation and injury. NINJ1 deficiency or inhibition reduces liver injury markers and inflammation in models of fulminant hepatitis and other liver injuries, suggesting its role in conditions like hepatocellular carcinoma and viral hepatitis (Kayagaki2023Inhibiting).

NINJ1 also plays a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where its deficiency leads to microbial imbalance and increased colonic inflammation, potentially contributing to chronic colitis and colon cancer (Choi2020Ninjurin1).

In serous ovarian cancer, lower NINJ1 expression is linked to advanced disease stages and poorer prognosis, indicating its potential role in tumor progression and drug resistance (Berkel2022Lower).

## Interactions
NINJ1 (ninjurin 1) is known to form homomeric protein complexes through cis-interactions, as demonstrated by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays and formaldehyde cross-linking experiments. These interactions occur in various cell types, including NIH3T3 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages (Bae2017Ninjurin1). The intracellular region of NINJ1, particularly the segment between Leu 101 and Ala 110, is crucial for its homomeric assembly. Deletion of this region abolishes the protein's ability to form homomers (Bae2017Ninjurin1).

NINJ1 is also involved in plasma membrane rupture (PMR) during cell death, where it forms filamentous structures that facilitate membrane rupture. These filaments are composed of tightly packed transmembrane α-helices, forming a fence-like array that is crucial for PMR (Degen2023Structural). NINJ1's polymerization into these structures is necessary for its function in PMR, as demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis and crosslinking experiments (Degen2023Structural).

NINJ1's interactions are highly conserved across species, with co-immunoprecipitation experiments showing that human and mouse NINJ1 can interact with each other (Bae2017Ninjurin1). These interactions are essential for NINJ1's role in cell adhesion, nerve regeneration, and inflammatory responses.
