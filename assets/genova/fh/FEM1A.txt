# FEM1A

## Overview
FEM1A, or fem-1 homolog A, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of protein degradation within human cells. The protein, fem-1 homolog A, is a component of the CUL2-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which play a critical role in targeting proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation. This function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in the regulation of the Stem-Loop Binding Protein (SLBP), which is crucial for histone metabolism and cell cycle progression. FEM1A's interaction with SLBP is evolutionarily conserved, indicating its fundamental role across species. The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is part of a complex network of interactions that ensure proper cell cycle regulation and protein turnover (Samadani2015Interaction; Dankert2017FEM1).

## Function
FEM1A (fem-1 homolog A) is a protein involved in the regulation of the degradation of Stem-Loop Binding Protein (SLBP) in human cells. It is part of the CUL2-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which target proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation. FEM1A interacts with SLBP, along with its homologs FEM1B and FEM1C, to mediate SLBP degradation, ensuring appropriate levels of SLBP throughout the cell cycle (Dankert2017FEM1). This regulation is crucial for synchronizing histone metabolism with the cell cycle, as SLBP is involved in mRNA cleavage, translation, and degradation, with its levels peaking during the S-phase (Dankert2017FEM1).

FEM1A binds to specific motifs within the N-terminus of SLBP, such as the MARY92-95 motif, to facilitate its degradation outside of the G2 phase (Dankert2017FEM1). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is part of the E3 ligase protein complex of ubiquitin (Samadani2015Interaction). The evolutionary conservation of the FEM1-SLBP degradation pathway across species, including D. melanogaster and C. elegans, underscores its fundamental role in cellular regulation (Dankert2017FEM1).

## Clinical Significance
FEM1A has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. It is considered a genetic risk factor for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), with a germline missense mutation in FEM1A reported in a woman with PCOS, suggesting its potential role in the syndrome (Sáez2007Calpain5). In the context of cancer, FEM1A is involved in the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway, with reduced expression observed in human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, and is associated with ovarian cancer (Samadani2015Interaction). 

FEM1A is also linked to Keshan disease, an endemic mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, where its up-regulation in patients suggests mitochondrial dysfunction, which may contribute to the disease's pathogenesis (Wang2018Prediction). In the context of COVID-19, FEM1A has been identified as a gene whose expression is altered in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially playing a role in the immune response and disease severity (Pahl2022Implicating). These associations highlight FEM1A's involvement in various pathological processes, making it a gene of interest for further research in these conditions.

## Interactions
FEM1A is involved in the regulation of the Stem-Loop Binding Protein (SLBP) degradation. It interacts with SLBP through distinct binding motifs within SLBP's N-terminus, specifically binding to the MARY92-95 region. This interaction is crucial for targeting SLBP for proteasome-mediated degradation, as demonstrated by experiments showing that SLBP mutants unable to bind FEM1A exhibit higher expression levels than the wild-type SLBP (Dankert2017FEM1).

FEM1A is part of the CUL2-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which are involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. This complex formation is essential for the regulation of SLBP levels, ensuring proper histone metabolism and cell cycle regulation. The interaction between FEM1A and SLBP is evolutionarily conserved, with similar interactions observed in other species such as C. elegans and D. melanogaster (Dankert2017FEM1).

The CRL2 FEM1A/B/C complexes cooperate with SCF cyclin F to regulate SLBP levels, highlighting the redundancy in human cells where multiple E3 ligases can target the same substrate, and a single E3 ligase can have multiple substrates (Dankert2017FEM1).
