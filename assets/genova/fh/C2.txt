# C2

## Overview
The C2 gene encodes the complement component C2 protein, a serine protease that plays a pivotal role in the classical and lectin pathways of the complement system, which are integral to the immune response. The C2 protein is synthesized as a zymogen and, upon activation, is cleaved into two fragments, C2a and C2b. The C2a fragment, which is the catalytic component, is involved in the formation of the C3 convertase complex, crucial for the opsonization and clearance of pathogens. The C2 protein is heavily glycosylated and shares structural similarities with other complement proteins, such as Factor B. Mutations and deficiencies in the C2 gene are linked to various clinical conditions, including hereditary C2 deficiency, systemic lupus erythematosus, and certain renal diseases. Additionally, polymorphisms in the C2 gene have been associated with a reduced risk of age-related macular degeneration (Bentley1986Primary; Alper2003ImmunoglobulindeficienciesandsusceptibilitytoinfectionamonghomozygotesandheterozygotesforC2deficiency; Francis2008Polymorphisms).

## Structure
The human complement component C2 protein is a serine protease involved in the classical pathway of the complement system. It is synthesized as a zymogen with a molecular weight of approximately 102,000 and consists of 732 amino acid residues (Bentley1986Primary). Upon activation, C2 is cleaved into two polypeptides: C2a and C2b. The C2a chain, which is the catalytic component, contains six potential glycosylation sites, while C2b has two (Bentley1986Primary). The C2 protein is heavily glycosylated, with 15.9% of its mass attributed to carbohydrates, primarily attached to the C2a chain (Bentley1986Primary).

The C-terminal half of C2a is homologous to the catalytic domains of other serine proteinases, indicating its role in enzymatic activity (Bentley1986Primary). The C2b region contains three tandem repeats of approximately 60 amino acids each, which are homologous to repeats found in other complement regulatory proteins like Factor B and C4BP (Bentley1986Primary). These repeats are involved in the Mg2+-dependent interaction with C4b, forming the classical-pathway C3 convertase (Bentley1986Primary). The structure of C2 mRNA and protein is closely related to that of Factor B, with both having similar organization and domains (Bentley1986Primary).

## Function
The C2 gene encodes the complement component C2 protein, which plays a crucial role in the classical and lectin pathways of the complement system, an essential part of the immune response. In its zymogen form, C2 associates with C4b bound to immune aggregates and is cleaved by C1 to form the C3 convertase, C4b2a. This enzyme complex is responsible for cleaving complement component C3, leading to opsonization and clearance of pathogens (Bentley1986Primary; Mortensen2016Solution). The C2 protein is composed of two fragments, C2a and C2b. C2a, which remains bound to C4b, is involved in the hydrolysis of complement components C3 and C5, facilitating downstream immune responses such as phagocytosis and the assembly of the cell membrane attack complex (Bentley1986Primary; Mortensen2016Solution).

C2 is primarily active in the blood plasma and on cell surfaces, where it contributes to the formation of the C3 convertase, a key step in the complement cascade. This cascade enhances the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear pathogens and damaged cells, playing a vital role in immune defense (Bentley1986Primary; Martini2010Recombinant).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and deficiencies in the C2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Hereditary C2 deficiency (C2D) is linked to an increased risk of severe infections, particularly those caused by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. This deficiency is the most common inherited complete deficiency of a complement protein in European Caucasians, with a prevalence of 1 per 10,000 (Alper2003ImmunoglobulindeficienciesandsusceptibilitytoinfectionamonghomozygotesandheterozygotesforC2deficiency). Patients with C2D also have a higher incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other rheumatic diseases, with a mean onset age of 34 years for SLE (Jönsson2005Hereditary).

C2D is associated with cardiovascular diseases, notably a fourfold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) compared to the general population (Jönsson2005Hereditary). Gain-of-function mutations in the C2 gene, such as R249C and S250C, have been implicated in complement-mediated renal diseases like atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), due to increased C3 deposition in the kidney microvasculature (Urban2021GainofFunction). Additionally, certain polymorphisms in the C2 gene are associated with a reduced risk of progression to advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Francis2008Polymorphisms).

## Interactions
The human complement C2 protein is involved in several critical interactions within the complement system. It interacts with complement component C4 to form the C4b2 complex, which is part of the classical and lectin pathways. This interaction is Mg2+-dependent and involves the von Willebrand factor-A (vWFA) domain of C2, which contains a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) crucial for binding (Laich2001Complement; Mortensen2016Solution). The C2 protein is cleaved into C2a and C2b fragments upon binding to C4b, with C2a remaining bound to form the C3 convertase C4b2a (Mortensen2016Solution).

C2 also interacts with the complement receptor inhibitor trispanning (CRIT), specifically binding to the extracellular domain 1 (CRIT-ed1). This interaction is significant as CRIT competes with C4b for C2 binding, potentially modulating complement activation (Hui2005Expression; Inal2005Complement). The vWFA domain of C2 is central to these interactions, as it binds both C4 and CRIT, highlighting its role in the assembly of C4b-C2 and CRIT-C2 complexes (Hui2005Expression). These interactions are essential for the regulation and activation of the complement system.
