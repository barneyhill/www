# HEATR3

## Overview
HEATR3 (HEAT repeat containing 3) is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of HEAT repeats, which are structural motifs known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. The HEATR3 protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis and intracellular transport, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting cell growth and proliferation (Zhang2013Extended). In the immune system, HEATR3 is notably expressed in innate immune cells, where it acts as a positive regulator of NOD2 signaling, thereby influencing the activation of NF-κB and the secretion of IL-8, essential components of the immune response to bacterial infections (Zhang2013Extended). The gene's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in both cellular function and organismal health, with implications for various diseases, including Diamond-Blackfan Anemia and uterine fibroids (Liu2023Perspectives; Edwards2019A).

## Function
HEATR3 (HEAT repeat containing 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, primarily through its role in protein-protein interactions and intracellular transport. The protein contains HEAT repeats, which are structural motifs that facilitate these interactions, contributing to its function in the cytoplasm (Zhang2013Extended). HEATR3 is implicated in ribosome biogenesis and assembly, processes essential for protein synthesis and cellular growth. This involvement suggests that HEATR3 plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting the growth and proliferation of cells (Zhang2013Extended).

In the context of the immune system, HEATR3 is highly expressed in innate immune cells and acts as a positive regulator of NOD2 signaling. This regulation is crucial for the activation of NF-κB and the secretion of IL-8, both of which are important for initiating immune responses to bacterial components (Zhang2013Extended). The protein's activity in enhancing NOD2 signaling underscores its significance in the immune response, particularly in recognizing and responding to bacterial infections (Zhang2013Extended). These functions highlight the multifaceted role of HEATR3 in both cellular and organismal biology.

## Clinical Significance
The HEATR3 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations or alterations in its expression. Variants in HEATR3 are associated with Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA), a rare genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure and anemia. These variants destabilize the protein, leading to impaired ribosome biogenesis and a severe phenotype, including short stature and intellectual disability. HEATR3 is inherited in a recessive manner in DBA cases (Liu2023Perspectives; Pelagiadis2023The).

HEATR3 is also linked to uterine fibroids, with increased expression in uterine tissue associated with a higher risk of developing these benign tumors. A trans-ethnic genome-wide association study identified genetic variants near HEATR3 that are significantly associated with fibroid risk (Edwards2019A).

Additionally, HEATR3 has been identified as a candidate gene for susceptibility to mycobacterial infections. A de novo frameshift mutation in HEATR3 was found in a patient with BCG-itis, suggesting a potential role in immune response, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Varzari2022Candidate).

## Interactions
HEATR3 (HEAT repeat containing 3) is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It is suggested to be a positive regulator of the NOD2 signaling pathway, particularly in the context of Crohn's disease. Experiments have shown that HEATR3 influences NF-κB activation and IL-8 secretion in cells expressing NOD2. Knockdown of HEATR3 results in reduced NF-κB activation and IL-8 secretion, while over-expression leads to increased activity and secretion, indicating functional interactions with components of the NOD2 signaling pathway (Zhang2013Extended).

HEATR3 is also mentioned in the context of ribosomal protein assembly. It is identified as a human ortholog of the yeast chaperone Syo1, which is involved in the nuclear import and assembly of ribosomal proteins. However, specific interactions of HEATR3 with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Pillet2016Hold).

In the study of the carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) interactome, HEATR3 is noted as a protein not directly connected in the network of CA IX interactors, suggesting its role may be more peripheral or context-dependent in this specific interactome (Buanne2012Characterization).
