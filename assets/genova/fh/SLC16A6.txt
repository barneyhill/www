# SLC16A6

## Overview
SLC16A6 is a gene that encodes the protein monocarboxylate transporter 7 (MCT7), a member of the solute carrier family 16. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and is part of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), characterized by its 12 transmembrane helices and intracellular termini (Halestrap2013The; Halestrap2004The). MCT7 is primarily involved in the transport of ketone bodies, such as β-hydroxybutyrate, across cell membranes, playing a significant role in energy homeostasis, particularly under conditions of fasting or low carbohydrate intake (Felmlee2020Monocarboxylate). The expression of SLC16A6 is regulated by metabolic states, such as fasting, and is observed in various tissues, including the liver and pancreas, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological processes (Hugo2012A). Additionally, SLC16A6 has been implicated in clinical contexts, including cancer and metabolic disorders, although its precise physiological roles and substrates require further elucidation (Böhme2020Membrane; Meredith2008The).

## Structure
SLC16A6, also known as Monocarboxylate transporter 7 (MCT7), is a member of the solute carrier family 16, which typically features 12 transmembrane helices with intracellular N- and C-termini and a large intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 6 and 7 (Halestrap2013The; Halestrap2004The). This structural topology is characteristic of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) to which SLC16A6 belongs (Halestrap2013The).

The primary structure of SLC16A6 includes a phospho-degron motif, DSGVELT, located in a cytosolic loop, which is crucial for its regulation and degradation by the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex (Frommelt2024The). Mutations at serine 240 and threonine 245 within this motif affect the protein's stability, with phosphorylation at these sites targeting SLC16A6 for degradation (Frommelt2024The).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in the function and stability of SLC16A6. The S240D mutation, which mimics phosphorylation, results in increased stability, indicating the importance of this modification (Frommelt2024The). The protein's interactions and stability are also influenced by its association with chaperone proteins and the SCF complex, highlighting its complex regulatory mechanisms (Frommelt2024The).

## Function
The SLC16A6 gene encodes a monocarboxylate transporter, known as MCT7, which is involved in the transport of ketone bodies, such as β-hydroxybutyrate, across cell membranes. This transporter plays a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis, particularly during fasting or low-carbohydrate conditions, by facilitating the export of ketone bodies from the liver to peripheral tissues where they serve as an alternative energy source (Felmlee2020Monocarboxylate; Hugo2012A). In healthy human cells, SLC16A6 is implicated in the regulation of intracellular ketone body levels, protecting cells from excessive triglyceride synthesis and maintaining metabolic balance (Felmlee2020Monocarboxylate).

The expression of SLC16A6 is regulated by fasting and caloric restriction, suggesting its involvement in adaptive metabolic responses (Felmlee2020Monocarboxylate). The gene is expressed in multiple tissues, including the liver, pancreas, and testis, indicating its role in diverse physiological processes (Hugo2012A). Variants in the SLC16A6 gene have been associated with human height, suggesting a potential role in growth regulation, although these associations require further validation (Karanth2019The). Overall, SLC16A6 is essential for ketone body transport and energy metabolism in humans.

## Clinical Significance
The SLC16A6 gene, encoding the monocarboxylate transporter 7 (MCT7), has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to cancer and metabolic conditions. In melanoma, alterations in SLC16A6 expression have been observed, with reduced expression noted in certain melanoma cell lines. This reduction may impact lactate-fueled ATP production, affecting tumor cell survival in low glucose environments and potentially influencing melanoma progression and response to treatment (Böhme2020Membrane). 

Genetic variants in SLC16A6 have also been associated with cutaneous melanoma-specific survival. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs71387392 in SLC16A6 has been identified as a significant predictor of melanoma survival, with the A allele linked to increased mRNA expression levels in primary cutaneous melanoma tissue (Dai2020Genetic). 

In the context of metabolic acidosis, SLC16A6 expression is upregulated in the kidneys, suggesting a role in the renal response to acid-base disturbances (Nowik2008Genomewide). Despite these associations, the precise physiological roles and substrates of MCT7 remain not well characterized, and specific diseases directly linked to SLC16A6 mutations are not extensively documented (Meredith2008The).

## Interactions
SLC16A6, also known as Monocarboxylate transporter 7 (MCT7), is involved in interactions with components of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex. It specifically interacts with the CUL1 subunit and F-box adaptor proteins BTRC and FBXW11, which are unique to SLC16A6. These interactions are crucial for the proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent degradation process of SLC16A6. The presence of a phospho-degron motif, DSGVELT, located at positions 239-245, is essential for targeting SLC16A6 for degradation. Phosphorylation at serine 240 within this motif allows binding to the SCF β-TrCP complex, facilitating its recognition and degradation. Mutations such as S240A and T245N result in increased stability of SLC16A6, highlighting the importance of these residues in its degradation process. Depletion of BTRC and FBXW11 stabilizes SLC16A6, further supporting their role in its degradation. These interactions were confirmed through affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) analysis, which showed reduced binding of BTRC, CUL1, and FBXW11 to serine mutants of SLC16A6 (Frommelt2024The).
