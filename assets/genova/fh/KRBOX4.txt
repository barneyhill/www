# KRBOX4

## Overview
KRBOX4 is a human gene that encodes the protein KRAB box domain containing 4, which is characterized by the presence of a KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) domain. This protein is primarily involved in transcriptional repression, functioning as a transcriptional regulator. The KRAB domain is a well-known transcriptional repression motif that facilitates the interaction of KRBOX4 with KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1), a scaffold protein that recruits chromatin remodeling complexes. These complexes, which include histone deacetylases, play a critical role in modifying chromatin structure and thereby regulating gene expression. Through these interactions, KRBOX4 contributes to the modulation of transcriptional activity, influencing the expression patterns of various target genes and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
KRBOX4, a human gene encoding a protein with a KRAB domain, is primarily involved in transcriptional repression. Proteins containing KRAB domains, such as KRBOX4, typically interact with KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1). This interaction is crucial as KAP1 acts as a scaffold protein, recruiting other proteins to form complexes that modify chromatin structure. These complexes can include histone deacetylases and other chromatin remodeling proteins, which work together to influence gene expression by altering the accessibility of DNA to transcriptional machinery. The interaction between KRBOX4 and KAP1 is a key component of its role in gene regulation, as it facilitates the formation of these repressive complexes, thereby modulating the transcriptional activity of target genes. This interaction underscores the importance of KRBOX4 in maintaining proper gene expression patterns through chromatin modification.
