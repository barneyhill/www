# RNF212

## Overview
RNF212 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 212, a crucial component in the regulation of meiotic recombination in mammals. The protein is characterized as a SUMO E3 ligase, which plays a pivotal role in the stabilization of recombination factors at crossover sites during meiosis. This stabilization is essential for the accurate segregation of chromosomes, thereby ensuring genetic diversity and fertility (Reynolds2013RNF212; Qiao2014Antagonistic). The RNF212 protein contains a RING motif, a coiled-coil domain, and a serine-rich C-terminal region, which are indicative of its involvement in protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications (Reynolds2013RNF212). Mutations in the RNF212 gene have been linked to male infertility, particularly azoospermia, due to their impact on crossover formation and meiotic progression (RieraEscamilla2019Sequencing). The gene's expression and function underscore its critical role in reproductive biology and its potential as a target for genetic screening in infertility cases (RieraEscamilla2019Sequencing).

## Structure
The RNF212 protein is a 307-amino-acid protein characterized by a tripartite domain structure, which includes an N-terminal RING motif, a coiled-coil domain, and a serine-rich C-terminal region (Reynolds2013RNF212). The RING motif is a type of zinc finger domain commonly found in proteins involved in ubiquitination, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications (Reynolds2013RNF212). RNF212 is homologous to meiotic procrossover factors such as Zip3 in yeast and ZHP-3 in C. elegans, indicating a conserved function in crossover designation during meiosis (Reynolds2013RNF212).

RNF212 functions as a SUMO E3 ligase, stabilizing recombination factors like the MutSγ complex at recombination sites, which is crucial for crossover formation (Reynolds2013RNF212; Qiao2014Antagonistic). The protein's localization to synaptonemal complexes and its dynamic association with recombination sites suggest a role in the structural organization of these complexes during meiosis (Reynolds2013RNF212). The precise molecular interactions and localization mechanisms of RNF212 remain to be fully elucidated, but its involvement in SUMOylation and stabilization of recombination intermediates is well-supported (Reynolds2013RNF212).

## Function
RNF212 is a dosage-sensitive regulator of crossing-over during mammalian meiosis, playing a crucial role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. It facilitates the formation of crossover-specific recombination complexes by stabilizing meiosis-specific recombination factors such as the MutSγ complex (MSH4-MSH5) at recombination sites (Reynolds2013RNF212). RNF212 localizes to synaptonemal complexes during meiosis, forming foci that are retained at sites where crossovers will form, thus designating a crossover fate to certain recombination sites (Qiao2014Antagonistic). This stabilization is essential for the crossover designation process, a key step in meiotic recombination (Reynolds2013RNF212).

RNF212's function involves the SUMOylation of MutSγ, enhancing its binding to recombination sites and promoting the stable accumulation of RNF212 and MutSγ at specific sites. This process may involve a positive feedback loop that designates crossover sites (Reynolds2013RNF212). The protein is active in the nucleus, particularly during prophase I of meiosis, and is essential for fertility and genetic diversity. Its absence or dysfunction can lead to meiotic arrest and infertility, as seen in cases of azoospermia where RNF212 mutations result in failed crossover formation and spermatogenic failure (RieraEscamilla2019Sequencing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RNF212 gene have been implicated in male infertility, particularly in cases of azoospermia, which is characterized by a lack of sperm in semen. A study identified a frameshift variant in the RNF212 gene in two azoospermic brothers from a consanguineous family, which resulted in a premature stop codon and was associated with meiotic arrest (RieraEscamilla2019Sequencing). This mutation is located within the zinc-finger domain of the gene and leads to reduced crossover formation during meiosis, causing univalents and meiotic arrest (RieraEscamilla2019Sequencing). The RNF212 gene is crucial for stabilizing recombination complexes during meiosis, and its absence or mutation can lead to defects in crossover formation, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation (Reynolds2013RNF212).

Alterations in RNF212 expression levels can also impact fertility. The gene is highly expressed in early spermatogenic germ cells, and its disruption can lead to meiotic arrest and infertility (RieraEscamilla2019Sequencing). The clinical significance of RNF212 mutations underscores the importance of genetic screening in diagnosing and understanding the genetic basis of male infertility (RieraEscamilla2019Sequencing).

## Interactions
RNF212 interacts with several proteins during mammalian meiosis, playing a crucial role in crossover formation. It stabilizes the MutSγ complex, which includes MSH4 and MSH5, by enhancing their association with recombination sites through SUMOylation. This stabilization is essential for the differentiation between crossover and non-crossover pathways (Reynolds2013RNF212). RNF212 also interacts with TEX11, another ZMM factor, and its absence leads to reduced localization of both MSH4 and TEX11, indicating its role in stabilizing these proteins at recombination sites (Reynolds2013RNF212).

RNF212 does not form an obligate heterocomplex with RNF212B, but they have an interdependent relationship. This is evidenced by diminished immunostaining in mutants lacking either protein, suggesting that they stabilize each other (Ito2023Distinct). RNF212B shows stronger self-interaction compared to its interaction with RNF212, as detected by yeast two-hybrid assays (Ito2023Distinct). RNF212's interactions are crucial for the proper assembly of crossover-specific complexes, such as MutLγ, and for successful crossing-over during meiosis (Reynolds2013RNF212).
