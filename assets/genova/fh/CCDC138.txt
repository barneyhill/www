# CCDC138

## Overview
CCDC138 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 138, which is implicated in centrosomal and ciliary biology. The protein is part of a complex that is enriched in centrosomal proteins, with several components associated with ciliopathies, a group of disorders caused by defects in cilia structure or function. CCDC138 is one of the few proteins within this complex that remains largely uncharacterized. It localizes specifically to basal bodies, suggesting a role in the structural organization and function of cilia, which are crucial for cellular motility and signaling (Drew2016A). The CilioGenics method has identified CCDC138 as a top candidate for ciliary proteins, highlighting its potential involvement in ciliary functions, although its precise role in human cells is not yet fully understood (Pir2023CilioGenics:).

## Structure


## Function
CCDC138 is a protein that plays a role in centrosomal and ciliary biology. It is part of a large, 18-subunit complex enriched in centrosomal proteins, with several subunits linked to ciliopathies. CCDC138 has been identified as one of the three completely uncharacterized proteins within this complex. Experimental studies have shown that CCDC138 localizes strongly and specifically to basal bodies, which are components of the centrosome involved in organizing ciliary microtubule axonemes. This localization suggests that CCDC138 is involved in the structural organization and function of cilia, which are essential for cellular motility and signaling (Drew2016A).

The CilioGenics method, which integrates various approaches to predict novel ciliary genes, has identified CCDC138 as a top candidate ciliary protein. This method combines protein-protein interaction analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing, and comparative genomics, among other techniques, to improve the identification of ciliary genes. The localization of CCDC138 to cilia supports its potential role in ciliary functions, although specific details about its function in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Pir2023CilioGenics:).
