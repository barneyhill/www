# MYO18A

## Overview
MYO18A is a gene that encodes the unconventional myosin protein, myosin XVIIIA (myosin-18A), which is a member of the myosin superfamily. Unlike conventional myosins, myosin-18A is characterized by its atypical motor domain, which exhibits minimal ATPase activity, and its ability to interact with actin structures without the need for ATP hydrolysis (Billington2015Myosin; Ouyang2021Multifaceted). The protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the assembly of actomyosin bundles, stress fiber formation, and cell migration. Myosin-18A is involved in the regulation of actin filament dynamics and interacts with several protein complexes, such as the PAK2/βPIX/GIT1 complex, influencing cellular motility and structural integrity (Ouyang2021Multifaceted; Hsu2010Identification). Additionally, MYO18A has clinical significance, with mutations linked to certain cancers and myeloproliferative disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lin2020Intratumor; Walz2005The).

## Structure
The MYO18A gene encodes the myosin 18A protein, which is part of the unconventional myosin superfamily. Myosin 18A has several splice variants, including M18Aa, M18Ab, Myo18Aα, Myo18Aβ, and Myo18Aγ, each with distinct structural features (Horsthemke2019A; Billington2015Myosin; Ouyang2021Multifaceted). The protein contains a central motor domain, which is atypical due to mutations that result in minimal ATPase activity, classifying it as an unconventional myosin (Ouyang2021Multifaceted). 

The motor domain includes deviations in the nucleotide-binding pocket, such as an asparagine replacing the typical glutamic acid in switch-2, which may affect ATPase activity (GuzikLendrum2013Mammalian). Myosin 18A also features a coiled-coil domain that facilitates dimerization, although it does not form large bipolar filaments like other myosins (Billington2015Myosin). 

The N-terminal region of Myo18Aα includes a PDZ domain and a KE-rich sequence, which are absent in Myo18Aβ, affecting their cellular localization (Horsthemke2024Are). Myo18Aγ, identified in cardiac tissue, has unique N- and C-terminal regions, including a polyproline region and a serine-rich C-terminus (Horsthemke2019A). These structural variations contribute to the diverse functional roles of myosin 18A in cellular processes.

## Function
MYO18A encodes myosin-18A, an unconventional myosin involved in various cellular functions. Myosin-18A interacts with actin structures, playing a significant role in the assembly of actomyosin bundles and stress fibers. It binds to actin through its N-terminal domain without ATPase activity and can self-associate via its coiled-coil domain (Ouyang2021Multifaceted). Myosin-18A coassembles with nonmuscle myosin 2 (NM2) to form mixed bipolar filaments, potentially regulating NM2's assembly properties and mechanical output (Billington2015Myosin).

In cellular motility, myosin-18A interacts with the PAK2/βPIX/GIT1 complex, influencing the localization of these proteins and affecting actin filament dynamics and membrane ruffles. This interaction is crucial for cell migration, as depletion of MYO18A leads to increased actin stress fiber density and larger focal adhesion areas, reducing cell migration ability (Hsu2010Identification).

Myosin-18A also plays a role in Golgi function by interacting with GOLPH3, a Golgi membrane phosphoprotein, which is important for Golgi membrane curvature and trafficking (Ouyang2021Multifaceted). Despite its weak actin-binding affinity, myosin-18A can hinder actin translocation, suggesting a regulatory role in actin-myosin interactions (GuzikLendrum2013Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MYO18A gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC) and myeloproliferative neoplasms. In stage III CRC, MYO18A mutations are significant in the founding clone and are associated with better disease-free survival (DFS). Patients with these mutations can be further stratified based on additional mutations in genes like FBXW7 and ATM, affecting clinical outcomes. MYO18A mutations are found in 50% of patients with recurrence and 84.6% without recurrence, indicating a protective effect on DFS (Lin2020Intratumor).

MYO18A is also involved in cell migration, with its knockdown leading to reduced migration activity in CRC cells, suggesting its role as a potential tumor driver (Lin2020Intratumor). In hematological malignancies, MYO18A forms fusion genes with tyrosine kinases such as FGFR1 and PDGFRB. The MYO18A-FGFR1 fusion is associated with 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome, characterized by atypical myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (Walz2005The). Similarly, MYO18A-PDGFRB fusions are found in myeloproliferative neoplasms, contributing to disease pathogenesis through constitutive activation of the PDGFRB kinase domain, and these patients often respond well to imatinib treatment (Sheng2017Multiple).

## Interactions
MYO18A, a member of the myosin superfamily, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with F-actin through two distinct sites: one in the KE-rich region for ATP-independent binding and another in the motor domain regulated by nucleotide binding (Taft2013Functional). MYO18A also interacts with the Golgi-associated phosphoprotein GOLPH3, which modulates its actin-binding properties and suggests a role in linking the Golgi apparatus to the actin cytoskeleton (Taft2013Functional).

MYO18A forms a multiprotein complex with p190RhoGEF, Golgin45, and Lurap1, which is essential for maintaining myofiber integrity and muscle development in zebrafish (Cao2016Identification). It also coassembles with nonmuscle myosin 2 (NM2) to form mixed bipolar filaments, indicating a regulatory role in filament assembly (Billington2015Myosin).

In epithelial cells, MYO18A interacts with the PAK2/βPIX/GIT1 complex, influencing cell migration by modulating actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (Hsu2010Identification). The interaction with βPIX is particularly important for epithelial cell migration, as the carboxyl-terminal domain of MYO18A is required for this interaction (Hsu2014Binding). These interactions highlight MYO18A's role in cellular structure and motility.
