# NRIP1

## Overview
The NRIP1 gene encodes the nuclear receptor interacting protein 1, also known as RIP140, which is a transcriptional coregulator involved in the modulation of nuclear receptor activity and transcription factors. This protein primarily functions as a transcriptional repressor, playing a critical role in regulating energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism. NRIP1 interacts with a variety of nuclear receptors, including estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), and retinoid X receptor (RXR), influencing processes such as glucose uptake and mitochondrial biogenesis (Wang2018Deletion; Izzo2014NRIP1RIP140). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, which are essential for its function and subcellular localization (Lapierre2015Expression). NRIP1 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including adipocyte differentiation, brain function, and cancer progression, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Shi2021METTL3Mediated; Park2009RIP140).

## Function
NRIP1, also known as RIP140, is a transcriptional coregulator that plays a significant role in modulating the activity of various nuclear receptors and transcription factors in healthy human cells. It primarily functions as a transcriptional repressor, utilizing four inhibitory domains to recruit histone deacetylases and C-terminal binding proteins, thereby influencing gene expression (Lapierre2015Expression). NRIP1 is involved in regulating energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism. It interacts with nuclear receptors such as estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), retinoid X receptor (RXR), and liver X receptor (LXR), impacting processes like glucose uptake and mitochondrial biogenesis (Wang2018Deletion; Izzo2014NRIP1RIP140).

In the context of adipocyte differentiation, NRIP1 is crucial for the repression of specific genes, such as Crabp1, by forming repressive complexes on chromatin (Park2009RIP140). It also plays a role in maintaining normal brain function and cognitive abilities, being expressed in the cortical and hippocampus areas of the brain (Shi2021METTL3Mediated). NRIP1's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications like sumoylation and acetylation, which are essential for its subcellular localization and repressive function (Lapierre2015Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NRIP1 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), NRIP1 is significantly overexpressed, and this overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, including poorer overall survival and increased tumor burden. The expression of NRIP1 in STAD is influenced by factors such as H. pylori infection and TP53 co-mutation, and it is involved in pathways like WNT, E2F, and ER, which are crucial in cancer progression (Fang2020Expression). 

In colorectal cancers with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), NRIP1 is considered a candidate tumor suppressor gene. Frameshift mutations in NRIP1 are found in a significant portion of MSI-H colorectal cancers, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis through inactivation (Choi2017Intratumoral).

NRIP1 mutations have also been linked to congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract (CAKUT). A truncating variant in NRIP1 was identified in a family with CAKUT, indicating that loss-of-function mutations in NRIP1 may be a novel monogenic cause of this condition (Zheng2021A).

In breast cancer, NRIP1 expression levels are inversely correlated with E2F1 target genes. Low NRIP1 expression is associated with basal-like tumors, which have a poor prognosis, while high expression is linked to luminal-like tumors (Docquier2010The).

## Interactions
NRIP1, also known as RIP140, is a transcriptional coregulator that interacts with various nuclear receptors and transcription factors. It acts primarily as a corepressor, modulating gene expression by forming complexes with proteins such as estrogen receptors (ERs), retinoic acid receptors, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (Augereau2006Transcriptional). NRIP1 interacts with ERα, where it can inhibit target gene transcription by competing with coactivators and recruiting histone deacetylases (Augereau2006Transcriptional). 

In the context of mitochondrial function, NRIP1 interacts with PGC-1a, a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function. NRIP1 overexpression leads to the downregulation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes (NEMGs) by repressing PGC-1a activity, which is crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory efficiency (Izzo2014NRIP1RIP140). This interaction is significant in conditions such as Down syndrome, where NRIP1 is upregulated, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction (Izzo2014NRIP1RIP140).

NRIP1 also interacts with other nuclear receptors, including thyroid hormone receptors and retinoic acid receptors, often inhibiting their activity by recruiting regulatory factors such as histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferases (Izzo2014NRIP1RIP140; Augereau2006Transcriptional). These interactions highlight NRIP1's role in regulating diverse biological processes through its corepressor functions.
