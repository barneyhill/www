# EPAS1

## Overview
EPAS1, also known as endothelial PAS domain protein 1 or HIF-2α, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix/PAS domain family. This transcription factor is pivotal in the cellular response to hypoxia, or low oxygen conditions, by regulating the expression of genes involved in critical physiological processes such as erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and metabolism (Tian1997Endothelial; Kristan2021Integration). The protein product of EPAS1 forms a heterodimer with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), enabling it to bind to hypoxia response elements in DNA and activate target gene transcription (Tian1997Endothelial). EPAS1 is expressed in various tissues, with notable activity in endothelial cells and highly vascularized organs like the heart, placenta, and lung (Tian1997Endothelial; Kristan2021Integration). Its function and stability are modulated by post-translational modifications, which are influenced by oxygen levels (Kristan2021Integration). The gene's mutations and dysregulation are implicated in several pathologies, including various cancers and erythrocytosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Rosato2023One; Kristan2021Integration).

## Structure
EPAS1, also known as HIF-2α, is a transcription factor characterized by its basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and PAS domains, which are crucial for DNA binding and dimerization. The bHLH domain facilitates DNA binding, while the PAS domains, specifically PAS-A and PAS-B, are involved in dimerization partner selection and ligand/cofactor binding (Kewley2004The; KolonkoAdamska2021The). The PAS domains are structured with an antiparallel β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, forming a dimerization interface that limits partner selection to other PAS-containing proteins (Kewley2004The).

EPAS1 forms heterodimers with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), which is essential for its function as a transcription factor (Tian1997Endothelial). This interaction is crucial for binding to hypoxia response elements in DNA, allowing EPAS1 to regulate gene expression under hypoxic conditions (Tian1997Endothelial).

Post-translational modifications, such as hydroxylation and ubiquitination, play significant roles in regulating EPAS1's stability and activity. These modifications occur in the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of the protein, which are rich in molecular recognition features (MoRFs) (KolonkoAdamska2021The). Missense mutations in the bHLH and PAS domains have been linked to various cancers and familial erythrocytosis (KolonkoAdamska2021The).

## Function
EPAS1, also known as endothelial PAS domain protein 1, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the cellular response to hypoxia, or low oxygen levels. It is part of the basic helix-loop-helix/PAS domain family and functions primarily in the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of genes involved in various biological processes, including erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and metabolism (Tian1997Endothelial; Kristan2021Integration).

In healthy human cells, EPAS1 forms a heterodimer with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) to bind hypoxia response elements (HREs) in the DNA, activating the transcription of target genes (Tian1997Endothelial). This activity is essential for the regulation of genes that increase oxygen delivery, such as erythropoietin (EPO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which are critical for red blood cell production and angiogenesis, respectively (Kristan2021Integration).

EPAS1 is expressed in various tissues, with enhanced expression in highly vascularized organs like the heart, placenta, and lung, and is particularly active in endothelial cells (Tian1997Endothelial; Kristan2021Integration). Its activity is tightly regulated by oxygen levels, with post-translational modifications influencing its stability and function (Kristan2021Integration).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the EPAS1 gene are implicated in several diseases and conditions. EPAS1 is associated with various cancers, including renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, neuroblastoma, glioma, colorectal carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma. It serves as a prognostic marker in renal cancer, with numerous somatic variants identified in tumors (Kristan2021Integration). In non-small cell lung cancer, the SNP rs13419896 in EPAS1 is linked to enhanced expression and poor prognosis, affecting transcription factor binding and gene expression (Putra2015The).

EPAS1 mutations are also linked to pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, with specific germline variants like p.Arg247Ser, p.Phe374Tyr, and p.Pro785Thr showing oncogenic features (Dwight2021Functional). These mutations can lead to a pseudo-hypoxic microenvironment that promotes tumor growth (Islam2020Identification). EPAS1 is involved in Pacak-Zhuang Syndrome, characterized by paraganglioma, somatostatinoma, and polycythemia, due to gain-of-function mutations that disrupt normal protein interactions (Wang2019A).

In erythrocytosis, EPAS1 mutations lead to increased erythrocyte mass and elevated hemoglobin levels, particularly in Familial erythrocytosis type 4 (ECYT4) (Kristan2021Integration). These mutations often occur in exon 12, affecting the gene's normal regulatory functions (Rosato2023One).

## Interactions
EPAS1, also known as HIF-2α, is involved in several physical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a heterodimer with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), which is essential for its function as a transcription factor. This complex binds to hypoxia response elements (HREs) in DNA, regulating the expression of genes involved in the cellular response to hypoxia (Tian1997Endothelial). EPAS1 also interacts with ARNT2 and ARNTL, which serve as binding partners to form a complete transcription factor complex (Kristan2021Integration).

The stability of EPAS1 is regulated through interactions with prolyl hydroxylases EGLN1, EGLN2, EGLN3, and the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), which are involved in its degradation under normoxic conditions (Kristan2021Integration). EPAS1 is also known to interact with Elongin B (ELOB) and Elongin C (ELOC), which are part of the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex (Kristan2021Integration).

In the context of cancer, EPAS1 interacts with the pregnane X receptor (PXR), enhancing its activity and influencing the expression of PXR target genes, which may affect drug metabolism and resistance (Zhao2016Crosstalk). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of EPAS1 in cellular processes and its potential impact on disease states.
