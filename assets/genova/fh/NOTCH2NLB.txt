# NOTCH2NLB

## Overview
NOTCH2NLB is a human-specific gene that encodes the protein notch 2 N-terminal like B, which is involved in the modulation of the Notch signaling pathway, a critical regulator of cell differentiation and proliferation. The gene is part of the NOTCH2NL family, which emerged from a partial duplication of the NOTCH2 gene, resulting in a secreted protein that lacks the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains typical of membrane-bound receptors (Fiddes2018Human-Specific; Fiddes2017Humanspecific). The NOTCH2NLB protein is characterized by its unique structure, including a signal peptide and a distinct fifth exon, which contribute to its functional role in enhancing Notch receptor activation and promoting progenitor cell cycle reentry (Fiddes2018Human-Specific; Suzuki2017Homininspecific). This gene is particularly significant in the context of human brain development, where it influences the proliferation and self-renewal of neural progenitor cells, thereby playing a crucial role in cortical expansion (Fiddes2017Humanspecific). Variations in the NOTCH2NLB gene are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal neuronal function (Lodewijk2020Evolution).

## Structure
The NOTCH2NLB gene encodes a protein that is part of the human-specific NOTCH2NL gene family, which has arisen from a partial duplication of the NOTCH2 gene. This duplication includes the upstream region, promoter, and the first six N-terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains from NOTCH2 exons 1 through 4, but excludes the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, resulting in a secreted protein rather than a membrane-bound one (Fiddes2018Human-Specific; Fiddes2017Humanspecific). The NOTCH2NLB protein includes a signal peptide and a unique fifth exon derived from NOTCH2 intronic sequence, providing it with 20 unique amino acids (Fiddes2018Human-Specific).

A notable feature of the NOTCH2NLB protein is a Thr→Ile substitution in the fifth EGF repeat, which is a conserved fucosylation site in NOTCH2. This substitution is referred to as 'long NOTCH2NL with Thr→Ile substitution' (NOTCH2NL L,T197I) (Fiddes2018Human-Specific; Fiddes2017Humanspecific). The EGF repeats are critical for the protein's function, particularly in promoting progenitor cell cycle reentry and activating the Notch signaling pathway (Suzuki2017Homininspecific). The protein's structure allows it to interact with NOTCH receptors, enhancing their activation and modulating NOTCH signaling (Fiddes2018Human-Specific).

## Function
NOTCH2NLB is a human-specific gene that plays a significant role in brain development by modulating the Notch signaling pathway. This gene is primarily active in the germinal zones of the developing human cortex, particularly in outer radial glia (oRG) cells, which are crucial for cortical expansion. NOTCH2NLB enhances Notch signaling, supporting the self-renewal and proliferation of neural progenitor cells. This is achieved by promoting Notch signaling in a cell-autonomous manner and potentially in a non-autonomous manner as well (Fiddes2017Humanspecific).

In the embryonic mouse neocortex, overexpression of NOTCH2NLB increases the number of Pax6-positive cells in the ventricular zone, suggesting it helps maintain cells in a progenitor state. It enhances Notch receptor activation, particularly upregulating Hes1, a downstream effector of the Notch pathway. The EGF repeats of NOTCH2NLB facilitate interaction with the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (DLL1), which is important for progenitor proliferation versus differentiation (Heide2021HumanSpecific).

The stable copy number of NOTCH2NLB in the human population indicates the importance of its dosage in maintaining normal function. Variations in the 1q21.1 locus, where NOTCH2NLB is located, are associated with neurological disorders, highlighting its role in normal neuronal development (Lodewijk2020Evolution).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the NOTCH2NLB gene are associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders. Variations in the gene, such as deletions and duplications, are linked to the 1q21.1 deletion/duplication syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by distinct neurodevelopmental outcomes depending on the type of genetic alteration. Deletions in the NOTCH2NLB region are associated with microcephaly and schizophrenia, while duplications are linked to macrocephaly, autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, and intellectual disabilities (Fiddes2017Humanspecific).

The NOTCH2NLB gene plays a role in cortical neurogenesis, where duplications can increase the gene's dosage, delaying the differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells and promoting their proliferation. Conversely, deletions decrease the gene's dosage, leading to premature differentiation of these cells (Fiddes2017Humanspecific). These genetic variations are thought to result from non-allelic homologous recombination events between NOTCH2NLA and NOTCH2NLB, leading to changes in their copy number and contributing to the neurodevelopmental phenotypes observed in the 1q21.1 distal deletion/duplication syndrome (Fiddes2017Humanspecific). The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its clinical significance in human brain development and associated disorders.

## Interactions
NOTCH2NLB is known to interact with components of the Notch signaling pathway, particularly influencing cortical neurogenesis. It physically interacts with the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (DLL1), reducing its availability at the plasma membrane. This interaction inhibits DLL1's role in promoting neuronal differentiation, thereby enhancing progenitor self-renewal (Suzuki2017Homininspecific; Heide2021HumanSpecific). 

NOTCH2NLB also interacts with NOTCH2 and enhances the activation of NOTCH2, NOTCH1, and NOTCH3 receptors. This interaction is facilitated by the EGF repeats of NOTCH2NLB, which are critical for its function (Heide2021HumanSpecific). The protein can enhance Notch signaling through both cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous mechanisms, as demonstrated by increased Notch reporter activity and upregulation of Hes1, a downstream effector of the Notch pathway (Suzuki2017Homininspecific).

These interactions suggest that NOTCH2NLB plays a significant role in regulating the balance between progenitor proliferation and differentiation, contributing to the expansion of cortical progenitors during human brain development (Suzuki2017Homininspecific).
