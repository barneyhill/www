# PKNOX2

## Overview
PKNOX2 is a gene that encodes the PBX/knotted 1 homeobox 2 protein, a member of the TALE-superfamily of homeodomain proteins. This protein is characterized by its unique homeodomain structure, which includes a conserved insertion of three amino acids, distinguishing it from other homeodomain proteins. PBX/knotted 1 homeobox 2 plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with PBX proteins, thereby influencing DNA binding and gene expression. It is involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and response to growth factors, and is implicated in tissue-specific transcription regulation. The gene's expression and function are associated with several clinical conditions, such as cancer, fibrosis, and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Song2023PKNOX2; Imoto2001Identification; Cagnan2018PKNOX2).

## Structure
The PKNOX2 protein is a member of the TALE-superfamily of homeodomain proteins, characterized by a unique homeodomain structure. This homeodomain includes a conserved insertion of three amino acids between helices 1 and 2, which is atypical for homeodomain proteins (Imoto2001Identification). The PKNOX2 homeodomain shares significant sequence identity with human MEIS-related proteins (71%), TGIF-related proteins (51%), and PBX1 (38%) (Imoto2001Identification). 

PKNOX2 is composed of 460 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 50.8 kDa (Imoto2001Identification). The protein contains two regions, HR1 and HR2, which are homologous to similar regions in PKNOX1 and MEIS proteins. These regions are essential for interactions with PBX proteins, which are crucial for DNA binding and transcription regulation (Imoto2001Identification). 

The genomic organization of PKNOX2 is similar to PKNOX1, although it is located on a different chromosomal region, 11q24 (Imoto2001Identification). The nuclear localization of PKNOX2 was confirmed through transfection of epitope-tagged cDNA, indicating its role in transcription regulation (Imoto2001Identification). The study suggests that PKNOX2 may play a role in tissue-specific transcription regulation, similar to PKNOX1 (Imoto2001Identification).

## Function
PKNOX2 is a TALE homeodomain protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily active in the nucleus of cells. It shares significant sequence similarity with PKNOX1, particularly in the homeodomain region, which is 94% identical, suggesting similar DNA-binding properties and potential interactions with PBX proteins (Imoto2001Identification). PKNOX2 is thought to recognize the TGACAG DNA motif, a sequence also bound by PKNOX1, MEIS, and TGIF proteins, indicating its role in modulating gene transcription (Imoto2001Identification).

PKNOX2 is involved in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and death, similar to other TALE homeodomain proteins (Imoto2001Identification). It may act as a co-activator or repressor in transcription, depending on the context, and is suggested to contribute to tissue-specific transcription regulation due to its restricted mRNA expression pattern compared to PKNOX1 (Imoto2001Identification).

In bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, PKNOX2 expression is influenced by TGF-β signaling, with TGF-β1 stimulation increasing its expression, suggesting a role in cellular responses to growth factors (Cagnan2018PKNOX2). PKNOX2 may also be involved in DNA repair processes and maintaining genomic stability, although its exact functions in healthy human cells require further elucidation (Cagnan2018PKNOX2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PKNOX2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In lung cancer, PKNOX2 is significantly downregulated, which is associated with tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stage. This downregulation is linked to the methylation of its promoter region, and PKNOX2 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, thereby reducing cell proliferation and migration (Song2023PKNOX2).

In Fanconi anemia, PKNOX2 expression is significantly lower in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells from patients compared to healthy donors. Despite this, protein levels remain unchanged, suggesting post-transcriptional modifications may play a role. The gene's interaction with TGF-β signaling is also noted, as TGF-β1 stimulation increases PKNOX2 expression in both FA patients and healthy donors (Cagnan2018PKNOX2).

PKNOX2 has also been associated with psychiatric disorders. Genome-wide association studies have linked specific SNPs within PKNOX2 to formal thought disorder in schizophrenia, suggesting a genetic overlap with bipolar disorder (Wang2012PKNOX2). Additionally, PKNOX2 is identified as a candidate gene for substance dependence, particularly in European-origin women, highlighting its potential role in addiction (Chen2011The).

## Interactions
PKNOX2, a member of the TALE-superfamily of homeodomain proteins, is known to interact with PBX proteins, forming complexes that enhance DNA binding affinity. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of coordinated gene transcription, suggesting that PKNOX2 may modulate PBX-HOX functions (Imoto2001Identification). PKNOX2 also interacts with the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) TCONS_00323213 in porcine satellite cells. This interaction relieves the inhibitory effect of PKNOX2 on the MyoG promoter, promoting myogenic differentiation by upregulating MyoG expression (Li2023LncRNA).

In the context of myocardial fibrosis, PKNOX2 has been shown to bind directly to promoters of fibrosis-related genes such as POSTN and COL1A1, indicating a transcriptional regulatory role. It also interacts with MBD3, a component of the NuRD complex, suggesting a role in repressing fibrogenic gene expression through chromatin remodeling (Chen2024PBXKnotted). In kidney fibrosis, PKNOX2 expression is induced by TGF-b1 in renal fibroblasts, implicating its involvement in TGF-b1 signaling pathways (Miyake2021PKNOX2). These interactions highlight PKNOX2's multifaceted role in gene regulation across different biological contexts.
