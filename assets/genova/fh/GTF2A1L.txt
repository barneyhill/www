# GTF2A1L

## Overview
The GTF2A1L gene encodes the protein known as general transcription factor IIA subunit 1-like, which plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional initiation process in human cells. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor and is involved in the formation and stabilization of the transcription pre-initiation complex, a critical step in the regulation of gene expression. GTF2A1L interacts with other transcriptional components, such as GTF2A2 and the TATA-binding protein (TBP), to facilitate the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The gene is expressed in specific cell types, including late pachytene spermatocytes and haploid round spermatids, indicating its importance in germ cell transcription regulation. Alterations in the GTF2A1L gene have been linked to various diseases, including primary open angle glaucoma and potentially non-obstructive azoospermia, highlighting its clinical significance (Kumar2015Identification; Zhang2014Association; Gao2023GTF2A1L).

## Function
The GTF2A1L gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the transcriptional initiation process in human cells. It is involved in transcriptional coactivation activity, interacting with other key components such as GTF2A2 and the TATA binding protein (TBP). These interactions are crucial for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, as they facilitate the assembly of pre-initiation complexes and regulate the rate of transcription complex formation and initiation (Gao2023GTF2A1L).

GTF2A1L is enriched in pathways related to basal transcription factors and has the ability to bind to DNA, GTF2A2, and TBP. This binding is essential for promoter recognition and the stabilization of the transcription pre-initiation complex, which is a critical step in the regulation of gene expression (Gao2023GTF2A1L). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression, impacting various cellular processes and organismal development. In particular, the GTF2A1L gene is expressed in specific cell types, such as late pachytene spermatocytes and haploid round spermatids, indicating its role in the regulation of transcription in germ cells (Kumar2015Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GTF2A1L gene have been implicated in several diseases. A study on a four-generation family from the Chinese Han population identified a frameshift variant in the GTF2A1L gene associated with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). This variant follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and is believed to affect the structure and function of the encoded protein, potentially disrupting transcription initiation and promoter recognition (Gao2023GTF2A1L).

In the context of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), the GTF2A1L gene was investigated for its role in spermatogenesis. Although no significant association was found between GTF2A1L variants and NOA, the study noted that reduced expression of the GTF2A1L protein in infertile patients with spermatogenetic disturbances suggests a potential link to the condition (Zhang2014Association).

Additionally, genetic variations in the STON1-GTF2A1L/LHCGR/FSHR region have been associated with the bilaterality of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in East Asian populations. The SNP rs4482537 in this region showed a significant association with AMD bilaterality, suggesting that polymorphisms in GTF2A1L might influence the development of this condition through effects on photoreceptor cell synaptic transmission (KawashimaKumagai2017A).

## Interactions
The GTF2A1L gene encodes a protein that is involved in transcription regulation through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. GTF2A1L interacts with GTF2A2 and the TATA-binding protein (TBP), both of which are crucial components in the transcription initiation process. GTF2A2 encodes a subunit of transcription factor IIA (TFIIA), which plays a role in the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. TBP is involved in promoter recognition and binding, facilitating the assembly of pre-initiation complexes and regulating transcription initiation. The frameshift variants of GTF2A1L may alter the structure and function of its encoded protein, potentially reducing or eliminating its transcriptional coactivation activity, which could disrupt its binding to GTF2A2 and TBP, affecting promoter recognition, transcription initiation, and assembly (Gao2023GTF2A1L).

GTF2A1L is also noted for its significant protein-protein interactions, particularly with STON1, as evidenced by a high interaction score of 0.992. This suggests a strong interaction between the STON1 and GTF2A1L proteins, which may be relevant in the context of breast cancer biology (Ponomarenko2024SexHormoneBinding). However, specific details on the interactions of GTF2A1L with nucleic acids are not provided in the available context.
