# TP53TG3C

## Overview
TP53TG3C is a gene located on chromosome 16p11.2, which encodes the protein TP53 target 3C. This protein is part of a family of genes that are transcriptionally regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, although the specific functional role of TP53 target 3C remains to be fully elucidated. The gene is of particular interest due to its involvement in various genomic regions associated with congenital conditions and diseases. Alterations in the expression or copy number variations of TP53TG3C have been linked to congenital diaphragmatic hernia and congenital heart disease, suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis of these conditions (Dasouki2020New; Zhu2018Systematic). Additionally, while TP53TG3C is frequently deleted in breast cancer, this deletion is also observed in the normal population, indicating that its absence may not be directly implicated in cancer progression (Callen2021Revisiting).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The TP53TG3C gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression or copy number variations (CNVs). In congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), a 2.4-Mb gain at 16p11.2, which includes TP53TG3C, was found to be significantly enriched in patients compared to controls, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of CDH (Zhu2018Systematic). This region also contains other genes, such as TP53TG3E, TP53TG3B, and TP53TG3F, which may collectively contribute to the condition.

In congenital heart disease (CHD), CNVs at 16p11.2, encompassing TP53TG3C, have been associated with specific cardiac anomalies, including transposition of the great arteries (Dasouki2020New). Although the specific clinical significance of TP53TG3C in these conditions is not fully detailed, its involvement in these genomic regions suggests a potential impact on disease development.

In breast cancer, TP53TG3C is located near the centromere of chromosome 16p and is frequently deleted. However, this deletion is considered a common copy variant in the normal population rather than a breast cancer-specific event, indicating that its absence may not be directly linked to cancer progression (Callen2021Revisiting).
