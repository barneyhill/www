# CRACDL

## Overview
The CRACDL gene encodes the CRACD protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, including calcium signaling and immune response regulation. CRACD is categorized as a cytosolic protein that plays a crucial role in the activation of calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels, which are essential for calcium influx in non-excitable cells. This protein is implicated in the modulation of intracellular calcium levels, thereby influencing numerous physiological functions such as gene expression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Mutations or dysregulation of the CRACDL gene have been associated with several pathological conditions, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
