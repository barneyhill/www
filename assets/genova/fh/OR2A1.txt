# OR2A1

## Overview
OR2A1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily A member 1, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are primarily known for their role in the detection of odor molecules, contributing to the sense of smell. However, OR2A1 is also expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, such as the lung, adipose tissue, and skin, suggesting potential roles beyond olfaction (Kerslake2020Co‑expression). Despite its widespread expression, the specific functions of OR2A1 in these tissues remain largely unexplored. The gene has been implicated in clinical contexts, including its association with Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) and its down-regulation in certain cancers, indicating possible broader physiological and pathological roles (Kerslake2020Co‑expression; MosconaNissan2024Whole).

## Function
OR2A1 is an olfactory receptor that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, primarily involved in detecting odor molecules. In healthy human cells, OR2A1 is expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, including the lung, adipose tissue, arteries, breast, cervix, and skin, among others (Kerslake2020Co‑expression). Despite its broad expression, the specific functional roles of OR2A1 in these tissues remain largely unexplored. 

In airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells, OR2A1 is one of several olfactory receptors identified, although it does not reach the plasma membrane even with the aid of chaperone proteins, suggesting a limited role in direct cellular signaling in these cells (Aisenberg2016Defining). The presence of OR2A1 in non-olfactory tissues suggests potential roles in chemosensory networks beyond traditional olfactory functions, but these roles are not yet fully understood (Abaffy2015Human; Aisenberg2016Defining).

The expression of OR2A1 in various tissues and its potential involvement in fundamental cellular processes indicate that it may have broader physiological implications, although specific molecular activities and organismal outcomes in healthy human cells have not been detailed in the available literature (Abaffy2015Human).

## Clinical Significance
The OR2A1 gene has been implicated in several clinical contexts due to its expression and mutation patterns. In the study of genetic variants associated with Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), OR2A1 exhibited variants exclusively in MODY cases, suggesting a potential link between OR2A1 mutations and this form of diabetes (MosconaNissan2024Whole). Additionally, OR2A1 is expressed in a wide range of tissues and has been found to be down-regulated in certain cancers, such as ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma and thyroid carcinoma, according to TCGA datasets (Kerslake2020Co‑expression). This down-regulation could imply a role in the progression or suppression of these cancers.

The gene is also expressed in human airway smooth muscle cells, although at low levels, and is among the most highly enriched OR transcripts in lung cell types (Aisenberg2016Defining). Despite its expression in various tissues, changes in the methylation status of OR2A1 did not significantly correlate with changes in gene expression, indicating that other regulatory mechanisms might be involved (Kerslake2020Co‑expression). These findings suggest that OR2A1 may have broader implications in metabolic disorders and cancer beyond its traditional role in olfaction.
