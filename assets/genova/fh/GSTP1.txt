# GSTP1

## Overview
The GSTP1 gene encodes the enzyme glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1-1), a member of the glutathione S-transferase family, which is primarily involved in detoxification processes. This enzyme catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione to a variety of electrophilic compounds, including carcinogens and products of oxidative stress, thereby facilitating their excretion from the body (Zhang2002Expression). GSTP1-1 is categorized as a cytosolic enzyme and is highly expressed in tissues such as the liver and skin, where it plays a critical role in cellular defense mechanisms (Zhang2002Expression). Beyond its detoxification function, GSTP1 is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis through interactions with signaling pathways, such as the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway (Holley2007Differential). The gene's polymorphisms and expression levels have been associated with susceptibility to various diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Cui2020GSTP1; Grussy2023The).

## Structure
The GSTP1 protein is a member of the glutathione S-transferase family, which plays a crucial role in detoxification processes. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of GSTP1 is characterized by a distinct fold typical of GSTs, which forms a catalytic site essential for its enzymatic activity. This structure includes a thioredoxin-like N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain, which are important for its function and interaction with substrates (Federici2009Structural).

GSTP1 can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure, which is common among GSTs and is important for their biological activity (Federici2009Structural). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which can influence its activity and stability. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of GSTP1 may exist, potentially altering its functional properties and contributing to its role in various cellular processes (Federici2009Structural). These structural features enable GSTP1 to effectively participate in detoxification and other cellular functions.

## Function
The GSTP1 gene encodes the enzyme glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1-1), which is a member of the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) family. This enzyme plays a crucial role in detoxifying harmful compounds by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione with electrophilic substrates, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, and products of oxidative stress, thereby making them more water-soluble and easier to excrete (Zhang2002Expression). GSTP1-1 is particularly active in the cytoplasm of cells and is abundantly expressed in epidermal cells, such as keratinocytes, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting cells from damage by reactive oxygen species (Zhang2002Expression).

Beyond its detoxification role, GSTP1 is involved in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. It interacts with the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, inhibiting JNK activity under non-stressed conditions, which is associated with cell cycle control and responses to oxidative stress (Holley2007Differential). GSTP1 can dissociate from JNK during oxidative stress, leading to JNK activation and subsequent signaling for stress response, proliferation, and apoptosis (Holley2007Differential). This regulatory function highlights GSTP1's role in cellular defense mechanisms and its potential impact on cancer susceptibility and progression.

## Clinical Significance
The GSTP1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases, particularly cancers. Alterations in GSTP1 expression, such as overexpression, are linked to reduced chemosensitivity in cancers like esophageal and breast cancer, and resistance to drugs such as cisplatin and adriamycin (Cui2020GSTP1). In prostate cancer, GSTP1 is often downregulated due to hypermethylation, which is a hallmark of early prostatic carcinogenesis and is associated with increased susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced DNA damage (Cui2020GSTP1; McIlwain2006Glutathione).

Polymorphisms in GSTP1, such as Ile105Val and rs1695, are associated with increased risks of various cancers, including lung, colorectal, and prostate cancer (Cui2020GSTP1; Santric2020GSTP1). The GSTP1*Val variant is linked to heart failure, and the GSTP1 A/G polymorphism is associated with breast cancer risk in Asian women (Grussy2023The). GSTP1 polymorphisms also play a role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular diseases, influencing oxidative stress and disease susceptibility (Association; p&gt; Du2019&lt; Grussy2023The). These genetic variations can affect the enzyme's detoxification capabilities, impacting disease progression and treatment outcomes.

## Interactions
GSTP1 (glutathione S-transferase pi 1) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), where it acts as an inhibitor, maintaining low basal JNK activity in non-stressed cells. This interaction is crucial for controlled cell growth and is modulated by GSTP1's monomeric state, which is sensitive to redox changes (Adler1999Regulation). 

GSTP1 also interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), influencing cell death pathways and tumorigenesis. It can suppress TNF-α and TRAF2-ASK1-triggered apoptosis, highlighting its role in modulating oxidative stress responses (De2014The; Bartolini2016The).

Additionally, GSTP1 forms a complex with 1-Cys peroxiredoxin (Prdx6), facilitating its peroxidase activity through a GSH-dependent reduction mechanism (Bartolini2016The). It also interacts with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to the S-glutathionylation and activation of AMPK, which is important under oxidative conditions (Klaus2013Glutathione).

GSTP1's interactions extend to transcription factors such as Nrf2 and STAT3, where it influences cell cycle regulation and anti-apoptotic gene control (Bartolini2016The). These interactions underscore GSTP1's role in cellular stress responses and its potential as a therapeutic target.
