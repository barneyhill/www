# AK1

## Overview
The AK1 gene encodes adenylate kinase 1, a cytosolic enzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular energy homeostasis by catalyzing the reversible transfer of phosphate groups between adenine nucleotides. This enzyme is essential for maintaining the balance of ATP, ADP, and AMP within cells, which is vital for energy transfer and signal transduction processes (Dzeja2009Adenylate; Panayiotou2014The). Adenylate kinase 1 is predominantly expressed in tissues with high energy demands, such as skeletal muscle, brain, and erythrocytes, and is involved in various physiological processes, including excitation-contraction coupling and hormone secretion (Ionescu2019Adenylate). The enzyme's activity is modulated by factors such as exercise and metabolic stress, and it plays a role in cardioprotection during ischemic conditions (Dzeja2009Adenylate). Mutations in the AK1 gene are linked to clinical conditions like hemolytic anemia and may also impact male fertility and neurodegenerative disorders (Fujisawa2023Regulation; Matsuura1989Human).

## Structure
Adenylate kinase 1 (AK1) is a key enzyme involved in cellular energy homeostasis, characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of AK1 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form its functional domains. The secondary structure includes nine α-helices and a five-stranded β-sheet, which are organized into three distinct domains: the NMP, LID, and CORE domains. The NMP domain comprises α3 and α4, the LID domain includes α7 and α8, and the CORE domain is formed by the β-sheet surrounded by other helices (Guo2022ADPInduced).

The tertiary structure of AK1 is a compact, globular shape that facilitates its catalytic function. The enzyme undergoes significant conformational changes during its catalytic cycle, transitioning from an open to a closed state upon substrate binding, which is crucial for its function (Guo2022ADPInduced). The quaternary structure of AK1 may involve dimerization or higher-order oligomerization, although specific details are not provided in the context.

AK1 also has several isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, which may affect its function and regulation (Janssen2004Two). These structural features and dynamics are essential for AK1's role in catalyzing phosphor-transfer reactions.

## Function
Adenylate kinase 1 (AK1) is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a pivotal role in cellular energy homeostasis by catalyzing the reversible transfer of phosphate groups between adenine nucleotides, specifically converting two molecules of ADP into ATP and AMP. This reaction is crucial for maintaining the balance of adenine nucleotides within cells, which is essential for various cellular processes, including energy transfer and signal transduction (Dzeja2009Adenylate; Panayiotou2014The).

AK1 is predominantly active in the cytosol and is highly expressed in tissues with high energy demands, such as skeletal muscle, brain, and erythrocytes (Ionescu2019Adenylate; Panayiotou2014The). It facilitates the local supply of ATP, which is critical for processes like excitation-contraction coupling, hormone secretion, and cell motility (Dzeja2009Adenylate). AK1 also plays a role in metabolic signaling by generating AMP, which acts as a metabolic signal for energy sensing and regulation, influencing pathways such as the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K-ATP) (Dzeja2009Adenylate).

In the heart, AK1 is involved in cardioprotection during ischemia and stress by promoting AMP and adenosine signaling, and it works alongside creatine kinase to mediate energetic remodeling (Dzeja2009Adenylate). AK1's activity is influenced by factors such as exercise, hypoxia, and metabolic stress, and it remains active as long as ADP is available (Dzeja2009Adenylate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AK1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily hemolytic anemia. This rare genetic disorder is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells, leading to symptoms such as jaundice, anemia, and splenomegaly. Various mutations, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and deletion mutations, have been identified in patients with AK1 deficiency, which results in reduced or undetectable enzyme activity in erythrocytes (Qualtieri1997Severe; Bianchi1999A; Matsuura1989Human). 

Specific mutations, such as the homozygous A → G substitution at codon 164 and the C to T transition in exon 6, have been linked to chronic hemolytic anemia (Matsuura1989Human; Qualtieri1997Severe). In some cases, AK1 deficiency is also associated with mental and psychomotor impairments (Bianchi1999A; He2022Red). 

AK1 expression levels are also implicated in male infertility, with decreased levels observed in patients with non-obstructive azoospermia, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis and sperm motility (Fujisawa2023Regulation). Additionally, AK1 dysregulation may contribute to neurodegeneration and other metabolic disorders (Fujisawa2023Regulation).

## Interactions
Adenylate kinase 1 (AK1) is known to interact with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular energy homeostasis and signal transduction. In human β-cells, AK1 interacts with the Kir6.2 subunit of the K-ATP channel, a crucial component in regulating insulin secretion. This interaction is important for modulating the ATP/ADP ratio in the microenvironment of the K-ATP channel, influencing channel activity and insulin release (Stanojevic2008Cytosolic).

AK1 also participates in the regulation of K-ATP channel activity by generating ADP in the presence of ATP, which enhances channel currents. This regulatory mechanism is influenced by glucose levels, where high glucose concentrations lead to decreased AK1 expression, affecting the channel's response and insulin secretion (Stanojevic2008Cytosolic).

In cardiac tissues, AK1 is involved in maintaining myocardial energetic homeostasis, particularly under ischemic conditions. The absence of AK1 in knockout models results in reduced tolerance to ischemic stress, highlighting its role in phosphotransfer and energy metabolism. Despite the deletion of AK1, other adenylate kinase isoforms can partially compensate, maintaining some level of energy homeostasis (Pucar2002Adenylate).
