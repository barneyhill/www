# JTB

## Overview
The JTB gene encodes the Jumping Translocation Breakpoint protein, a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis regulation, and mitochondrial function. This protein is ubiquitously expressed across multiple human tissues, with particularly high levels in the thyroid and skeletal muscle (Hatakeyama1999JTB:). Structurally, JTB is characterized by a conserved cysteine-rich region and a transmembrane domain, suggesting its involvement in membrane-related processes and potential interactions with other proteins or the extracellular matrix (Rousseau2012The). Functionally, JTB is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, influencing mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential, which are crucial for energy metabolism and biosynthesis (Jayathirtha2022Investigating). The protein's dysregulation is linked to various cancers, where it contributes to tumorigenic processes such as cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Jayathirtha2023TwoDimensional; Jayathirtha2022Investigating).

## Structure
The JTB protein, encoded by the human JTB gene, exhibits a well-defined molecular structure. Its secondary structure includes one α-helix and a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, organized in a βαββ order. This arrangement gives the protein a hand-like shape, with the α-helix acting as a 'thumb' alongside the β-sheet 'palm'. The β-strands are composed of residues 54-59 (β1), 80-85 (β2), and 89-95 (β3), with a β-bulge at residue Val56. The α-helix (α1) spans residues 66-70 (Rousseau2012The).

The tertiary structure of JTB is stabilized by three disulfide bonds: Cys48-Cys85, Cys60-Cys96, and Cys63-Cys74. These bonds contribute to the protein's stability and may facilitate interactions with other proteins or the extracellular matrix. The structure shows a distant resemblance to the N-terminal CRD of midkine, suggesting a potential convergent binding function (Rousseau2012The).

The JTB protein is characterized by a conserved cysteine-rich region in its extracellular domain, which is indicative of potential interactions with other proteins or the extracellular matrix. The intracellular domain is short and lacks obvious signaling motifs, suggesting a role as an accessory or decoy receptor (Rousseau2012The).

## Function
The JTB (jumping translocation breakpoint) gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues and cell lines, with higher expression levels in the thyroid and skeletal muscle (Hatakeyama1999JTB:). The protein is involved in several cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis regulation, and mitochondrial function (Jayathirtha2022Investigating). JTB is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it influences mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential, impacting energy metabolism and biosynthesis (Jayathirtha2022Investigating).

In healthy cells, JTB plays a role in maintaining cellular functions such as cell cycle progression, chromosome segregation, spindle formation, and cytokinesis (Jayathirtha2023TwoDimensional). It is also involved in regulating apoptosis and maintaining mitochondrial function, with its expression conferring resistance to apoptosis induced by TGF-β1 (Pan2009Interacting). The protein's structure includes a signal sequence, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain, suggesting its involvement in membrane-related processes (Hatakeyama1999JTB:).

Despite its widespread expression and conservation across species, the precise molecular function of JTB in healthy cells remains unclear, though its evolutionary conservation suggests a fundamental biological role (Rousseau2012The).

## Clinical Significance
The JTB (jumping translocation breakpoint) gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and chromosomal translocations. In breast cancer, particularly in the MCF7 cell line, JTB overexpression is associated with pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), mitochondrial organization, and oxidative stress, contributing to tumorigenic processes like cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Jayathirtha2023TwoDimensional; Jayathirtha2022Investigating). JTB's dysregulation is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and resistance to apoptosis, which are critical in cancer progression (Jayathirtha2022Investigating).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), JTB is significantly overexpressed, with a 1.9-fold increase in tumor cells compared to non-malignant tissues. This overexpression is associated with genomic amplifications in the 1q21-q22 region, contributing to drug resistance and tumor metastasis (Wong2003Positional; Chen2010Chromosome). JTB also interacts with hepatitis B surface antigens, affecting apoptosis resistance, which may play a role in HCC progression, especially in the context of hepatitis B infection (Pan2009Interacting).

Overall, JTB's altered expression and interactions are linked to aggressive cancer phenotypes and resistance to apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology.

## Interactions
The Jumping Translocation Breakpoint (JTB) protein is involved in several physical interactions with other proteins, which may influence its role in cellular processes. JTB has been shown to interact with the Hepatitis B surface antigens (HBs), specifically the large (L-HBs) and small (S-HBs) forms, in mammalian cells. This interaction was demonstrated through co-transfection experiments in 293FT cells, which resulted in increased luciferase activity, indicating a physical association. The interaction was further confirmed using immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and GST pull-down assays, suggesting that the S region of HBs is a binding site for JTB (Pan2009Interacting).

JTB is also associated with various proteins involved in cancer progression. In breast cancer cells, JTB interacts with proteins such as heat shock proteins (HSPs), ribosomal proteins, and translation factors, which are upregulated in conditions where JTB is overexpressed. These interactions suggest a role for JTB in protein folding, ribosome biogenesis, and translation, contributing to cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Jayathirtha2022Investigating). Additionally, JTB dysregulation is linked to changes in the expression of proteins involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mitochondrial organization, further implicating its role in cancer dynamics (Jayathirtha2022Investigating).
