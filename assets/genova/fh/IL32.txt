# IL32

## Overview
Interleukin 32 (IL32) is a gene that encodes the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 32, which plays a crucial role in immune response and inflammation. The IL32 protein is categorized as a cytokine and is involved in the regulation of various inflammatory pathways. It is expressed in multiple isoforms, including IL32α, IL32β, and IL32γ, each differing in their structural and functional properties. The protein is primarily intracellular but can also be membrane-bound, influencing processes such as cell differentiation and cytokine production. IL32 is known to interact with integrins and other proteins involved in cell signaling, contributing to its role in immune modulation. Its expression is typically low in healthy tissues but increases significantly in response to inflammatory stimuli and in various pathological conditions, including autoimmune diseases and cancers (Joosten2013Novel; Dinarello2006IL32; Han2023Pancancer).

## Structure
The IL32 protein is characterized by a structure that includes coils and α-helixes, but notably lacks β sheets (Heinhuis2012Interleukin). The protein contains a typical α-helix bundle structure, resembling the focal adhesion targeting (FAT) region of focal adhesion kinase-1 (FAK-1) (Heinhuis2012Interleukin). IL32α and IL32β both have a four α-helix bundle structure, with IL32β containing an additional α-helix (Heinhuis2012Interleukin). The tertiary structure modeling shows that IL32α and IL32β have confidence scores indicating a reasonable prediction of their folds, while IL32γ has a less reliable score due to the presence of a transmembrane domain (Heinhuis2012Interleukin).

IL32 is expressed in several isoforms, including IL32α, IL32β, IL32γ, IL32δ, IL32ε, and IL32ζ, with IL32γ being the most potent in terms of cell death and activation (Joosten2013Novel). The isoforms vary in size, with IL32α being 14.9 kDa and IL32γ being 26.7 kDa (Joosten2013Novel). The protein contains two interesting amino acid motifs, DDM and RGD, which are involved in integrin signaling and activation of procaspase-3 (Heinhuis2012Interleukin). The RGD motif in IL32α is differently oriented and less accessible compared to IL32β or IL32γ (Heinhuis2012Interleukin). IL32 does not contain any conserved domains in its amino acid sequence, complicating modeling efforts (Heinhuis2012Interleukin).

## Function
Interleukin 32 (IL32) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in various molecular processes and plays a significant role in cell biology. In healthy human cells, IL32 is expressed at low levels, particularly in epithelial cells, and is involved in maintaining a state of low-level inflammatory readiness. This readiness becomes more pronounced in pathological conditions, where IL32 expression increases significantly (Dinarello2006IL32).

IL32 is involved in the induction of other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-8, IL-1β, and IL-6, through pathways like nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (NoldPetry2009IL32–dependent; Kim2005Interleukin32). It is also involved in the activation of Erk1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways, particularly in osteoclast precursors, and can synergize with NOD1/NOD2 ligands to drive cytokine production via a caspase-1-dependent mechanism (Joosten2013Novel).

IL32 is predominantly expressed intracellularly but can also be membrane-bound. It influences cell differentiation, such as driving monocytes to differentiate into macrophage-like cells, and is involved in the differentiation of monocytes into osteoclasts (Joosten2013Novel). IL32's interaction with integrins, specifically αVβ3 and αVβ6, suggests its role in cell signaling, adhesion, survival, and cytokine production (Joosten2013Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Interleukin 32 (IL32) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and type 1 diabetes (T1D), IL32 expression is elevated, contributing to inflammation and disease progression. In RA, IL32 is highly expressed in synovial tissues and fibroblast-like synoviocytes, correlating with increased levels of TNF-α and IL-6, which are markers of inflammation (de2021The; Heinhuis2011Inflammation-dependent). In T1D, elevated IL32 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells may serve as an early biomarker for disease progression (de2021The).

IL32 is also associated with various cancers, where its expression is often higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This elevated expression is linked to poor prognosis and overall survival, as well as increased tumor immune cell infiltration and tumorigenesis (Han2023Pancancer). In hepatocellular carcinoma, IL32 is involved in hepatic fibrosis and tumor progression, while in lung cancer, it is associated with tumor progression and metastasis (Han2019Interleukin32:).

In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), IL32 is identified as a potential biomarker, with increased expression correlating with disease severity and liver damage (Baselli2020Liver). Additionally, reduced DNA methylation at the IL32 gene is linked to juvenile idiopathic arthritis, suggesting an epigenetic component in its role in inflammatory diseases (Meyer2015DNA).

## Interactions
Interleukin 32 (IL32) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. IL32 can bind to integrins, specifically αVβ3 and αVβ6, which are involved in cell adhesion and signaling processes. The interaction with αVβ3 integrins is inhibited by small RGD peptides, indicating a specific binding mechanism (Joosten2013Novel; Heinhuis2012Interleukin). IL32 also interacts with focal adhesion proteins such as paxillin and focal adhesion kinase-1 (FAK-1), suggesting its involvement in the integrin-FAK signaling pathway (Joosten2013Novel; Heinhuis2012Interleukin).

IL32 is known to interact with proteinase 3 (PR3), a serine protease that can cleave IL32 into more active forms, enhancing its biological activity. This interaction suggests a dual role for PR3 in both binding and processing IL32, which may increase its pro-inflammatory effects (Novick2006Proteinase). Additionally, IL32 can synergize with nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) ligands, such as NOD1 and NOD2, to enhance cytokine production through a caspase-1-dependent mechanism (Netea2005IL32). These interactions highlight IL32's role in modulating immune responses and inflammatory pathways.
