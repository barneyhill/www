# OR52E6

## Overview
The OR52E6 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily E member 6, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many receptors involved in signal transduction. The protein encoded by OR52E6 is specifically involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding to specific ligands and initiating a neuronal response that results in the perception of smell. This gene is part of a large family of olfactory receptor genes, which are the largest gene family in the human genome, highlighting the complexity and diversity of the olfactory system (Qiu2020aarFDC).
