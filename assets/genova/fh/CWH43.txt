# CWH43

## Overview
The CWH43 gene encodes the protein cell wall biogenesis 43 C-terminal homolog, which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and the proper functioning of multiciliated cells. This protein is involved in the regulation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, which are essential for maintaining cellular architecture and signaling. The CWH43 protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its role in cellular processes that involve membrane interactions. Mutations in the CWH43 gene have been linked to idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), a neurological disorder characterized by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to various symptoms. Research has shown that these mutations can disrupt the localization and function of GPI-anchored proteins, thereby affecting the normal operation of ependymal and choroid plexus cells (Yoko‐o2018Lipid; Liu2024Congenital; Yoko‐o2013Determination; Sakamoto2021Ependymal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CWH43 gene have been associated with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), a condition characterized by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain's ventricles, leading to symptoms such as gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive dysfunction. Approximately 15% of patients with iNPH carry heterozygous loss-of-function deletions in the CWH43 gene. These mutations are believed to affect the number of ependymal cilia and the apical/basal targeting of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins in ventricular multi-ciliated epithelial cells, contributing to the development of iNPH (Liu2024Congenital; Sakamoto2021Ependymal).

In animal models, mice with Cwh43 deletions develop communicating hydrocephalus, gait dysfunction, and abnormalities in choroid plexus and ependymal cells. The loss of Cwh43 expression leads to decreased association of GPI-anchored proteins with intracellular vesicles, disrupting the normal function of multiciliated choroid plexus and ependymal cells. This mislocalization of GPI-anchored proteins is hypothesized to disrupt normal cell function, contributing to hydrocephalus (Sakamoto2021Ependymal).

The CWH43 gene is also involved in lipid metabolism, and its dysregulation may contribute to metabolic disorders, although specific diseases related to these functions in humans are not detailed in the provided context (Yoko‐o2018Lipid; Yoko‐o2013Determination).
