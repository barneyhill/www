# PACRG

## Overview
The PACRG gene encodes the parkin coregulated protein, which is integral to various cellular processes, including microtubule stabilization and immune signaling. The protein is characterized by a helical repeat fold, similar to HEAT repeat proteins, and forms a stable heterodimer with MEIG1, crucial for axoneme formation and tubulin binding (Khan2021Crystal; Khan2019Crystal). PACRG is involved in the stabilization of microtubule structures, essential for the function of cilia and flagella, and plays a significant role in immune signaling by stabilizing the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (Meschede2020The). Additionally, PACRG is implicated in neuroprotection and may influence susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases and infectious conditions (Khan2021Crystal; Liu2021Functional). Mutations in PACRG have been associated with ciliopathies and are linked to conditions such as Parkinson's disease and certain leukemias, highlighting its clinical significance (Wilson2010Deletion; Taylor2007Parkin; Agirre2005Abnormal).

## Structure
The PACRG protein is characterized by a helical repeat fold similar to HEAT repeat proteins, consisting of a core of seven alpha helices that form parallel repeats (Khan2021Crystal). The structure includes an N-terminal helix and a 3_10 helix, with continuous electron density observed from amino acids 70 to 255, except for a disordered loop between amino acids 203-219 (Khan2021Crystal). The PACRG protein adopts an alpha-helical structure with a loop insertion that mediates a conserved network of interactions with the MEIG1 protein (Khan2019Crystal).

The tertiary structure of PACRG is stabilized by its interaction with MEIG1, forming a stable heterodimer complex. This interaction involves a unique loop termed the MB-loop, located between helices a1 and a2, and residues in the a3 helix, forming 12 hydrogen bonds and 6 salt bridges (Khan2021Crystal; Khan2019Crystal). The quaternary structure of PACRG in complex with MEIG1 is crucial for its role in axoneme formation and tubulin binding, as it stabilizes atypical lattice structures at the inner junction of doublet microtubules (Khan2019Crystal).

PACRG is expressed in various tissues, suggesting potential functions independent of MEIG1, although specific post-translational modifications or splice variants are not detailed in the provided context (Khan2021Crystal).

## Function
The PACRG gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, particularly in the stabilization of microtubule structures and immune signaling. In healthy human cells, PACRG is involved in axoneme formation, a key component of cilia and flagella, by binding to α- and β-tubulin and recruiting them to microtubules. This function is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of these cellular appendages, which are important for cell movement and signaling (Khan2021Crystal).

PACRG also plays a significant role in immune signaling by stabilizing the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which is crucial for TNF-induced NF-κB signaling. This stabilization promotes the formation of linear ubiquitin chains, facilitating the activation of the IKK complex and subsequent NF-κB signaling, which is vital for immune responses and inflammation (Meschede2020The).

In addition to its role in microtubule dynamics and immune signaling, PACRG is implicated in neuroprotection and may influence susceptibility to infectious diseases and neurodegenerative conditions due to its interactions with Parkin and involvement in cellular homeostasis (Khan2021Crystal; Liu2021Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PACRG gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. PACRG is crucial for the function of motile cilia and flagella, and mutations can lead to phenotypes similar to ciliopathies, affecting fertility and causing neurodevelopmental and respiratory defects (Khan2021Crystal). In the quaking viable mouse model, the absence of PACRG expression results in male sterility and hydrocephalus due to impaired ciliary motility, highlighting its essential role in ciliary function (Wilson2010Deletion).

PACRG is also associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). It is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasomal system and is present in Lewy bodies, which are pathological features of PD. Although no pathogenic mutations were found in PACRG in early-onset PD patients, its presence in neuropathological lesions suggests a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Taylor2007Parkin).

Additionally, epigenetic changes, such as hypermethylation of the PACRG promoter, have been linked to downregulation of gene expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of these hematological cancers (Agirre2005Abnormal).

## Interactions
PACRG (parkin coregulated gene) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It forms a stable heterodimer with MEIG1, which is essential for axoneme formation and tubulin binding. This interaction involves a small buried surface area with 12 hydrogen bonds and six salt bridges, highlighting the importance of specific residues in both proteins for binding (Khan2021Crystal). PACRG also interacts with tubulin, stabilizing the axoneme outer doublet, and is involved in recruiting a/b-tubulin to microtubules, a process that is dose-dependent and influenced by specific mutations in PACRG (Khan2021Crystal).

PACRG has been shown to interact with DNALI1, which stabilizes PACRG in both mammalian cells and bacterial systems. This interaction enhances the stability of PACRG protein without affecting its mRNA levels, indicating a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism (Yap2023DNALI1). Additionally, PACRG is known to interact with proteins involved in the ubiquitination pathway, such as MID1, PSMD4, TRIM11, USP39, and USP35, suggesting a role in ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic processes (Liu2021Functional). These interactions highlight PACRG's involvement in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation and microtubule dynamics.
