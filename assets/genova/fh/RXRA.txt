# RXRA

## Overview
The RXRA gene encodes the retinoid X receptor alpha, a nuclear receptor protein that plays a critical role in regulating gene expression. As a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, RXRA functions primarily as a transcription factor, forming heterodimers with other nuclear receptors such as PPAR, LXR, and RAR. These interactions enable RXRA to bind to specific DNA sequences, thereby modulating the transcription of genes involved in diverse biological processes, including lipid metabolism, immune response, and cellular homeostasis (Li2021The; Sharma2022Retinoid). The protein is characterized by its ligand-binding and DNA-binding domains, which facilitate its regulatory functions (Eberhardt2019A). RXRA is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and brain, and is implicated in several clinical conditions, such as bladder cancer and cardiomyopathy, due to its role in cellular proliferation and metabolic regulation (Halstead2017Bladdercancerassociated; Subbarayan2000RXRα).

## Structure
The retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA) is a nuclear receptor protein characterized by its complex molecular structure. The primary structure of RXRA consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains crucial for its function, including the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and the DNA-binding domain (DBD) (Eberhardt2019A). The secondary structure of RXRA includes 12 α-helices organized as an antiparallel helical sandwich, with a small β-sheet between helices H5 and H6 (Eberhardt2019A). 

The tertiary structure of RXRA involves the arrangement of these helices to form the LBD, which is essential for ligand binding and interaction with co-regulatory proteins (Eberhardt2019A). The LBD undergoes conformational changes upon ligand binding, particularly in helices H3, H11, and H12, which are critical for activating transcriptional activity (Nahoum2007Modulators). 

RXRA can form homodimers or heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, representing its quaternary structure (Eberhardt2019A). This dimerization is crucial for its role in gene regulation. RXRA also undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and sumoylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Eberhardt2019A). Additionally, RXRA has several splice variant isoforms that may affect its functional properties (Eberhardt2019A).

## Function
RXRA (retinoid X receptor alpha) is a nuclear receptor that plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression by forming heterodimers with other nuclear receptors such as PPAR, LXR, FXR, PXR, and CAR. This heterodimerization allows RXRA to bind to specific DNA sequences, facilitating transcriptional regulation (Sharma2022Retinoid). RXRA is predominantly expressed in the liver, kidney, and brain tissues and can be found in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria (Sharma2022Retinoid).

In the liver, RXRA is crucial for maintaining lipid and bile acid homeostasis. It regulates genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism, such as those affecting triglyceride and cholesterol levels (Li2021The). RXRA also influences the expression of apolipoproteins, which are essential for lipid transport and metabolism (Li2021The). In addition, RXRA is involved in the regulation of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), impacting gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism, and ketogenesis (Li2021The).

RXRA's role extends to the immune system, where it modulates cytokine and chemokine expression, influencing inflammatory responses (Sharma2022Retinoid). It also plays a role in stress responses and neuroinflammation, where it can reduce oxidative stress and inhibit pro-inflammatory gene expression (Sharma2022Retinoid). These functions highlight RXRA's importance in maintaining cellular and metabolic homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RXRA gene have been implicated in several diseases. In bladder cancer, mutations at the S427 position of RXRA lead to hyperactive peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling, which drives urothelial proliferation and contributes to cancer progression in 20-25% of cases (Halstead2017Bladdercancerassociated). These mutations result in ligand-independent activation of PPARs, particularly PPARD and PPARG, promoting cancer cell growth (Halstead2017Bladdercancerassociated). Targeting PPARs with inhibitors has shown potential in reversing the growth of mutant RXRA-driven urothelium, suggesting a therapeutic strategy for bladder cancer patients with these mutations (Halstead2017Bladdercancerassociated).

In cardiology, RXRA overexpression in cardiomyocytes has been linked to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), characterized by structural abnormalities and increased mortality in transgenic mice (Subbarayan2000RXRα). This overexpression does not rescue myocardial hypoplasia in RXRA-null fetuses, indicating a complex role in cardiac development (Subbarayan2000RXRα).

RXRA is also associated with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC) in breast cancer patients treated with doxorubicin. Variants at the RXRA locus have been linked to a decline in cardiac function, highlighting RXRA as a susceptibility gene for AIC (Ma2020Retinoid).

## Interactions
RXRA (retinoid X receptor alpha) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a transcription factor. It forms heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) and retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARα), which are essential for regulating gene expression in response to ligands like retinoic acid (Seol1995Isolation). RXRA also interacts with novel orphan receptors, RIP14 and RIP15, which form heterodimers with RXRA and bind to specific DNA sequences, although their transactivation activity may depend on unidentified ligands or other activation processes (Seol1995Isolation).

RXRA interacts with the Epstein-Barr virus BZLF1 transactivator (Z), where the interaction is necessary for the repression of RXRA-mediated transactivation of cellular promoters. This interaction involves specific domains within the Z protein and RXRA, highlighting the complexity of RXRA's role in modulating viral and cellular regulatory pathways (Deshmane1995Physical).

RXRA also interacts with NRIP1, modulating transcriptional activity by repressing it. This interaction is considered a candidate for drug-targetable protein-protein interactions, with potential implications for diseases such as obesity and cancer (Sugaya2007An).
