# PPIAL4H

## Overview
The PPIAL4H gene encodes the protein peptidylprolyl isomerase A like 4H, which is a member of the cyclophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases. These enzymes play a crucial role in protein folding by catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides. The PPIAL4H protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, protein trafficking, and immune response modulation. Its function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper physiological function. Dysregulation of peptidylprolyl isomerases, including PPIAL4H, has been implicated in several diseases, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets (Qiu2020aarFDC).
