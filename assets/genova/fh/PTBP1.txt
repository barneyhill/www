# PTBP1

## Overview
PTBP1, or polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism. The protein, categorized as an RNA-binding protein, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of alternative splicing by binding to polypyrimidine-rich sequences in pre-mRNA, thereby influencing splice site selection and exon inclusion or exclusion (Romanelli2013New; Sawicka2008Polypyrimidinetractbinding). Beyond splicing, PTBP1 is involved in mRNA stability, translation, and localization, impacting processes such as neuronal differentiation, immune cell function, and heart development (Zhu2020Roles; Fochi2020The). The protein's interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids are crucial for its regulatory functions, and its dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Ye2024Pancancer; Takahashi2015Significance).

## Structure
PTBP1, or polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1, is characterized by its four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are arranged in a 'beads on a string' orientation. These RRMs are connected by linker regions of varying lengths, with the linkers after RRM1 and RRM2 being long, allowing for independent movement, while the linker between RRM3 and RRM4 is short, resulting in a stable intramolecular didomain complex (Carico2023Reviewing). The RRMs of PTBP1 deviate from the canonical RRM sequence, often substituting key aromatic residues with hydrophobic ones, and interact with RNA through conserved sequences, typically making one to three canonical contacts (Carico2023Reviewing).

RRM3 and RRM4 are major drivers of RNA binding, with RRM3 containing a β5 strand antiparallel to β2, connected to β4 by a long loop above the RNA binding interface. RRM4 has a canonical RRM topology with four anti-parallel β-strands (Carico2023Reviewing). PTBP1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms such as PTB1, PTB2, and PTB4, which differ in the linker length between RRM2 and RRM3 (Carico2023Reviewing). Post-translational modifications, including acetylation and phosphorylation, influence PTBP1's activity and interactions (Pina2018PostTranslational).

## Function
PTBP1, also known as polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1, is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, where it acts as a splicing repressor by binding to polypyrimidine-rich sequences in pre-mRNA, influencing splice site selection and exon inclusion or exclusion (Romanelli2013New; Sawicka2008Polypyrimidinetractbinding). PTBP1 is also involved in mRNA stability and translation, particularly through internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation initiation, which is crucial for both cellular and viral mRNAs (Romanelli2013New).

In the nucleus, PTBP1 regulates the splicing of its own pre-mRNA and other transcripts, while in the cytoplasm, it influences mRNA localization and stability (Romanelli2013New). PTBP1 is essential for neuronal differentiation, where it modulates the splicing of genes involved in neurogenesis and neuronal development (Zhu2020Roles). It also plays a role in immune cell function, affecting T-cell activation and B-cell selection (Zhu2020Roles). PTBP1's activity is crucial for maintaining proper cellular and organismal functions, including heart development and spermatogenesis (SENOO2020RNAbinding; Fochi2020The).

## Clinical Significance
PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in mRNA splicing and regulation. In gliomas, PTBP1 is significantly overexpressed and hypomethylated, correlating with tumor progression and prognosis. Its expression is associated with WHO grade and IDH1 mutation status, suggesting its potential as a marker for inflammation and progression in gliomas (Ye2024Pancancer). In colorectal cancer, high PTBP1 expression is linked to poor clinicopathologic variables, such as venous invasion and lymph node metastasis, and is associated with poor survival rates post-surgery. PTBP1 influences cancer cell invasion and proliferation by regulating the splicing of PKM1/PKM2 isoforms, contributing to the Warburg effect (Takahashi2015Significance).

In breast cancer, PTBP1 is overexpressed in HER2-positive tumors and metastatic samples, indicating its role in aggressive cancer forms. It is linked to the up-regulation of pAkt and interference with autophagy, processes involved in tumorigenesis (Tabatabaeian2020PTBP1). In prostate cancer, PTBP1 genetic variants, particularly the rs10420407 SNP, are associated with poor overall survival and increased expression, correlating with cancer aggressiveness and poor prognosis (HUANG2021PTBP1Genetic). These findings highlight PTBP1's potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target across various cancer types.

## Interactions
PTBP1, or polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1, is known for its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and regulation. PTBP1 interacts directly with the RNA helicase UPF1, inhibiting its 5'-3' translocation activity, which is crucial for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). This interaction is RNA-independent and involves PTBP1 promoting the dissociation of UPF1 from messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) in an ATPase-dependent manner (Fritz2020The).

PTBP1 also interacts with other proteins such as Raver1 and Matrin3. The interaction with Raver1 involves the α-helical surface of PTBP1's RRM2 domain, which binds to a peptide motif within Raver1. This interaction is crucial for forming higher-order ribonucleoprotein complexes that influence splicing (Keppetipola2016Multiple; Coelho2016Functional). PTBP1's interaction with Matrin3, a nuclear matrix protein, is involved in alternative splicing regulation, although Matrin3 acts independently of PTBP1 for most splicing events (Coelho2016Functional).

In the context of telomerase activity regulation, PTBP1 binds to hTERT pre-mRNA at the DR8 region, potentially interacting with NOVA1, which facilitates PTBP1's binding to hTERT pre-mRNA in certain cancer cells (Sayed2018NOVA1).
