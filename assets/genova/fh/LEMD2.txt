# LEMD2

## Overview
LEMD2 is a gene that encodes the LEM domain nuclear envelope protein 2, a transmembrane protein integral to the inner nuclear membrane. This protein is a member of the LEM-domain protein family, characterized by the presence of a conserved LEM domain, which facilitates interactions with chromatin-associated proteins such as the Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (BAF) (Moser2020Comparative; Brachner2005LEM2). LEMD2 plays a pivotal role in maintaining nuclear integrity and chromatin organization, particularly during cell division, by recruiting components of the ESCRT-III complex to the nuclear envelope (Gu2017LEM2). It is also involved in mechanotransduction and is essential for cardiac function, with mutations in the LEMD2 gene linked to various pathologies, including cardiomyopathy and progeroid syndromes (Marbach2019The; Caravia2022Loss). The protein's interactions with A-type lamins and other nuclear envelope components underscore its importance in nuclear structure and function (Brachner2005LEM2).

## Structure
LEMD2, also known as LEM2, is a protein characterized by its membership in the LEM-domain protein family, which includes a conserved LEM domain at the N-terminus. This domain, spanning amino acids 1-42, is involved in binding to the chromatin protein Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (BAF) (Moser2020Comparative; Brachner2005LEM2). LEMD2 contains two transmembrane domains located between amino acids 209-231 and 372-394, which anchor it within the inner nuclear membrane (Brachner2005LEM2). The C-terminal region of LEMD2 includes a highly conserved MAN1-Src1p C-terminal (MSC) domain, spanning amino acids 435-493, which is shared with MAN1, another LEM-domain protein (Moser2020Comparative; Brachner2005LEM2).

LEMD2 is known to interact with A-type lamins, which are crucial for its localization and retention at the nuclear envelope (Brachner2005LEM2). The N-terminal region of LEMD2 is essential for its nuclear envelope retention, containing a retention signal between residues 74-130 (Brachner2005LEM2). LEMD2 also plays a role in recruiting CHMP7 and other ESCRT-III proteins to the nuclear envelope, facilitating its closure during cell division (Gu2017LEM2). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing. However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of LEMD2 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
LEMD2 is a nuclear envelope protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining nuclear integrity and chromatin stabilization in healthy human cells. It is a member of the LEM family, characterized by the LEM domain and two transmembrane domains, and is located in the inner nuclear membrane (Caravia2022Loss). LEMD2 is involved in the interaction between chromatin and the nuclear envelope, associating with DNA-binding proteins such as lamins and barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF). This interaction is essential for nuclear envelope reformation after cell division, contributing to genome stability and proper cardiac function (Caravia2022Loss).

LEMD2 is also implicated in mechanotransduction and chromatin organization, which are vital for cellular functions. It helps organize and stabilize chromatin, particularly under mechanical stress, protecting against DNA damage and apoptosis (Caravia2022Loss). In the context of cardiac function, LEMD2 is essential for maintaining cardiac homeostasis and function, with its deficiency leading to severe cardiomyopathy (Caravia2022Loss). The protein's role in maintaining nuclear stability and chromatin organization is crucial for proper gene expression and cellular function, particularly in cardiac cells (Caravia2022Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LEMD2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting the nuclear envelope's integrity. A de novo missense variant c.1436C>T (p.Ser479Phe) in LEMD2 has been linked to a novel nuclear envelopathy with early progeroid appearance, resembling features of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome and Néstor-Guillermo Progeria Syndrome. This mutation is extremely rare, with an estimated occurrence likelihood of 1 in 60 million, and is suggested to follow an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern (Marbach2019The).

Another mutation, c.T38>G, results in a leucine-to-arginine substitution in the LEM domain and is associated with arrhythmic cardiomyopathy. This mutation leads to severe dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac fibrosis, as demonstrated in knockin mice models, which exhibit DNA damage and apoptosis linked to p53 activation (Abdelfatah2019Characterization; Caravia2022Loss). 

LEMD2 is also implicated in breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Its expression correlates with overall survival, suggesting a protective role. Depletion of LEMD2 in TNBC cells impairs proliferation and induces apoptosis, indicating its potential involvement in tumor suppression (Rose2024The). These findings underscore the gene's clinical significance in various pathologies, including progeroid syndromes, cardiomyopathies, and cancer.

## Interactions
LEMD2, also known as LEM domain nuclear envelope protein 2, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the nuclear envelope. LEMD2 interacts with A-type lamins, particularly lamin A/C, which is essential for its localization and stabilization at the nuclear envelope. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminus of lamin C and is crucial for LEMD2's retention at the inner nuclear membrane (Brachner2005LEM2).

LEMD2 also interacts with emerin and the Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (BAF), which are involved in chromatin organization and nuclear structure maintenance. These interactions suggest a role for LEMD2 in the structural organization of the nuclear envelope and chromatin (Brachner2005LEM2).

In the context of DNA repair, LEMD2 has been shown to interact with several components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, including DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1) and other NER-linked proteins. This indicates a potential role for LEMD2 in DNA damage repair processes (Moser2020Comparative).

LEMD2 also recruits CHMP7 and other ESCRT-III proteins to the nuclear envelope during mitosis, facilitating nuclear envelope reformation. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal domain of LEMD2, highlighting its role as an adaptor in the ESCRT pathway (Gu2017LEM2).
