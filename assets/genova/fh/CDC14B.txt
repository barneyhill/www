# CDC14B

## Overview
CDC14B is a gene that encodes the protein cell division cycle 14B, a dual-specificity phosphatase involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. The CDC14B protein plays a pivotal role in mitotic progression by dephosphorylating key substrates, such as Cdc25 phosphatases, which are crucial for the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) (Tumurbaatar2011Human). This regulation ensures proper mitotic entry and exit, contributing to genomic stability and accurate chromosome segregation (Tumurbaatar2011Human). CDC14B is sequestered in the nucleolus during interphase and released during mitosis, where it influences spindle dynamics and microtubule stability (Cho2005The). The protein's interactions with various cell cycle regulators and its involvement in DNA damage response pathways underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oncogenic transformations (Peddibhotla2011The; Guillamot2011Cdc14b). Alterations in CDC14B expression have been linked to cancer, particularly breast cancer, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Li2020Downregulation).

## Structure
The CDC14B protein is a dual-specificity phosphatase involved in cell cycle regulation. Its molecular structure is characterized by two structurally equivalent domains, known as the A-domain and B-domain, arranged in tandem and connected by a linker alpha-helix (Gray2003The). The B-domain contains the catalytic center, which includes the conserved protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) signature motif (Cys-[X]5-Arg), essential for its enzymatic activity (Gray2003The; Wang2004Kinetic). The A-domain, although structurally similar to the B-domain, lacks catalytic site residues and is unable to bind phosphate, suggesting a non-catalytic role (Gray2003The).

The protein's tertiary structure forms a single globular structure with a large solvent-accessible surface area, featuring a central mainly parallel beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices (Gray2003The). The catalytic site is located within a channel formed at the interface of the two domains, providing specificity for phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues preceding a proline residue (Gray2003The). The structure of CDC14B also includes a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the apolar proline residue, contributing to substrate specificity (Gray2003The).

CDC14B is known to have splice variant isoforms, which may result in different functional roles, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (ManzanoLópez2020The).

## Function
The CDC14B gene encodes a phosphatase that plays a critical role in regulating mitosis in human cells. It is involved in dephosphorylating Cdc25 phosphatases, which are essential for the activation of Cdk1, a key regulator of cell cycle progression. By inactivating Cdc25, CDC14B prevents unscheduled activation of Cdk1, thereby promoting proper mitotic progression and exit (Tumurbaatar2011Human). CDC14B is sequestered in the nucleolus during interphase and released during mitosis, where it modulates spindle assembly and disassembly by bundling and stabilizing microtubules (Tumurbaatar2011Human; Cho2005The).

CDC14B also plays a role in maintaining genomic stability by ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and preventing mitotic defects such as multipolar spindles and lagging chromosomes (Tumurbaatar2011Human). It is involved in the transcriptional repression of cell cycle regulators, influencing the degradation machinery of proteins like cyclins and Cdk1, and modulating cell cycle progression through transcriptional regulation (Guillamot2011Cdc14b). The protein's activity is crucial for proper cell division and organismal development, contributing to the DNA damage response and maintaining genomic stability (Cho2005The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the CDC14B gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. In breast cancer, CDC14B is frequently downregulated, which is associated with poor prognosis, especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. This downregulation correlates with poor recurrence-free survival and overall survival, making CDC14B a potential prognostic marker for TNBC (Li2020Downregulation). CDC14B alterations, such as amplification and deep deletion, are common in invasive ductal and lobular breast carcinomas and are linked to menopausal status, metastatic tumor indicators, and lymph node stage (Li2020Downregulation).

CDC14B is also involved in DNA damage repair. Deficiency in CDC14B impairs both homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining, the two major DNA double-strand break repair pathways, leading to genome instability and early-onset aging phenotypes in mice (Lin2015Cdc14A). Additionally, CDC14B is linked to centrosome regulation, where its depletion leads to centriole amplification, a condition associated with chromosomal instability and cancer development (Wu2008Cdc14B). These findings suggest that CDC14B may function as a tumor suppressor, and its alterations could contribute to tumorigenesis through disrupted cell cycle control and genomic instability.

## Interactions
CDC14B is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly during mitosis. It forms complexes with various proteins, including components of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) such as APC1 and Cdh1, but not Cdc20. This interaction suggests that CDC14B dephosphorylates and activates Cdh1, facilitating the formation of APC/C Cdh1, which is essential for the degradation of cyclin B and other mitotic regulators (tumurbaatar2007functional).

CDC14B also interacts with all three human Cdc25 isoforms, dephosphorylating them at Cdk1/cyclin B target sites, with a preference for Cdc25B and Cdc25C. This interaction is crucial for regulating mitotic entry (tumurbaatar2007functional). Additionally, CDC14B is phosphorylated by Cdk1/cyclin B, indicating a regulatory interaction (tumurbaatar2007functional).

In the context of DNA damage response, CDC14B interacts with the Chk1 kinase. Chk1 phosphorylates CDC14B, regulating its sub-nuclear shuttling in response to DNA damage, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability (Peddibhotla2011The). CDC14B also forms a complex with RNA polymerase II, dephosphorylating its C-terminal domain, which is important for transcriptional regulation during the cell cycle (Guillamot2011Cdc14b).
