# MAP2K7

## Overview
MAP2K7, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7, is a gene that encodes a dual-specificity kinase involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The protein product of MAP2K7, MKK7, plays a pivotal role in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling cascade, which is crucial for regulating cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Park2019MKK7). As a kinase, MKK7 is responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of JNK, thereby influencing responses to extracellular stimuli, including stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Kishimoto2003Different). The structural features of MKK7, including its kinase domain and regulatory elements, facilitate its function and interaction with other proteins in the signaling pathway (Sogabe2016A). MAP2K7 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity, and cancer, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Winchester2012Converging; Ray2020A).

## Structure
MAP2K7, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7, is a kinase involved in the JNK signaling pathway. The protein contains a kinase domain that is essential for its catalytic activity. The molecular structure of MAP2K7 includes a typical kinase fold with disordered regions such as the αC-helix and activation loop, which are crucial for kinase activation (Sogabe2016A). The protein's structure is characterized by a unique auto-inhibition mechanism, where the glycine-rich loop occludes the ATP binding site, stabilized by an interaction between Cys218 and Gly145 (Sogabe2016A).

MAP2K7's structure also features a conserved N-terminal regulatory helix that plays a critical role in transitioning the kinase from an inactive to an active state. This helix interacts with the αC helix, facilitating structural rearrangements necessary for activation (Schröder2020Catalytic). The kinase domain exhibits plasticity, allowing it to accommodate various inhibitors, including those targeting an allosteric pocket in the N-terminal lobe (Schröder2020Catalytic).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in MAP2K7, influencing its regulatory and functional properties. The protein also has several splice variant isoforms, which may differ in their regulatory or functional roles.

## Function
MAP2K7, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7, is a dual-specificity kinase that plays a critical role in the JNK signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, MAP2K7 specifically activates the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) through threonine phosphorylation, a process crucial for responding to extracellular stimuli like pro-inflammatory cytokines, stress, and growth factors (Park2019MKK7).

MAP2K7 is involved in the dual phosphorylation of the stress-activated protein kinase SAPK/JNK, with a preference for phosphorylating the threonine residue in the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif. This phosphorylation is necessary for the full activation of JNK, which regulates intracellular functions such as cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation (Kishimoto2003Different). The kinase is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing stress responses and developmental processes (Park2019MKK7).

MAP2K7 is also implicated in synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopment, particularly through its interaction with the NMDA receptor, which is essential for cognitive functions and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Winchester2012Converging). Its role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAP2K7 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In cancer, the MAP2K7Δexon2 splice isoform is up-regulated in conditions of low MBNL1 expression, leading to activation of the JNK signaling pathway. This activation is associated with increased cancer stem cell properties, including enhanced migratory and invasive behaviors in cancer cells. The splicing status of MAP2K7 exon2 may serve as a biomarker for predicting the effectiveness of JNK inhibition therapy in cancer patients (Ray2020A).

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the p.Glu116Lys variant of MAP2K7 is associated with an increased risk, particularly in southern and eastern Chinese populations. Carriers of this variant exhibit significantly lower lung function, suggesting its potential role as a genetic biomarker for COPD susceptibility (Qiu2017Rare).

MAP2K7 is also linked to schizophrenia. Sequence variations, such as SNPs rs3679 and rs4804833, are associated with altered expression levels of MAP2K7, potentially contributing to schizophrenia. These variations may affect mRNA stability and transcription initiation, leading to impaired cognitive functions like working memory, which are characteristic of schizophrenia (Winchester2012Converging).

## Interactions
MAP2K7, also known as MKK7, is a dual-specificity kinase that plays a crucial role in the MAPK signaling pathway, specifically activating the JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) pathway. It interacts with various proteins, including MAPK8 (JNK1), MAPK9 (JNK2), and MAPK10 (JNK3), facilitating their activation (Ray2020A). MAP2K7 is regulated by upstream kinases such as MAP3K1 (MEKK1) and forms complexes with scaffold proteins like JIP1, which aid in its interaction with JNKs (Ray2020A).

In the context of cancer, MAP2K7 has been identified as a tumor-suppressing kinase with loss-of-function mutations frequently observed in gastric cancer. These mutations often result in the inactivation of the JNK pathway, which includes MAP2K7, MAP2K4, and MAP3K13, contributing to tumorigenesis (Hudson2018Truncationa). The interaction of MAP2K7 with the JNK pathway is significant in various cancers, where alterations in this pathway can lead to increased cancer stem cell-like properties and dedifferentiation (Ray2020A).

MAP2K7 also participates in interactions that are critical for its function and stability. For instance, the presence of cysteine residues in its structure, such as Cys218, is important for its covalent engagement with inhibitors, which can affect its activity and interactions (Scheidt2023The).
