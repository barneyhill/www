# MUS81

## Overview
MUS81 is a gene that encodes a structure-specific endonuclease subunit, which plays a pivotal role in DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability. The MUS81 protein, in conjunction with its partners EME1 or EME2, forms a heterodimeric complex essential for its endonuclease activity. This complex is involved in the resolution of branched DNA structures, such as stalled replication forks and Holliday junctions, which are critical intermediates in DNA repair and replication processes (Interthal2000MUS81; Ciccia2008Structural). The MUS81 protein is characterized by an XPF-like nuclease domain and a helix-hairpin-helix motif, which are crucial for its catalytic function and DNA binding, respectively (Interthal2000MUS81). Its activity is regulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, such as SLX4 and TOPBP1, which enhance its function in DNA damage response pathways (Pfander2017Control). The clinical significance of MUS81 is underscored by its association with various cancers, where its altered expression or mutations can lead to genomic instability and influence cancer progression and treatment outcomes (Pinheiro2020Germline; Lu2019MUS81).

## Structure
The human MUS81 protein is a structure-specific endonuclease that plays a critical role in DNA repair. It forms a heterodimer with either EME1 or EME2, which is essential for its quaternary structure and function (Ciccia2008Structural). The MUS81 protein contains an XPF-like nuclease domain, which is crucial for its catalytic activity, and a helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motif that facilitates DNA binding (Interthal2000MUS81; Ciccia2008Structural). 

The protein's active site is characterized by a signature motif, DXnERKX3D, involving key residues such as Asp274, Glu277, and Asp307, which are essential for its nuclease activity. The presence of a Mg2+ ion is necessary for its function, and mutations in these residues significantly reduce its activity (Gwon2014Crystal). The MUS81 protein shares structural similarities with other nucleases like hFEN1 and Exo1, including a six-stranded sheet flanked by helices and a hydrophobic wedge that separates DNA strands (Gwon2014Crystal).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate MUS81's activity, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context (Ciccia2008Structural).

## Function
The MUS81 gene encodes a structure-specific endonuclease that plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. MUS81 forms a complex with EME1, which is essential for its endonuclease activity. This complex is involved in the processing of branched DNA structures, such as stalled replication forks and Holliday junctions, which are critical intermediates in DNA repair and replication processes (Hiyama2006Haploinsufficiency; Blais2004RNA).

MUS81 is active during the S-phase of the cell cycle, where it localizes to nucleoli and regions of DNA damage, facilitating the repair of DNA lesions and the resolution of replication stress. Its activity is crucial for the proper progression of DNA replication, particularly under conditions of replication stress, where it helps convert perturbed replication forks into DNA breaks, allowing for the resumption of replication (Gao2003Mus81; Fu2015The).

MUS81 also plays a role in activating intra-S-phase and G2/M checkpoints in response to DNA damage, preventing DNA rereplication and ensuring proper cell cycle progression. This function is vital for maintaining chromosomal stability and preventing chromosomal aberrations, which can lead to tumorigenesis (McPherson2004Involvement; Hiyama2006Haploinsufficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the MUS81 gene have been linked to various cancers. The c.1292G>A (p.R431H) variant of MUS81 is associated with familial breast and thyroid cancer. This mutation results in impaired protein stability and reduced DNA damage repair activity, leading to increased cancer susceptibility. The variant is more frequent in familial cancer cases compared to sporadic ones, suggesting a significant role in hereditary cancer risk (Pinheiro2020Germline).

In serous ovarian cancer (SOC), MUS81 expression is upregulated, correlating with genomic instability and cancer progression. Higher MUS81 levels are linked to poorer prognosis, and its overexpression is associated with advanced-stage SOC (Lu2019MUS81). In gastric cancer, MUS81 is also overexpressed, and its high expression is linked to poor outcomes. Targeting MUS81 can enhance the effects of WEE1 inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockade therapy, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2021Targeting).

In esophageal adenocarcinoma, MUS81 expression is associated with resistance to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. High MUS81 levels may predict poorer clinical outcomes, indicating its potential as a biomarker for chemotherapy response (MacGregor2018Translational). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MUS81 in cancer development and treatment.

## Interactions
MUS81, a structure-specific endonuclease, interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to perform its role in DNA repair. In humans, MUS81 forms a complex with EME1 or EME2, which are regulatory subunits that modulate its activity. This complex is involved in resolving DNA intermediates such as Holliday junctions and 3' flaps (Marini2023MUS81; Mazina2008Human).

MUS81 also interacts with SLX4, a scaffold protein that facilitates its interaction with other proteins like TOPBP1, enhancing its nuclease activity. This interaction is crucial for targeting MUS81 to its chromosomal substrates (Pfander2017Control). In yeast, MUS81 forms a complex with Mms4 and interacts with proteins such as Rad54, which enhances its nuclease activity on various DNA substrates. This interaction is evolutionarily conserved and plays a significant role in DNA repair and recombination processes (Matulova2009Cooperativity).

Additionally, MUS81 interacts with the cruciform DNA-binding protein Crp1, which stimulates its endonuclease activity on nicked Holliday junctions. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal regions of both proteins, enhancing MUS81's catalytic efficiency (Phung2020The).
