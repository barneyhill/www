# RHOV

## Overview
RHOV is a gene that encodes the protein Ras homolog family member V, which is part of the Rho GTPase family. This protein is categorized as an atypical GTPase due to its distinct structural and functional properties. Unlike typical Rho GTPases, RHOV lacks a C-terminal prenylation site and instead undergoes S-palmitoylation, which is crucial for its membrane localization and function. The RHOV protein plays a significant role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, cell adhesion, and cell polarity, contributing to processes such as filopodia and lamellipodia formation. It interacts with p21-activated kinases (PAKs) and is involved in various signaling pathways, including the JNK/c-Jun pathway, which is important for cell proliferation and migration. RHOV's expression and activity have been linked to cancer progression, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma, where it acts as an oncogene by promoting tumor growth and metastasis (Hodge2017Regulation; Wang2022Exosomal; Zhang2021RHOV).

## Structure
The RHOV protein, a member of the Rho GTPase family, is characterized by its unique structural features that distinguish it from other Rho GTPases. Unlike typical Rho GTPases, RHOV lacks a C-terminal prenylation site, which is usually involved in membrane attachment. Instead, RHOV undergoes C-terminal S-palmitoylation, a reversible lipid modification that influences its membrane association and localization to both the plasma membrane and endomembrane compartments (Hodge2017Regulation).

The primary structure of RHOV includes unique N-terminal and C-terminal regions that regulate its activity and localization. These regions are crucial for its transforming activity and interaction with other proteins, such as PAK2 and PAK6, through its effector loop and C-terminal region (Hodge2017Regulation). The C-terminal region contains specific residues, including a tryptophan residue (W229) and two arginine residues (R226 and R228), which are essential for its membrane localization (Hodge2017Regulation).

RHOV's secondary and tertiary structures are not detailed in the provided context, but it is known to form a compact, globular shape typical of small GTPases. The protein's involvement in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility suggests a role in actin polymerization and focal adhesion complex formation (Hodge2017Regulation; Alibardi2019Immunolabelling).

## Function
RHOV, also known as RhoV, is a member of the Rho GTPase family involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics, cell adhesion, and cell polarity. It is considered an atypical GTPase due to its unique biochemical properties and sequence homology with RhoU. Unlike classical Rho GTPases, RhoV is post-translationally modified by palmitoylation, which is crucial for its localization to the plasma membrane and endomembrane compartments (Hodge2017Regulation).

RhoV plays a significant role in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, promoting the assembly of focal adhesion complexes, which are essential for cell movement and stability (Hodge2017Regulation). It interacts with PAK serine/threonine kinases, influencing cellular signaling pathways, although it does not increase phospho-PAK6 levels, suggesting a complex regulatory role (Hodge2017Regulation).

RhoV is activated at the endosomal compartment, particularly in response to TNF-a activation, indicating its involvement in endosomal signaling. This activation is crucial for processes like heart development and epithelial morphogenesis (Hodge2017Regulation). RhoV's expression increases during macrophage differentiation into osteoclasts, coinciding with high apoptosis levels, although its direct role in this process is not fully understood (Hodge2017Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RHOV gene have been implicated in the progression and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). High RHOV mRNA expression is significantly associated with advanced clinical stages, lymph node metastasis, and larger tumor sizes in LUAD patients. This overexpression correlates with shorter overall survival, particularly in the early stages of the disease, suggesting that RHOV acts as an oncogene in LUAD (Zhang2021RHOV). Mechanistically, RHOV promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through the activation of the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer progression. This pathway also influences the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes, contributing to cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Zhang2021RHOV).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RHOV is upregulated and plays a significant role in tumor growth and metastasis. It is part of a regulatory network involving exosomal circ_0000519 and miR-1258, where RHOV expression is modulated by these molecules, impacting cancer cell behavior (Wang2022Exosomal). These findings highlight RHOV as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker in lung cancer.

## Interactions
RHOV, also known as Ras homolog family member V, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with p21-activated kinases (PAKs), specifically PAK2 and PAK6. The interaction with PAK2 is facilitated by the C-terminal region of RHOV, while specific residues in the effector loop, such as T63, L65, and E66, mediate its interaction with the PAK6 CRIB motif. These interactions are modulated by mutations in RHOV, with the activating mutation RhoV-G40V enhancing binding to PAK2 and PAK6, and the dominant negative mutant RhoV-S45N abolishing these interactions (Hodge2017Regulation).

Despite these interactions, RHOV overexpression does not increase phospho-PAK6 levels, indicating that PAK6 is not an effector protein of RHOV (Hodge2017Regulation). RHOV also plays a role in the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway, which is crucial for lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This pathway is activated by RHOV overexpression, leading to increased phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun, although it does not alter their total expression levels (Zhang2021RHOV). These interactions highlight RHOV's role in cellular signaling and its potential impact on cancer progression.
