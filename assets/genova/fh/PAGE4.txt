# PAGE4

## Overview
PAGE4 (Prostate-associated gene 4) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cancer/testis antigen family, specifically known as PAGE family member 4. This protein is characterized as an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), which means it lacks a stable tertiary structure, allowing it to participate in diverse cellular interactions and signaling pathways. PAGE4 is predominantly expressed in the stromal compartment of the prostate gland, where it plays a critical role in modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is vital for maintaining tissue homeostasis and regulating stem cell fate. The protein's function is intricately linked to its phosphorylation state, which influences its interaction with other proteins such as c-Jun, a component of the MAP kinase signaling pathway. PAGE4's expression and activity are of particular interest in the context of prostate cancer, where it has been implicated in disease progression and resistance to treatment, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Koirala2020Tissue-Specific; Sampson2012PAGE4; Rajagopalan2014The).

## Structure
PAGE4 is an intrinsically disordered protein, meaning it lacks a stable tertiary structure and exhibits a high degree of flexibility. Despite this, PAGE4 has regions with specific conformational tendencies. The protein consists of 102 amino acids and includes regions with propensities for β-extended and α-helical conformations. Specifically, residues 14-17, 21-23, 32-34, and 38-40 show β-extended conformations, while residues 67-73 exhibit α-helical tendencies (He2015Phosphorylationinduced).

Phosphorylation is a significant post-translational modification for PAGE4, particularly at Thr-51, which induces conformational changes. This modification increases α-helical tendencies around Thr-51 and leads to a more compact structure by forming an intraresidue hydrogen bond, providing approximately 2 kcal/mol of stabilization (He2015Phosphorylationinduced). Phosphorylation also affects long-range interactions within the protein, modulating its structural ensemble and influencing its binding affinity to partners like c-Jun (He2015Phosphorylationinduced).

PAGE4 interacts with the oncoprotein c-Jun, forming part of a regulatory circuit that influences phenotypic switching in prostate cancer cells. The protein's structure is modulated by phosphorylation through kinases such as HIPK1 and CLK2, which result in different conformational preferences and affect its binding affinity to the AP-1 complex (Lin2019Structural).

## Function
PAGE4 (PAGE family member 4) is a gene that encodes a protein primarily expressed in the stromal compartment of the prostate gland, where it plays a crucial role in regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for stem cell fate, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration. PAGE4 is expressed in prostate stromal fibroblasts, which produce canonical Wnts, and it functions by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin activity in these cells. This inhibition is achieved through PAGE4 acting as a substrate decoy for Tankyrase 1 (TNKS1), preventing the degradation of AXIN1, a key component of the β-catenin destruction complex, thereby stabilizing the complex and reducing Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Koirala2020Tissue-Specific).

PAGE4's expression is confined to prostate stromal fibroblasts and does not overlap with active β-catenin, which is enriched in epithelial/basal cells. This suggests that PAGE4 helps maintain the specificity and accuracy of signaling within the prostate gland by balancing autocrine and paracrine signaling (Koirala2020Tissue-Specific). Additionally, PAGE4 is involved in modulating stress responses and may influence the JNK pathway by interacting with c-Jun, a component of the MAP kinase signaling pathway, thereby enhancing c-Jun transactivation (Rajagopalan2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PAGE4 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in prostate cancer (PCa). PAGE4 is upregulated in early-stage PCa and precursor lesions but is downregulated in high-grade and metastatic PCa, suggesting its role in disease progression (Fu2020Stromal‐epithelial). High PAGE4 expression is associated with longer survival in hormone-naive PCa patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Sampson2012PAGE4). PAGE4 expression inversely correlates with androgen receptor (AR) status, and its presence is linked to attenuated AR signaling, which is crucial in PCa progression (Sampson2012PAGE4).

PAGE4's phosphorylation by kinases such as HIPK1 and CLK2 leads to different conformational changes, affecting its interaction with transcription factors like c-Jun. This modulation can influence transitions between androgen-dependent and androgen-independent phenotypes, contributing to androgen resistance in PCa (Kulkarni2017Phosphorylationinduced). Silencing PAGE4 expression increases apoptosis and enhances the sensitivity of PCa cells to chemotherapy, suggesting its role in cell survival and resistance to treatment (Zeng2011The). These findings highlight PAGE4's potential as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer management.

## Interactions
PAGE4 is a highly intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing cellular signaling pathways and transcriptional regulation. PAGE4 interacts with Tankyrase 1 (TNKS1), forming a complex that inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction involves PAGE4's Tankyrase Binding Motif (TBM), which allows it to compete with other proteins like AXIN1 and RNF146 for TNKS1 binding, thereby preventing the ubiquitination and degradation of TNKS1 substrates (Koirala2020Tissue-Specific).

PAGE4 also interacts with the transcription factor c-Jun, enhancing its transactivation in a MEKK-JNK-dependent manner. This interaction is characterized by conformational changes in PAGE4, which are crucial for its function as a modulator of c-Jun activity (Rajagopalan2014The). Phosphorylation of PAGE4 by homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1 (HIPK1) at threonine 51 modulates its interaction with c-Jun, potentially allowing c-Jun to engage with other partners (Mooney2014CancerTestis).

PAGE4 is also predicted to be a DNA-binding protein, with a high probability of binding to GC-rich sequences, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Zeng2011The). These interactions highlight PAGE4's role in cellular processes and its potential involvement in cancer pathophysiology.
