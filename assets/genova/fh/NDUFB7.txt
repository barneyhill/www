# NDUFB7

## Overview
NDUFB7 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B7, which is an integral component of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein is categorized as an accessory subunit within the complex and plays a pivotal role in the electron transport chain, a critical process for cellular energy production through oxidative phosphorylation. The NDUFB7 protein is characterized by its CHCH domain and N-terminal N-myristoylation motif, which are essential for its mitochondrial localization and function. It is involved in stabilizing complex I by interacting with other subunits, such as ND5, and is crucial for the assembly and maintenance of the complex. Mutations or alterations in the expression of NDUFB7 have been associated with severe mitochondrial disorders and various cancers, underscoring its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Correia2021Severe; Harada2023Protein; Padavannil2022The).

## Structure
The NDUFB7 protein is a member of the CHCHD-containing protein family and is characterized by several structural features. Its primary structure includes an N-terminal N-myristoylation motif, which is crucial for mitochondrial localization and is highly conserved among vertebrates (Harada2023Protein). The secondary structure of NDUFB7 features a CHCH domain between positions 56 to 98, containing two Cx9C motifs at positions 59 to 69 and 80 to 90. These motifs form a helix-coil-helix structure, facilitating the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds that stabilize the protein's conformation (Szklarczyk2011NDUFB7; Harada2023Protein).

The tertiary structure is influenced by these disulfide bonds, which are essential for maintaining the protein's stability and preventing membrane translocation (Szklarczyk2011NDUFB7). NDUFB7 also contains a nuclear localization signal-like sequence (NLSL) at positions 109 to 118, with a specific sequence (RKKRR) at positions 111 to 115, which is involved in nuclear localization when the protein is not myristoylated (Harada2023Protein).

In terms of quaternary structure, NDUFB7 functions as an accessory subunit of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, interacting with other proteins within this complex to stabilize its structure (Harada2023Protein; Padavannil2022The). The protein's localization and function are dependent on both the N-myristoylation and the CHCH domain, which are necessary for its proper mitochondrial targeting and retention (Harada2023Protein).

## Function
NDUFB7 is a protein subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which plays a critical role in the electron transport chain. This complex is essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a process that generates ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell. NDUFB7 is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is unique among complex I subunits due to its lipid modification; its N-terminal glycine is myristoylated, anchoring it to the membrane. This myristoyl group binds in a groove on the ND5 subunit, facilitating interactions with other subunits such as ND5, NDUFB8, NDUFB2, NDUFB6, and NDUFB10 (Padavannil2022The).

The protein contains a CX9C motif, which is involved in forming disulfide bonds that stabilize its structure. This motif is crucial for the Mitochondrial Import and Assembly (MIA) pathway, which regulates complex I assembly based on the cell's redox status (Padavannil2022The). Knockout studies in HEK293T cells have shown that the absence of NDUFB7 leads to defects in complex I assembly and reduced mitochondrial respiration, highlighting its essential role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Padavannil2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFB7 gene have been linked to severe mitochondrial disorders. A notable case involves a biallelic intronic mutation (c.113-10C>G) in NDUFB7, which disrupts the normal splicing pattern of its mRNA. This mutation results in reduced levels of the NDUFB7 protein and decreased activity of mitochondrial complex I, leading to severe congenital lactic acidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The affected patient exhibited symptoms such as intrauterine growth restriction, anemia, encephalopathy, and a severe complex I defect, ultimately resulting in a fatal outcome (Harada2023Protein; Correia2021Severe).

Alterations in the expression levels of NDUFB7 have also been observed in cancer. In gastric cancer, NDUFB7, along with other oxidative phosphorylation genes, is significantly down-regulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This down-regulation is associated with poorer overall survival and post-progression survival in patients, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic biomarker (Su2020Quantitative).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of NDUFB7 in both mitochondrial disorders and cancer, highlighting the importance of maintaining its normal expression and function for cellular health.

## Interactions
NDUFB7 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is a crucial component of the electron transport chain. This protein participates in several interactions that are essential for its function and localization. NDUFB7 interacts with the central subunit ND5 within complex I, where its N-terminal myristoyl group binds in a groove on ND5, facilitating protein-protein interactions necessary for the assembly and stability of complex I (Harada2023Protein). 

NDUFB7 is part of a module within complex I that includes other accessory subunits such as NDUFB2, NDUFB3, NDUFB8, and NDUFB9, which collectively contribute to the stabilization and function of the complex (Harada2023Protein). The protein is imported into the mitochondrial intermembrane space via the Mia40/CHCHD4 import machinery, which is crucial for its proper localization and function (Harada2023Protein). 

In the context of painful diabetic neuropathy, NDUFB7 has been identified as a hub protein in protein-protein interaction networks, indicating its significant role in the pathophysiology of this condition (AmiriDashatan2024Introducing). These interactions highlight the importance of NDUFB7 in both mitochondrial function and disease-related pathways.
