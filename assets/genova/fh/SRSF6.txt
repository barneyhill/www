# SRSF6

## Overview
The SRSF6 gene encodes the serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 6, a member of the SR protein family, which is integral to the regulation of alternative splicing in eukaryotic cells. This protein, also known as SRp55, is characterized by its RNA recognition motifs and an RS domain, which facilitate its role in RNA binding and protein interactions, respectively (Wan2017SRSF6regulated; She2021Targeting). SRSF6 is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, metabolism, and immune activation, by modulating the splicing of pre-mRNA (Choi2022SRSF6). It is particularly significant in the context of cancer, where its dysregulation is associated with tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (JimenezVacas2023The; Wan2017SRSF6regulated). The protein's interactions with specific RNA sequences and other proteins underscore its critical role in gene expression regulation and cellular homeostasis (Choi2022SRSF6; Kong2016Long).

## Structure
The SRSF6 protein, also known as SRp55, is a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family and plays a crucial role in RNA splicing. The full-length SRSF6 protein consists of 344 amino acids and includes several key structural domains. It contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2) at the N-terminus, which are essential for binding RNA. The RRM2 domain is particularly important for the regulation of alternative splicing in colorectal cancer progression (Wan2017SRSF6regulated; She2021Targeting). The C-terminal region of SRSF6 features an RS domain, rich in arginine and serine dipeptides, which functions as a protein interaction domain and is involved in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (She2021Targeting).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, often occur in the RS domain, influencing the splicing activity of SRSF6. The protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (She2021Targeting). SRSF6 can exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function and interactions, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context. The lack of a crystal structure has led to the use of homology modeling to predict its 3D structure (Wan2017SRSF6regulated).

## Function
SRSF6, a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family, plays a crucial role in the regulation of alternative splicing in healthy human cells. It is involved in the splicing of pre-mRNA, a process essential for gene expression, and influences mRNA diversity and gene expression (She2021Targeting). SRSF6 is active in the nucleus, where it regulates the alternative splicing of various genes, including those involved in apoptosis, such as Fas, CCAR1, Bcl-x, and Bim (Choi2022SRSF6). In particular, SRSF6 enhances the inclusion of cassette exons in Fas pre-mRNA, promoting the production of proteins with pro-apoptotic functions (Choi2022SRSF6).

In pancreatic β-cells, SRSF6 is required for mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, impacting insulin release (She2021Targeting). It also regulates the splicing of genes involved in the DNA damage response, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, and is involved in maintaining microtubule stability in neuron cells by promoting the inclusion of Tau exon 10 (She2021Targeting). SRSF6's role in cell proliferation is evident as its knockdown inhibits the proliferation of pleural mesothelial cells (She2021Targeting). Overall, SRSF6 is integral to various cellular processes, including apoptosis, metabolism, and immune activation (Choi2022SRSF6).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SRSF6 gene have been implicated in the progression of various cancers. Overexpression of SRSF6 is frequently observed in colorectal cancer, where it promotes tumor proliferation and metastasis by regulating alternative splicing events that affect cell adhesion and other oncogenic pathways (Wan2017SRSF6regulated). In prostate cancer, SRSF6 is upregulated and associated with aggressive clinical features, including high Gleason scores and metastasis. Its overexpression enhances tumor aggressiveness, while silencing SRSF6 reduces proliferation and tumor growth (JimenezVacas2023The).

SRSF6 also plays a role in breast cancer, where it is linked to increased metastasis and chemotherapy resistance. It regulates immune-associated genes and influences angiogenesis, contributing to cancer progression and resistance to treatment (She2021Targeting). In HeLa cells, SRSF6 overexpression leads to increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation, suggesting a complex role in cancer progression (Yang2020SRSF6).

The gene's involvement in alternative splicing of genes related to DNA damage response and repair pathways further underscores its significance in tumorigenesis (Yang2020SRSF6). These findings highlight SRSF6 as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in various cancers.

## Interactions
SRSF6, a member of the SR protein family, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence alternative splicing and gene expression. It interacts with the long non-coding RNA LINC01133, which inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC) by binding to SRSF6. This interaction blocks SRSF6's function, leading to changes in EMT marker expression and reduced migration and invasion of CRC cells (Kong2016Long).

SRSF6 also binds to specific RNA sequences, such as the UGCCAA motif in the Fas pre-mRNA, regulating alternative splicing events related to apoptosis. This interaction was confirmed through RNA-pulldown and immunoblotting analyses, demonstrating SRSF6's role in modulating Fas pre-mRNA splicing (Choi2022SRSF6).

In colorectal cancer, SRSF6 interacts with the ZO-1 mRNA by binding to a specific motif in exon23, influencing its splicing and promoting tumor progression. This interaction was validated through gel shift assays and RNA immunoprecipitation (Wan2017SRSF6regulated). These interactions highlight SRSF6's role in regulating alternative splicing and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
