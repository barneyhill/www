# CCDC71

## Overview
The CCDC71 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 71 protein, which is a member of the coiled-coil domain-containing protein family. These proteins are characterized by their structural motif, the coiled-coil domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions and is involved in various cellular processes. Although the specific biological functions of CCDC71 are not fully elucidated, proteins with coiled-coil domains are often implicated in roles such as intracellular transport, cell division, and signal transduction. The expression and regulation of CCDC71 may have implications in certain pathological conditions, although further research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance.
