# TET2

## Overview
TET2, or ten-eleven translocation 2, is a gene located on chromosome 4q24 that encodes the enzyme tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2. This enzyme is a member of the dioxygenase family and plays a pivotal role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression through its involvement in DNA demethylation. TET2 catalyzes the conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and further oxidized derivatives, facilitating active DNA demethylation processes (Ito2011Tet; He2011Tet-Mediated). The protein is characterized by a catalytic domain with a double-stranded β-helix fold and a cysteine-rich domain, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Bussaglia2019TET2; Bowman2017TET2). Unlike its homologs TET1 and TET3, TET2 lacks a CXXC domain due to a chromosomal inversion, which affects its direct DNA binding capability (Zhang2023TET). TET2 is crucial for normal hematopoiesis and cellular differentiation, and its mutations are associated with various hematological malignancies, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease (Quivoron2011TET2; Kosmider2009TET2).

## Structure
The TET2 protein is a 2002-amino acid enzyme encoded by the TET2 gene located on chromosome 4q24. It features a carboxy-terminal catalytic domain that includes a double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) fold, essential for its dioxygenase activity, and a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) (Zhang2023TET; Bussaglia2019TET2; Bowman2017TET2). The catalytic unit is situated in the C-terminal region and is characterized by two tandem cysteine-rich modules followed by the catalytic domain (Bussaglia2019TET2). The DSBH domain contains key residues necessary for binding cofactors such as α-ketoglutarate and Fe(II), which are crucial for the catalytic function (Zhang2023TET).

TET2 lacks a CXXC domain due to a chromosomal inversion, which resulted in the ancestral TET2 CXXC domain becoming a separate gene called IDAX (CXXC4) (Zhang2023TET). This structural difference means TET2 does not directly bind to DNA like TET1 and TET3, which have CXXC domains (Zhang2023TET). The protein also includes a large, poorly conserved insertion between positions Cys1464 and Glu1841 (Bussaglia2019TET2). Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation of Lys110 by p300/CBP, enhance TET2's stability and catalytic activity (Bussaglia2019TET2).

## Function
TET2 (tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the DNA demethylation process, which is essential for regulating gene expression and maintaining normal cellular functions. TET2 catalyzes the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), and further to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) (Ito2011Tet; He2011Tet-Mediated). This series of reactions is a key step in active DNA demethylation, which can lead to the replacement of methylated cytosines with unmethylated ones through base excision repair (He2011Tet-Mediated).

TET2 is primarily active in the nucleus and requires cofactors such as Fe2+ and 2-oxoglutarate for its enzymatic activity (He2011Tet-Mediated). The enzyme's activity is influenced by factors like vitamin C, which can enhance TET2 function, particularly in embryonic stem cells (Bowman2017TET2). TET2 is involved in normal hematopoiesis and cellular differentiation, impacting immune function and development (Bowman2017TET2). It is highly expressed in pluripotent cells and plays a significant role in epigenetic regulation during embryogenesis and somatic cell reprogramming (Lou2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TET2 gene are implicated in a variety of hematological malignancies. These mutations are frequently observed in myeloid disorders such as myeloproliferative neoplasms, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Quivoron2011TET2; Kosmider2009TET2). In CMML, TET2 mutations are present in approximately 50% of cases and are associated with poorer survival outcomes (Kosmider2009TET2). In myeloproliferative neoplasms, TET2 mutations occur in both JAK2V617F-positive and negative cases, though they do not significantly affect leukocyte or platelet counts (Tefferi2009TET2).

TET2 mutations are also found in lymphoid malignancies, including B and T cell lymphomas. Notably, up to 30% of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) cases harbor TET2 mutations (Quivoron2011TET2). These mutations can lead to altered hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis, contributing to both myeloid and lymphoid malignancies (Quivoron2011TET2).

Germline TET2 mutations are linked to immunodeficiency and lymphoproliferative diseases, as seen in children with autosomal recessive syndromes characterized by immunodeficiency and lymphoma (Stremenova2020Germline). These mutations can predispose individuals to hematological tumors, often requiring additional genetic mutations for disease manifestation (Wu2022Pedigree).

## Interactions
TET2 interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in epigenetic regulation and cellular differentiation. Unlike TET1 and TET3, TET2 lacks a CXXC domain for chromatin binding and is instead recruited to DNA by proteins such as IDAX, which originates from the ancestral TET2 CXXC domain (Zhang2023TET). TET2 also interacts with transcription factors like NANOG, EBF1, and WT1, which help regulate DNA demethylation and gene expression. The interaction with WT1 is particularly important for guiding TET2 to specific DNA sequences (Zhang2023TET).

TET2 forms complexes with RNA-binding proteins like PSPC1, which recruits HDAC1/2 for transcriptional repression independent of TET2's catalytic activity (Zhang2023TET). It also interacts with O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), promoting its activity and influencing transcription through the regulation of H3K4me3, a histone modification associated with gene activation (Deplus2013TET2).

The CRL4 VprBP E3 ligase promotes the monoubiquitylation of TET2, enhancing its chromatin binding and DNA interaction capabilities. This modification is crucial for TET2's function, as mutations at the monoubiquitylation site disrupt its activity (Nakagawa2015CRL4VprBP). These interactions highlight TET2's role in complex regulatory networks that influence gene expression and cellular differentiation.
