# ZNF555

## Overview
ZNF555 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 555, which is categorized as a transcriptional regulator. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression in muscle-committed unipotent cells, such as myoblasts, and is notably expressed at higher levels in these cells compared to pluripotent and multipotent precursors (Kim2015ZNF555). Zinc finger protein 555 plays a significant role in the transcriptional regulation of genes associated with the 4q35 locus, including ANT1 and FRG1, through its interaction with the 4qAe enhancer, which is crucial for muscle function (Kim2015ZNF555). The protein's involvement in facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) has been highlighted, as it interacts with the 4qA-enhancer sequence and the ANT1 promoter, suggesting its potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Kim2015ZNF555). Despite its established functions, the full scope of ZNF555's role in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Function
ZNF555 is a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcriptional regulator, particularly in muscle-committed unipotent cells, such as myoblasts. It is expressed at higher levels in these cells compared to pluripotent and multipotent precursors, indicating a myogenic specificity for its expression (Kim2015ZNF555). ZNF555 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes associated with the 4q35 locus, including ANT1 and FRG1, through its interaction with the 4qAe enhancer. This enhancer is crucial for the transcriptional control of these genes, which are linked to muscle function (Kim2015ZNF555).

The protein binds to the ANT1 promoter in both normal and FSHD-affected myoblasts, suggesting its role in regulating gene expression in muscle cells (Kim2015ZNF555). ZNF555 also shows a strong interaction with DUX4-containing canonical D4Z4 repeats, although its specificity to the 4q35 region is not fully confirmed (Kim2015ZNF555). Despite its significant role in muscle-related gene regulation, the specific function of ZNF555 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, as most studies focus on its implications in facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (Kim2015ZNF555).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF555 has been implicated in several diseases, primarily through its role in transcriptional regulation. In facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), ZNF555 interacts with the 4qAe enhancer and the ANT1 gene promoter, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis. The depletion of ZNF555 affects the transcription of the ANT1 gene in FSHD myoblasts, indicating a potential mechanism through which ZNF555 contributes to FSHD (Kim2015ZNF555). 

ZNF555 is also associated with the regulation of the SLC25A4 gene, which is crucial for muscle function and is linked to the hypersensitivity of FSHD muscles to oxidative stress. Alterations in ZNF555 expression or function could therefore impact muscle health and contribute to musculoskeletal diseases (Mucke2017Patent).

In the context of Burkitt lymphoma, a 'Stopgain' mutation in ZNF555 was identified, although its clinical significance remains uncertain (Penther2019A). Additionally, ZNF555 has been mentioned in studies on migraine susceptibility, though its exact role and significance in this context are not well defined (Cox2012A).

## Interactions
ZNF555 is a zinc finger protein that plays a role in transcriptional regulation, particularly in the context of facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD). It interacts with the 4qA-enhancer sequence, which is associated with the 4q35 region linked to FSHD. This interaction is specific, as demonstrated by DIG-EMSA and mass spectrometry, which identified ZNF555 as a protein that binds specifically to the 4qA-enhancer sequence (Kim2015ZNF555). ZNF555 also binds to the ANT1 promoter in both normal and FSHD individuals, suggesting its involvement in the transcriptional regulation of the ANT1 gene (Kim2015ZNF555).

ZNF555 is associated with transcriptionally active chromatin, marked by H3K9 acetylation, in the 4q35 region. This suggests that ZNF555 may influence gene regulation in FSHD by interacting with chromatin structures (Kim2015ZNF555). The protein also shows a strong interaction with DUX4-containing canonical D4Z4 repeats, although the specificity to the 4q35 region could not be confirmed due to similar repeats elsewhere in the genome (Kim2015ZNF555).

ZNF555 is involved in interactions with KAP1 and SETDB1, rather than ZNF274, indicating its role in transcriptional repression through heterochromatin spreading (Frietze2010ZNF274; Groner2010KRAB–Zinc).
