# PEX12

## Overview
PEX12 is a gene that encodes the peroxisomal biogenesis factor 12, a crucial component of the peroxisomal membrane involved in the import of matrix proteins into peroxisomes. The protein, characterized as a RING-type zinc finger protein, plays a significant role in the ubiquitination and recycling of the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) receptor, PEX5, as part of a ubiquitin ligase complex with PEX2 and PEX10. This process is essential for maintaining peroxisome function, which is vital for various metabolic pathways, including lipid metabolism and detoxification. Mutations in the PEX12 gene are linked to peroxisomal biogenesis disorders, such as Zellweger syndrome spectrum, which manifest in developmental and neurological impairments due to defective peroxisomal function (Chang1999Pex12; Okumoto1998PEX12; Waterham2012Genetics).

## Structure
The PEX12 protein is an integral peroxisomal membrane protein characterized by its two transmembrane segments, which allow both its N-terminal and C-terminal regions to extend into the cytosol (Chang1999Pex12; Okumoto1998PEX12). A key structural feature of PEX12 is its cysteine-rich zinc finger motif, specifically the RING motif, located near the C-terminus. This motif is crucial for the protein's function in peroxisome biogenesis and is involved in interactions with other peroxins, such as PEX5 and PEX10 (Chang1999Pex12; Okumoto1998PEX12).

The RING finger motif of PEX12 is essential for its biological activity, as it facilitates the binding of zinc ions, although PEX12 binds only one Zn2+ ion due to its incomplete C5 RING structure (Prestele2010Different). This motif is also implicated in the protein's role as a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is important for receptor recycling in the peroxisomal matrix protein import process (Prestele2010Different).

Mutations in the zinc-binding domain of PEX12, such as those affecting specific cysteine residues, can impair its function and are linked to peroxisome biogenesis disorders like Zellweger syndrome (Chang1999Pex12; Okumoto1998PEX12). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its role in peroxisomal matrix protein import, acting downstream of receptor docking (Chang1999Pex12).

## Function
The PEX12 gene encodes a peroxisomal membrane protein that is integral to the import machinery for peroxisomal matrix proteins. PEX12 is a zinc-binding RING finger protein that functions as part of a ubiquitin ligase complex, along with PEX2 and PEX10, to facilitate the ubiquitination of PEX5, a receptor protein responsible for transporting peroxisomal matrix proteins to the peroxisomal membrane. This ubiquitination process is crucial for the recycling of PEX5, with mono-ubiquitination promoting recycling and poly-ubiquitination targeting PEX5 for degradation (Waterham2012Genetics; Platta2009Pex2).

PEX12 is located on the peroxisomal membrane and contains two transmembrane segments, with its N- and C-terminal regions exposed to the cytoplasm. The C-terminal region includes a RING finger zinc-binding domain essential for interactions with other peroxins, such as PEX5, PEX10, and PEX19, which are necessary for the import of proteins containing peroxisomal targeting sequences (PTS) into peroxisomes (Zeharia2007A). In healthy human cells, PEX12 plays a critical role in maintaining peroxisome function and integrity, which is vital for various metabolic processes, including lipid metabolism and detoxification (Okumoto1998PEX12; Zeharia2007A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PEX12 gene are associated with peroxisomal biogenesis disorders, particularly Zellweger syndrome spectrum (ZSS), which includes Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and infantile Refsum disease. These disorders are characterized by developmental abnormalities, neurological impairment, and liver dysfunction due to defective peroxisomal function. PEX12 mutations lead to impaired protein import into peroxisomes, resulting in the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids and other metabolites (Okumoto1998PEX12; Konkoľová2015A).

Specific mutations in PEX12, such as point mutations and frameshift mutations, can cause a range of clinical phenotypes from severe to mild. For instance, a novel mutation c.767_768dupAT results in a frameshift and premature termination of the protein, leading to a severe phenotype (Konkoľová2015A). Another mutation, c.102A>T (p.R34S), is associated with a milder clinical phenotype and minimal biochemical abnormalities (Zeharia2007A).

PEX12 is also involved in the monoubiquitination of the PTS1 receptor, Pex5, which is crucial for its recycling. Mutations affecting this process can lead to the accumulation of Pex5 and impaired peroxisomal matrix protein import, further contributing to the clinical manifestations of Zellweger syndrome (Platta2009Pex2).

## Interactions
PEX12 is a peroxisomal membrane protein that plays a crucial role in peroxisomal matrix protein import by interacting with other proteins such as PEX5 and PEX10. PEX12 interacts with PEX5, the PTS1 receptor, through its zinc-binding domain. This interaction is essential for forming a stable complex in vivo, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Chang1999Pex12). The PEX12-binding domain of PEX5 is located in its COOH-terminal half, which contains the PTS1 binding site (Chang1999Pex12).

PEX12 also interacts with PEX10, another protein required for peroxisomal matrix protein import. This interaction is mediated through the zinc ring domains of both PEX12 and PEX10, confirmed by blot overlay experiments and coimmunoprecipitation in vivo (Chang1999Pex12). The PEX12-S320F mutation, located within the zinc-binding domain, reduces the interaction between PEX12 and both PEX5 and PEX10, highlighting the importance of this domain for PEX12's function (Chang1999Pex12).

PEX12, along with PEX2 and PEX10, functions as a RING peroxin involved in the ubiquitination of the PTS1 receptor PEX5. PEX12 specifically facilitates the Pex4-dependent monoubiquitination of PEX5, which is crucial for the receptor's recycling (Platta2009Pex2).
