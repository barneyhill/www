# CEBPZ

## Overview
CEBPZ, or CCAAT enhancer binding protein zeta, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and chromatin architecture. The protein product of CEBPZ is categorized as a transcription factor and plays a critical role in gene expression by interacting with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is involved in the regulation of the mTOR pathway, chromatin structure, and mRNA processing, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular function. CEBPZ has been implicated in several diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia and bladder cancer, where it influences disease progression through its interactions with other proteins such as DGKZ and METTL3. These interactions underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer and other conditions characterized by dysregulated gene expression (Herold2014Isolated; Wu2021Characterization; Ma2024DGKZ).

## Clinical Significance
CEBPZ has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in gene expression regulation. In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CEBPZ has been identified as a novel recurrently mutated gene, particularly in patients with isolated trisomy 13, a subgroup characterized by poor prognosis. These mutations are part of a complex mutational landscape that includes other genes like SRSF2 and RUNX1, suggesting a significant role in the disease's progression (Herold2014Isolated).

In bladder cancer, CEBPZ interacts with Diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKZ) to promote tumor progression. This interaction enhances cell proliferation and metastasis by modulating the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for phosphatidic acid biosynthesis. The DGKZ-CEBPZ interaction is considered a potential therapeutic target due to its significant role in cancer progression (Ma2024DGKZ).

CEBPZ is also involved in oxidative stress and spermatogenesis through its regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways. Its upregulation is linked to conditions such as oligozoospermia, characterized by low sperm count, and may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases due to increased reactive oxygen species production (Sun2021LncRNAs).

## Interactions
CEBPZ (CCAAT enhancer binding protein zeta) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with DGKZ in bladder cancer cells, where this interaction promotes cell proliferation and metastasis by regulating the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and lipid metabolism (Ma2024DGKZ). This interaction is dependent on the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of DGKZ (Ma2024DGKZ).

CEBPZ also interacts with the transcription factor CTCF, affecting chromatin architecture. Depletion of CEBPZ reduces CTCF binding at shared genomic sites, suggesting that CEBPZ may recruit CTCF to specific regions (Wu2021Characterization). CEBPZ is involved in rRNA processing, with its depletion leading to decreased levels of 18S and 28S rRNAs, indicating its role in maintaining rRNA abundance (Wu2021Characterization).

CEBPZ interacts with METTL3, a component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, influencing m6A modification and R-loop formation. This interaction suggests a regulatory role for CEBPZ in mRNA processing and gene expression (Wu2021Characterization). CEBPZ's interactions with these proteins and nucleic acids highlight its multifaceted role in transcriptional regulation and cellular function.
