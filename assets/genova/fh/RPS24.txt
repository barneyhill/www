# RPS24

## Overview
RPS24 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein S24, a crucial component of the 40S ribosomal subunit involved in ribosome biogenesis and function. This protein plays a significant role in the maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursors, particularly in the processing of 18S rRNA, which is essential for the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit. The proper function of ribosomal protein S24 is vital for efficient protein synthesis, cellular growth, and proliferation. Mutations in the RPS24 gene have been linked to Diamond-Blackfan anemia, a genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure and congenital anomalies, underscoring the gene's importance in hematopoiesis and cellular homeostasis (Robledo2008The; Shenoy2012Alterations).

## Structure


## Function
RPS24 is a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, playing a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis and function. In healthy human cells, RPS24 is essential for the maturation of rRNA precursors, particularly in the processing of 18S rRNA, which is a critical component of the small ribosomal subunit. Depletion of RPS24 disrupts the formation of mature 18S rRNA, leading to an accumulation of rRNA processing intermediates and a decrease in mature ribosomes, which affects protein synthesis (Robledo2008The).

RPS24 is active in both the nucleolus and cytoplasm, where it contributes to the assembly and function of ribosomes, facilitating mRNA translation into proteins. This activity is vital for cellular growth and proliferation, as efficient protein production is necessary for these processes (Robledo2008The). The protein's role in ribosome biogenesis is underscored by its involvement in the early stages of rRNA processing, where it ensures the proper synthesis and assembly of ribosomal subunits (Robledo2008The). The stability and function of RPS24 are also influenced by cellular stress conditions, such as hypoxia, where alternative splicing of its mRNA can lead to the production of more stable isoforms that aid in cell survival (Kerry2023Autophagydependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RPS24 gene are associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a rare genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure and congenital anomalies. These mutations impair the pre-RNA processing of 18 S RNA, leading to reduced production of the 40 S ribosomal subunit and mature 80 S ribosomes, which are crucial for effective erythropoiesis (Shenoy2012Alterations). This disruption in ribosome biogenesis results in the failure to produce red blood cells, a hallmark of DBA (Khan2018Identification).

DBA is typically diagnosed in infancy and presents with normochromic macrocytic anemia, reticulocytopenia, and nearly absent erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow (Shi2019Identification). Current treatments for DBA include steroids and chronic blood transfusions, with bone marrow transplantation being the only definitive therapy (Shenoy2012Alterations).

While the RPS24 gene is not directly linked to other specific conditions in the provided context, its role in ribosome biogenesis suggests that alterations in its expression or interactions could potentially impact cellular growth and homeostasis, contributing to various hematologic disorders (Shenoy2012Alterations).

## Interactions
RPS24 is involved in several interactions critical for ribosome biogenesis and rRNA processing. In Arabidopsis, RPS24B interacts with proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, pre-mRNA splicing, and RNA transport. Co-immunoprecipitation assays identified 25 high-confidence nucleolar interactors of RPS24B, including ribosomal proteins and components of the spliceosome, such as PRE-MRNA PROCESSING FACTOR 8 (PRP8) and BAD RESPONSE TO REFRIGERATION2 (BRR2) (Cabezas-Fuster2023Cross-kingdom). These interactions suggest a multifunctional role for RPS24B in RNA metabolism, potentially facilitating the incorporation of ribosome biogenesis factors into pre-rRNA substrates (Cabezas-Fuster2023Cross-kingdom).

In humans, RPS24 is part of the 40S ribosomal subunit and is essential for the maturation of 18S rRNA. Depletion of RPS24 in HeLa cells leads to a decrease in the 41S rRNA precursor and an accumulation of a 30S rRNA processing intermediate, indicating its role in early pre-rRNA processing (Robledo2008The). This depletion also results in a reduction of mature 80S ribosomes and an increase in free 60S subunits, affecting the balance of ribosomal subunits and the production of mature ribosomes (Robledo2008The). These findings highlight the critical role of RPS24 in maintaining ribosome integrity and function.
