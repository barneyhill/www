# SLC27A3

## Overview
SLC27A3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 27 member 3, commonly referred to as fatty acid transport protein 3 (FATP3). This protein is a member of the fatty acid transport proteins (FATP) family, which are integral membrane proteins characterized by their role in the transport and activation of long-chain and very-long-chain fatty acids. FATP3 is distinguished by its transmembrane domain and its involvement in the acyl-CoA activation of fatty acids, a critical step in fatty acid metabolism. The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, adrenal gland, and reproductive organs, highlighting its importance in both metabolic processes and developmental functions. FATP3's activity is essential for cellular energy production and the synthesis of complex lipids, such as ceramides, which are vital for normal neural function and development (Calvo2006Isolation; Korbecki2023Reduced; Maekawa2015Investigation).

## Structure
The SLC27A3 gene encodes the fatty acid transport protein 3 (FATP3), which is involved in the transport and activation of long-chain and very-long-chain fatty acids. FATP3 is a member of the fatty acids transport proteins (FATP) family, characterized by at least one transmembrane domain. The N-terminus of these proteins is positioned on the extracellular side of the membrane, while the C-terminus is on the cytosolic side (PeckaKiełb2020Effects). 

FATP3 contains a highly conserved 311-amino acid sequence known as the AMP-binding protein domain located at the C-terminus, which is common to all adenylate-forming enzymes. This domain is crucial for the protein's acyl-CoA ligase activity, essential for its role in fatty acid metabolism (PeckaKiełb2020Effects). 

The primary structure of FATP3 includes amino acid sequences that facilitate its function, while the secondary structure likely involves alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of membrane proteins. The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding necessary for its activity, although specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided in the available context. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may regulate its function, and splice variants could exist, potentially altering its structure and function. However, specific details on these aspects are not provided in the context.

## Function
SLC27A3, a member of the solute carrier family 27, encodes a protein known as fatty acid transport protein 3 (FATP3), which is involved in the transport and acyl-CoA activation of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) across the plasma membrane. This function is crucial for the metabolism and transport of fatty acids within cells, facilitating their uptake necessary for energy production and cellular processes (Calvo2006Isolation). SLC27A3 is highly expressed in various tissues, including the adrenal gland, testis, ovary, lung, and both neonatal and adult brain, indicating its significant role in brain development, particularly during the fetal stage (Maekawa2015Investigation).

In the context of brain development, SLC27A3 is expressed at higher levels in neurospheres derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, suggesting its involvement in the developmental stage of the central nervous system (Maekawa2015Investigation). Although SLC27A3 does not directly participate in fatty acid uptake, it plays a crucial role in intracellular fatty acid metabolism, particularly in the synthesis of ceramides, as evidenced by experiments on U-87 MG cells (Korbecki2023Reduced). This protein is part of a complex network of enzymes that regulate fatty acid metabolism, contributing to normal neural function and brain development (Korbecki2023Reduced).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC27A3 gene, which encodes a fatty acid transporter, have been implicated in various metabolic disorders. In studies involving male Wistar rats, a high-fat, high-sugar cafeteria diet led to significant upregulation of SLC27A3 in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), which was associated with increased body weight, retroperitoneal fat, and serum triglycerides. This upregulation was linked to DNA hypomethylation at a specific CpG site in the gene's exon 1 region, suggesting that epigenetic changes may contribute to the gene's increased expression and potentially influence adipose tissue expansion and metabolic health (Viraragavan2021Cafeteria).

In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the SLC27A3 gene has been studied for its potential role in neurodevelopmental disorders. Although no direct association between SLC27A3 mutations and ASD was established, the gene's expression in human neural stem cells suggests its involvement in central nervous system development. Variants in SLC27A3 were identified in genetic studies, but their clinical significance in ASD remains unclear (Maekawa2015Investigation).

Overall, while SLC27A3 is implicated in metabolic and neurodevelopmental conditions, further research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target.
