# DNAJC8

## Overview
DNAJC8 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C8, which is part of the Hsp40 family of molecular chaperones. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein folding, assembly, translocation, and degradation. The DNAJC8 gene is expressed in multiple tissues and has been implicated in several biological functions and disease processes. The protein it encodes plays a significant role in stress response mechanisms and has been associated with oncogenic activities, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma and other gastrointestinal cancers. Its expression levels and methylation status have been linked to cancer progression and prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Zhang2024DNAJC8:). Additionally, DNAJC8 is involved in stress responses in non-human organisms, such as honeybees, indicating its broader biological significance (Li2018Environmental).

## Clinical Significance
DNAJC8 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DNAJC8 is upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal liver tissues, and its high expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including reduced overall survival and progression-free survival. DNAJC8 functions as an oncogene in HCC, promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Its expression correlates with advanced tumor stages and vascular invasion, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for HCC (Zhang2024DNAJC8:).

In gastrointestinal cancers, DNAJC8 expression is negatively correlated with promoter methylation, suggesting that methylation status may influence its expression during cancer progression. In colorectal carcinoma, DNAJC8 shows a stage-dependent correlation between methylation and expression, indicating its role in tumor development (Pohl2019Gene).

DNAJC8 is also involved in stress responses in honeybees, where its expression is upregulated under various environmental stresses. This suggests a potential role in stress adaptation, although its direct implications in human diseases related to stress response are not fully understood (Li2018Environmental).
