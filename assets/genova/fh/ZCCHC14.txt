# ZCCHC14

## Overview
ZCCHC14 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCHC-type containing 14 protein, which is characterized by its zinc-binding motif known as a 'Zn-knuckle'. This protein is involved in nucleic acid binding, a common feature of zinc finger proteins, and plays a significant role in RNA stability and viral replication (Hyrina2019A). The protein interacts with other proteins such as TENT4A and TENT4B to generate mixed RNA tails, enhancing mRNA stability, which is crucial in the context of viral infections like Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (Wen2023The). ZCCHC14 is also implicated in various diseases, including gastric cancer and thyroid carcinoma, where it influences cell proliferation, migration, and tumor immunity (Yin2023Differential; Liu2023CircRNA15430). Its role in stabilizing viral RNA and its potential as a therapeutic target in chronic hepatitis B highlight its clinical significance (Hyrina2019A).

## Structure
ZCCHC14 is a protein characterized by the presence of a zinc-binding motif known as a 'Zn-knuckle', which has the form Cys-X2-Cys-X4-His-X4-Cys. This motif is involved in nucleic acid binding, a common feature of zinc finger proteins (Hyrina2019A). The protein is composed of 949 amino acids, indicating a complex primary structure that supports its functional roles in cellular processes (Hyrina2019A). 

While specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ZCCHC14 are not provided in the available context, the presence of zinc finger motifs suggests that the protein likely contains alpha helices and beta sheets, which are typical of such domains. These structural elements facilitate the protein's interaction with nucleic acids and possibly other proteins. 

Post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination have been implicated in the regulation of ZCCHC14's function, particularly in the context of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication, where ubiquitination proteins are involved in the biogenesis of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (Hyrina2019A). However, specific details on other post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Clinical Significance
ZCCHC14 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in RNA binding and regulation. In gastric cancer, ZCCHC14 expression is regulated by the circRNA_15430/miR-382-5p axis. Downregulation of circRNA_15430, often seen in gastric cancer tissues, leads to increased miR-382-5p levels, which in turn reduces ZCCHC14 expression. This reduction is associated with increased tumor size, proliferation, and migration, while suppressing apoptosis and autophagy in gastric cancer cells (Liu2023CircRNA15430). 

In the context of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, ZCCHC14 is identified as a host factor necessary for the production of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). It stabilizes HBsAg expression through HBV RNA tailing, a process that can be disrupted by the small molecule inhibitor RG7834. This suggests that ZCCHC14 could be a potential therapeutic target for chronic hepatitis B (Hyrina2019A).

In thyroid carcinoma, ZCCHC14 is differentially expressed and is positively correlated with several immune cells, indicating its potential role in tumor immunity. However, its specific role in tumor stemness and clinical significance in thyroid carcinoma remains less clear (Yin2023Differential).

## Interactions
ZCCHC14 is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA stability and viral replication. It interacts with TENT4A and TENT4B to generate mixed RNA tails, which include non-adenosine nucleotides, primarily guanosine, enhancing mRNA stability by slowing degradation. This interaction is crucial in the context of viral infections, such as Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV), where ZCCHC14 recognizes specific pentaloops in the viral mRNA's 3' UTR and recruits TENT4A/4B to stabilize viral RNA (Wen2023The).

In Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) replication, ZCCHC14 forms a protein bridge with TENT4A/4B, circularizing HAV RNA and enhancing its replication. This interaction can be disrupted by the TENT4 inhibitor RG7834, which reduces viral RNA synthesis (Wen2023The). ZCCHC14 also interacts with the HSLα structure of HBV mRNA, recruiting PAPD5/7 to the poly(A) tail, protecting it from exonucleases. This interaction is essential for maintaining HBV mRNA stability (Sun2020The).

In gastric cancer, ZCCHC14 is part of a regulatory axis involving circRNA_15430 and miR-382-5p, where it acts as a tumor-inhibiting factor by influencing cell proliferation and migration (Liu2023CircRNA15430).
