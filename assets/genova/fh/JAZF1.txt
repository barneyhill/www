# JAZF1

## Overview
JAZF1 (Juxtaposed with Another Zinc Finger 1) is a gene that encodes the JAZF zinc finger 1 protein, a nuclear transcriptional regulator involved in various biological processes, including glucose and lipid metabolism. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding, and it plays a crucial role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism by interacting with key transcription factors such as PPARγ and SREBP-1c (Wei2018JAZF1; Jeong2021JAZF1). JAZF1 is also implicated in chromatin remodeling through its interaction with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), particularly in the context of endometrial stromal sarcoma (Ma2016The). Clinically, alterations in JAZF1 expression are associated with various conditions, including metabolic disorders, cardiac malformations, and cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Bae2011Overexpression; Chiang2011Cytogenetic).

## Structure
The JAZF1 protein is composed of 243 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 27.0 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.63 (Yang2015Molecular; Guo2021Bioinformatics). Its primary structure includes three ZnF-C2H2 zinc finger domains, which are common in DNA-binding proteins, and two low-complexity regions (Yang2015Molecular; Koontz2001Frequent). The secondary structure of JAZF1 is characterized by coiled regions, seven alpha helices, and random coil regions (Guo2021Bioinformatics). 

The tertiary structure of JAZF1 has been modeled using homology modeling and folding recognition methods, with the latter providing a more reliable prediction (Guo2021Bioinformatics). JAZF1 interacts with the testicular nuclear receptor 4 (TR4) through its TR4-interacting domain, forming an α-helix that binds to a novel surface on TR4, stabilizing a specific tail helix (Liu2023Structures). 

Post-translational modifications of JAZF1 include phosphorylation, with 35 phosphorylation sites identified, and a potential N-glycosylation site, although it may not be glycosylated in vivo due to the absence of a signal peptide (Guo2021Bioinformatics). The protein is expressed in the nucleus and lacks a transmembrane domain (Guo2021Bioinformatics).

## Function
The JAZF1 gene encodes a nuclear protein that plays a significant role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. It functions as a transcriptional regulator, influencing the transcription of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation and maturation. JAZF1 interacts with PPARγ, a key regulator in adipocyte differentiation, and acts as a positive regulator of this process, contrary to previous beliefs that it was a negative regulator (Jeong2021JAZF1).

In the liver, JAZF1 influences lipid metabolism by modulating the transcription of SREBP-1c, a critical transcription factor involved in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. This regulation occurs through an AMPK-dependent mechanism, where JAZF1 overexpression reduces lipid accumulation and the expression of lipogenic genes such as FAS, SCD-1, and ACC-1 (Wei2018JAZF1). JAZF1 also inhibits the transcriptional activity of liver X receptor response elements (LXREs) in the SREBP-1c promoter, further impacting lipid metabolism (Zhou2020Effect).

JAZF1 is highly expressed in adipose tissues and testes, and its expression is crucial for maintaining insulin sensitivity and proper lipid metabolism. It is involved in systemic metabolism, with implications for treating metabolic diseases like obesity and diabetes (Jeong2021JAZF1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the JAZF1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In cardiac health, overexpression of JAZF1 in transgenic mice leads to cardiac malformations, including increased apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, mitochondrial defects, and ventricular non-compaction, which are associated with heart failure and arrhythmias (Bae2011Overexpression). In cancer, JAZF1 is involved in the pathogenesis of endometrial stromal tumors through the JAZF1/JJAZ1 gene fusion, a common molecular event in these tumors (Chiang2011Cytogenetic). This fusion is specific to endometrial stromal tumors and is not found in other types of tumors (Koontz2001Frequent).

In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), JAZF1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation in PTC tissues is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness, while overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis by suppressing the TAK1/NF-κB signaling pathways (JAZF1; Huang2019&lt; p&gt). In gastric cancer, JAZF1 expression is increased and is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis. It is regulated by miR-1275, which inhibits JAZF1 expression, thereby reducing cancer cell migration and invasion (Mei2019MicroRNA1275). These findings highlight the diverse roles of JAZF1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
JAZF1 (JAZF zinc finger 1) is involved in several protein interactions that influence transcriptional regulation. It interacts with the testicular nuclear receptor 4 (TR4), acting as a repressor by binding to a novel interface on TR4. This interaction involves the C-terminal region of TR4 and the TR4-interacting domain (TID) of JAZF1, which stabilizes a specific tail helix, α13, on TR4. This binding blocks coactivators from interacting with TR4, thereby reinforcing its autorepressed conformation and suppressing transcriptional activation (Liu2023Structures).

JAZF1 also forms a fusion protein with SUZ12, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), due to a chromosomal translocation. The JAZF1-SUZ12 fusion protein disrupts PRC2 complexes, impairing chromatin repression by reducing the histone methyltransferase activity of PRC2. This disruption affects the binding of PRC2 to chromatin and destabilizes other PRC2 components like EZH2 and EED, which is significant in the context of endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) carcinogenesis (Ma2016The).

Additionally, JAZF1, also known as ZNF802, interacts with TR4 in the context of erythropoiesis and hemoglobin synthesis, suggesting its role as a transcriptional corepressor (Wongborisuth2022Downregulation).
