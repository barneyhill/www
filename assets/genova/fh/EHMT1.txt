# EHMT1

## Overview
EHMT1, or euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a member of the SET domain-containing methyltransferase family. The EHMT1 protein, also known as G9a-like protein (GLP), plays a pivotal role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by catalyzing the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), a modification associated with transcriptional repression and chromatin condensation (Fear2022CRISPR; Demond2023Multiomics). This protein is characterized by several domains, including a transactivation domain, a cysteine-rich domain, an ankyrin repeat domain, and a SET domain, which is responsible for its methyltransferase activity (Chi2023A). EHMT1 is involved in various biological processes, including neuronal development, oocyte maturation, and the DNA damage response, where it interacts with other proteins to maintain genome integrity (Watanabe2018MDC1; Demond2023Multiomics). Mutations in the EHMT1 gene are linked to Kleefstra syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Mitra2016A; Balemans2012Hippocampal).

## Structure
The EHMT1 protein, also known as G9a-like protein (GLP), is a member of the SET domain-containing methyltransferase family and consists of 1298 amino acids. It features several distinctive domains, including a transactivation domain at the N-terminus, a cysteine-rich domain, an ankyrin repeat domain, and the enzymatic SET domain at the C-terminus (Chi2023A). The ankyrin repeat domain is crucial for the protein's scaffolding function and is involved in recognizing histone modifications, specifically H3K9me1 and H3K9me2, which are important for gene and epigenome regulation (Chi2023A; Blackburn2017A).

The SET domain is responsible for the methyltransferase activity of EHMT1, catalyzing the mono- and di-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9, a key process in gene silencing (Chi2023A). The protein's structure includes ankyrin repeats, each consisting of an outer and an inner helix, with the inner helix beginning with a proline or cysteine followed by a conserved TPLX motif (Blackburn2017A). This motif is essential for the structural stability of the ankyrin repeat domain, contributing to the helix-turn-helix conformation (Blackburn2017A).

EHMT1 can form homo- and hetero-dimer functional units through interactions in the pre-SET region, which contains a structural zinc ion cluster (Chi2023A). The protein may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its function and interactions.

## Function
EHMT1, also known as euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 1, is a crucial enzyme involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. It primarily functions by adding methyl groups to lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9), a modification associated with transcriptional repression and chromatin condensation (Fear2022CRISPR; Demond2023Multiomics). EHMT1 forms a complex with EHMT2, another histone methyltransferase, to regulate gene expression through H3K9 mono- and di-methylation, which is essential for maintaining proper chromatin structure and gene expression patterns (Fear2022CRISPR; Demond2023Multiomics).

In healthy human cells, EHMT1 is vital for normal neuronal development and differentiation. It plays a significant role in transcriptional repression during oogenesis, contributing to local transcriptional repression in oocytes and is critical for oocyte maturation and developmental competence (Demond2023Multiomics). EHMT1 is also involved in the DNA damage response, where it interacts with MDC1 to regulate the accumulation of activated ATM around DNA damage sites, thereby maintaining genome integrity (Watanabe2018MDC1). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, influencing gene expression patterns critical for normal cellular function and development (Fear2022CRISPR).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EHMT1 gene are primarily associated with Kleefstra syndrome (KS), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, hypotonia, distinctive facial features, and sometimes autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Mitra2016A; Bonati20199q34.3; Balemans2012Hippocampal). KS is caused by haploinsufficiency of EHMT1, which can result from either pathogenic variants or deletions in the gene (Blackburn2017A; Goodman2020EHMT1).

EHMT1 mutations can also lead to other conditions, including schizophrenia and ASD, suggesting a broader phenotypic spectrum (Blackburn2017A). In some cases, specific variants such as p.P809L have been identified, which affect the protein's structure and function, contributing to the pathogenesis of KS (Blackburn2017A).

Alterations in EHMT1 expression levels, such as those caused by 9q34.3 microduplications, can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders with symptoms overlapping KS, including developmental delays and behavioral problems (Bonati20199q34.3). These findings underscore the critical role of EHMT1 in maintaining normal cognitive and developmental processes.

## Interactions
EHMT1, also known as euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. EHMT1 forms a trimeric complex with EHMT2 (G9a) and WIS, which plays a role in maintaining epigenetic states by reading and writing the H3K9me2 histone mark. This complex interacts with histone code reader proteins HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ, which recruit SUVARH1 to convert H3K9me2 into H3K9me3, leading to transcriptional repression through heterochromatin formation (Blackburn2017A).

EHMT1 also interacts with MDC1, a key chromatin adaptor in the DNA damage response (DDR). This interaction is enhanced upon DNA damage and is facilitated by ATM activation. EHMT1, along with EHMT2, methylates MDC1, which is crucial for the recruitment of downstream repair factors to DNA damage sites (Watanabe2018MDC1).

In the context of viral infections, EHMT1 is recruited to sites of Sendai virus genomic RNA replication, where it becomes part of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex. EHMT1 interacts with the Nucleoprotein (N) and Phosphoprotein (P) of the virus, facilitating viral replication through methylation processes (Biligiri2023Phase).
