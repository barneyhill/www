# FABP12

## Overview
Fatty acid binding protein 12 (FABP12) is a gene that encodes a member of the fatty acid binding protein family, which is involved in the intracellular transport of fatty acids and other lipophilic substances. The protein encoded by FABP12, also known as fatty acid binding protein 12, plays a critical role in lipid metabolism and is implicated in the progression of prostate cancer (PCa). It functions by interacting with nuclear receptors such as PPARγ, influencing pathways that promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastatic transformation in cancer cells. The expression of FABP12 is notably elevated in prostate cancer tissues, correlating with aggressive cancer phenotypes and poorer patient outcomes. Due to its significant role in cancer biology, FABP12 is being explored as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a target for therapeutic intervention in prostate cancer (Liu2020The; ALBayati2017Increased).

## Clinical Significance
FABP12 has been implicated in the progression of prostate cancer (PCa). Studies have shown that FABP12 expression is significantly increased in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) cases. This elevated expression correlates with higher Gleason scores, indicating more aggressive cancer, and is associated with shorter patient survival times (ALBayati2017Increased). The overexpression of FABP12 is suggested to promote malignant progression by enhancing cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation. This is potentially due to its role in transporting fatty acids and interacting with the PPARγ pathway, which is involved in lipid metabolism and cancer progression (ALBayati2017Increased).

FABP12's expression levels have been proposed as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for prostate cancer, potentially offering a more accurate predictor of patient outcomes than traditional markers like the androgen receptor index or prostate-specific antigen levels (ALBayati2017Increased). The study suggests that targeting FABP12 with specific inhibitors could serve as a therapeutic strategy for treating prostate cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in the context of cancer progression (ALBayati2017Increased).

## Interactions
FABP12 interacts with the nuclear receptor PPARγ, playing a significant role in prostate cancer (PCa) progression. This interaction is crucial for the activation of PPARγ, which is involved in lipid metabolism and the induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PCa cells. FABP12 facilitates PPARγ-specific binding to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response elements (PPREs), as demonstrated by gel shift experiments, and enhances PPRE-driven luciferase activity, indicating transcriptional activation (Liu2020The).

FABP12 also interacts with the EMT-inducing factor Slug, enhancing cell motility and EMT in PCa cells. Inhibition of FABP12 reduces Slug expression and cell motility, suggesting that Slug acts as a downstream effector of FABP12 (Liu2020The). The interaction between FABP12 and PPARγ is significant, as PPARγ inhibition reverses the effects of FABP12 on cell migration and Slug induction (Liu2020The).

These interactions highlight FABP12's role in promoting metastatic transformation in PCa by affecting lipid metabolism and energy production, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target in PCa intervention (Liu2020The; ALBayati2017Increased).
