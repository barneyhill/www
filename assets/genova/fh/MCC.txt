# MCC

## Overview
The MCC gene encodes the MCC regulator of WNT signaling pathway, a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation and the modulation of the WNT signaling pathway. This protein, composed of 829 amino acids, is involved in various cellular processes, including tumor suppression, cell migration, and cell proliferation. It functions primarily by inhibiting beta-catenin transcriptional activity, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor independent of the APC gene, which is frequently mutated in colorectal cancer (Pangon2014MCC; Matsumine1996MCC). The MCC protein interacts with several other proteins, such as Scrib and DBC1, through its PDZ-binding motif, influencing its localization and function within the cell (Pangon2014MCC; Arnaud2009MCC). Clinically, alterations in MCC expression or function are associated with colorectal cancer, particularly in cases characterized by promoter hypermethylation, and may serve as a predictive biomarker for therapeutic responses (Jahan2022MCC).

## Structure
The MCC protein is a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein involved in cell cycle regulation and WNT signaling. It is composed of 829 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 100 kDa (Matsumine1996MCC). The protein lacks membrane-spanning regions or nuclear localization signals, indicating its cytoplasmic localization (Matsumine1996MCC). MCC contains heptad repeats throughout its length, suggesting a potential for forming coiled-coil structures, although it does not form homodimers or heterodimers with the APC protein (Matsumine1996MCC).

MCC features a PDZ-binding motif at its carboxy-terminus, which is crucial for interactions with proteins like Scrib. This motif is phosphorylated at serine 828, enhancing its binding affinity with Scrib and playing a role in cell migration (Pangon2012The). The protein undergoes phosphorylation, with its phosphorylation state changing during the cell cycle, being weakly phosphorylated in G0/G1 and highly phosphorylated during the G1 to S transition (Matsumine1996MCC).

The MCC gene produces two major mRNA isoforms, encoding proteins of 1019 and 829 amino acids, both containing the PDZ-binding motif ETSL at the carboxy-terminus (Arnaud2009MCC). These isoforms result from alternative promoter usage, leading to differences at their N-termini (Young2014The).

## Function
The MCC gene encodes a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in regulating the WNT signaling pathway, particularly by modulating beta-catenin (b-cat) transcriptional activity. In healthy human cells, MCC acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting b-cat signaling, which is crucial for maintaining normal cellular processes and preventing tumorigenesis. This inhibition is achieved through the sequestration of DBC1 (Deleted in Breast Cancer 1) in the cytoplasm, preventing it from promoting b-cat activity in the nucleus (Pangon2014MCC).

MCC's repression of b-cat signaling is independent of the APC gene, which is commonly mutated in colorectal cancer. The protein's ability to inhibit b-cat transcriptional activity is impaired by mutations such as R506Q, highlighting its role in tumor suppression (Pangon2014MCC). MCC also plays a role in cell cycle regulation by blocking the transition from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase, thereby acting as a negative regulator of cell proliferation (Matsumine1996MCC).

Additionally, MCC is involved in cell migration, interacting with the protein Scrib through its PDZ-binding motif, which is crucial for its localization to the plasma membrane and the formation of lamellipodia in colon epithelial cells (Pangon2012The; Arnaud2009MCC).

## Clinical Significance
The MCC gene, known as the "MCC regulator of WNT signaling pathway," plays a significant role in colorectal cancer. Its silencing, often due to promoter hypermethylation, is prevalent in colorectal cancers, particularly those with the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) (Jahan2022MCC). This silencing is associated with increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents like irinotecan and PARP inhibitors such as Olaparib, suggesting its potential as a predictive biomarker for therapy responsiveness (Jahan2022MCC). 

In mouse models, MCC deficiency has been linked to impaired DNA repair mechanisms and increased genomic instability, contributing to cancer development. The loss of MCC expression leads to down-regulation of DNA repair pathways, including mismatch repair and homologous recombination repair, which are crucial for maintaining genomic integrity (Currey2019Mouse). This deficiency also results in increased DNA damage and altered inflammatory responses, promoting carcinogenesis in inflamed tissues (Currey2019Mouse).

MCC mutations or expression alterations are significant in the early stages of colorectal cancer development, particularly in the context of inflammation-associated carcinogenesis. These alterations are associated with sessile serrated polyps and may contribute to the progression of premalignant tumors (Currey2019Mouse).

## Interactions
The MCC protein, known as MCC regulator of WNT signaling pathway, engages in several significant protein-protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. MCC interacts with Scrib, a tumor suppressor protein, through its PDZ-binding motif. This interaction is primarily with the third PDZ domain of Scrib and is essential for MCC's localization at the cell membrane (Arnaud2009MCC). MCC also interacts with other PDZ domain-containing proteins such as Snx27 and NHERF1/2, which are scaffold proteins capable of forming complexes with Ezrin (Arnaud2009MCC).

In the context of WNT signaling, MCC interacts with β-catenin, inhibiting its transcriptional activity by sequestering DBC1 in the cytoplasm. This interaction prevents DBC1 from promoting β-catenin transcriptional activity, acting as a tumor suppressor mechanism independent of the APC gene (Pangon2014MCC). MCC's interaction with DBC1 is crucial for its ability to repress β-catenin activity, and mutations in MCC, such as R506Q, can disrupt this interaction (Pangon2014MCC). MCC also interacts with the Vangl2 cytoplasmic tail, linking it to non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways (Young2014The).
