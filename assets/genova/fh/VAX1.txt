# VAX1

## Overview
VAX1 is a gene that encodes the ventral anterior homeobox 1 protein, a member of the homeodomain transcription factor family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the development of the ventral forebrain and visual system, influencing neural precursor cell proliferation and differentiation. As a transcription factor, VAX1 is involved in regulating gene expression critical for tissue specification during embryonic development. The protein is characterized by a DNA-binding paired-type homeodomain, which facilitates its interaction with specific DNA sequences. Beyond its transcriptional activities, VAX1 also functions extracellularly, promoting axonal growth in retinal ganglion cells through interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Mutations in the VAX1 gene have been linked to developmental disorders such as microphthalmia and nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate, underscoring its significance in craniofacial and neural development (Slavotinek2011VAX1mutation; Bertuzzi1999The; Kim2014Regulation).

## Structure
The VAX1 protein is a member of the ANTP class of homeobox genes and contains a DNA-binding paired-type homeodomain, which is crucial for its function as a transcription factor (Markitantova2020Inherited). The homeodomain is a well-conserved region that typically forms a helix-turn-helix structure, allowing the protein to bind to specific DNA sequences. This domain is essential for the regulation of genes involved in tissue specification during early embryonic development (Nasser2012Resequencing).

VAX1 is known to have at least two isoforms, a long and a short one, which differ in their C-terminal sequences. The long isoform includes a C-terminal region that is 192 amino acids long, while the short isoform has a C-terminal region of 44 amino acids. Both isoforms share the first 142 amino acids (Nasser2012Resequencing). The long isoform is particularly associated with craniofacial development and has been implicated in nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) (Nasser2012Resequencing).

The VAX1 protein can be secreted and internalized by retinal ganglion cell axons, where it promotes axonal growth. This function is independent of its transcriptional activity and involves interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (Kim2014Regulation). The protein's ability to penetrate cells and stimulate local protein synthesis in axons suggests a role beyond traditional transcription factor activity (Kim2014Regulation).

## Function
The VAX1 gene encodes a homeodomain transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development of the ventral forebrain and visual system. In healthy human cells, VAX1 is involved in regulating neural precursor cell proliferation and differentiation. It acts as a negative regulator of stem cell proliferation, particularly during mid-embryogenesis, ensuring proper differentiation and organization of neural structures (Soria2004Defective). VAX1 is expressed in various ventral-medial forebrain-derived structures and is essential for the development of the optic chiasm by promoting retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon growth. This function is independent of its transcription factor activity, as VAX1 is secreted and acts extracellularly to stimulate axonal growth (Kim2014Regulation).

VAX1 also plays a role in axon guidance and the formation of major tracts in the developing forebrain. It is expressed in specific cells at the ventral anterior midline of the embryonic central nervous system, influencing the expression of guidance cues necessary for proper axon pathfinding (Bertuzzi1999The). In the absence of VAX1, there are significant defects in axon pathfinding and tract formation, highlighting its importance in neural development (Bertuzzi1999The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VAX1 gene are associated with several developmental disorders. A homozygous mutation, p.Arg152Ser, has been linked to severe microphthalmia, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and cleft palate in humans. This mutation is considered pathogenic due to its absence in control individuals and its segregation with the disease phenotype. It likely causes microphthalmia through a loss of function, potentially by failing to produce dnTCF7L2, leading to hyperactivation of the Wnt signaling pathway (Slavotinek2011VAX1mutation).

VAX1 is also implicated in nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P). Genome-wide association studies have identified significant associations between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VAX1, such as rs7078160, and NSCL/P in various populations, including Mongolian, Japanese, Filipino, and Chinese groups (Sabbagh2019Molecular; You2022Target; Butali2013Replication). These SNPs may influence transcription factor binding and expression of genes involved in craniofacial development (You2022Target).

In animal models, Vax1 null mutant mice exhibit phenotypes similar to those observed in humans, including brain malformations and craniofacial defects, reinforcing the gene's role in these developmental processes (Slavotinek2011VAX1mutation; Geoghegan2017Vax1).

## Interactions
VAX1 is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in development. It acts as a transcription factor, interacting with other transcriptional machinery components to regulate gene expression. VAX1 negatively regulates Pax6 during olfactory bulb neurogenesis by inducing the expression of miR-7, a microRNA that post-transcriptionally inhibits Pax6 protein expression. This interaction confines the generation of dopaminergic neurons to specific regions (Coré2020Stem).

In the context of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon growth, VAX1 interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the surface of RGCs. This interaction is necessary for VAX1's growth-stimulatory effects, as it allows VAX1 to penetrate RGC axons and stimulate local protein synthesis, which is crucial for axonal growth (Kim2014Regulation). VAX1 also binds to the extracellular domain of syndecan, a transmembrane HSPG, in mouse optic nerves and human embryonic kidney cells, highlighting its role in modulating intercellular protein transfer (Kim2014Regulation).

VAX1's interaction with Gsx2 in the subpallium is another example of its regulatory role. VAX1 represses Gsx2 expression, which is crucial for proper subpallium development, as evidenced by increased Gsx2 expression in VAX1 knockout mice (Wen2021Transcription).
