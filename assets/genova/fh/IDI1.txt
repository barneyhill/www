# IDI1

## Overview
The IDI1 gene encodes the enzyme isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase 1, a critical component of the mevalonate pathway, which is essential for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids. This enzyme is classified as an isomerase and is responsible for the conversion of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), both of which are vital precursors in the synthesis of cholesterol, steroid hormones, and other isoprenoids (Fang2018Idi1; Clizbe2007IDI2). IDI1 is predominantly active in the cytosol and is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and liver, highlighting its role in cellular growth, maintenance, and lipid homeostasis (Nakamura2015Isopentenyl). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of cellular membranes, particularly in the liver, where it plays a significant role in cholesterol metabolism and transport (Yan2023The).

## Function
The IDI1 gene encodes the enzyme isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase 1, which plays a crucial role in the mevalonate pathway, a key metabolic pathway responsible for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids. This enzyme catalyzes the isomerization of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which are essential precursors for the synthesis of cholesterol, steroid hormones, and other isoprenoids (Fang2018Idi1; Clizbe2007IDI2). IDI1 is active in the cytosol and is involved in cellular growth and maintenance, contributing to the production of lipophilic molecules such as sterols, ubiquinones, and terpenoids (Fang2018Idi1; Nakamura2015Isopentenyl).

In healthy human cells, IDI1 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver, indicating its widespread role in cholesterol synthesis and cellular metabolism (Nakamura2015Isopentenyl). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining lipid homeostasis and supporting the structural and functional integrity of cellular membranes. IDI1's involvement in cholesterol metabolism is particularly significant in the liver, where it contributes to the regulation of cholesterol synthesis and transport (Yan2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IDI1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), IDI1 is found to be localized in the core of Lewy bodies, where it may interact with α-synuclein, potentially contributing to the formation of these pathological structures (Nakamura2015Isopentenyl). This suggests that IDI1 may play a role in the biochemical environment that promotes α-synuclein aggregation, a key process in the pathogenesis of these diseases (Nakamura2015Isopentenyl).

In the context of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS), a segmental copy-number gain in the region of the IDI1 gene has been identified, suggesting a strong association with the disease. This genetic alteration may contribute to the risk of developing SALS by affecting motor neuron degeneration (Kato2010Segmental).

In cardiac conditions, mechanical stress has been shown to upregulate IDI1 expression in atrial myocytes, which may influence cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid metabolism. This upregulation is associated with atrial lipotoxic myopathy, a condition linked to atrial enlargement and heart failure progression in patients with mitral regurgitation (Fang2018Idi1).
