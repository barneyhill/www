# SHC1

## Overview
The SHC1 gene encodes SHC adaptor protein 1, a critical component in cellular signaling pathways. This gene produces several isoforms, including p46Shc, p52Shc, and p66Shc, which function as adaptor proteins facilitating signal transduction from receptor tyrosine kinases to downstream pathways such as RAS/MAPK and PI3K. These pathways are essential for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Mir2020Structurefunctional; Chen2022PanCancer). The SHC1 protein is characterized by its modular structure, featuring phosphotyrosine-binding domains that enable interactions with phosphorylated tyrosine residues on growth factor receptors, thus acting as a scaffold in signaling pathways (Blaikie1994A). The p66Shc isoform is particularly notable for its role in oxidative stress response and apoptosis, contributing to cell senescence and the regulation of reactive oxygen species (Chen2022PanCancer). SHC1's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in cancer progression and therapy (Guo2024SHC1; Chen2022PanCancer).

## Structure
The SHC1 gene encodes several protein isoforms, including p66Shc, p52Shc, and p46Shc, which are involved in cellular signaling pathways. These isoforms share a modular structure characterized by two phosphotyrosine-binding domains: a PTB domain at the amino-terminal and an SH2 domain at the carboxy-terminal, separated by a glycine/proline-rich region known as the Collagen Homology domain 1 (CH1) (Luzi2011SHC1). The CH1 domain contains key tyrosine residues (Y239, Y240, Y317) that are phosphorylated upon activation by cell surface receptors, playing a crucial role in signal transduction (Chen2024Dissecting; Luzi2011SHC1).

The p66Shc isoform includes an additional glycine/proline-rich region called CH2, which is phosphorylated on serine 36 in response to oxidative stress and contains a 'redox centre' essential for regulating reactive oxygen species (Luzi2011SHC1). The SHC1 protein isoforms are involved in assembling protein complexes in receptor tyrosine kinases and immunoreceptors, with phosphorylation-dependent interactions critical for their function (Chen2024Dissecting).

The SHC1 protein's structure facilitates its role as a scaffold in signaling pathways, with its domains enabling interactions with phosphorylated tyrosine residues on growth factor receptors (Blaikie1994A). The protein's modular organization and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are vital for its involvement in cellular processes like proliferation and apoptosis (Luzi2011SHC1).

## Function
The SHC1 gene encodes a family of adaptor proteins, including the isoforms p46Shc, p52Shc, and p66Shc, which play crucial roles in signal transduction and cellular communication. These proteins are involved in transmitting signals from receptor tyrosine kinases to downstream signaling pathways, such as the RAS/MAPK and PI3K pathways, which are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Mir2020Structurefunctional; Chen2022PanCancer). 

In healthy human cells, SHC1 proteins are active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where they contribute to maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to external stimuli (Chen2022PanCancer). The p52Shc and p46Shc isoforms are universally expressed and are particularly involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation (Chen2022PanCancer). The p66Shc isoform, although expressed at different levels in various tissues, is associated with oxidative stress and apoptosis, playing a role in cell senescence and the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Mir2020Structurefunctional; Chen2022PanCancer). 

Overall, SHC1 proteins are integral to normal cellular signaling and function, influencing pathways that control cell proliferation and survival, thereby contributing to the maintenance of cellular functions in healthy human cells (Chen2022PanCancer).

## Clinical Significance
The SHC1 gene, encoding SHC adaptor protein 1, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), SHC1 is significantly overexpressed compared to normal tissues, correlating with worse cancer stages and serving as an independent prognostic indicator for overall survival (Guo2024SHC1). High SHC1 expression is also linked to poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), where it is associated with poorer overall survival (Liang2021The).

SHC1 is involved in pathways related to extracellular matrix organization, focal adhesion, and immune responses, contributing to tumor progression and immune evasion (Guo2024SHC1). It is also implicated in tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, crucial for tumor growth, and is associated with immune cell infiltration, particularly macrophages, which are linked to immunosuppression and poor prognosis in cancers like breast cancer (Chen2022PanCancer). SHC1's expression and methylation status are important factors in the prognosis of lung cancer, with specific methylation changes linked to survival outcomes (Liang2021The). These findings suggest SHC1 as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy and a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in various cancers.

## Interactions
SHC1 (SHC adaptor protein 1) is a key player in signal transduction pathways, interacting with various proteins to mediate cellular responses. It contains a CH1 region with conserved phosphotyrosine sites at positions 239, 240, and 313, which are crucial for its function in signaling pathways (Chen2024Dissecting). The phosphorylation of tyrosine residues Y239 and Y240 is essential for SHC1's interaction with the SH2 domain of Grb2, facilitating the assembly of protein complexes involved in the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway (van1996The). These sites are phosphorylated by Src kinase and the EGF receptor, highlighting their role in signal transduction (van1996The).

SHC1 also interacts with proteins involved in lipid signaling, such as Plcg1 and Plcg2, through phosphorylation at Y313 and S335, which are associated with the recruitment of negative regulators of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling (Chen2024Dissecting). In the context of cancer, SHC1's interactions with proteins like GRB7 and PIK3R1/2/3 are significant for RTK signaling networks, particularly in breast cancer cell lines (Chen2024Dissecting). These interactions underscore SHC1's role in diverse signaling pathways, influencing cell proliferation and survival.
