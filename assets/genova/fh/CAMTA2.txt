# CAMTA2

## Overview
CAMTA2, or calmodulin-binding transcription activator 2, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in cardiac and neurological contexts. The protein product of CAMTA2 is characterized by its ability to bind calmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein, which influences its activity in response to calcium signals. As a transcription activator, CAMTA2 plays a crucial role in cardiac growth and hypertrophy by interacting with specific DNA sequences and other transcription factors, such as Nkx2.5, to regulate cardiac gene expression (Finkler2007CAMTAs:). Additionally, CAMTA2 is implicated in various clinical conditions, including left ventricular hypertrophy, neurological disorders, and cancer, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological processes (Song2016A; Monies2017Identification; Luan2019The).

## Structure
CAMTA2 is a protein characterized by several conserved domains that contribute to its function as a transcription activator. It contains nuclear localization signals (NLS) and nuclear export signals (NES), which are crucial for its transport into and out of the nucleus. In humans, the NLS is located at the C-terminus, while the NES is at the N-terminus (Finkler2007CAMTAs:). The protein features a unique DNA-binding domain known as CG-1, which interacts with specific DNA sequences and the homeodomain of the Nkx2.5 transcription factor, playing a role in cardiac gene regulation (Finkler2007CAMTAs:).

CAMTA2 also includes TIG domains, which are involved in nonspecific DNA contacts and protein dimerization, and ankyrin (ANK) repeats that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Finkler2007CAMTAs:). The ANK domain interacts with class II histone deacetylase (HDAC5), influencing cardiac growth through transcriptional regulation (Finkler2007CAMTAs:). The presence of IQ motifs suggests a role in binding calmodulin and related proteins (Finkler2007CAMTAs:). While the context does not provide detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, it notes the potential for CAMTA2 to form homo- and hetero-dimers, which may have functional implications (Finkler2007CAMTAs:).

## Function
CAMTA2 (calmodulin-binding transcription activator 2) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation in human cells. It is involved in cardiac growth, particularly in promoting hypertrophy through the transcriptional reprogramming of cardiac gene expression. This process is mediated by the interaction of CAMTA2's CG-1 domain with the homeodomain of the Nkx2.5 transcription factor, which binds to the NKE cis-element of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene, a marker of cardiac hypertrophy (Finkler2007CAMTAs:). CAMTA2's activity is modulated by calcium (Ca2+) and calmodulin, with Ca2+ signals influencing its transcriptional activity (Finkler2007CAMTAs:).

CAMTA2 is also involved in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with class II histone deacetylase (HDAC5). When HDAC5 is phosphorylated in response to signals from protein kinases C and D (PKC/PKD), it is exported from the nucleus, relieving the repression of CAMTA2 and allowing it to activate cardiac genes (Finkler2007CAMTAs:). This regulatory mechanism highlights CAMTA2's role in cardiac growth and function, suggesting its importance in heart development and physiological processes (Finkler2007CAMTAs:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CAMTA2 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. A functional variant in the coding region of CAMTA2, specifically the Ala-267 to Pro-267 mutation, is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). This mutation affects the activation of NKX2.5-dependent transcription, leading to increased cardiac growth and hypertrophy, particularly in individuals with hypertension (Song2016A).

In the context of neurological disorders, a homoallelic hypomorphic mutation (c.-6G>A) in the 5′UTR of CAMTA2 transcript variant 2 has been identified in a syndromic form of tremulous dystonia, known as Bohlega Syndrome. This mutation affects protein translation and is associated with symptoms such as dystonia, tremor, spasticity, and white matter disease, suggesting a post-transcriptional impact on CAMTA2's function in the brain (Monies2017Identification).

CAMTA2 is also implicated in cancer progression. In colon cancer, CAMTA2 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. It is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation and metastasis. The miR-28-5p/CAMTA2 axis plays a critical role in this process, with miR-28-5p acting as a tumor suppressor by downregulating CAMTA2 expression (Luan2019The).
