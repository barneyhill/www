# ATG2B

## Overview
ATG2B is a gene that encodes the autophagy-related protein 2B, which plays a pivotal role in the cellular autophagy process. This protein is integral to the formation and elongation of autophagosomes, vesicular structures that sequester and degrade cellular debris, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to metabolic stress. ATG2B is characterized as a cytoplasmic protein involved in lipid transfer and membrane tethering, essential for the expansion of the isolation membrane during autophagy. It interacts with WDR45, a member of the WIPI protein family, and is recruited to preautophagosomal membranes by TRAPPC11, facilitating its function in autophagosome maturation. Mutations in ATG2B have been linked to various myeloid malignancies and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in disease pathogenesis and potential as a prognostic marker (Levine2019Biological; Stanga2019TRAPPC11; BellannéChantelot2020Germline).

## Structure
The ATG2B protein is characterized by a club-shaped structure when in complex with WDR45, featuring a bar-shaped main body attributed to ATG2B and a smaller globular density at one end associated with WDR45 (Zheng2017Architecture). The ATG2B protein alone appears as an elongated bar, confirming its rod-like structure (Zheng2017Architecture). The protein contains a conserved aromatic Y/HF motif crucial for binding to WDR45, with specific phenylalanine (F) and tyrosine (Y) residues being highly conserved across species (Zheng2017Architecture). 

ATG2B shares structural similarities with ATG2A, including the presence of conserved domains such as Chorein_N and ATG_C, which are also found in VPS13-family proteins (Zheng2017Architecture). These domains are essential for its function in autophagy, particularly in lipid transfer and membrane tethering activities (Osawa2019Human). The protein's lipid transfer activity is enhanced by negatively charged lipids and the presence of WIPI4, a human ortholog of Atg18 (Osawa2019Human). Despite these insights, detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of ATG2B is not provided in the available sources.

## Function
ATG2B is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the autophagy process, a critical cellular mechanism for degrading and recycling cellular components. In healthy human cells, ATG2B plays a significant role in the formation and elongation of autophagosomes, which are vesicles that engulf cellular debris for degradation. The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly during nutrient deprivation (Levine2019Biological).

ATG2B functions in the early stages of autophagosome membrane elongation, contributing to the autophagic process by interacting with WIPI proteins at the site of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) generation. This interaction is crucial for the proper expansion of the isolation membrane, a key step in autophagy (Levine2019Biological). The recruitment of ATG2B to preautophagosomal membranes is facilitated by TRAPPC11, which is necessary for the proper localization and function of ATG2B in autophagosome formation (Stanga2019TRAPPC11).

The protein's role in autophagy is vital for cellular responses to metabolic stress and maintaining organellar quality control, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal health (Levine2019Biological).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATG2B gene are associated with several myeloid malignancies and cancers. A germline structural variant involving ATG2B, along with GSKIP, has been identified in families with a high incidence of myeloid disorders, including myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This variant is a 700 kb copy-number variation on chromosome 14q32.13-q32.2, which is associated with a high penetrance of these conditions (Saliba2015Germline; BellannéChantelot2020Germline).

In gastric and colorectal cancers, frameshift mutations in ATG2B have been identified, particularly in cancers with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H). These mutations lead to premature stops in amino acid synthesis, resulting in loss-of-function and potentially inactivating autophagy, which may contribute to cancer pathogenesis (Kang2009Frameshift).

Additionally, the ATG2B rs17094017 polymorphism has been linked to the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The presence of the T allele is associated with improved overall survival and progression-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Yu2022Genetic).

## Interactions
ATG2B is involved in several critical interactions within the autophagy pathway. It forms a complex with WDR45 (also known as WIPI4), which is essential for autophagosome maturation. The interaction between ATG2B and WDR45 is mediated by a specific 33-amino acid peptide in ATG2B, with the aromatic Y/HF motif playing a crucial role in binding. Mutations in this motif significantly impair the interaction, highlighting its importance (Zheng2017Architecture). 

ATG2B also interacts with TRAPPC11, a component of the TRAPP III complex, which is involved in recruiting ATG2B and WIPI4 to preautophagosomal membranes. This recruitment is crucial for the elongation and sealing of isolation membranes into autophagosomes. The carboxy-terminus of TRAPPC11 is important for this interaction, and mutations in TRAPPC11 can lead to defects in autophagic flux due to impaired recruitment of ATG2B and WIPI4 (Stanga2019TRAPPC11).

ATG2B's lipid transfer activity is enhanced by negatively charged lipids and the presence of WIPI4, indicating a conserved role of Atg18-family proteins in supporting ATG2B's function in autophagy (Osawa2019Human). These interactions underscore ATG2B's role in the autophagic process, particularly in membrane dynamics and protein complex formation.
