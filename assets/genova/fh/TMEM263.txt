# TMEM263

## Overview
TMEM263 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 263, a highly conserved protein across species, which plays a crucial role in growth and bone development. This protein is characterized by its multi-pass membrane structure, featuring two transmembrane domains, and is localized to the plasma membrane, suggesting its function as an integral membrane protein involved in signal transduction and cellular transport (Wu2018A; Sarver2024Tmem263). TMEM263 is implicated in the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) axis and interacts with key proteins such as growth hormone 1 (GH1) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), indicating its role in regulating bone mineral density and osteoblast activity (Wu2018A). Mutations in TMEM263 have been associated with growth-related disorders, including skeletal dysplasia and autosomal dwarfism, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining normal physiological processes related to growth and skeletal development (Wu2018A; Sarver2024Tmem263).

## Structure
The TMEM263 protein is a transmembrane protein predicted to have a multi-pass membrane structure, featuring two transmembrane domains located between amino acid positions 38-60 and 80-102 (Wu2018A). The protein includes an intracellular N- and C-terminus and an extracellular loop, suggesting a complex arrangement typical of transmembrane proteins (Wu2018A). The TMEM263 protein is highly conserved across various species, with a protein sequence identity of 89% when compared to the human homologous protein, indicating the importance of its structure for function (Wu2018A).

A nonsense mutation in the TMEM263 gene, identified in autosomal dwarf chickens, results in a truncated protein that only contains the N-terminal amino acids 1-58, leading to the loss of part of the conserved domain UPF0444 and one of the membrane-spanning domains (Wu2018A). This mutation likely results in a loss of protein function, highlighting the significance of the intact transmembrane domains for the protein's role in growth and bone development (Wu2018A). The specific three-dimensional structure of TMEM263 could not be predicted due to low coverage and confidence, leaving some aspects of its tertiary and quaternary structure unresolved (Wu2018A).

## Function
The TMEM263 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is highly conserved across species and is involved in several critical biological processes. In humans, TMEM263 is associated with growth and bone development, playing a significant role in the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) axis, which is essential for normal growth and development (Wu2018A; Sarver2024Tmem263). TMEM263 is coexpressed with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and interacts with growth hormone 1 (GH1), indicating its involvement in bone mineral density regulation and osteoblast activity (Wu2018A).

TMEM263 is localized to the plasma membrane, where it is predicted to have two transmembrane helices, suggesting its role as an integral membrane protein (Sarver2024Tmem263). It may function in the growth pathway, potentially acting as a regulator in transport or signal transduction (Wu2018A). The protein's interaction with potassium channel genes Slick and Slack, which are expressed in the central nervous system, suggests a broader role in cellular signaling and homeostasis (Wu2018A). TMEM263's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining normal physiological processes related to growth and skeletal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM263 gene have been linked to several growth-related disorders. In humans, genome-wide association studies have associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in TMEM263 with variations in bone mineral density, suggesting a role in skeletal development (Sarver2024Tmem263). A documented case of a loss-of-function mutation in TMEM263 has been associated with severe skeletal dysplasia in a human fetus, raising concerns about its compatibility with postnatal survival (Sarver2024Tmem263). This mutation may lead to growth hormone insensitivity, potentially causing Laron-type dwarfism, characterized by impaired linear growth due to disrupted growth hormone (GH) signaling (Sarver2024Tmem263).

In animal models, such as chickens, a novel loss-of-function variant in TMEM263 has been identified as a cause of autosomal dwarfism. This mutation results in a truncated protein, leading to a significant reduction in growth and altered bone development (Wu2018A). The mutation is associated with normal levels of GH and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), indicating a disruption in the GH/IGF-1 axis (Wu2018A). These findings suggest that TMEM263 mutations can significantly impact growth and skeletal development across species.

## Interactions
TMEM263, a transmembrane protein, is known to engage in several interactions that suggest its involvement in growth and bone development pathways. In humans, TMEM263 physically interacts with growth hormone 1 (GH1), indicating a potential role in growth regulation (Wu2018A). It is also coexpressed with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), which further supports its involvement in bone development processes (Wu2018A). 

Additionally, TMEM263 is part of a cortical bone co-expression network that influences bone mineral density by affecting osteoblast activity, which are cells responsible for bone formation (Wu2018A). This association with bone mineral density and osteoporotic fracture risk highlights its potential regulatory role in skeletal development. 

TMEM263 also interacts with potassium channel genes Slick and Slack, which are expressed in the central nervous system, suggesting a broader role in cellular signaling pathways (Wu2018A). These interactions imply that TMEM263 may function as a regulator in transport or signal transduction, impacting various physiological processes related to growth and development.
