# PRKAA2

## Overview
The PRKAA2 gene encodes the alpha 2 catalytic subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK is a heterotrimeric enzyme complex that is activated in response to cellular energy stress, characterized by an increased AMP:ATP ratio. The protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 2, encoded by PRKAA2, is integral to the regulation of metabolic pathways, promoting catabolic processes that generate ATP while inhibiting anabolic processes that consume ATP. This regulation is crucial for maintaining energy balance within cells and is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including lipid metabolism, autophagy, and oxidative stress response. Mutations and polymorphisms in PRKAA2 have been associated with metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, as well as certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases, underscoring its clinical significance (SpencerJones2006AMPkinase; Sakura2024PHARMACODYNAMIC; Horikoshi2006A).

## Structure
The PRKAA2 gene encodes the alpha 2 catalytic subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a crucial enzyme in cellular energy regulation. The protein consists of 552 amino acids and includes several key domains: a kinase domain (KD) at the N-terminus (residues 1-312), an auto-inhibitory domain (AID), and a C-terminal regulatory domain (RD) (residues 313-552) (Sanz2008AMPActivated). The kinase domain is highly conserved and shares significant identity with yeast Snf1 and plant SnRK1, with phosphorylation at Thr172 being critical for its activity (Sanz2008AMPActivated; Ross2016AMP‐activated).

The AID interacts with the KD to inhibit its activity, a process that can be counteracted by interaction with the AMPK-γ subunit (Sanz2008AMPActivated). The C-terminal domain is involved in interactions with the AMPK-β and AMPK-γ subunits, forming a heterotrimeric complex essential for AMPK's function (Sanz2008AMPActivated; Xiao2011Structure).

The PRKAA2 protein undergoes post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation, which is crucial for its activation (Krishan2014Adenosine). The protein's structure has been crystallized, revealing a monomeric form similar to the yeast Snf1 kinase domain (Sanz2008AMPActivated).

## Function
The PRKAA2 gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a crucial enzyme in cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK is activated in response to an increased AMP:ATP ratio, which signals low energy levels within the cell. Once activated, AMPK promotes catabolic pathways that generate ATP, such as fatty acid oxidation, while inhibiting anabolic pathways that consume ATP, like lipid and cholesterol synthesis (SpencerJones2006AMPkinase; Pan2021Analysis).

In the liver, AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates enzymes such as acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and HMG-CoA reductase, reducing lipid biosynthesis and promoting fatty acid oxidation. This action helps prevent intracellular lipid accumulation and may protect against insulin resistance (SpencerJones2006AMPkinase). In vascular endothelial cells, PRKAA2 protects against oxidative stress by suppressing NF-κB-mediated expression of NAD(P)H oxidase and modulating the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (Pan2021Analysis).

PRKAA2 is also involved in regulating autophagy, a process crucial for cellular homeostasis, by modulating the phosphorylation state of proteins like RASAL2, which can switch from suppressing to activating autophagy under certain conditions (Bao2021PRKAAAMPKα).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRKAA2 gene, which encodes the α2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), have been associated with several clinical conditions. In the context of type 2 diabetes, specific polymorphisms in PRKAA2, such as the SNP rs2051040, have been linked to increased insulin resistance and susceptibility to the disease in the Japanese population. Haplotype analysis has shown significant associations with type 2 diabetes, particularly involving the minor allele A of rs2051040, which is also linked to higher insulin resistance in nondiabetic subjects (Horikoshi2006A).

In addition to metabolic disorders, PRKAA2 mutations are implicated in skin cancer and melanoma. Missense mutations in this gene can lead to partial or complete loss of AMPK activity, promoting tumor growth and metastasis, especially in melanomas with concurrent NF1 mutations (Sakura2024PHARMACODYNAMIC). PRKAA2 mutations are also associated with cardiac conditions, such as cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy, affecting glycogen storage and cardiac cell growth (Sakura2024PHARMACODYNAMIC).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of PRKAA2 in various diseases, highlighting its role in metabolic regulation and potential implications for cancer and cardiovascular health.

## Interactions
PRKAA2, encoding the alpha 2 catalytic subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular energy regulation. One significant interaction involves UBE2O, an E2/E3 hybrid ubiquitin ligase, which ubiquitinates AMPKα2, leading to its degradation via the proteasome. This interaction affects insulin resistance and metabolic disturbances in skeletal muscle (Vila2019A).

PRKAA2 also interacts with miR-124-3p, a microRNA that binds to the 3'UTR of PRKAA2 mRNA, regulating its expression. The binding of miR-124-3p to PRKAA2 was confirmed through a dual luciferase reporter assay, and knockdown of miR-124-3p resulted in increased PRKAA2 expression, indicating a regulatory role in endothelial cells adhered by tumor cells (Pan2021Analysis).

Additionally, PRKAA2 is involved in a dynamic interactome, as identified through CRISPR genomic tagging and mass spectrometry. This approach revealed various high-confidence protein interactors, highlighting the complexity of PRKAA2's role in cellular processes (Stein2019Comparison). These interactions underscore the multifaceted regulatory functions of PRKAA2 in energy metabolism and cellular stress responses.
