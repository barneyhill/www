# CHCHD6

## Overview
The CHCHD6 gene encodes the coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 6 (CHCHD6) protein, which is a mitochondrial protein involved in the structural organization and function of mitochondrial cristae. This protein is a component of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, playing a critical role in maintaining the integrity and morphology of mitochondrial cristae. The CHCHD6 protein interacts with other mitochondrial proteins, such as mitofilin and CHCHD3, to ensure proper mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. It is predominantly localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane and is essential for cellular energy homeostasis. Alterations in the CHCHD6 gene have been associated with congenital heart defects, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in mitochondrial-related pathologies (Birker2023Mitochondrial; Ding2015Mitofilin; An2012CHCM1CHCHD6).

## Structure
The CHCHD6 protein, also known as CHCM1, is a mitochondrial protein characterized by an open reading frame of 235 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 26.5 kDa (An2012CHCM1CHCHD6). The primary structure of CHCHD6 includes a myristoylation site at the N-terminal end, which is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as Sam50 (Ding2015Mitofilin). The protein also contains a domain of unknown function (DUF737) at the N terminus (An2012CHCM1CHCHD6).

The secondary structure of CHCHD6 is suggested by the presence of a coiled-coil helix-coiled-coil helix (CHCH) domain at the C-terminal end, which typically forms a coiled-coil structure (An2012CHCM1CHCHD6). This domain includes twin CX9C structural motifs, which are important for protein-protein interactions (Ding2015Mitofilin).

While the tertiary structure is not explicitly detailed, the CHCH domain implies a specific folding pattern typical of such domains (An2012CHCM1CHCHD6). The quaternary structure is not discussed in detail, but CHCHD6 is known to interact with other proteins, such as mitofilin and CHCHD3, suggesting it may form part of larger protein complexes (Ding2015Mitofilin; An2012CHCM1CHCHD6). CHCHD6 is predominantly localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, similar to mitofilin (An2012CHCM1CHCHD6).

## Function
CHCHD6 is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and biogenesis of mitochondrial cristae. It predominantly localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane and contains a coiled coil helix-coiled coil helix domain at its C-terminal end (An2012CHCM1CHCHD6). CHCHD6 interacts directly with mitofilin, a key protein in the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is essential for the proper morphology of mitochondrial cristae (An2012CHCM1CHCHD6). This interaction is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, as CHCHD6 deficiency leads to severe defects in cristae morphology, characterized by hollow cristae and a reduction in electron-dense matrix (An2012CHCM1CHCHD6).

CHCHD6 is also involved in energy metabolism, as its knockdown significantly affects cellular and mitochondrial ATP levels, indicating a unique role in energy production (An2012CHCM1CHCHD6). The protein is part of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, contributing to cristae morphology regulation (Ding2015Mitofilin). CHCHD6's role in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function is vital for cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis, impacting cell growth and survival (An2012CHCM1CHCHD6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CHCHD6 gene have been implicated in hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), a severe congenital heart defect. Variants in CHCHD6 have been identified in HLHS probands, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis. The gene's deficiency is thought to impair mitochondrial function, leading to contractile dysfunction and potentially affecting left ventricular growth. This impairment may result in decreased ventricular blood flow in embryos, contributing to the development of an abnormally small left ventricle and possibly compromising right ventricular function later in life (Birker2023Mitochondrial).

CHCHD6 is also involved in maintaining mitochondrial cristae structure through its interaction with other proteins in the MICOS complex. While knockout of CHCHD6 alters cristae structure, it does not significantly affect mitochondrial function, suggesting a compensatory role of other proteins like CHCHD3. However, disruptions in cristae structure and mitochondrial function due to CHCHD6 alterations could potentially be linked to various pathologies, although specific diseases are not directly mentioned in the context (Ding2015Mitofilin).

## Interactions
CHCHD6 is a mitochondrial protein that participates in several significant interactions with other proteins, primarily within the mitochondria. It is a component of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, which is crucial for maintaining the structure of mitochondrial cristae. CHCHD6 interacts with mitofilin, a key protein in the MICOS complex, through its C-terminal end. This interaction is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of mitochondrial cristae (Ding2015Mitofilin; An2012CHCM1CHCHD6).

CHCHD6 also interacts with CHCHD3, another mitochondrial protein involved in cristae morphology regulation. These interactions are significant for the maintenance of mitochondrial structure and function (An2012CHCM1CHCHD6). Additionally, CHCHD6 binds to Sam50, a protein that connects the MICOS complex with the outer mitochondrial membrane, via its N-terminal region. This interaction is crucial for the assembly or stability of mitochondrial proteins involved in cristae junctions (Ding2015Mitofilin).

The protein also interacts with DISC1, which is linked to neurodevelopment and mitofilin stability, suggesting a broader role in cellular processes beyond mitochondrial structure (An2012CHCM1CHCHD6).
