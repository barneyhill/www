# SLC44A5

## Overview
SLC44A5 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 44 member 5, which functions as a choline transporter-like protein. This protein is integral to the transport of choline, a critical component for phospholipid biosynthesis and cell membrane integrity. As a transmembrane protein, solute carrier family 44 member 5 plays a significant role in regulating intracellular choline levels, thereby influencing cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis (Sugimoto2012The). The gene's expression is notably involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the biosynthesis of ceramides, which are essential for maintaining the skin's barrier function (GirardeauHubert2019Reconstructed). Alterations in SLC44A5 expression have been linked to various clinical conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma and sickle cell disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (PENG2016Knockdown; Tinguely2023Transcriptomic).

## Function
The SLC44A5 gene encodes a choline transporter-like protein involved in choline transport, which is crucial for phospholipid biosynthesis and maintaining cell membrane integrity. In healthy human cells, SLC44A5 facilitates the uptake and efflux of choline, a precursor for acetylcholine and phosphocholine, which are essential for cell proliferation and apoptosis regulation (Sugimoto2012The). The gene's expression influences choline levels within cells, affecting cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis. Knockdown of SLC44A5 increases choline uptake and cell proliferation, while overexpression reduces choline uptake and enhances apoptosis, suggesting its role in suppressing cell growth by modulating intracellular choline levels (Sugimoto2012The).

SLC44A5 is also implicated in lipid metabolism, particularly in the biosynthesis of ceramides, which are vital for the skin's barrier function. The gene is highly up-regulated in Caucasian skin models, indicating its involvement in epidermal differentiation and barrier function through choline efflux and ceramide processing (GirardeauHubert2019Reconstructed). This function highlights its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling, contributing to the structural and functional integrity of cell membranes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC44A5 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. In Holstein cattle, a polymorphism in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of SLC44A5 is linked to birth weight variations and dystocia rates. Specifically, the A-326G polymorphism affects the gene's expression, with the A allele associated with lower expression levels, higher birth weights, and increased dystocia risk (Sugimoto2012The).

In humans, SLC44A5 has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The gene is upregulated in HCC tissues, and its knockdown in cell lines results in reduced cell viability, increased apoptosis, and decreased invasion, suggesting its role in cancer progression (PENG2016Knockdown). This indicates that SLC44A5 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in HCC.

Additionally, SLC44A5 expression is downregulated in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, both untreated and treated with hydroxyurea, compared to healthy controls. This downregulation is specific to erythroid cells, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of SCD (Tinguely2023Transcriptomic).
