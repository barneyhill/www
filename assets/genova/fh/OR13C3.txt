# OR13C3

## Overview
OR13C3 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 13 subfamily C member 3, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the detection of odorant molecules, facilitating the sense of smell by initiating signal transduction pathways in the olfactory system. The OR13C3 protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the neuronal processes underlying olfactory perception. Beyond its sensory function, OR13C3 has been implicated in cancer biology, with studies identifying its potential involvement in pancreatic cancer and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (Wei2012Insights; Gao2019Identification). The gene's role in these contexts underscores the broader significance of olfactory receptors in both sensory and pathological processes.

## Function
OR13C3 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR13C3 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to olfactory sensation.

In the context of disease, OR13C3 has been identified as one of the top contributing genes to the olfactory transduction pathway in studies related to pancreatic cancer. Somatic mutations in OR13C3 have been found in human pancreatic tumors, suggesting a potential role in cancer biology (Wei2012Insights). Additionally, OR13C3 is significantly downregulated in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) cells overexpressing miR-145-5p, indicating its involvement in cancer-related pathways (Gao2019Identification).

The specific function of OR13C3 in healthy human cells, beyond its role in olfactory perception, is not well-documented in the provided context. However, its involvement in olfactory transduction suggests a primary role in sensory processes related to smell.

## Clinical Significance
The gene OR13C3, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been associated with pancreatic cancer risk. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified the olfactory transduction pathway, which includes OR13C3, as significantly associated with pancreatic cancer. OR13C3 was ranked as the fifth most significant gene among 5,127 genes analyzed, with a strong statistical association indicated by a P value of 1.03x10^-25 (Wei2012Insights). The study suggests that olfactory receptor genes, including OR13C3, may have somatic mutations in human pancreatic tumors, highlighting a potential link between these mutations and cancer development (Wei2012Insights).

While the specific clinical significance of OR13C3 mutations beyond this association is not well-documented, the study emphasizes the need for further research to explore the biological and molecular links between olfactory transduction signaling and pancreatic cancer. The role of G protein-coupled receptors, which include olfactory receptors, in transmitting external signals into cells and potentially contributing to carcinogenesis is also discussed (Wei2012Insights). This suggests that alterations in OR13C3 expression or function could have implications for cancer risk, although more research is needed to fully understand these connections.
