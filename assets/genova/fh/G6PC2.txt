# G6PC2

## Overview
G6PC2 is a gene that encodes the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 2, a protein primarily expressed in pancreatic beta cells. This protein is a member of the glucose-6-phosphatase family and is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is involved in glucose metabolism. Although its precise enzymatic activity in humans is not fully characterized, G6PC2 is thought to function as a negative regulator of the beta-cell glucose sensor, counteracting glucokinase activity and influencing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Oeser2011Deletion; Martin2001Cloning). Variations in the G6PC2 gene have been associated with fasting glucose levels and may impact the risk of type 2 diabetes, highlighting its potential clinical significance in metabolic regulation (Mahajan2015Identification; Li2020Glucose).

## Function
The G6PC2 gene encodes the islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein, which is primarily expressed in pancreatic beta cells. This protein is part of the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) family and is located in the endoplasmic reticulum. It plays a role in glucose metabolism by hydrolyzing glucose-6-phosphate into glucose and inorganic phosphate, although its exact enzymatic activity in humans is not fully established (Martin2001Cloning).

G6PC2 is proposed to act as a negative component of the beta-cell glucose sensor, opposing the action of glucokinase. This modulation affects glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, thereby influencing fasting blood glucose levels (Oeser2011Deletion). In G6pc2 knockout mice, a reduction in fasting blood glucose levels has been observed, suggesting a similar role in humans (Oeser2011Deletion).

Despite its involvement in glucose metabolism, the absence of G6PC2 does not lead to severe metabolic disturbances, indicating that it may not play a major role in energy homeostasis under normal physiological conditions (Wang2007Deletion). The protein's function in healthy cells remains somewhat unclear, but it is implicated in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the G6PC2 gene have been associated with alterations in fasting glucose levels and may influence the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Specific coding variants, such as p.Val219Leu and p.His177Tyr, have been identified as significantly associated with fasting glucose levels. These variants are independent of the lead GWAS SNP, rs560887, at the G6PC2/ABCB11 locus, indicating multiple association signals at this locus (Mahajan2015Identification). The p.Val219Leu variant, in particular, shows a modest association with increased T2D risk, suggesting that G6PC2 dysfunction may contribute to T2D pathogenesis (Mahajan2015Identification).

The G6PC2 gene encodes an islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit, which plays a role in glucose homeostasis. Variants in G6PC2, such as rs560887, have been linked to fasting plasma glucose levels and pancreatic beta cell function, although their direct association with T2D risk remains controversial (Li2020Glucose). Some studies have found that G6PC2 variants, like rs16856187, are associated with T2D and fasting plasma glucose levels in specific populations, highlighting potential ethnic differences in genetic susceptibility (Hu2008A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of G6PC2 mutations in metabolic diseases, particularly in relation to glucose metabolism and diabetes risk.
