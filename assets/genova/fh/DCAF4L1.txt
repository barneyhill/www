# DCAF4L1

## Overview
DCAF4L1 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 4 like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, functioning primarily as an adaptor protein. This protein facilitates the interaction between specific substrates and the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a critical role in protein degradation and homeostasis. The DCAF4L1 protein is categorized as an adaptor protein due to its role in linking substrates to the ubiquitin ligase complex. It is expressed in various cellular compartments, including the nucleus and cytoplasm, and is particularly noted for its high expression in the testis, suggesting a significant role in spermatogenesis and testicular development. While the precise functions of DCAF4L1 in normal human physiology are not fully understood, its involvement in key cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and signal transduction has been documented. The gene's expression patterns and potential regulatory roles in reproductive tissues underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Mistry2020Expression).

## Structure


## Function
DCAF4L1 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 4 like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for regulating protein degradation. This protein functions as an adaptor, linking specific substrates to the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, a process crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis. Through this mechanism, DCAF4L1 influences several cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and signal transduction (Mistry2020Expression).

The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, contributing to cellular responses and organismal development. Although the specific function of DCAF4L1 in healthy human cells is not fully elucidated, it is known to be involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis, as it is highly expressed in the testis. This suggests a role in testicular development and the differentiation of spermatogenic cells (Mistry2020Expression).

DCAF4L1's expression patterns and potential regulatory roles in reproductive tissues highlight its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal development, although further research is needed to fully understand its specific molecular activities in healthy human cells (Jamin2021Combined).

## Clinical Significance
The DCAF4L1 gene has been implicated in various cancers and other diseases due to its altered expression and mutations. In cancer, DCAF4L1 shows significant differential expression in 14 types, including ovarian and testicular germ cell tumors, kidney cancer, and bladder cancer. High expression of DCAF4L1 is associated with a decreased probability of survival in kidney cancer patients, while it correlates with an increased probability of survival in bladder cancer patients, highlighting its potential role in cancer prognosis (Jamin2021Combined).

In hemangioblastoma, a type of tumor, DCAF4L1 harbors significant mutations, particularly in familial cases, suggesting its involvement in the genetic complexity of this disease. These mutations were identified through whole exome sequencing, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis (Ma2017Whole).

Additionally, DCAF4L1 has been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) through differential expression and DNA methylation changes in the cerebellum, although its specific role in the disease remains unclear (Ebbert2017Conserved). These findings underscore the clinical significance of DCAF4L1 in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders.
