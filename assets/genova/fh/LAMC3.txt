# LAMC3

## Overview
The LAMC3 gene encodes the laminin subunit gamma 3, a crucial component of the laminin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins. Laminins are integral to the structural integrity and function of basement membranes, playing significant roles in cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, and signaling. The laminin gamma 3 chain, specifically, is involved in forming heterotrimeric complexes with various alpha and beta chains, contributing to the diversity of laminin isoforms. This protein is particularly important in neural development, influencing processes such as neuronal migration and cortical layering in the brain (Koch1999Characterization; Li2012The). The gamma 3 chain is expressed in specific tissues, including the central nervous system and certain epithelial surfaces, where it contributes to the structural and functional integrity of these tissues (Koch1999Characterization). Mutations in the LAMC3 gene have been linked to neurological disorders, underscoring its critical role in cortical development and extracellular matrix organization (Qian2021Variants).

## Structure
The LAMC3 gene encodes the laminin subunit gamma 3, which is a component of the laminin protein family involved in the structure of basement membranes. The human gamma 3 chain consists of 1620 amino acids, including a 19-residue signal peptide (Kefalides2005Structural). The primary structure of the gamma 3 chain includes an LN-terminal globule, four LE repeats, a globular domain IV, and six additional LE repeats. It also contains nine potential glycosylation sites conserved in both human and mouse species (Kefalides2005Structural). 

The gamma 3 chain features a single RGD sequence, although this site is not conserved in other gamma chains. It also has a sequence homologous to the nidogen-binding site found in the gamma 1 chain (Kefalides2005Structural). The quaternary structure of laminins involves the assembly of alpha, beta, and gamma chains into a heterotrimeric complex, forming a dumbbell-shaped molecule approximately 25 nm in length (Kefalides2005Structural). The gamma 3 chain can partner with either the beta 1 or beta 2 chain, contributing to the formation of various laminin isoforms (Li2012The). The gamma 3 chain is not directly involved in integrin binding but forms complexes with integrin beta 1 at certain epithelial surfaces (Li2012The).

## Function
The LAMC3 gene encodes the laminin γ3 chain, a component of laminins, which are essential glycoproteins in the extracellular matrix. Laminins are involved in various molecular processes, including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, and signaling. The γ3 chain is particularly important in neural development, influencing processes such as neuronal migration and cortical layering in the brain (Koch1999Characterization; Li2012The).

In healthy human cells, the laminin γ3 chain is expressed in specific tissues, including the apical surfaces of ciliated epithelial cells in the testis, lung, and fallopian tube. It is involved in forming laminin heterotrimers by pairing with various α and β chains, potentially forming up to 10 different laminins (Koch1999Characterization). The γ3 chain contains glycosylation sites and a nidogen-binding site, which are crucial for its role in forming stable matrices and contributing to tissue integrity and function (Koch1999Characterization).

The γ3 chain is also expressed in the central nervous system, including the neural retina, cerebellum, and forebrain structures, suggesting its role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of these tissues (Koch1999Characterization). Its expression in the retina is crucial for retinal lamination, photoreceptor organization, and ganglion cell differentiation (Dorgau2018Laminin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LAMC3 gene are associated with occipital cortical malformations (OCCM), a condition characterized by structural brain abnormalities such as polymicrogyria and pachygyria, particularly affecting the occipital lobes. These malformations can lead to childhood-onset seizures and developmental delays (Qian2021Variants). The LAMC3 gene variants have been identified in patients with occipital polymicrogyria and epilepsy, with seven different variants reported, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations (Qian2021Variants).

In addition to OCCM, LAMC3 mutations have been linked to posterior periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH), a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by nodules of neurons that fail to migrate properly to the cerebral cortex. This condition is also associated with seizures and developmental delays. Specific LAMC3 variants, such as p.Arg356Cys and p.Gln909Arg, have been identified in individuals with occipital restricted PNH, suggesting that these mutations disrupt normal laminin interactions and basement membrane assembly (De2021Compound).

These findings highlight the critical role of LAMC3 in cortical development and its involvement in neurological disorders due to its impact on extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion (Qian2021Variants).

## Interactions
The LAMC3 gene encodes the laminin γ3 chain, which is part of the laminin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins. Laminins are crucial for cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, and signaling. The laminin γ3 chain can form heterotrimeric complexes with various α and β chains, potentially creating up to 10 different laminin isoforms, including the α2β1γ3 heterotrimer, provisionally named laminin 12 (Koch1999Characterization). The γ3 chain is closely related to the human γ1 chain and contains a γ1-like nidogen binding motif, suggesting potential interactions with other basement membrane molecules through nidogen (Koch1999Characterization).

LAMC3 and its interacting proteins are primarily located in the basement membrane and are involved in extracellular matrix organization, cell adhesion, and cellular component organization. The STRING database predicted interactions with ten other genes, including DAG1, LAMA1, LAMA3, LAMA5, LAMB1, LAMB2, LAMB3, NID1, NID2, and NTN4, with an interaction score of 0.4 (Qian2021Variants). These interactions are significant for structural support and cellular processes, including protein-containing complex binding and signaling receptor binding (Qian2021Variants). The γ3 chain's interactions are likely important for the structural and signal transduction roles of laminins, contributing to the formation and stability of basement membranes and cellular attachments (Koch1999Characterization).
