# TMEM107

## Overview
TMEM107 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 107, a critical component of the ciliary transition zone (TZ) in eukaryotic cells. This protein is characterized by its four transmembrane helices, which are essential for its localization and function within the TZ, a region pivotal for regulating cilium composition and signaling (Lambacher2015TMEM107). TMEM107 is involved in the organization of the MKS module, interacting with other proteins such as TMEM216, TMEM231, TMEM237, and MKS1, to maintain the structural integrity and function of cilia (Lambacher2015TMEM107). The protein plays a significant role in ciliogenesis and is implicated in the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, which is crucial for various developmental processes (Shaheen2015Identification). Mutations in the TMEM107 gene are linked to several ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome and Meckel-Gruber syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in human health and development (Bruel2017Fifteen; Shaheen2015Identification).

## Structure
TMEM107 is a transmembrane protein characterized by four predicted transmembrane helices and short cytosolic N-and C-termini. These transmembrane helices are crucial for its localization and function at the ciliary transition zone (TZ) (Lambacher2015TMEM107). The protein's association with the TZ is dependent on these helices, while disruption of the transmembrane domain linkers or cytosolic termini does not affect its localization, highlighting the importance of the helices themselves (Lambacher2015TMEM107).

TMEM107 interacts with several proteins within the MKS module, including TMEM216, TMEM231, TMEM237, and MKS1, forming part of a complex network at the TZ. This interaction is independent of its short cytosolic termini, suggesting that the transmembrane helices or interhelical linkers are essential for these associations (Lambacher2015TMEM107). The protein is immobile within the TZ, as demonstrated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays, indicating that it is anchored at the TZ membrane (Lambacher2015TMEM107).

TMEM107's role in ciliogenesis and signaling is supported by its localization at the TZ in both Caenorhabditis elegans and human cells, and mutations in TMEM107 are linked to ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome and oral-facial-digital syndrome (Lambacher2015TMEM107).

## Function
TMEM107 is a transmembrane protein localized to the ciliary transition zone (TZ), a critical region for controlling cilium composition and signaling. It plays a significant role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, and is essential for maintaining the integrity and function of the ciliary structure in healthy human cells (Lambacher2015TMEM107; Shaheen2015Identification). TMEM107 is involved in the recruitment of other ciliopathy proteins to subdomains of the TZ, organizing the assembly of membrane to microtubule Y-link connectors, and forming diffusion barriers that are crucial for ciliary function (Lambacher2015TMEM107).

In terms of molecular processes, TMEM107 is part of the MKS module, which is involved in the organization and recruitment of proteins like MKS1, TMEM231, and TMEM237, essential for the architecture of the TZ (Lambacher2015TMEM107). It also plays a role in Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling, a pathway critical for various developmental processes, by ensuring proper ciliary function and signaling (Shaheen2015Identification). Disruption of TMEM107 can lead to reduced ciliation and altered cell structures, impacting cellular signaling pathways and leading to developmental abnormalities (Lambacher2015TMEM107).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM107 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome (JBTS), Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS), and oral-facial-digital syndrome (OFD). These conditions are characterized by defects in ciliary structure and function, leading to a range of developmental abnormalities. In Joubert syndrome, TMEM107 mutations result in neurological disturbances, retinopathy, and the characteristic molar tooth sign on brain imaging (Lambacher2015TMEM107). Meckel-Gruber syndrome, a perinatally lethal disorder, is linked to TMEM107 mutations that cause ciliogenesis defects and disrupted Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling, leading to features such as exencephaly, polydactyly, and polycystic kidneys (Shaheen2015Identification). 

TMEM107 is also crucial for eye development, and its deficiency can lead to ocular phenotypes such as anophthalmia and microphthalmia. These eye defects are associated with altered SHH signaling and reduced ciliogenesis, as observed in both mouse models and human retinal organoids (Dubaic2023Role). The severity of symptoms in humans correlates with the type of mutation, with frameshift mutations causing more severe defects (Dubaic2023Role).

## Interactions
TMEM107 is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis and is involved in several protein interactions within the ciliary transition zone (TZ). It is a component of the MKS module, which is essential for recruiting ciliopathy-associated proteins to specific subdomains of the TZ. TMEM107 interacts with proteins such as MKS1, TMEM231, and TMEM237, forming a submodule that is necessary for the organization of Layer 3 proteins at the TZ (Lambacher2015TMEM107; Dubaic2023Role). 

Co-immunoprecipitation assays have demonstrated that TMEM107 associates with TMEM216, TMEM231, TMEM237, and MKS1, although it does not interact with TMEM17. The association with TMEM237 is dependent on its transmembrane helices or C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Lambacher2015TMEM107). 

TMEM107 is also involved in maintaining the integrity of the membrane diffusion barrier in cilia, as evidenced by its role in regulating the selective leakage of proteins into mutant cilia (Lambacher2015TMEM107). These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning and maintenance of primary cilia, and defects in these interactions can lead to ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome and Meckel syndrome (Bruel2017Fifteen).
