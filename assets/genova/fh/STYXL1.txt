# STYXL1

## Overview
STYXL1 is a gene that encodes the protein serine/threonine/tyrosine interacting-like 1, commonly referred to as MK-STYX. This protein is categorized as a pseudophosphatase due to its structural similarity to phosphatases but lacks catalytic activity because of specific amino acid substitutions in its active site (Patel2023Pseudophosphatase). Despite its inactivity as a phosphatase, MK-STYX plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of lysosomal function, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and organelle distribution (Patel2023Pseudophosphatase). It is particularly significant in the context of sperm flagella development, where it interacts with the chaperonin CCT complex to facilitate protein folding necessary for sperm motility (Chen2024STYXL1). Additionally, STYXL1 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as Gaucher disease and male infertility, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Patel2023Pseudophosphatase; Chen2024STYXL1).

## Structure
The STYXL1 protein, also known as MK-STYX, is characterized by a rhodanese-like domain in its N-terminal segment and a C-terminal tyrosine-protein phosphatase domain (Chen2024STYXL1). Despite its classification as a pseudophosphatase, STYXL1 shares a common signature motif (VILIFSTQGISR) with dual-specificity phosphatases of the PTP superfamily. However, it contains phenylalanine (F) and serine (S) instead of the histidine (H) and cysteine (C) residues necessary for catalytic activity, rendering it inactive as a phosphatase (Qi2022Evolutionary; Patel2023Pseudophosphatase).

The rhodanese-like domain in STYXL1 is distinct from that in MAPK phosphatases, as it lacks the critical arginines required for MAPK docking, indicating a different function (Chen2024STYXL1). This domain is responsible for interactions with the CCT complex subunits, independent of the phosphatase domain (Chen2024STYXL1). STYXL1 is involved in various cellular processes, including sperm flagella development, where it acts as a co-factor for the CCT complex, crucial for tubulin folding (Chen2024STYXL1). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details on its secondary or tertiary structures are limited.

## Function
STYXL1 is a pseudophosphatase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes despite its lack of catalytic activity. In healthy human cells, STYXL1 is involved in regulating lysosomal function and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Its depletion enhances the trafficking of β-glucocerebrosidase to lysosomes, increasing lysosomal activity and ER-lysosome contacts, which suggests a role in modulating ER stress and lysosomal function (Patel2023Pseudophosphatase). STYXL1 also influences the distribution of organelles, such as the ER, late endosomes, and lysosomes, and affects microtubule post-translational modifications, impacting lysosome motility (Patel2023Pseudophosphatase).

STYXL1 interacts with the CCT complex, a chaperonin essential for protein folding, particularly in the context of sperm flagella formation. It regulates the assembly of the CCT complex and the folding of flagellar tubulin, which is crucial for sperm motility and male fertility (Chen2024STYXL1). The protein's interaction with CCT subunits is mediated by its N-terminal rhodanese-like domain, independent of its phosphatase domain, highlighting its role in cellular processes related to flagella and cilia formation (Chen2024STYXL1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the STYXL1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder, STYXL1 acts as a negative regulator of lysosomal activity. Depletion of STYXL1 enhances the trafficking of the lysosomal enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase to lysosomes, which may improve lysosomal function and potentially delay disease progression (Patel2023Pseudophosphatase). This suggests that targeting STYXL1 could be a therapeutic strategy for Gaucher disease and other lysosomal storage disorders (Patel2023Pseudophosphatase).

In male fertility, STYXL1 is crucial for normal sperm formation and function. Deletion of STYXL1 in mice leads to male infertility due to defects in sperm flagella, resulting in reduced sperm motility and morphological abnormalities (Chen2024STYXL1). These findings highlight the gene's role in spermiogenesis and its potential link to male infertility (Chen2024STYXL1).

STYXL1 has also been associated with sarcoidosis, a systemic inflammatory disease. Genetic studies have identified the STYXL1-SRRM3 locus as a novel susceptibility locus for sarcoidosis, suggesting that mutations in this gene may influence disease outcomes through their effect on immune response modulation (Meguro2020Genetic).

## Interactions
STYXL1, a pseudophosphatase, is known to interact with the chaperonin CCT complex, which is crucial for protein folding. Specifically, STYXL1 interacts with the CCT complex subunits CCT1, CCT6, and CCT7. These interactions are mediated by the N-terminal rhodanese-like domain of STYXL1 and are independent of its C-terminal tyrosine-protein phosphatase domain (Chen2024STYXL1). The interaction with the CCT complex is essential for the folding of key proteins involved in sperm flagella formation, and the deletion of STYXL1 affects the expression and localization of these CCT subunits in sperm flagella (Chen2024STYXL1).

STYXL1 also interacts with the mitochondrial phosphatase PTPMT1, negatively regulating its function during mitochondrial-dependent cell death. This interaction suggests a role for STYXL1 in mitochondrial dynamics and cell death pathways (Patel2023Pseudophosphatase). Additionally, STYXL1 interacts with proteins such as G3BP1 and FBXW7, influencing processes like stress granule formation and apoptosis (Patel2023Pseudophosphatase). These interactions highlight STYXL1's involvement in various cellular processes, despite its lack of catalytic activity.
