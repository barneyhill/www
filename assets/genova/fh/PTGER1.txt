# PTGER1

## Overview
The PTGER1 gene encodes the prostaglandin E receptor 1 (EP1), a G-protein-coupled receptor that is integral to the cellular response to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). As a transmembrane receptor, EP1 is involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of steroidogenesis, calcium mobilization, and intracellular signaling pathways. It plays a significant role in the modulation of steroid hormone synthesis and the conversion of cortisol to cortisone in granulosa-lutein cells (Chandras2007PTGER1). The receptor's activity is crucial in renal physiology, where it interacts with other receptors to influence oxidative stress and fibrosis, particularly in the context of diabetic nephropathy (Thibodeau2013PTGER1). Additionally, PTGER1 has clinical significance in conditions such as hypertension and diabetic kidney disease, where its modulation presents potential therapeutic avenues (Rutkai2009Activation; Thibodeau2013PTGER1).

## Structure


## Function
PTGER1 encodes the prostaglandin E receptor 1, a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in mediating the effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in human cells. This receptor is primarily involved in the regulation of steroidogenesis and cortisol metabolism in granulosa-lutein cells. PGE2 stimulates progesterone synthesis and the conversion of cortisol to cortisone through the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11bHSD1) (Chandras2007PTGER1). The PTGER1 receptor, when activated by PGE2, contributes to the steroidogenic response, although it does not mediate the full response, as evidenced by partial inhibition of progesterone production when a PTGER1 antagonist is used (Chandras2007PTGER1).

PTGER1 is also involved in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those related to calcium mobilization. It mediates increases in intracellular calcium levels, which are crucial for various cellular functions (Chandras2007PTGER1). The receptor's activity is modulated by specific antagonists, which can alter its effects on steroidogenesis and enzyme activity, highlighting its role in fine-tuning cellular responses to PGE2 (Chandras2007PTGER1). PTGER1 is active in the cell membrane, where it influences these intracellular signaling pathways (Chandras2007PTGER1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PTGER1 gene, which encodes the prostaglandin E2 EP1 receptor, have been implicated in several pathological conditions. In the context of type 2 diabetes, increased expression and activation of the EP1 receptor contribute to elevated arteriolar tone and hypertension. Studies in db/db mice, a model for type 2 diabetes, have shown that EP1 receptor activation leads to increased arteriolar constriction and elevated blood pressure. The use of an EP1 receptor antagonist was found to normalize these vascular changes, suggesting that targeting the EP1 receptor could be a therapeutic strategy for managing hypertension in type 2 diabetes (Rutkai2009Activation).

In diabetic nephropathy, the EP1 receptor is associated with renal damage. Deletion of the PTGER1 gene in diabetic mouse models has shown protective effects against renal injury, including reduced albuminuria and preservation of renal structure. This suggests that EP1 receptor activity contributes to the progression of diabetic nephropathy, and its inhibition could be beneficial in managing this condition (Thibodeau2013PTGER1).

EP1 receptor signaling is also involved in angiotensin II-dependent hypertension, particularly through its role in the subfornical organ of the brain. This signaling pathway is crucial for the hypertensive effects mediated by angiotensin II, indicating that EP1 receptor antagonism could be a potential treatment for certain forms of hypertension (Cao2012Angiotensin).

## Interactions
The PTGER1 gene encodes the EP1 receptor, which is a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in various cellular processes. The EP1 receptor interacts with Gq proteins to activate phospholipase Cb, leading to phosphoinositide hydrolysis, calcium mobilization, and protein kinase C activation (Thibodeau2013PTGER1). This receptor is expressed in several renal cell types, including mesangial cells, podocytes, and proximal tubule cells, where it plays a role in mediating the effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (Thibodeau2013PTGER1).

In the context of diabetic nephropathy, the EP1 receptor has been shown to interact with the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor. This interaction is associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can lead to podocyte damage and albuminuria. Antagonism of the EP1 receptor reduces AngII-mediated ROS production in human podocytes, suggesting a protective role against diabetic kidney injury (Thibodeau2013PTGER1).

The EP1 receptor also influences fibronectin expression and ROS generation in proximal tubule cells, contributing to oxidative stress responses and fibrosis. These interactions highlight the receptor's involvement in kidney disease progression and its potential as a therapeutic target (Nasrallah2015Prostaglandin).
