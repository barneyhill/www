# PSME1

## Overview
PSME1 is a gene that encodes the proteasome activator subunit 1, also known as PA28α, which is a crucial component of the 11S regulator complex involved in protein degradation. The protein encoded by PSME1 is categorized as a proteasome activator and plays a significant role in enhancing the peptidase activity of the 20S proteasome, thereby facilitating the generation of antigenic peptides for presentation by class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (Knowlton1997Structure; McCusker1999Organization). This function is vital for immune surveillance and response. PA28α forms a heptameric structure that interacts with the proteasome, inducing conformational changes that enhance proteolytic activity (Knowlton1997Structure). The expression of PSME1 is regulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), underscoring its role in immune function and antigen processing (McCusker1999Organization). Additionally, PSME1 has clinical significance in various cancers, where its expression levels can influence prognosis and treatment outcomes (Lou2016High; Tripathi2021The).

## Structure
The PSME1 gene encodes the proteasome activator subunit 1, also known as PA28α, which is part of the 11S regulator complex. The protein forms a heptameric barrel-shaped assembly with a central channel, facilitating substrate entry and product exit when bound to the proteasome (Knowlton1997Structure). The heptamer is stabilized by interactions between monomers, involving both polar and hydrophobic associations. The central pore is lined with polar residues, including charged side chains, which may play a role in substrate processing (Knowlton1997Structure).

The primary structure of PA28α includes a 'KEKE' motif, which is thought to mediate protein-protein interactions, although its deletion does not impact peptidase activity (Knowlton1997Structure). This motif is encoded by exons 4 and 5 of the PSME1 gene (McCusker1999Organization). The secondary structure is predominantly helical, with four long α-helices forming the monomer (Knowlton1997Structure).

PA28α can form multimeric complexes even in the absence of β subunits, although both subunits are necessary for maximal activation of the proteasome (Song1996A). The protein is regulated by γ-interferon, which increases its mRNA levels in cultured cells (Joon1995Primary).

## Function
PSME1 encodes the proteasome activator subunit 1, also known as REGα or PA28α, which is a component of the 11S regulator complex. This protein plays a crucial role in enhancing the peptidase activity of the 20S proteasome, a core component of the proteasome system responsible for protein degradation. PSME1 is involved in the generation of antigenic peptides for presentation by class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which is essential for immune surveillance and response (Knowlton1997Structure; McCusker1999Organization).

REGα forms a heptameric structure that binds to the proteasome, inducing conformational changes that facilitate substrate entry into the proteasome's active sites. This interaction can enhance proteasome activity up to 200-fold against certain peptides, suggesting a selective enhancement of proteolytic activity (Knowlton1997Structure). The protein is also involved in the degradation of oxidized proteins, which is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing apoptosis during cellular differentiation processes, such as myogenic differentiation (Cui2014Identification).

PSME1 is expressed in immune tissues and is upregulated in response to interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), highlighting its role in immune function and antigen processing (McCusker1999Organization).

## Clinical Significance
The PSME1 gene, encoding the PA28α subunit of the proteasome activator complex, plays a significant role in various cancers. In ovarian cancer, the presence of the C-terminal fragment of PA28 correlates with poorer overall survival, serving as a biomarker for tumor relapses and treatment monitoring (Tripathi2021The). In multiple myeloma, elevated plasma levels of PA28α are linked to a reduced response to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, indicating poor treatment outcomes (Tripathi2021The). High expression of PSME1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma and soft tissue leiomyosarcoma is associated with poor prognosis, while in melanoma, elevated levels are linked to better overall survival (Lou2016High; Tripathi2021The).

In leiomyosarcomas, high nuclear expression of PSME1 is an independent prognostic factor for reduced overall survival and metastasis-free survival (Lou2016High). Mutations in PSME1, such as N146Y, can inhibit proteasome activation, affecting cancer progression and treatment outcomes (Li2021Integrated). PSME1 expression is also associated with drug sensitivity to chelerythrine and hydroxyurea, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2021Integrated). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PSME1 in cancer prognosis and treatment.

## Interactions
PSME1, also known as proteasome activator subunit 1, is a component of the 11S regulator complex that interacts with the 20S proteasome core to form the immunoproteasome. This interaction enhances the hydrolysis of peptides, facilitating antigen processing for presentation by class I MHC molecules (McCusker1999Organization). PSME1 is involved in protein-protein interactions through its KEKE motif, although the exact function of this motif is not fully established (McCusker1999Organization). 

In the context of cancer, PSME1 is frequently overexpressed and co-expressed with other proteasome genes, such as PSMB8-10 and PSME2, across various cancer types, indicating a coordinated expression pattern necessary for proteasome function (Larsson2022Pancancer). This suggests that PSME1 may participate in interactions that are crucial for maintaining proteostasis in cancer cells. 

In the context of sickle cell disease, PSME1 is part of a cluster dominated by proteasome proteins, indicating its involvement in protein degradation pathways and potential interactions with other proteasome components (Ammann2009Cluster). However, specific details on transient or inhibitory interactions involving PSME1 are not provided in the available context.
