# SPHK2

## Overview
The SPHK2 gene encodes sphingosine kinase 2, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the phosphorylation of sphingosine to produce sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a potent signaling lipid involved in numerous cellular processes. As a kinase, SPHK2 is integral to various signaling pathways, influencing cellular functions such as gene expression, apoptosis, and inflammation. Unlike its isoform SPHK1, SPHK2 is localized in the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria, where it exerts distinct regulatory effects, including epigenetic modulation and mitochondrial respiration (Weigert2019Sphingosine; Diaz2021The). The gene's expression and activity are tightly regulated and have been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and kidney disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Imeri2021Loss; Huo2021METTL3mediated).

## Structure
The SPHK2 protein is an enzyme that phosphorylates sphingosine to produce sphingosine-1-phosphate, a signaling lipid involved in various cellular processes. The primary structure of SPHK2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains crucial for its function. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the enzyme's stability and function. The tertiary structure of SPHK2 forms a specific three-dimensional shape, which includes a kinase domain essential for its enzymatic activity (Worrell2019In).

SPHK2 has a two-domain architecture, with the catalytic site located between the C-terminal and N-terminal domains. This structure is crucial for its function in phosphorylating sphingosine (Zhang2020Investigating). The enzyme also features a larger binding site compared to its isoform SPHK1, which can be targeted by designing larger inhibitor molecules (Zhang2020Investigating).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, affecting the enzyme's activity and interactions. SPHK2 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may result in variations in its structure and function (Worrell2019In). These structural features are critical for the enzyme's role in cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
Sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2) is an enzyme that plays a multifaceted role in cellular processes, primarily through the production of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid involved in signaling pathways. SPHK2 is distinct from its isoform SPHK1, as it is localized to the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria, where it influences gene expression, telomere maintenance, and mitochondrial respiration (Diaz2021The). In the nucleus, SPHK2 associates with histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, inhibiting them and leading to epigenetic regulation of gene expression, which is crucial for neuronal function (Diaz2021The).

SPHK2 has a dual role in apoptosis and cell survival. It can promote apoptosis by enhancing the expression of p21 and activating pro-apoptotic pathways, yet it also supports cell survival, as evidenced by its cytoprotective role during cerebral ischemia (Diaz2021The). SPHK2 is also involved in regulating inflammation, acting as a negative regulator in macrophages by modulating cytokine production and NF-κB signaling, independent of its catalytic activity (Weigert2019Sphingosine).

SPHK2's activity is regulated by various factors, including epidermal growth factor and hypoxia, and it can be phosphorylated by several kinases, affecting its function and localization (Diaz2021The). Its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes underscores its importance in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the SPHK2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In gastric cancer, SPHK2 is overexpressed, which correlates with poor prognosis and is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This overexpression is facilitated by METTL3-mediated m6A methylation, which enhances SPHK2 mRNA translation, promoting oncogenic activities through the degradation of the tumor suppressor KLF2 (Huo2021METTL3mediated). SPHK2's role in cancer is further highlighted in large granular lymphocyte leukemia, where its overexpression promotes cell survival via the Mcl-1 pathway (LeBlanc2020Sphingosine).

In addition to cancer, SPHK2 has been studied in the context of kidney diseases. Loss of SPHK2 expression or its catalytic inhibition in podocytes leads to increased expression of nephrin and the Wilm's tumor suppressor gene 1 (WT1), which protects against podocyte damage and proteinuria. This suggests a potential protective role of SPHK2 downregulation in preventing nephrotic syndromes and glomerular diseases (Imeri2021Loss). These findings indicate that SPHK2 is a significant target for therapeutic intervention in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
SPHK2 (sphingosine kinase 2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. In gastric cancer cells, SPHK2 interacts with the transcription factor KLF2, promoting its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction is facilitated by the phosphorylation of KLF2 at the Thr173 residue and its ubiquitination at the K122 residue, with E3 ubiquitin ligases WWP1 and Smurf1 playing a role in this process (Huo2021METTL3mediated).

In the context of influenza A virus infection, SPHK2 interacts with the DNA demethylase TET3 and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to regulate type I interferon expression. SPHK2 acts as an adaptor protein, recruiting HDAC1 to the IFN-β promoter, which leads to the suppression of IFN-β transcription. This interaction is independent of SPHK2's enzymatic activity and involves its substrate binding domain (Xu2022Enzymatic).

SPHK2 also interacts with TRAF6 in inflammatory macrophages, where it is suggested to prevent TRAF6's recruitment to mitochondria, thereby inhibiting mitochondrial ROS production and NF-κB activation (Weigert2019Sphingosine). These interactions highlight SPHK2's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and regulation.
