# ISM1

## Overview
The ISM1 gene encodes the protein isthmin 1, a secreted protein that plays a multifaceted role in various biological processes, including metabolism, angiogenesis, and immune responses. Isthmin 1 is categorized as an adipokine due to its involvement in metabolic regulation, particularly in promoting glucose uptake and inhibiting hepatic lipid synthesis, which are crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Hu2022A; Menghuan2023Advances). Structurally, the protein is characterized by a thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR1) domain and an adhesion-associated domain in MUC4 and other proteins (AMOP), which are integral to its functions in cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis (Menghuan2023Advances; OSÓRIO2014Distinct). Isthmin 1 also interacts with various cellular receptors and proteins, such as αvβ5 integrin and GRP78, mediating processes like apoptosis and vascular permeability (Zhang2011Isthmin; Menghuan2023Advances). The gene's expression is regulated by nutritional and metabolic changes, highlighting its role in both normal physiological and pathological conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders (Hu2022A).

## Structure
The ISM1 protein is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function. It contains a signal peptide at the N-terminus, which directs the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum for secretion (Yoshimoto2021Regulation). The protein features a thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR1) domain, approximately 60 amino acids in length, which is involved in cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis (Menghuan2023Advances; OSÓRIO2014Distinct). This domain includes motifs such as WSLW and CSVTCG, which are associated with anti-angiogenic activity (Shakhawat2022Isthmin—A).

The C-terminal region of ISM1 contains an AMOP domain, about 160 amino acids long, which plays a role in cell adhesion and is linked to angiogenesis and metastasis (Menghuan2023Advances; OSÓRIO2014Distinct). The AMOP domain includes an RKD motif that interacts with αvβ5 integrins, affecting vascular permeability and cell migration (Shakhawat2022Isthmin—A).

Post-translational modifications of ISM1 include N-glycosylation at Asn39 and Asn282, which are crucial for its secretion, and C-mannosylation at Trp223 and Trp226, which facilitates protein transport and secretion (Menghuan2023Advances; Yoshimoto2021Regulation). These modifications are essential for the protein's stability and function.

## Function
The ISM1 (isthmin 1) gene encodes a secreted protein that plays a significant role in various biological processes, particularly in metabolism, angiogenesis, and immune responses. In healthy human cells, ISM1 functions as an adipokine, promoting glucose uptake and inhibiting hepatic lipid synthesis, which is crucial for maintaining metabolic balance and preventing conditions like diabetes mellitus and fatty liver disease (Hu2022A; Menghuan2023Advances). 

ISM1 is involved in cell adhesion and migration through its thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) and adhesion-associated domain in MUC4 and other proteins (AMOP), which are essential for tissue remodeling and angiogenesis (Hu2022A; Menghuan2023Advances). The protein also plays a role in apoptosis by interacting with caspases, particularly caspase-3 and caspase-8, and binding to receptors like αvβ5 integrin and GRP78, which mediate its apoptotic effects in endothelial and tumor cells (Hu2022A; Menghuan2023Advances).

ISM1 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, lungs, heart, and adipose tissue, and is regulated by nutritional and metabolic changes, indicating its involvement in immune responses and metabolic processes (Hu2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ISM1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In craniofacial development, heterozygous deletions of ISM1 are linked to cleft lip and palate, suggesting that the loss of even one copy predisposes individuals to these disorders. ISM1 is expressed in regions critical for craniofacial development, and its knockdown in Xenopus laevis results in craniofacial dysmorphologies, including cleft-like phenotypes (Lansdon2018Identification).

In cancer, ISM1 plays a complex role. Although it is an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, its overexpression is reported in gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and colorectal cancer. In gastric cancer, ISM1 binds with lncRNA H19, promoting carcinogenesis and metastasis. In colon adenocarcinoma, ISM1 overexpression activates the Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (Menghuan2023Advances; Shakhawat2022Isthmin—A).

ISM1 is also involved in metabolic conditions. It acts as an adipokine that promotes glucose uptake, with knockout studies in mice showing reduced glucose tolerance and uptake. Overexpression in diet-induced mice improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. ISM1 suppresses insulin-dependent de novo lipogenesis, preventing lipid accumulation in a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mouse model (Shakhawat2022Isthmin—A).

## Interactions
Isthmin 1 (ISM1) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein GRP78, which is highly expressed on the surface of various cancer cells. This interaction facilitates the endocytosis of ISM1 into endothelial cells, where it disrupts ATP exchange in mitochondria, leading to apoptosis (Menghuan2023Advances). ISM1 also interacts with αvβ5 integrin, a cell surface receptor involved in vascular permeability and cell migration. The AMOP domain of ISM1, containing an 'RKD' motif, is crucial for its binding to αvβ5 integrin, which can either promote or inhibit endothelial cell functions depending on ISM1's physical state (Zhang2011Isthmin; Lansdon2018Identification).

ISM1's interaction with non-coding RNAs, such as miR-1307-3p, regulates its expression. In colon adenocarcinoma cell lines, decreased miR-1307-3p expression leads to increased ISM1 expression, promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Menghuan2023Advances). Additionally, ISM1 interacts with circRNAs like hsa_circ_0091570, which can regulate ISM1 expression by sponging miR-1307 (Menghuan2023Advances). These interactions highlight ISM1's complex role in cellular signaling and its potential impact on cancer development and progression.
