# UNKL

## Overview
The UNKL gene encodes the protein known as unk like zinc finger, which is characterized by the presence of a zinc finger domain, a structural motif commonly involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. This protein plays a crucial role in modulating gene expression and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The zinc finger domain allows the protein to interact with specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing the transcription of target genes. Given its involvement in these fundamental biological processes, alterations in the UNKL gene, such as mutations or changes in expression levels, have been associated with pathological conditions, notably cancer. These alterations can lead to dysregulation of cell proliferation and survival, contributing to oncogenesis. Ongoing research aims to further delineate the functional pathways involving UNKL and to assess its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The UNKL gene, which encodes a protein with a zinc finger domain, plays a significant role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Alterations in the expression of UNKL or mutations within this gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. These changes can disrupt normal cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, processes in which UNKL is actively involved. Such disruptions may lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation, a hallmark of cancer development. The precise mechanisms by which UNKL mutations or expression alterations contribute to oncogenesis are not yet fully understood, necessitating further research to elucidate its clinical significance. Understanding these pathways could potentially lead to novel therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Current studies are focused on exploring the extent of UNKL's involvement in different cancer types and its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis and treatment response.
