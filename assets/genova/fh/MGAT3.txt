# MGAT3

## Overview
MGAT3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme beta-1,4-mannosyl-glycoprotein 4-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, commonly referred to as N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III (GnT-III). This enzyme is a type II transmembrane protein involved in the modification of N-glycans by adding a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to the core of N-glycans, a process crucial for regulating protein folding, stability, and cell signaling (Pinho2012Loss; Stanley2004Molecular). The activity of GnT-III, which occurs in the Golgi apparatus, plays a significant role in cellular communication and organismal development by influencing processes such as cell-cell interaction and immune response (You2021Exosomal; Pinho2012Loss). Alterations in MGAT3 expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Tang2023Transcriptomic; Klasić2016DNA).

## Structure
The MGAT3 gene encodes the enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:β-D-mannoside β 1-4 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III), which is involved in the formation of bisecting GlcNAc structures on N-linked oligosaccharides. This enzyme is a type II transmembrane protein, characterized by a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and a large luminal catalytic domain (Stanley2004Molecular). The primary structure of GnT-III includes a DxD motif, which is indicative of a GT-A fold, a common structural feature among nucleotide sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases (Nagae20203D). The enzyme also contains a proline-rich region between the transmembrane helix and the catalytic domain, although the full crystal structure has not yet been solved (Nagae20203D).

The MGAT3 protein is known to undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is crucial for its function. It has three N-glycan sites and several motifs that may be modified by phosphorylation (Stanley2004Molecular). The enzyme's structure and function are influenced by these modifications, which play a role in its activity and interaction with other cellular components. The detailed atomic structure of MGAT3 remains to be elucidated to fully understand its substrate recognition and catalytic mechanisms (Nagae20203D).

## Function
The MGAT3 gene encodes the enzyme N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III (GnT-III), which plays a crucial role in the modification of N-glycans by adding a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to the core of N-glycans. This modification is significant in regulating protein folding, stability, and cell signaling, impacting cellular communication and organismal development (Klasić2016DNA; Pinho2012Loss). 

GnT-III-mediated glycosylation is particularly important for the function of E-cadherin, a key cell adhesion molecule. The addition of bisecting GlcNAc structures by GnT-III enhances E-cadherin's stability and function at the cell surface, promoting cell-cell adhesion and maintaining the epithelial phenotype. This process is vital during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), where changes in MGAT3 expression and E-cadherin glycosylation influence cellular phenotype transitions (Pinho2012Loss).

The activity of MGAT3 occurs in the Golgi apparatus, where it influences processes like cell-cell interaction and immune response. By modulating glycan structures, MGAT3 plays a role in suppressing metastasis and maintaining epithelial characteristics, which are crucial for normal cellular function and organismal development (You2021Exosomal; Pinho2012Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and methylation of the MGAT3 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MGAT3 is significantly overexpressed due to hypomethylation of its promoter region. This upregulation is linked to changes in glycosylation patterns, which may contribute to cancer development and progression (Klasić2016DNA). Similarly, in pancreatic cancer, MGAT3 is overexpressed in tumor samples compared to normal tissues, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis and metastasis (Gupta2020Global).

In ovarian cancer, MGAT3-mediated glycosylation of the CD82 protein at the asparagine 157 site has been shown to inhibit metastasis. Reduced expression of MGAT3 in metastatic ovarian tumors suggests that its downregulation may promote cancer spread (Li2020MGAT3mediated).

Beyond cancer, MGAT3 expression is also implicated in Alzheimer's disease, where altered glycosylation patterns are observed. The gene's expression correlates with specific glycomic changes in the brain, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis (Tang2023Transcriptomic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MGAT3 in various pathological conditions, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
MGAT3, encoded by the human gene MGAT3, is involved in specific protein interactions within the Golgi apparatus. It forms complexes with other MGAT proteins, notably interacting with MGAT2. This interaction is competitive, as MGAT1 and MGAT3 both compete for binding to the same interface on MGAT2, indicating a specific sub-complex formation (KhoderAgha2019Nacetylglucosaminyltransferases). MGAT3 also participates in a ternary complex with MGAT2 and MAN2A2, suggesting that MAN2A2 acts as a central hub for MGAT interactions, facilitating the formation of multi-enzyme-transporter assemblies in the Golgi membranes (KhoderAgha2019Nacetylglucosaminyltransferases).

In the context of disease, MGAT3's product, GnT-III, is implicated in the regulation of Notch signaling in ovarian cancer. GnT-III modifies Notch receptors through bisecting glycosylation, affecting their levels and activity. This modification influences the localization and activation of Notch receptors, which are crucial for cancer stem cell maintenance and tumor progression (Allam2017The). The interaction between MGAT3 and Notch signaling components highlights its role in cancer biology, where it may serve as a potential therapeutic target (Allam2017The).
