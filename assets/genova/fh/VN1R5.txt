# VN1R5

## Overview
The VN1R5 gene encodes the vomeronasal 1 receptor 5, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is involved in olfactory signaling. This receptor is part of the vomeronasal type-1 receptor (VN1R) family, which is responsible for detecting specific volatile compounds, such as aliphatic aldehydes and alcohols, in humans (Shirokova2007The). Although VN1R5 is expressed in olfactory model systems, its precise biological role in humans remains uncertain due to the limited number of functional VN1R genes and the absence of a functional TRPC2 channel, which is crucial for vomeronasal signaling in other species (Shirokova2007The). Beyond its potential olfactory functions, VN1R5 has been implicated in the regulation of long non-coding RNAs and the development of cisplatin resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), highlighting its significance in cancer biology (Jiang2022lncRNA).

## Function
The VN1R5 gene is part of the human vomeronasal type-1 receptor (VN1R) family, which is involved in detecting volatile compounds. In humans, VN1R5, along with other VN1Rs, is expressed in HeLa/Olf cells, a model system used to study olfactory signaling. These receptors are activated by specific combinations of volatile compounds, particularly aliphatic aldehydes and alcohols, but not by acids, esters, lactones, pyrazines, steroids, amines, and camphor (Shirokova2007The). The activation of VN1R5 and other VN1Rs leads to the stimulation of the cAMP signaling pathway via G proteins αolf/αs, which is distinct from the signaling pathway observed in mouse vomeronasal receptors (Shirokova2007The).

The VN1R5 receptor shows a selective response profile, indicating a potential role in detecting specific volatile compounds in humans, possibly contributing to olfactory signaling pathways (Shirokova2007The). However, the biological significance of VN1R5 in humans remains unclear, and it may not have a significant physiological function due to the non-functional TRPC2 channel in humans and the low number of functional VN1R genes compared to other species (Shirokova2007The).

## Clinical Significance
The VN1R5 gene has been implicated in the development of cisplatin resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Studies have shown that VN1R5 is highly expressed in cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cells compared to cisplatin-sensitive ones. This upregulation is associated with a lower 5-year survival rate in patients, indicating its potential role as a biomarker for poor prognosis (Jiang2022lncRNA). VN1R5 transcriptionally regulates the expression of the long noncoding RNA lnc-POP1-1 through the activation of the specificity protein 1 (Sp1) transcription factor via the cAMP/PKA pathway. The upregulation of lnc-POP1-1 promotes cisplatin resistance by interacting with the MCM5 protein, inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation, and facilitating DNA repair (Jiang2022lncRNA).

Functional experiments have demonstrated that knocking out VN1R5 in cisplatin-resistant cells increases sensitivity to cisplatin, while overexpression enhances resistance. In vivo experiments support these findings, showing that tumor volumes and weights are lower in VN1R5 knockout groups under cisplatin treatment (Jiang2022lncRNA). These results suggest that VN1R5 plays a significant role in mediating cisplatin resistance in HNSCC, making it a potential therapeutic target for reversing resistance (Jiang2022lncRNA).

## Interactions
VN1R5, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in the regulation of the long non-coding RNA lnc-POP1-1 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). VN1R5 influences the expression of lnc-POP1-1 through its interaction with the transcription factor Sp1. This interaction is mediated via the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signaling pathway, where VN1R5 activates Sp1, leading to increased transcriptional activity of the lnc-POP1-1 promoter (Jiang2022lncRNA).

lnc-POP1-1, upregulated by VN1R5, interacts with the DNA repair protein MCM5. This interaction inhibits the ubiquitination of MCM5, slowing its degradation and enhancing DNA repair processes. This mechanism is crucial for the development of cisplatin resistance in HNSCC cells (Jiang2022lncRNA). The VN1R5-lnc-POP1-1-MCM5 axis is a key pathway in modulating the response of HNSCC cells to cisplatin treatment, highlighting the role of VN1R5 in facilitating cisplatin resistance through these molecular interactions (Jiang2022lncRNA).
