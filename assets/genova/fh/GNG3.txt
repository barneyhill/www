# GNG3

## Overview
GNG3 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit gamma 3, a component of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in intracellular signaling pathways. The G protein subunit gamma 3 is a crucial part of the G protein complex, which plays a significant role in signal transduction by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, thereby activating downstream cellular responses. This protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it is involved in critical processes such as coupling receptors to calcium channel activity and participating in pathways like the GABAergic synapse and p75 NTR receptor-mediated signaling. The structural characteristics of the G protein subunit gamma 3, including its interaction with the beta subunit and post-translational modifications, contribute to its multifunctionality in various signaling pathways (Hansen2010Specificity; Fonin2019Multifunctionality). GNG3's involvement in neurological functions and its implications in diseases such as glioblastoma and Alzheimer's disease underscore its importance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Chen2020Identification; Singh2022Differential).

## Structure
The GNG3 gene encodes the gamma 3 subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, which are involved in intracellular signaling. The primary structure of GNG3 includes a sequence of amino acids that exhibit significant sequence variability among human Gγ subunits, with a predicted disorder rate of 29.3% (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). In its Gβ-bound form, the GNG3 protein undergoes a disorder-to-order transition, forming a highly extended α-helical structure. This structure is characterized by a coiled-coil formation with the N-terminal tail of the Gβ subunit, indicating that the tertiary and quaternary structures of GNG3 are dependent on its interaction with Gβ subunits, forming part of a heterodimeric complex (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

The structural diversity of GNG3 is primarily concentrated in the N-terminal third of the protein, which may be responsible for specific interactions with α subunits and effectors (Hansen2010Specificity). The N-termini of γ subunits, including GNG3, may undergo post-translational modifications, such as prenylation, which are crucial for their functional association with receptors (Hansen2010Specificity). These modifications and the structural flexibility contribute to the multifunctionality of the GNG3 protein in various signaling pathways.

## Function
The GNG3 gene encodes the gamma 3 (γ3) subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, which are integral to signal transduction processes in cells. These proteins are involved in exchanging GDP for GTP, thereby activating downstream effectors that lead to various cellular responses, including the elevation of cytosolic calcium levels (Royland2008Gene). The γ3 subunit is particularly active in the brain, where it is abundantly expressed in neurons and plays a crucial role in coupling receptors to changes in calcium channel activity (Schwindinger2004Mice). This subunit is involved in pathways such as the GABAergic synapse and p75 NTR receptor-mediated signaling, which are important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal neurological function (Hu2018Gene).

In healthy human cells, GNG3 is active at the cell membrane, where it helps regulate signal transduction pathways that are essential for various cellular processes, including sensory perception, cell growth, and hormone response. The protein's involvement in these pathways suggests its significant role in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions, particularly in the brain (Royland2008Gene; Schwindinger2004Mice).

## Clinical Significance
GNG3, the gene encoding the gamma subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), GNG3 is identified as a potentially significant gene, with its downregulation observed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This suggests a role in GBM pathogenesis, possibly through its involvement in the GABAergic synapse pathway and interactions with other genes (Chen2020Identification). However, its expression level does not significantly correlate with overall survival in GBM patients (Chen2020Identification).

In medulloblastoma, particularly the SHH subtype, GNG3 is part of a gene signature that accurately predicts disease progression, indicating its importance in this cancer subtype (Li2021Gene). GNG3 is also deregulated in Alzheimer's disease, where it may affect the retrograde endocannabinoid signaling pathway, contributing to disease progression (Singh2022Differential). Additionally, GNG3 is associated with brain aging, as its expression is significantly downregulated in the aging brain, suggesting a potential role in age-related cognitive decline (Hu2018Gene). These findings highlight GNG3's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various neurological and oncological conditions.

## Interactions
The GNG3 protein, specifically the gamma 3 subunit of G proteins, is involved in various interactions within the brain, primarily as part of the G protein beta-gamma (βγ) dimer. This dimer plays a crucial role in signal transduction by targeting the alpha subunit to the membrane, recognizing receptors, activating effectors, and modulating signal intensity or duration (Schwindinger2004Mice). The gamma 3 subtype is predominantly expressed in neurons and is involved in coupling receptors to changes in calcium channel activity. In vitro studies suggest that GNG3 functions in several heterotrimer combinations, such as αo2β1γ3, α13β1γ3, and αq/11β1/3γ3 (Schwindinger2004Mice).

In Gng3 knockout mice, the absence of the gamma 3 subunit leads to reduced levels of β2, β1, and αi3 subunits in certain brain regions, indicating specific interactions with these subunits (Hansen2010Specificity; Schwindinger2004Mice). The loss of GNG3 results in small compensatory increases in the levels of gamma 2 and gamma 7 proteins, although these are insufficient to compensate for the loss of gamma 3 (Hansen2010Specificity). These interactions highlight the unique role of GNG3 in receptor signaling pathways and its distinct functions compared to other gamma subtypes.
