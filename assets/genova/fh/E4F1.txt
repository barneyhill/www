# E4F1

## Overview
E4F1 is a gene that encodes the E4F transcription factor 1, a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding, and it functions as both a transcription factor and an atypical ubiquitin E3 ligase. E4F transcription factor 1 plays a pivotal role in regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, and cellular metabolism, particularly through its interactions with the p53 protein and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. It is essential for maintaining epidermal stem cells and skin homeostasis, as well as for the DNA damage response in certain cancer cells. The protein's involvement in these critical pathways underscores its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, such as cancer, where it is often overexpressed and contributes to tumor survival and resistance to therapy (GoguetRubio2016E4F1mediated; Hatchi2011E4F1; Le2006E4F1).

## Structure
E4F1 is a 120 kDa protein characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, specifically nine C2H2 or C2HC Kruppel-like zinc fingers, which are likely involved in DNA binding (Le2006E4F1). These zinc finger domains do not show obvious sequence similarities with the functional domains of known E3 ligases, such as RING, HECT, or U-Box domains (Le2006E4F1). A region located at the N terminus of E4F1 (amino acids 30-80) presents similarities with the catalytic core domain of the SUMO E3 ligase RanBP2, which is crucial for its ubiquitin E3 activity (Le2006E4F1).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which influences its DNA binding activity and interactions with other proteins, such as the adenovirus E1A proteins (Rooney2020Multiple). E4F1 can form homodimers, as seen in the 50 kDa N-terminal product, p50E4F1, which is a homodimer of an N-terminal proteolytic fragment of E4F1 (Rooney2020Multiple).

E4F1 also exists in different isoforms due to splice variants, which may lead to distinct functional roles in cellular processes (Rooney2020Multiple). These structural features and modifications enable E4F1 to participate in various regulatory interactions and functions within the cell.

## Function
E4F1 (E4F transcription factor 1) is a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis in healthy human cells. It functions as both a transcription factor and an atypical ubiquitin E3 ligase, influencing gene expression and protein stability. E4F1 is involved in modulating the activity of the p53 protein, a key regulator of the cell cycle and apoptosis. Unlike typical E3 ligases, E4F1 does not promote p53 degradation but instead stimulates its oligo-ubiquitylation at specific lysine residues, which affects p53's transcriptional activity. This modification directs p53 towards promoting cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis, thereby playing a crucial role in the cellular decision-making process between growth arrest and apoptosis (Le2006E4F1).

E4F1 is also essential for maintaining epidermal stem cells (ESCs) and skin homeostasis. It regulates the metabolic status of basal keratinocytes, ensuring proper skin function and preventing ESC exhaustion. E4F1's role in skin homeostasis is linked to its regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which is crucial for cellular metabolism (GoguetRubio2016E4F1mediated; Lacroix2010Transcription). In the absence of E4F1, there is a disruption in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, leading to skin defects (Lacroix2010Transcription).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the E4F1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. E4F1 is overexpressed in various cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it is crucial for leukemic cell survival. Its inactivation in leukemic cells leads to mitochondrial defects, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cell death, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in leukemia (Hatchi2011E4F1). In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), E4F1 regulates the ATM/ATR-CHK1 signaling pathway, and its depletion increases sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, highlighting its role in DNA damage response and potential in sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapy (Batnini2022MultiLevel).

E4F1 also plays a role in coordinating mitochondrial functions and genome surveillance checkpoints, particularly in p53-deficient tumors. Its regulation of CHK1 is crucial for cancer cell survival, and targeting E4F1 could be a strategy for treating such tumors (Rodier2015The). In hematopoietic cells, E4F1 is essential for cell survival and genome integrity, with its deletion leading to acute bone marrow aplasia and death, underscoring its critical role in hematopoietic cell function (Grote2015E4F1).

## Interactions
E4F1 interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It acts as an atypical ubiquitin E3 ligase for the p53 protein, modulating its effector functions without promoting degradation. E4F1 stimulates the ubiquitylation of p53 on lysines distinct from those targeted by Hdm2, specifically on the lysine cluster K319-K321. This ubiquitylation is associated with chromatin and influences p53's transcriptional activity, leading to cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis (Le2006E4F1).

E4F1 also interacts with the CHK1 kinase, affecting its stability and activity, and regulates the expression of genes involved in the ATM/ATR-CHK1 signaling pathway, such as CHEK1, TTI2, and PPP5C. These interactions are crucial for the DNA damage response and replication stress checkpoint pathways in triple-negative breast cancer cells (Batnini2022MultiLevel).

In the context of adenovirus E1A oncoproteins, E4F1, specifically the p50E4F1 form, interacts with E1A proteins to regulate the E4 promoter. This interaction involves the CR3 domain of E1A289R and is mediated through phosphorylation within the DNA binding domain of p50E4F1 (Rooney2020Multiple).
