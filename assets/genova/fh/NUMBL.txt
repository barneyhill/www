# NUMBL

## Overview
NUMBL, or NUMB-like endocytic adaptor protein, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily functioning as an adaptor protein. This protein plays a critical role in the internalization and recycling of membrane proteins, influencing key signaling pathways such as NF-κB and angiogenesis. NUMBL is essential for regulating cellular activities like cell migration, invasion, and osteoclast differentiation by modulating the ubiquitination and degradation of specific signaling proteins (van2015Regulation; Swarnkar2017NUMBL). Additionally, NUMBL is significant in neurogenesis, where it helps maintain neural progenitor cells, ensuring their self-renewal during embryonic development (Petersen2002Progenitor). Through its interactions with various proteins, NUMBL influences processes such as apoptosis, osteoclastogenesis, and the degradation of growth factor receptors, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and development (Basavarajappa2023The; Hirai2017Adaptor).

## Function
NUMBL (NUMB like endocytic adaptor protein) is involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily functioning as an adaptor protein that facilitates the internalization and recycling of membrane proteins. In healthy human cells, NUMBL plays a significant role in regulating NF-κB signaling pathways. It interacts with proteins such as TRAF5, TRAF6, and NEMO, promoting their K48-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, which results in the suppression of NF-κB activation. This regulatory mechanism is crucial for controlling processes like cell migration and invasion, as well as osteoclast differentiation (Swarnkar2017NUMBL).

NUMBL is also involved in angiogenesis by regulating the function of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR2 and VEGFR3). It enhances the recycling of VEGFR2 to the cell surface, thereby maintaining its signaling activity and promoting endothelial cell proliferation and vessel growth. This function is essential for proper angiogenic signaling and vascular development (van2015Regulation).

In the context of neurogenesis, NUMBL, along with its homolog Numb, is crucial for maintaining neural progenitor cells. It helps progenitor cells choose progenitor over neuronal fates, ensuring the self-renewal of these cells during embryogenesis (Petersen2002Progenitor).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
NUMBL, or NUMB-like endocytic adaptor protein, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. NUMBL interacts with Mig6, a protein implicated in pancreatic beta cell apoptosis under glucolipotoxicity (GLT) conditions. This interaction is dynamic, showing a strong association under normal glucose conditions and a weaker one under GLT conditions (Basavarajappa2023The). NUMBL also interacts with TRAF6, a key component of NF-κB signaling, promoting its polyubiquitination and activation of NF-κB signaling, which leads to beta cell apoptosis under GLT conditions (Basavarajappa2023The).

In osteoclastogenesis, NUMBL acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling by interacting with TAK1, TRAF6, and NEMO. It promotes the degradation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), leading to the accumulation of the transcription factor RBPJ and repression of NFATc1 (Swarnkar2017NUMBL). NUMBL also interacts with TAB2, inhibiting TNFα and IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation (Ma2008NUMBL).

NUMBL is involved in targeting ERBB2 for degradation, crucial for cell cycle withdrawal. It interacts with Rab7 proteins, facilitating the transition of ERBB2 from early to late endosomes (Hirai2017Adaptor). These interactions highlight NUMBL's role in regulating various signaling pathways and cellular processes.
