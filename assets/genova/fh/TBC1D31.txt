# TBC1D31

## Overview
TBC1D31 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 31, which is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and metabolic regulation. The protein belongs to the TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain family, which is known for its role in regulating Rab GTPases, a group of proteins involved in vesicular trafficking. TBC1 domain family member 31 has been implicated in oncogenic pathways, particularly in cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer and prostate adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive cancer phenotypes (Hou2021Integrative; Lupi2024TBC1). Additionally, the gene is involved in exon skipping events in Alzheimer's disease, although the implications of these events are not yet fully understood (Yang2021ExonSkipAD).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TBC1D31 has been implicated in various cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). In TNBC, TBC1D31 is frequently overexpressed and is associated with a worse prognosis. It is identified as an independent predictor of poor clinical outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. The gene's overexpression in TNBC is linked to enhanced glycolytic metabolism, which is a characteristic of aggressive cancer phenotypes (Lupi2024TBC1). 

In prostate adenocarcinoma, TBC1D31 shows a positive correlation between copy number variations (CNVs) and gene expression levels, indicating that CN amplifications may lead to higher expression of the gene. This correlation suggests that TBC1D31 could serve as a prognostic biomarker in PRAD (Hou2021Integrative). 

Additionally, TBC1D31 is described as playing an oncogenic role in cancer progression, with its expression upregulated in prostate, breast, and bladder cancers. It accelerates cell growth by activating signal transduction pathways, and its degradation is mediated by CUL7 E3 ubiquitin ligase, which inhibits growth factor receptor expression (Shi2020The). 

The gene is also involved in exon skipping events in Alzheimer's disease, although the clinical significance of these events remains unclear (Yang2021ExonSkipAD).
