# SDK1

## Overview
SDK1, or sidekick cell adhesion molecule 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). The SDK1 protein plays a pivotal role in mediating cell-cell adhesion, particularly within the nervous system, where it is crucial for the formation and maintenance of neural circuits. Its structure is characterized by an extracellular region with multiple immunoglobulin and fibronectin type III domains, which facilitate homodimerization and cell adhesion. This protein is notably involved in synaptic specificity and neuronal connectivity, especially in the retina, where it contributes to the precise targeting and localization of synapses. SDK1's interactions with PDZ domain-containing proteins further underscore its importance in synaptic function. Alterations in the SDK1 gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Yamagata2020Structure; Goodman2016Molecular).

## Structure
The SDK1 protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). Its molecular structure includes an extracellular region with six immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and thirteen fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, followed by a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain ending in a PDZ binding motif (Yamagata2020Structure; Goodman2016Molecular). The Ig domains are arranged in a horseshoe conformation, characterized by anti-parallel interactions between the Ig1-2 and Ig3-4 domains, which are crucial for dimerization and cell adhesion (Goodman2016Molecular). The FNIII domains, each composed of about 90 amino acids, are common in extracellular matrix molecules and cell surface adhesion molecules (Yamagata2020Structure).

The cytoplasmic domain of SDK1 is approximately 200 amino acids long and includes a unique C-terminal hexapeptide sequence, -GFSSFV, which contains a tripeptide motif (-SXV) that binds to PDZ domain proteins (Yamagata2020Structure). Post-translational modifications of SDK1 may include glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Yamagata2020Structure). The protein's structure is essential for its role in cell-cell adhesion, particularly in the retina, where it forms homodimers through its Ig domains (Goodman2016Molecular).

## Function
SDK1 (sidekick cell adhesion molecule 1) is a crucial protein involved in mediating cell-cell adhesion, particularly in the nervous system. It plays a significant role in the formation and maintenance of neural circuits, especially in the retina, where it contributes to synaptic specificity and the establishment of neuronal connections (Yamagata2020Structure; Goodman2016Molecular). SDK1 functions by forming homodimers through interactions between its Ig-domain regions, specifically the Ig1-4 horseshoe regions, which are essential for its adhesive properties (Goodman2016Molecular). These interactions facilitate both cis clustering on the same cell surface and trans interactions between adjacent cells, ensuring precise cell adhesion and preventing inappropriate contacts (Goodman2016Molecular).

In the retina, SDK1 is expressed in specific types of interneurons and retinal ganglion cells, where it is involved in sublaminar targeting and synaptic localization (Yamagata2020Structure; Yamagata2019Expression). The protein's role in synaptic localization is further supported by its interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins, which are crucial for its function at synaptic sites (Yamagata2010Synaptic). SDK1's involvement in these molecular processes is vital for maintaining proper neural connectivity and function in healthy cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SDK1 gene are associated with a range of diseases and conditions. In neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders, SDK1 polymorphisms have been linked to autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and motion sickness. The gene is also upregulated in the nucleus accumbens following chronic cocaine use in mice, suggesting a role in addiction and depression. Overexpression of SDK1 in the ventral hippocampus has been shown to increase stress vulnerability, indicating its involvement in stress-related conditions (Yamagata2020Structure).

SDK1 is identified as hyperfragile, with frequent DNA double-strand breaks in neural stem/progenitor cells, potentially impacting neurodevelopment and neural functions. Chromosomal anomalies involving SDK1, such as microduplication at 7p22.1, are linked to intellectual disability and other developmental issues (Yamagata2020Structure).

In oncology, SDK1 mutations are frequently observed in various cancers, including malignant mesothelioma, adrenocortical carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma, indicating a potential role in oncogenesis. Gene fusions involving SDK1, such as with the AMACR gene in prostate cancer, have been noted, although their causal relationship with cancer progression remains unclear (Yamagata2020Structure). A novel SDK1-ALK fusion in a lung adenocarcinoma patient showed an excellent response to the ALK inhibitor SAF-189s, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting such fusions (Ma2022SDK1ALK).

## Interactions
SDK1 (sidekick cell adhesion molecule 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and synaptic specificity. SDK1 interacts with PDZ domain-containing proteins, such as members of the PSD-95 and MAGI protein families. These interactions are mediated by the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of SDK1, which is essential for synaptic localization and function (Goodman2016Molecular; Yamagata2010Synaptic).

The homophilic binding of SDK1 is a key feature, where SDK1 forms dimers through its N-terminal immunoglobulin domains (Ig1-4) in a horseshoe conformation. This interaction is crucial for cell-cell adhesion and clustering, with the Ig1-2 domains providing most of the binding affinity and specificity (Goodman2016Molecular). The Ig1:Ig1 interface, particularly the N22 residue, plays a critical role in dimer formation, and mutations at this site can disrupt dimerization and reduce cell adhesion (Goodman2016Molecular).

SDK1 also forms cis clusters on the cell surface, which are dependent on the Ig1-4 dimer interaction. These clusters are important for maintaining specificity in cell-cell interactions, particularly in the crowded synaptic layers of the central nervous system (Yamagata2020Structure; Goodman2016Molecular).
