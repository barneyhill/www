# JMJD4

## Overview
The JMJD4 gene encodes the protein jumonji domain containing 4, which is a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing protein family. This protein functions primarily as a hydroxylase, playing a critical role in the post-translational modification of proteins. Unlike other members of the JmjC family that are often involved in chromatin modification, JMJD4 is specifically involved in the hydroxylation of the translational termination factor eRF1, which is essential for accurate protein synthesis termination (Hu2016Global). Additionally, JMJD4 interacts with proteins such as Hsp70 and pyruvate kinase PKM2, influencing protein stability and turnover through mechanisms like chaperone-mediated autophagy (Di2024To). These functions underscore the importance of JMJD4 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring proper cellular differentiation and development.

## Function
JMJD4 is a protein involved in the post-translational modification process, specifically through hydroxylation. It functions as a hydroxylase, acting on the translational termination factor eRF1, which plays a crucial role in translational termination by hydroxylating this factor (Hu2016Global). This activity is essential for the proper termination of protein synthesis, ensuring that translation stops at the correct point on the mRNA, which is vital for maintaining the fidelity of protein production in cells.

JMJD4 shares 34% sequence identity with JMJD6, another member of the Jumonji domain-containing protein family, but it has distinct functions, particularly in the context of translation rather than transcription or splicing (Hu2016Global). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences cellular processes by modifying specific proteins involved in translation. This activity is crucial for cellular differentiation and development, as it ensures that proteins are synthesized correctly and efficiently, which is necessary for the proper functioning and growth of cells. The role of JMJD4 in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting normal organismal development.

## Interactions
JMJD4 is known to interact with the heat shock protein Hsp70. This interaction is significant in the context of protein turnover, specifically involving the pyruvate kinase PKM2. JMJD4 hydroxylates the lysine residue K66 of PKM2, which promotes its degradation through a chaperone-mediated autophagy mechanism. This process highlights JMJD4's role in regulating protein stability and turnover, rather than histone modification, which is a common function among other members of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing family (Di2024To).

There is no evidence from the provided context that JMJD4 interacts with nucleic acids or participates in multiprotein complexes related to chromatin or transcriptional regulation. The focus of JMJD4's known interactions is primarily on its role in protein hydroxylation and turnover, distinguishing it from other JmjC domain proteins that are more directly involved in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation (Di2024To).
