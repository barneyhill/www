# TMEM14A

## Overview
TMEM14A is a gene located on chromosome 6 (6p12.2) of the human genome, encoding the transmembrane protein 14A. This protein is characterized by its three transmembrane domains, which facilitate its integration into cellular membranes, particularly within the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (Woo2011TMEM14A). As a transmembrane protein, TMEM14A plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, primarily by inhibiting apoptosis through the stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential (Woo2011TMEM14A). The protein's evolutionary conservation across species underscores its fundamental biological significance (Woo2011TMEM14A). TMEM14A is also implicated in various cellular processes, including energy production and apoptosis regulation, and has been associated with cancer progression, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer, where it influences tumorigenic pathways and cellular metabolism (Zhang2022TMEM14A; Xu2021Circular).

## Structure
TMEM14A is a transmembrane protein encoded by the TMEM14A gene, located on chromosome 6 (6p12.2) of the human genome. The gene comprises 300 base pairs and encodes a protein consisting of 99 amino acids (Woo2011TMEM14A). The Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART) has identified three transmembrane domains within the TMEM14A protein, which are essential for its association with cellular membranes (Woo2011TMEM14A). These domains suggest a role in maintaining the protein's structural integrity and function within the membrane.

TMEM14A is highly conserved across species, showing significant similarity to homologous proteins in Bos taurus, Mus musculus, and Rattus norvegicus, indicating its evolutionary importance (Woo2011TMEM14A). Subcellular localization studies have demonstrated that TMEM14A is associated with mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, although no specific target sequences for subcellular localization have been identified (Woo2011TMEM14A).

The protein's role in inhibiting apoptosis is linked to its ability to stabilize the mitochondrial membrane potential and prevent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, crucial steps in the apoptotic pathway (Woo2011TMEM14A). However, specific details regarding the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
TMEM14A is a transmembrane protein primarily localized to the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum in human cells, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Woo2011TMEM14A). It is involved in the regulation of apoptosis, acting as an inhibitor of cell death processes. TMEM14A suppresses Bax-mediated apoptosis by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential, preventing the release of cytochrome c, and inhibiting the activation of caspase-3, although it does not affect the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Woo2011TMEM14A). This suggests that TMEM14A helps maintain mitochondrial membrane potential in a ROS-independent manner, thereby contributing to cell survival under stress conditions.

The protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental biological role (Woo2011TMEM14A). Structurally, TMEM14A contains three transmembrane domains, which are essential for its association with cellular membranes (Woo2011TMEM14A). Its involvement in cellular energy production and apoptosis highlights its importance in cell biology, particularly in processes that require the maintenance of mitochondrial function and integrity. TMEM14A's role in these molecular processes underscores its potential impact on organismal outcomes, particularly in conditions where apoptosis resistance is beneficial, such as in certain stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of TMEM14A have been implicated in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Studies have shown that TMEM14A expression is elevated in NSCLC tissues, contributing to cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This upregulation is associated with poor prognosis in patients. TMEM14A is involved in oncogenic pathways mediated by circular RNAs such as circ_0003645 and circFOXM1, which act as competing endogenous RNAs to sponge specific microRNAs, leading to increased TMEM14A expression. In the case of circ_0003645, it sponges miR-1179, resulting in elevated TMEM14A levels, which facilitates NSCLC cell progression (An2019Elevation). Similarly, circFOXM1 regulates TMEM14A expression through its interaction with miR-132-3p, promoting tumorigenesis in NSCLC. The knockdown of circFOXM1 reduces TMEM14A expression, thereby inhibiting cancer cell growth and increasing apoptosis, effects that can be reversed by TMEM14A overexpression (Zhong2021Circular). These findings suggest that TMEM14A plays a significant role in NSCLC pathogenesis and could serve as a potential target for therapeutic interventions. The regulatory axes involving TMEM14A highlight its importance in the molecular mechanisms underlying NSCLC progression.

## Interactions
TMEM14A interacts with various molecules and pathways, playing a significant role in cancer progression. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TMEM14A is regulated by several circular RNAs (circRNAs) through microRNA (miRNA) sponging mechanisms. Circ_0001421 acts as a sponge for miR-409-3p, which targets TMEM14A, thereby influencing NSCLC cell activities such as colony formation, migration, invasion, and glycolysis (Xu2021Circular). Similarly, circFOXM1 regulates TMEM14A expression by sponging miR-132-3p, affecting NSCLC cell proliferation and apoptosis (Zhong2021Circular). Another circRNA, circ_0003645, promotes NSCLC progression by sponging miR-1179, leading to increased TMEM14A expression (An2019Elevation).

In ovarian cancer, TMEM14A enhances tumorigenicity by promoting glycolysis and interacting with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Its expression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to proteins such as survivin, LDHA, β-catenin, and c-Myc. Silencing TMEM14A reduces these protein levels and decreases tumor growth, while its overexpression has the opposite effect (Zhang2022TMEM14A).
