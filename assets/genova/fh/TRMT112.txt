# TRMT112

## Overview
TRMT112 is a gene that encodes the tRNA methyltransferase activator subunit 11-2, a small, evolutionarily conserved protein that functions as a co-factor and activator for various methyltransferases (MTases) involved in the methylation of rRNA, tRNA, and proteins. This protein is characterized by its ability to form heterodimeric complexes with several MTases, enhancing their enzymatic activity and stability. The TRMT112 protein is crucial for ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis, playing a significant role in cellular growth and proliferation. It is involved in the methylation processes necessary for the maturation of rRNA and the proper functioning of the translation machinery. The protein's interactions with its partners are facilitated by its structural domains, including a Zn-knuckle domain, which is conserved across different life forms (Bourgeois2017Trm112; Brūmele2021Human).

## Structure
The TRMT112 protein is a small, evolutionarily conserved protein that acts as a co-factor and activator for various methyltransferases (MTases) involved in rRNA, tRNA, and protein methylation (Brūmele2021Human). It is organized into two domains: a Zn-knuckle domain and a second domain formed by α-helices (Bourgeois2017Trm112). The Zn-knuckle domain is conserved across the three domains of life and is composed of a short α-helix packed against a curved anti-parallel β-sheet. In the isolated form of TRMT112, the β-sheet consists of three β-strands, but in complex with MTase partners, it adopts a different conformation with a fourth β-strand (Bourgeois2017Trm112).

TRMT112 forms heterodimers with several partners in mammalian cells, including N6AMT1, WBSCR22, METTL5, ALKBH8, THUMPD2, THUMPD3, and TRMT11 (Brūmele2021Human). The interaction between TRMT112 and its partners involves a large hydrophobic cluster, which increases the solubility and stability of the partner proteins (Brūmele2021Human). This interaction also enhances the binding of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to the TRMT112-MTase complex (Brūmele2021Human). The protein's structure allows it to interact with MTases sharing less than 20% sequence identity, highlighting its interaction plasticity (Bourgeois2017Trm112).

## Function
TRMT112 is a crucial component in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in human cells. It functions as an activator for several methyltransferases, forming heterodimeric complexes that are essential for the methylation of tRNA and rRNA. In particular, TRMT112 interacts with WBSCR22 to stabilize it, which is necessary for the proper processing and maturation of 18S rRNA, a critical step in the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit (Zorbas2015The). This interaction is vital for the cleavage steps in pre-rRNA processing, specifically at site 3, and is required for the export and processing of ribosomal subunits (Zorbas2015The).

TRMT112 is also involved in the activation of other methyltransferases, such as Mtq2, which is important for translation termination. It enhances the binding of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to these enzymes, facilitating their methyltransferase activity (Liger2011Mechanism). The protein is active in both the nucleoplasm and a polarized perinuclear structure, excluding the nucleolus, indicating its role in various cellular compartments (Zorbas2015The). Through these interactions, TRMT112 supports cellular growth and proliferation by ensuring efficient ribosome function and protein synthesis.

## Clinical Significance
TRMT112 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in tRNA methylation. It acts as a co-factor for enzymes like TRMT11 and THUMPD2/THUMPD3, facilitating N2-methylguanine (m2G) modifications in tRNA. In pancreatic cancer, TRMT112, along with WBSCR22, inhibits cancer progression by repressing ISG15 transcription, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. However, TRMT112 is also significantly upregulated in multiple cancers, where it is associated with poorer prognosis, indicating a potential oncogenic role. These contradictory findings suggest that TRMT112's role in cancer may vary depending on the cancer type and cellular context (Yuan2024Dysregulation).

In yeast, TRMT112 is essential for the formation of 2-methylguanosine at position 10 in tRNA, working in conjunction with Trm11p. Deletion of TRMT112 leads to severe growth defects, highlighting its critical role in cellular functions beyond tRNA methylation (Purushothaman2005Trm11p). While the specific diseases associated with TRMT112 mutations in humans are not detailed, its involvement in essential cellular processes suggests that dysregulation could contribute to disease pathogenesis. Further research is needed to clarify its role in human diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
TRMT112 is a small, evolutionarily conserved protein that acts as a co-factor and activator for various methyltransferases (MTases) involved in rRNA, tRNA, and protein methylation. It forms heterodimers with several partners in mammalian cells, including N6AMT1, WBSCR22, METTL5, ALKBH8, THUMPD2, THUMPD3, and TRMT11. These interactions are crucial for the metabolic stability and enzymatic activity of the MTases, as TRMT112 enhances the binding of S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) to the TRMT112-MTase complex, increasing the solubility and stability of the partner proteins (Brūmele2021Human).

TRMT112 interacts with N6AMT1, forming a complex that is essential for N6AMT1's methyltransferase activities. The interaction is necessary for the methylation of the glutamine residue in the GGQ motif of eukaryotic translation termination factor 1 and other proteins involved in chromatin remodeling (Leetsi2019The). TRMT112 also interacts with Bud23, enhancing its solubility and stability, which is necessary for the methylation of the 18S rRNA at position G1575, crucial for the synthesis of the small ribosome subunit (Figaro2012Trm112). The interaction with Bud23 is essential for Bud23's stability, suggesting that TRMT112 may stabilize free Bud23 or assist in delivering it to its substrate (Sardana2012The).
