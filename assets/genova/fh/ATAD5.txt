# ATAD5

## Overview
ATAD5 is a gene that encodes the ATPase family AAA domain containing 5 protein, which is a crucial component in maintaining genomic stability. The ATAD5 protein is categorized as an AAA+ ATPase and is primarily involved in the unloading of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) from DNA, a process essential for the proper progression and restart of stalled replication forks. This function is vital for preventing genomic instability, which can lead to cancer (Park2019ATAD5). The protein forms a complex with the RFC2-5 complex, known as the ATAD5-RLC, which regulates PCNA dynamics on chromatin and is involved in DNA replication and repair processes (Ryu2022Distinct). Mutations in the ATAD5 gene have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in tumorigenesis and potential as a target for cancer therapy (Maleva2016Rare; Bell2011Predisposition).

## Structure
The ATAD5 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains and motifs. It contains an AAA+ ATPase domain, which is crucial for its function in unloading PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) from DNA (Wang2024The). The protein's structure features a collar domain, which is part of the C-terminal region and is essential for binding with the RFC2-5 complex, facilitating the PCNA-unloading process (Ryu2022Distinct).

ATAD5 has unique structural elements not found in other clamp loaders, such as two locking loops (LL1 and LL2) and a plug that occupies the central chamber of the complex. These features contribute to the rigidity of the ATAD5-RFC complex, preventing DNA from entering and allowing efficient PCNA unloading (Wang2024The). The LL1 loop is a 105-residue structure that wraps around the complex, while LL2 stabilizes the A-gate, locking it shut (Wang2024The).

The ATAD5 protein also includes a non-consensus PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) motif and an extended α0-helix in the AAA+ domain, which form specific interactions with PCNA, enhancing its unloading activity (Wang2024The). The protein's quaternary structure involves forming a complex with RFC2-5, which is crucial for its function (Ryu2022Distinct).

## Function
The ATAD5 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. It functions primarily as a PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) unloader, which is essential for the proper progression and restart of stalled replication forks. This activity is crucial for preventing genomic instability, which can lead to cancer (Park2019ATAD5). ATAD5 forms a complex with RFC2-5, known as the ATAD5-RLC, which regulates the unloading of PCNA from DNA after replication. This unloading is necessary for the recruitment of RAD51 to stalled replication forks, facilitating fork regression and restart in an ATR kinase-dependent manner (Park2019ATAD5).

ATAD5 also plays a role in regulating the dynamics of DNA replication factories by modulating the level of PCNA on chromatin. It is involved in the deubiquitylation of PCNA by recruiting the ubiquitin-specific protease 1 (USP1)-USP1-associated factor (UAF1) complex to ubiquitylated PCNA, which is important for maintaining genomic stability and suppressing tumorigenesis (Lee2012ATAD5). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the proper disassembly of replication factories and efficient DNA replication (Lee2012ATAD5). ATAD5's function is critical for the regulation of DNA replication and the maintenance of genomic stability in healthy human cells (Lee2012ATAD5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATAD5 gene are associated with several types of cancer, including endometrial, breast, and ovarian cancers. Somatic mutations in ATAD5 have been identified in 4.6% of primary endometrial tumors, with a higher frequency in non-endometrioid endometrial cancers (NEECs) compared to endometrioid endometrial cancers (EECs) (Bell2011Predisposition). These mutations often result in protein truncation, leading to functional defects that may contribute to cancer development (Bell2011Predisposition).

In breast and ovarian cancer, rare missense variants of ATAD5 have been identified, with a higher prevalence in ovarian cancer patients. These variants are predicted to be pathogenic and may contribute to genetic susceptibility to these cancers (Maleva2016Rare). The study found that the frequency of these variants was highest among ovarian cancer patients (10.1%) compared to triple-negative breast cancer patients (7.9%) and controls (6.5%) (Maleva2016Rare).

ATAD5 deficiency also leads to genomic instability and increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, which is significant for cancer therapy. This sensitivity is linked to defective DNA damage repair processes, particularly in the context of oxidative DNA damage (Giovannini2020ATAD5). These findings suggest that ATAD5 plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability, and its dysfunction can predispose individuals to cancer.

## Interactions
ATAD5 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in DNA replication and repair processes. It forms a complex with the RFC2-5 complex, which is essential for unloading the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) from chromatin. The C-terminal domain of ATAD5, particularly the region from amino acids 1600 to 1844, is important for binding to RFC2-5, facilitating the stable formation of the ATAD5-RLC complex (Ryu2022Distinct).

ATAD5 also interacts with RNA helicases, including DDX1, DDX5, DDX21, and DHX9, through its UAF1 binding domain. These interactions are vital for maintaining the abundance of these helicases at replication forks, which helps resolve R-loops and ensures proper replication fork progression (Kim2020ATAD5). The ATAD5/UAF1 complex is involved in regulating R-loop levels, with UAF1 mediating interactions between ATAD5 and helicases like DDX5 (Kim2020ATAD5).

Additionally, ATAD5 interacts with RAD51, a protein involved in DNA repair, particularly under replication stress. This interaction is enhanced by hydroxyurea treatment and is crucial for recruiting RAD51 to stalled replication forks, facilitating replication fork restart (Park2019ATAD5). ATAD5's interaction with RAD51 is ATR-dependent, highlighting its role in the replication stress response (Park2019ATAD5).
