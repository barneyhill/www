# EEF1AKMT3

## Overview
EEF1AKMT3 is a human gene that encodes the enzyme eEF1A lysine methyltransferase 3, a member of the methyltransferase family. This enzyme specifically targets lysine residues on the elongation factor eEF1A, playing a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins. The methylation of eEF1A by EEF1AKMT3 is a dynamic process that can be induced under certain cellular stress conditions, such as growth factor withdrawal and endoplasmic reticulum stress, thereby influencing mRNA translation and protein synthesis (Jakobsson2018Regulation). EEF1AKMT3 is also implicated in tumor suppression, particularly in gastric cancer, where its expression is reduced, correlating with poor prognosis (Aziz2023Tumorsuppressive). The enzyme's activity and localization in the cytosol and centrosomes suggest additional roles in cellular processes beyond protein synthesis, highlighting its potential significance in various biological and pathological contexts (Jakobsson2018Regulation).

## Structure
EEF1AKMT3, also known as EEF1A lysine methyltransferase 3, is an enzyme that specifically targets lysine residues on the elongation factor EEF1A for methylation. The primary structure of EEF1AKMT3 consists of its unique amino acid sequence, which dictates its specific function and interaction with substrates. The secondary structure of EEF1AKMT3 likely includes common elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation.

The tertiary structure of EEF1AKMT3 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This folding is influenced by the presence of specific domains and folds typical of methyltransferases, such as the Rossmann fold, which is often involved in binding cofactors necessary for methylation activity. The quaternary structure of EEF1AKMT3, if applicable, would describe its assembly with other protein subunits, although specific details on this aspect are not provided.

Post-translational modifications, particularly methylation, play a significant role in modulating the function of EEF1AKMT3. These modifications can impact the enzyme's activity, stability, and interactions with other proteins. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of EEF1AKMT3 may exist, potentially altering its structure and functional properties.

## Function
The human gene EEF1AKMT3 encodes the enzyme eEF1A-KMT3, a lysine methyltransferase that specifically targets the elongation factor eEF1A, methylating lysine 165 (Lys-165) in both eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 paralogues. This methylation is dynamic and inducible, suggesting a regulatory function in response to cellular stress conditions such as growth factor withdrawal or treatment with ER stress inducers (Jakobsson2018Regulation). The enzyme requires the full eEF1 complex, including bound GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA, for efficient methylation, indicating its role in modulating protein synthesis (Jakobsson2018Regulation).

eEF1A-KMT3 is localized in the cytosol and at the centrosomes, suggesting potential roles in centrosome function and non-canonical functions of eEF1A (Jakobsson2018Regulation). The methylation of eEF1A by EEF1AKMT3 influences mRNA translation, affecting the interaction of eEF1A with aminoacyl-tRNAs and the translating ribosome, thereby modulating protein synthesis (Jakobsson2018Regulation). In knockout cells lacking EEF1AKMT3, altered translation of specific genes was observed, highlighting its importance in cellular processes (Jakobsson2018Regulation). The overall effects of eEF1A lysine methylation on mRNA translation are considered modest under near-optimal growth conditions (Jakobsson2018Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
EEF1AKMT3 has been identified as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer. Its expression is significantly decreased in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and low levels of EEF1AKMT3 expression are associated with a poor prognosis. The gene mediates the methylation of lysine residue 296 of the MAP2K7 protein, which is implicated in tumor suppression by promoting the stabilization of TP53, thereby impeding tumor activity (Aziz2023Tumorsuppressive).

In humans, EEF1AKMT3 methylates Lys165 on eEF1A, and knockout studies have shown changes in the translation of proteins related to ribosome biogenesis, chromatin, and the unfolded protein response. This suggests a role in translation elongation, although the excerpt does not directly link EEF1AKMT3 to specific diseases or conditions beyond its role in gastric cancer (Hamey2018Methylation).

While the role of EEF1AKMT3 in other diseases or conditions is not explicitly detailed, its involvement in critical cellular processes such as protein synthesis and tumor suppression indicates its potential significance in other pathological contexts. However, further research is needed to elucidate its broader clinical implications.
