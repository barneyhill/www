# GDPD3

## Overview
GDPD3 is a gene that encodes the protein glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain containing 3, which functions as a lysophospholipase D enzyme. This enzyme is integral to lipid metabolism, specifically in the hydrolysis of lysophospholipids into lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs), which are vital for various cellular processes, including membrane remodeling and energy metabolism (Beaulac2021Primed; Naka2020The). The GDPD3 protein is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the kidney, liver, and stomach (Beaulac2021Primed). Its activity is modulated by intracellular calcium levels, although it does not possess known calcium-binding domains (Beaulac2021Primed). GDPD3 plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways and has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including chronic myelogenous leukemia and neuropathic pain, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2024GDPD3; Naka2020The).

## Function
The GDPD3 gene encodes a lysophospholipase D enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of lysophospholipids into lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs), which are crucial for various cellular processes. This enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in lipid metabolism by recycling lysophospholipids into LPAs, contributing to cellular lipid homeostasis and signaling (Beaulac2021Primed; Naka2020The). GDPD3 is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and is highly expressed in tissues such as the kidney, liver, and stomach (Beaulac2021Primed).

In healthy cells, GDPD3's enzymatic activity is dependent on intracellular calcium concentrations, although it lacks known calcium-binding domains. This activity is important for maintaining cellular functions such as membrane remodeling and energy metabolism (Beaulac2021Primed). GDPD3 is also involved in the production of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which influences processes like cytoskeletal stabilization and motility in outer hair cells, potentially mitigating noise damage in the cochlea (Beaulac2021Primed). The gene's role in lipid biogenesis and its influence on cellular signaling pathways underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the GDPD3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and neuropathic pain. In CML, GDPD3 is crucial for maintaining leukemia stem cells. Studies have shown that GDPD3 is more highly expressed in CML stem cells compared to normal hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting its role in the survival and self-renewal of these cancerous cells (Naka2020The). Disruption of GDPD3 leads to decreased self-renewal capacity and affects lipid metabolism, which is essential for CML stem cell maintenance (Naka2020The). The gene's deficiency also enhances the effectiveness of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in CML treatment (Naka2020The).

In the context of neuropathic pain, GDPD3 deficiency has been shown to alleviate pain by promoting a shift from pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization to anti-inflammatory M2 polarization. This shift is associated with reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting a role for GDPD3 in inflammatory responses (Li2024GDPD3). The deficiency also influences the PPARγ pathway, which is involved in inflammation and lipid metabolism, providing a potential therapeutic approach for managing neuropathic pain (Li2024GDPD3).
