# ZSWIM9

## Overview
ZSWIM9 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger SWIM-type containing 9 protein, which is part of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of a SWIM domain. This domain is typically involved in protein-protein interactions and may play a role in various cellular processes, although the specific functions of the ZSWIM9 protein remain largely undefined. The gene is located on chromosome 19q13.32q13.33, a region associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions (Guadagnolo2023Duplication). ZSWIM9 is highly expressed in the human brain, suggesting a potential role in neurological functions and disorders. Alterations in its expression have been linked to cognitive and psychiatric disorders, as well as cancer, indicating its possible involvement in diverse biological pathways (Neumann2023Multivariate; Giulietti2024Effects).

## Clinical Significance
ZSWIM9 has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions. A study identified a novel duplication at the 19q13.32q13.33 chromosomal region, which includes ZSWIM9, in a family with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric phenotypes. This suggests that ZSWIM9 might play a role in these conditions due to its high expression in the human brain and its location in a proposed critical region for intellectual disability (Guadagnolo2023Duplication). However, the specific role of ZSWIM9 in neuropsychiatric conditions remains uncertain, as it encodes a protein with unknown function.

In another study, decreased expression of ZSWIM9 was associated with higher non-Alzheimer's disease synaptic functioning scores. This expression profile was linked to increased risk for Alzheimer's disease, lower educational attainment, lower cognitive ability, and higher risk of major depressive disorder (Neumann2023Multivariate). These findings suggest that alterations in ZSWIM9 expression may contribute to cognitive and psychiatric disorders.

Additionally, ZSWIM9 expression was found to be downregulated in metastatic breast cancer cells treated with eribulin, although the specific implications of this downregulation in cancer or other diseases were not detailed (Giulietti2024Effects).
