# GPATCH2L

## Overview
GPATCH2L is a gene that encodes the protein G-patch domain containing 2 like, which is characterized by the presence of a glycine-rich RNA-binding motif known as the G-patch domain. This protein is primarily involved in RNA processing and splicing, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression by influencing RNA maturation and stability. The GPATCH2L protein is active in the nucleus and is implicated in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and normal cellular processes. It interacts with various proteins and RNA molecules, contributing to cellular homeostasis and organismal health. The gene has been associated with several pathological conditions, including Parkinson's disease, scleroderma renal crisis, and intervertebral disc degeneration, highlighting its clinical significance and the potential for therapeutic targeting (Chen2023N6methyladenosine; Jansen2017Discovery; Stern2020Analysis).

## Structure


## Function
GPATCH2L is a gene that encodes a protein involved in RNA processing and splicing, characterized by the presence of a glycine-rich RNA-binding motif known as the 'Gpatch' domain (Jansen2017Discovery). This domain facilitates the protein's interaction with RNA and other proteins involved in RNA metabolism, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression by influencing RNA maturation and stability. GPATCH2L is active in the nucleus, where it participates in maintaining normal cellular processes and overall organismal homeostasis (Jansen2017Discovery).

In healthy human cells, GPATCH2L is implicated in mitochondrial quality control. Knockdown of GPATCH2L in cell culture has been shown to increase mitochondrial roundness and impair Parkin translocation, suggesting its involvement in maintaining mitochondrial integrity (Jansen2017Discovery). Although GPATCH2L has not been extensively studied, its paralog, GPATCH2, is known to interact with RNA-processing machinery, indicating a potential similar function for GPATCH2L in RNA processing (Jansen2017Discovery). The protein's role in these molecular processes underscores its importance in cellular function and highlights the need for further research to fully elucidate its functions in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GPATCH2L gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Parkinson's disease (PD), a specific homozygous stopgain variant (p.R362X) in GPATCH2L has been identified in two PD cases, suggesting a potential role in the disease's genetic basis. This variant is rare in the general population but shows significant enrichment in PD cohorts, indicating its potential clinical significance in PD pathogenesis (Jansen2017Discovery).

In scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), GPATCH2L has been associated with genetic susceptibility, particularly in individuals positive for anti-RNA polymerase III autoantibodies. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the GPATCH2L region showed a nominally significant association with SRC, and increased expression of GPATCH2L protein was observed in renal biopsy specimens from SRC patients (Stern2020Analysis).

In intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), the circular RNA form of GPATCH2L, known as circGPATCH2L, is involved in regulating DNA damage and apoptosis in nucleus pulposus cells. Its overexpression leads to increased DNA damage and apoptosis, contributing to IVDD progression. Targeting circGPATCH2L has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for IVDD (Chen2023N6methyladenosine).

## Interactions
The GPATCH2L gene encodes a protein that participates in several interactions, particularly in the context of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). One of the key interactions involves circGPATCH2L, a circular RNA derived from the GPATCH2L gene, which binds to the TRIM28 protein. This interaction occurs specifically within the amino acid region 402-452 of TRIM28 and plays a significant role in regulating DNA damage repair and apoptosis in nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) (Chen2023N6methyladenosine).

The binding of circGPATCH2L to TRIM28 inhibits the phosphorylation of TRIM28 at Ser824, which is crucial for the DNA damage response. This interaction also prevents the binding of MDM2 to TRIM28, leading to the accumulation of P53 and promoting apoptosis (Chen2023N6methyladenosine). Additionally, circGPATCH2L is subject to regulation by m6A methylation, which affects its degradation through interactions with the YTHDF2-RPL10-RNase P/MRP complex. This complex facilitates the endoribonucleolytic cleavage of m6A-methylated circGPATCH2L, maintaining the physiological state of NPCs (Chen2023N6methyladenosine).

These interactions highlight the role of GPATCH2L in cellular processes related to RNA processing and protein interactions, particularly in pathological conditions like IVDD.
