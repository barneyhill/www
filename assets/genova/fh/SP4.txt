# SP4

## Overview
The SP4 gene encodes the Sp4 transcription factor, a member of the Sp/KLF family of transcription factors, which is characterized by its ability to bind GC-rich promoter regions in DNA. The Sp4 protein is distinguished by its three C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding, and two glutamine-rich transcription activation domains that enable its function as a transcriptional activator. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression, particularly in neural development and function, by modulating processes such as synaptic plasticity and neuronal differentiation (Safe2005Sp; Suske2005Mammalian). The SP4 gene is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including the regulation of receptor expression and pain response, and has been associated with psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (Zhou2009Transcription; Le2015Chronic). Understanding the function and regulation of SP4 is crucial for elucidating its role in health and disease.

## Structure
The SP4 transcription factor is a member of the Sp/KLF family, characterized by its molecular structure, which includes three C2H2-type zinc finger motifs in the DNA-binding domain. These zinc fingers facilitate binding to GC-rich promoter regions, a common feature among Sp family proteins (Safe2005Sp; Suske2005Mammalian). The SP4 protein also contains two glutamine-rich transcription activation domains, which are involved in its role as a transcriptional activator (Solomon2008A; Zhou2004Reduced).

The primary structure of SP4 shares approximately 50% homology with Sp1, indicating a significant degree of similarity in their amino acid sequences (Zhou2004Reduced). The presence of a Buttonhead (BTD) box near the zinc fingers is noted, although its function remains unknown (Suske2005Mammalian). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the activity of SP4, affecting its function and localization (Safe2005Sp).

Alternative splicing may result in different isoforms of SP4, which could influence its functional roles and cellular localization, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Safe2005Sp). The structural features of SP4, including its zinc finger motifs and activation domains, are crucial for its role in gene regulation.

## Function
The SP4 transcription factor is a member of the Sp/KLF family, which binds to GC-rich motifs in DNA to regulate gene expression. In healthy human cells, SP4 plays a crucial role in neural development and function, influencing processes such as synaptic plasticity and neuronal differentiation. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates the transcription of genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Sheehan2019Transcription).

SP4 is involved in the regulation of the 5-HT1A receptor expression through its interaction with the promoter region of the gene. It acts as a transcriptional repressor, and its activity is modulated by DNA methylation at specific CpG sites. Methylation of these sites reduces SP4's repressor activity, leading to increased transcription of the 5-HT1A receptor, which is crucial for regulating brain serotonergic tone (Le2015Chronic).

In sensory neurons, SP4 regulates the expression of the TRPV1 gene, which is involved in detecting noxious stimuli. SP4 binds to the TRPV1 promoter region, influencing its transcriptional activity. This regulation is essential for maintaining normal pain responses and is implicated in the persistence of hyperalgesic states (Chu2011Transcription; Sheehan2019Transcription).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SP4 gene have been implicated in several psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). Studies have shown that SP4 is a susceptibility gene for these conditions, with specific alleles and haplotypes linked to increased risk (Zhou2009Transcription). Reduced SP4 expression has been observed in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex of individuals with BD, suggesting a role in the disorder's pathophysiology (Pinacho2011The). In mice, reduced SP4 expression leads to deficits in sensorimotor gating and contextual memory, which are relevant to psychiatric disorders (Zhou2004Reduced).

SP4 mutations, particularly loss-of-function mutations, result in widespread gene expression changes in the brain, affecting synaptic and neuronal signaling pathways. These changes are associated with impaired glutamatergic signaling and altered presynaptic function, which are significant in the context of SCZ and BD (Kwon2024Mutiomics). The SP4 gene also influences the expression of NMDA receptors, with reduced expression linked to impaired NMDA neurotransmission, a feature observed in schizophrenia (Zhou2010Reduced). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SP4 in psychiatric disorders and suggest that targeting SP4 could be a novel therapeutic approach.

## Interactions
SP4, a member of the Sp/KLF family of transcription factors, is known to interact with specific DNA motifs, particularly GC-rich regions, to regulate gene expression. It binds to the promoter region of the PHF14 gene, facilitating its transcription. This interaction has been confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation-qRT-PCR assays, demonstrating that SP4 directly associates with the PHF14 promoter in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines (Wei2023SP4). SP4's role in activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is mediated through its promotion of PHF14 transcription, which in turn influences the expression of Wnt3a and β-catenin, key components of this pathway (Wei2023SP4).

In breast cancer cells, SP4 expression is regulated by microRNA-27a (miR-27a). Transfection with antisense miR-27a decreases SP4 protein levels, while a miR-27a mimic increases its expression. This regulation is significant as it affects the expression of survival and angiogenic genes, highlighting a potential mechanism for modulating SP4 activity in cancer cells (MertensTalcott2007The). These interactions underscore SP4's involvement in critical cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
