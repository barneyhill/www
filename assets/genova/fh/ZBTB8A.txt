# ZBTB8A

## Overview
ZBTB8A is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 8A, a transcriptional repressor involved in cellular differentiation and development. The protein is characterized by the presence of a BTB domain, which facilitates homodimerization and interactions with corepressors, and multiple zinc finger domains that bind specific DNA sequences. These structural features categorize ZBTB8A as a member of the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing family, which primarily functions in the nucleus to modulate transcriptional activity (Mance2024Dynamic). The BTB domain of ZBTB8A is notable for its ability to form dynamic filaments, promoting the clustering of ZBTB proteins into nuclear foci, which are associated with repressive chromatin (Mance2024Dynamic). Clinically, ZBTB8A has been implicated in oncogenesis, particularly through gene fusions such as ZBTB8A-BRAF, which activate pathways involved in cancer development (Efanov2017Investigation). Despite its recognized roles, the full spectrum of ZBTB8A's functions and its implications in human diseases remain areas of active research (Mance2024Dynamic).

## Structure
The ZBTB8A protein is characterized by the presence of a BTB domain at the N terminus and multiple zinc finger (ZF) domains towards the C terminus. The BTB domain is involved in homodimerization and interactions with corepressors, while the ZF domains bind to specific DNA sequences (Mance2024Dynamic). The BTB domain of ZBTB8A forms dimers that can assemble into higher-order structures, such as helical filaments, through C2-symmetric head-to-head and tail-to-tail interactions, resulting in nonpolar filaments (Mance2024Dynamic). These filaments are dynamic, forming spontaneously and reversibly into short chains, with their size dependent on local concentration (Mance2024Dynamic).

The BTB domain's structure has been crystallized, revealing a dimer with non-crystallographic 2-fold rotational symmetry, similar to other ZBTB proteins (Mance2024Dynamic). The interdimer interaction involves highly conserved surfaces among ZBTB8A orthologues, with specific contacts necessary for higher-order assembly, including a hydrophobic four-helix bundle and a β-sheet involving an 'LDI motif' (Mance2024Dynamic). The protein's linker region between the BTB and ZF domains is intrinsically disordered and contains potential sites for post-translational modifications, particularly SUMOylation, which may contribute to gene repression (Mance2024Dynamic).

## Function
ZBTB8A is a transcriptional repressor that plays a significant role in cellular differentiation and development. It is part of the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing family, which primarily functions in the nucleus to modulate transcriptional activity. The BTB domain of ZBTB8A is crucial for its function, facilitating homodimerisation and interactions with corepressors, which are essential for its repressive activity (Mance2024Dynamic).

ZBTB8A is involved in the formation of dynamic filaments through its BTB domain, which promotes the clustering of ZBTB proteins. This filamentation is important for the protein's localization within the nucleus, particularly at the nucleolar periphery, a region associated with repressive chromatin (Mance2024Dynamic). The dynamic filamentation of the BTB domain is a key driver in the nuclear localization and function of ZBTB8A, affecting its ability to regulate gene expression (Mance2024Dynamic).

The protein's filamentation propensity is conserved among its paralogues, suggesting a functional role in clustering ZBTB proteins, although the specific function of ZBTB8A in healthy human cells is not fully elucidated (Mance2024Dynamic). The BTB domain-mediated clustering might also impact post-translational modifications, such as SUMOylation, which could further regulate its activity (Mance2024Dynamic).

## Clinical Significance
ZBTB8A has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. The gene is involved in transcriptional regulation, and its dysregulation can contribute to oncogenesis. In the context of post-Chernobyl thyroid cancer, a novel gene fusion involving ZBTB8A and BRAF, known as ZBTB8A-BRAF, has been identified. This fusion is significant as it activates the MAPK pathway, which plays a crucial role in cancer development (Efanov2017Investigation). The ZBTB8A-BRAF fusion is also noted in radiation-induced papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target, especially in cases resistant to conventional treatments (Liu2021Kinase).

The structural properties of ZBTB8A, particularly its BTB domain, suggest a role in protein clustering and potential oncogenic activity. The BTB domain's ability to form dynamic filaments may facilitate interactions that promote cancerous transformations, although the exact clinical implications of these interactions require further investigation (Mance2024Dynamic). Despite these findings, the direct clinical significance of ZBTB8A mutations in human diseases remains underexplored, necessitating additional research to fully understand its role in disease pathogenesis (Mance2024Dynamic).

## Interactions
ZBTB8A, a member of the ZBTB protein family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions primarily through its BTB domain. This domain facilitates the formation of homodimers and higher-order assemblies, which are crucial for its function in transcriptional repression and protein clustering. The BTB domain of ZBTB8A has been shown to form dynamic homotypic filaments, which promote the clustering of ZBTB proteins into nuclear foci. These foci are characterized by slow molecular exchange, as demonstrated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, and are important for the protein's localization and function within the nucleus (Mance2024Dynamic).

The BTB domain's ability to form dimers and filaments is mediated by specific interdimer interactions, which are essential for the structural integrity and clustering of ZBTB8A. These interactions involve a conserved interface that includes hydrophobic contacts and a β-sheet formed by the LDI motif, which are critical for the assembly of ZBTB8A into higher-order structures (Mance2024Dynamic). The filamentation of ZBTB8A is also influenced by the presence of a serine residue at position 103, which is a potential marker for filamentation and is conserved across related proteins (Mance2024Dynamic).
