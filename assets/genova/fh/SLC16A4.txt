# SLC16A4

## Overview
SLC16A4 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 16 member 4, which is part of the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in the transport of monocarboxylates such as lactate and pyruvate across cell membranes, playing a crucial role in cellular metabolism and pH regulation (Halestrap2013The). SLC16A4, like other members of the MCT family, is a transmembrane protein that requires interaction with the chaperone protein basigin (CD147) for proper localization and function at the plasma membrane (Böhme2020Membrane). The gene has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor metabolism and microenvironment, making it a potential target for cancer therapy (Yu2020Comprehensive). Despite its association with tumor aggressiveness, SLC16A4's role in cancer is complex, as evidenced by its paradoxical association with better survival rates in certain cancers like head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Clatot2014The).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC16A4 gene, part of the solute carrier family, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), elevated expression of SLC16A4 has been paradoxically associated with better survival rates, despite its usual association with tumor aggressiveness (Clatot2014The). This suggests a complex role in tumor biology, potentially linked to the tumor microenvironment or metabolic adaptations. The gene's expression was found to be higher in non-proliferative tumor cells or cancer-associated fibroblasts, indicating a non-uniform expression pattern across HNSCC samples (Clatot2014The).

In pancreatic cancer, SLC16A4 expression levels are increased, although the specific clinical significance of this alteration is not fully detailed (Yu2020Comprehensive). The SLC16A gene family, to which SLC16A4 belongs, is involved in cancer metabolism, with aberrant expression linked to tumor cell growth and migration (Yu2020Comprehensive). These findings highlight the potential of SLC16A4 as a prognostic marker and its involvement in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells, warranting further research to elucidate its precise role in cancer progression and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SLC16A4, a member of the solute carrier family 16, is known to interact with the glycoprotein basigin (CD147), which acts as a chaperone to mediate its localization and activity at the plasma membrane. This interaction is crucial for the proper function of SLC16A4, particularly in the context of cancer, where it facilitates the efflux of lactate and protons, contributing to the acidification of the tumor microenvironment (Böhme2020Membrane). The interaction with basigin is similar to other monocarboxylate transporters in the SLC16 family, such as MCT1 and MCT4, which also require basigin for their functional expression at the plasma membrane (Halestrap2013The). While specific protein-protein interactions involving SLC16A4 beyond its association with basigin are not detailed in the available literature, the role of basigin as a chaperone highlights the importance of protein interactions in the regulation of SLC16A4's activity and its contribution to cancer cell metabolism and progression. The potential for SLC16A4 to participate in other interactions remains an area for further research, particularly in the context of its elevated expression in certain cancers (Yu2020Comprehensive).
