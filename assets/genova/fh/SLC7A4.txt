# SLC7A4

## Overview
SLC7A4 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 7 member 4, which is part of the solute carrier family 7 (SLC7), known for including cationic amino acid transporters (CATs). Despite its structural similarity to other members of the SLC7 family, SLC7A4 does not exhibit the typical transport activity associated with these proteins, as it does not facilitate the transport of cationic, neutral, or acidic amino acids when expressed in various experimental systems (WOLF2002Expression; Closs2006Structure). The protein is characterized by a predicted 14 transmembrane domain structure, with both termini located intracellularly, and is localized to the plasma membrane (Closs2006Structure). Although its precise physiological role remains unclear, SLC7A4 has been implicated in clinical contexts such as cancer prognosis and congenital anomalies, suggesting potential, yet unidentified, functions in cellular processes and disease (Köllges2023Exome; Lavoro2023In). Further research is necessary to elucidate the functional significance of SLC7A4 in human biology.

## Structure
SLC7A4 is a member of the solute carrier family 7 (SLC7), which includes cationic amino acid transporters (CATs). The protein is predicted to have 14 transmembrane domains (TMs) with both the N- and C-termini located intracellularly (Closs2006Structure). This structural arrangement is consistent with other members of the SLC7 family, which are characterized by a similar transmembrane topology. Although alternative models with 12 or 13 TMs have been proposed, experimental data support the 14-TM model for SLC7A4 (Closs2006Structure).

The SLC7A4 protein is localized in the plasma membrane, but unlike other CATs, it does not exhibit transport activity for cationic, neutral, or acidic amino acids when overexpressed in various human cells or Xenopus laevis oocytes. Its physiological function remains unknown (Closs2006Structure). The protein may have putative glycosylation sites, although these have not been experimentally confirmed (Closs2006Structure). There is no information available on specific domains, prominent folds, or post-translational modifications for SLC7A4, nor are there any known splice variant isoforms. The lack of polymorphisms in the coding region suggests that the protein's function does not tolerate many alterations in its sequence (Closs2006Structure).

## Function
The SLC7A4 gene, also known as hCAT-4, is a member of the human solute carrier family 7, which includes cationic amino acid transporters. Despite its sequence homology with other transporters in this family, SLC7A4 does not exhibit transport activity for cationic, neutral, or anionic amino acids, nor for polyamines, when expressed in various experimental systems such as Xenopus laevis oocytes and human glioblastoma cells (WOLF2002Expression). This lack of transport activity is not due to insufficient protein expression, as SLC7A4-EGFP fusion proteins show similar subcellular localization and expression levels as functional hCAT-EGFP proteins (WOLF2002Expression).

The precise function of SLC7A4 in healthy human cells remains unclear. It is suggested that SLC7A4 may not function as an amino acid transporter or may require additional protein factors to be functional (WOLF2002Expression). The presence of SLC7A4 in the plasma membrane alone is not sufficient to mediate amino acid transport activity, indicating a potential different or unknown function in cellular processes (WOLF2002Expression). Further research is needed to elucidate its role in cell biology and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
The SLC7A4 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer and congenital anomalies. In cancer, SLC7A4 expression levels have been associated with patient outcomes. It is identified as a favorable prognostic marker in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), where its expression is positively correlated with overall survival and progression-free interval, suggesting a potential protective role in these cancers (Lavoro2023In).

In the context of congenital anomalies, a novel heterozygous frameshift variant in the SLC7A4 gene, specifically c.1087delC (p.Arg363fster68), has been identified in an individual with Cloacal Bladder Exstrophy (CBE). This variant leads to early termination of the protein and is classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) due to the lack of functional data and proof of de novo occurrence. Although SLC7A4 is located in a chromosomal region associated with congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract (CAKUT) and bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC), no single base variant in SLC7A4 has been definitively linked to these phenotypes (Köllges2023Exome). Further research is needed to clarify the clinical significance of SLC7A4 variants.

## Interactions
The SLC7A4 protein, a member of the solute carrier family 7, has been studied for its potential interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of forming functional transport complexes. Despite its sequence homology with other cationic amino acid transporters (hCATs), SLC7A4 does not exhibit amino acid transport activity when expressed alone in Xenopus laevis oocytes or human glioblastoma cells, suggesting that it may require interaction with additional protein factors to function as a transporter (WOLF2002Expression). 

The study of SLC7A4 in Xenopus laevis oocytes indicated that the protein is correctly targeted to the plasma membrane and glycosylated, yet it does not mediate the transport of amino acids or polyamines. This lack of activity was not due to insufficient expression or mislocalization, leading to the hypothesis that SLC7A4 might need to interact with another protein to form an active transporter. However, attempts to create chimeric proteins between SLC7A4 and hCAT-2 isoforms did not result in transport activity, suggesting that SLC7A4 does not interact with other proteins to mediate transport under the tested conditions (WOLF2002Expression). 

Overall, the current evidence suggests that SLC7A4 does not participate in significant physical interactions with other proteins to facilitate amino acid transport in the experimental setups studied.
