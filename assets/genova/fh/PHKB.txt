# PHKB

## Overview
The PHKB gene encodes the beta subunit of phosphorylase kinase, a regulatory protein complex that plays a pivotal role in glycogen metabolism. This kinase is categorized as a regulatory enzyme, crucial for the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, which facilitates the conversion of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate during glycogenolysis. The beta subunit, encoded by PHKB, is integral to the regulation of the enzyme's activity, modulating its function through phosphorylation and interaction with other subunits within the phosphorylase kinase complex (Wüllrich‐Schmoll1996Structure; Burwinkel1997Autosomal). The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the liver and muscle, and is subject to alternative splicing, which may result in tissue-specific isoforms (Arends2022A). Mutations in PHKB are linked to glycogen storage disease type IX, underscoring its clinical significance in energy metabolism and genetic disorders (Kishnani2019Diagnosis).

## Structure
The PHKB gene encodes the beta subunit of phosphorylase kinase, a regulatory protein involved in glycogen metabolism. The primary structure of the PHKB protein consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by 30 exons, with some exons subject to tissue-specific differential splicing (Burwinkel1997Autosomal). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common structural motifs in proteins. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these elements, contributing to the protein's functional conformation.

The quaternary structure of phosphorylase kinase involves its assembly as a hexadecameric holoenzyme composed of four different subunits: α, β, γ, and δ. The β subunit, encoded by PHKB, plays a regulatory role, while the γ subunit possesses catalytic activity (Arends2022A). The PHKB protein contains regulatory domains and is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions.

Splice variant isoforms of PHKB result from alternative splicing events, particularly involving exon 25, leading to different transcript variants. The b isoform, encoded by variant 2, is likely the predominant form (Winchester2007In). These structural features and modifications are crucial for the protein's role in glycogen metabolism.

## Function
The PHKB gene encodes the beta subunit of phosphorylase kinase, an enzyme complex that plays a crucial role in glycogen metabolism. In healthy human cells, phosphorylase kinase is responsible for activating glycogen phosphorylase, which is essential for the breakdown of glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate, a key step in glycogenolysis (Wüllrich‐Schmoll1996Structure; Burwinkel1997Autosomal). This process is vital for maintaining energy homeostasis, particularly in liver and muscle tissues, where glycogen serves as a significant energy reserve (Arends2022A).

The beta subunit of phosphorylase kinase, encoded by PHKB, acts as a regulatory component of the enzyme complex. It modulates the enzyme's activity through phosphorylation by protein kinase A, which is crucial for the enzyme's response to regulatory signals (Wüllrich‐Schmoll1996Structure). The PHKB gene is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, muscle, brain, and heart, and some of its exons are subject to tissue-specific splicing, which may influence the enzyme's activity in different tissues (Burwinkel1997Autosomal).

In the cytoplasm, the proper function of the PHKB gene ensures normal glycogenolysis and energy availability, particularly during fasting states when glycogen stores are mobilized to produce glucose (Arends2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PHKB gene are associated with glycogen storage disease type IX (GSD IX), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by phosphorylase kinase (PhK) deficiency. This condition primarily affects the liver and muscle, leading to symptoms such as hepatomegaly, growth retardation, and hypoglycemia. Despite the presence of severe mutations, such as nonsense mutations, single-base insertions, and splice-site mutations, the clinical phenotype is often mild, with patients typically showing improvement with age (Kishnani2019Diagnosis; Burwinkel1997Autosomal).

The PHKB gene is large, consisting of multiple exons, and is expressed in various tissues, resulting in tissue-specific isoforms. Mutations in PHKB can lead to a deficiency in PhK activity, which is crucial for glycogen metabolism. This deficiency is most commonly observed in the liver, but muscle involvement can also occur, although symptoms are usually mild or absent (Wüllrich‐Schmoll1996Structure; Kishnani2019Diagnosis).

In some cases, cardiac manifestations such as interventricular septal hypertrophy have been reported in patients with PHKB-related GSD IX. Genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis are recommended for families affected by this condition, with a recurrence risk of 25% for parents who have had an affected child (Kishnani2019Diagnosis).

## Interactions
The PHKB gene encodes the beta subunit of phosphorylase kinase, which is involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism. The beta subunit plays a crucial role in the phosphorylase kinase (PhK) complex, interacting with other subunits, particularly the catalytic gamma subunit. The N-terminal region of the beta subunit (residues 1-31) interacts with the C-terminal regulatory domain of the gamma subunit (γCRD), which is essential for the allosteric regulation of the gamma subunit (Nadeau2007Evidence). This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation at serine residues, notably Ser11 and Ser26, which can disrupt inhibitory interactions and promote beta-beta interactions necessary for PhK activation (Nadeau2007Evidence).

The beta subunit also participates in self-association, mediated by its N-terminal and C-terminal regions. The N-terminal region, particularly residues 1-31, inhibits self-association, while phosphorylation or mutation of serine residues in this region can promote dimerization (Nadeau2007Evidence). Additionally, the beta subunit interacts with calmodulin (CaM), a calcium-binding messenger protein, through regulatory peptides, influencing the structural and functional dynamics of the PhK complex (Juminaga1994The). These interactions highlight the beta subunit's role in the complex regulatory network of phosphorylase kinase.
