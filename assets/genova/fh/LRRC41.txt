# LRRC41

## Overview
LRRC41 is a gene that encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat containing 41, which is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat motifs. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. LRRC41 interacts with the Elongin BC complex and forms part of a ubiquitin ligase complex, which is crucial for the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of target proteins (Kamura2001MUF1). The protein's ability to assemble with different cullin complexes, such as Cul3, Cul2, and Cul5, further underscores its involvement in post-translational modification and regulatory mechanisms within the cell (Reitter2024A). Additionally, LRRC41 has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its potential significance in clinical research and therapeutic development (Li2023Targeting).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The LRRC41 gene is significantly overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a prevalent and deadly form of liver cancer. This overexpression is associated with disease progression, recurrence, metastasis, and poor prognosis in HCC patients (Li2023Targeting). The gene's expression is positively correlated with stemness marker genes such as SOX9, CD44, and EpCAM, which are linked to HCC progression (Li2023Targeting). High levels of LRRC41 expression are also associated with advanced stages of HCC and metastasis, contributing to poorer overall survival rates in patients (Li2023Targeting).

LRRC41's role in HCC may involve its interaction with the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, crucial for cell proliferation and survival, suggesting that targeting LRRC41 could be a promising therapeutic strategy (Li2023Targeting). Molecular docking studies have identified several FDA-approved drugs, such as oxiglutathione and thymopentin, that show potential antitumor effects by targeting LRRC41 (Li2023Targeting). Despite these findings, the specific function of LRRC41 in HCC progression remains unclear, necessitating further research to explore its role and potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis and prognostic prediction (Li2023Targeting).

## Interactions
LRRC41, also known as Muf1, is a leucine-rich repeat protein that participates in various protein interactions. It is known to interact with the Elongin BC complex, which is a heterodimer composed of Elongin B and Elongin C proteins. This interaction is facilitated by a BC-box motif present in LRRC41, similar to the SOCS-box found in other proteins (Kamura2001MUF1). LRRC41 can assemble with Cul5 and Rbx1 to form a ubiquitin ligase complex, which exhibits ubiquitin ligase activity by activating ubiquitylation through the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc5 (Kamura2001MUF1).

The protein is also involved in complexes with Cul3, Cul2, and Cul5, and serves as a substrate for the Cul3 complex with the BTB protein RhoBTB3 (Reitter2024A). These interactions suggest that LRRC41 plays a role in protein synthesis and post-translational modification, particularly in the context of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (Kamura2001MUF1). The interactions of LRRC41 extend beyond the Cul3 complex, indicating its potential involvement in various cellular processes and regulatory mechanisms (Reitter2024A).
