# PAQR7

## Overview
PAQR7 is a gene that encodes the protein progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 7, also known as membrane progesterone receptor alpha (mPRα). This protein is a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family and is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, which are typical of this receptor family. Unlike traditional G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), PAQR7 is involved in non-genomic signaling pathways mediated by G proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell migration, proliferation, and calcium regulation. The protein's structure includes a unique eighth hydrophobic motif that may facilitate G protein coupling and activation. PAQR7 is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, such as peripheral nerve regeneration, vascular smooth muscle relaxation, and cell cycle regulation in reproductive tissues. Its expression and function have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, where it may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (AbouFadel2023Key; Castelnovo2021Membrane; Pang2019Role; Smith2008Heterologous; Thomas2022Membrane).

## Structure
The PAQR7 protein, also known as membrane progesterone receptor alpha (mPRα), is a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family. It is characterized by a core structure of seven transmembrane domains, which is a common feature among PAQR family members (Smith2008Heterologous). The protein's topology has been a subject of debate, with initial analyses suggesting an extracellular N-terminal and intracellular C-terminal, similar to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, more recent studies propose that the N-terminal is intracellular, supported by the 'positive-inside rule' and structural analyses (Thomas2022Membrane).

PAQR7 also features an additional eighth hydrophobic motif at the C-terminus, which is proposed to be a transmembrane domain involved in G protein coupling and activation (Thomas2022Membrane; Smith2008Heterologous). This structural feature distinguishes it from other PAQR family members that do not activate G proteins (Thomas2022Membrane).

The protein is involved in rapid, non-genomic signaling pathways mediated by G proteins, although it is not part of the GPCR superfamily (Thomas2022Membrane). The presence of a zinc-binding domain in the binding pocket is suggested to play a role in progesterone binding (Aickareth2023Membrane). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can affect its function and localization.

## Function
PAQR7, also known as membrane progesterone receptor α (mPRα), is a membrane receptor involved in various cellular processes through non-genomic signaling pathways. In human Schwann cell-like differentiated adipose stem cells (SCL-ASC), PAQR7 is upregulated and primarily localized to the cell membrane, where it plays a crucial role in promoting cell migration, proliferation, and the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These activities are essential for peripheral nerve regeneration, as they enhance cellular responses to treatments that promote these processes (Castelnovo2021Membrane).

PAQR7 is also involved in the regulation of calcium levels in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). It mediates the effects of progesterone, leading to a decrease in intracellular calcium levels, which is crucial for muscle relaxation. This process involves the inhibition of L-type calcium channels and the activation of MAP kinase/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways (Pang2019Role).

In human granulosa/luteal cells, PAQR7 interacts with PGRMC1 and PGRMC2 in the cytoplasm, playing a significant role in regulating the cell cycle by mediating progesterone's ability to suppress cell cycle entry (Sueldo2015Progestin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PAQR7 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In liver cancer, PAQR7 is significantly upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to normal liver tissues, suggesting its potential as an HCC-specific biomarker. This upregulation is associated with decreased survival in HCC patients, indicating its prognostic significance (AbouFadel2023Key). In contrast, PAQR7 expression is decreased in other liver cancer subtypes, such as combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA), where it is at its lowest abundance (AbouFadel2023Key).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, PAQR7, also known as membrane progesterone receptor alpha (mPRα), plays a neuroprotective role in Parkinson's disease models. It mediates protective effects through the activation of ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, which are crucial for reducing oxidative stress and cell death in neuronal cells (Castelnovo2023Progesterone). These findings suggest that PAQR7 could be a potential target for therapeutic strategies in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in these conditions.

## Interactions
PAQR7, also known as membrane progesterone receptor alpha (mPRα), is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function. It forms complexes with progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) and PGRMC2, which are crucial for its role in mediating the effects of progesterone on human granulosa cells. These interactions are significant for suppressing cell cycle entry in these cells (Sueldo2015Progestin). PAQR7 is also associated with inhibitory G proteins (Gi), which are involved in its signaling pathways. This interaction is demonstrated by the close association of PAQR7 with Gi proteins in vascular smooth muscle cells, as shown by in situ proximity ligation assays (Pang2018Progesterone).

In the context of neuroprotection, PAQR7 interacts with signaling pathways involving the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK kinases, which are essential for its neuroprotective effects in a Parkinson's disease model (Castelnovo2023Progesterone). The protein's interaction with PGRMC1 is also noted to facilitate its membrane localization, indirectly influencing oocyte maturation (Wang2021PAQR7:). These interactions highlight PAQR7's role in various cellular processes, including apoptosis regulation and reproductive functions.
