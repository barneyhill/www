# CISD1

## Overview
CISD1 is a gene that encodes the protein CDGSH iron sulfur domain 1, commonly referred to as mitoNEET. MitoNEET is a transmembrane protein located on the outer mitochondrial membrane and is a member of the NEET protein family. It is characterized by its unique CDGSH domain, which coordinates a [2Fe-2S] cluster essential for its function in iron-sulfur cluster transfer and homeostasis. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating mitochondrial function, cellular metabolism, and maintaining iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance. MitoNEET's interactions with other proteins, such as the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1) and iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), underscore its involvement in mitochondrial dynamics and iron metabolism. The gene's dysregulation has been linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Nechushtai2020The; Bitar2023Ironsulfur; Karmi2018The).

## Structure
The CISD1 gene encodes the mitoNEET protein, which is characterized by a unique structural fold known as the NEET fold. This protein is a homodimer, meaning it forms a dimer with two identical subunits. Each monomer contains a CDGSH domain, which is crucial for coordinating a [2Fe-2S] cluster through a 3Cys:1His motif. This coordination is significant for the lability and redox activity of the cluster, impacting the protein's function in cellular processes such as iron and reactive oxygen species homeostasis (Tamir2015Structure–function; Karmi2018The).

The primary structure of mitoNEET includes 108 amino acids, with the CDGSH domain playing a central role. The secondary structure likely involves helices and loops that accommodate the Fe-S cluster. The tertiary structure is defined by the folding of the CDGSH domain and a transmembrane helix, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The quaternary structure is characterized by the homodimeric nature of mitoNEET, where two monomers interact to form the functional protein (Tamir2015Structure–function; Karmi2018The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the protein's function and stability, although specific details are not provided in the context (Cheng2017Binding).

## Function
The human gene CISD1 encodes the protein mitoNEET, which is a member of the NEET protein family. MitoNEET is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism. It is involved in regulating iron, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and calcium homeostasis, which are essential for maintaining cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics (Nechushtai2020The).

MitoNEET is a homodimeric protein that contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster, which is important for its function in iron-sulfur cluster transfer and homeostasis. This cluster is coordinated by a unique CDGSH domain, which is conserved across species and contributes to the protein's stability and function (Sengupta2018Phylogenetic; Karmi2018The). The protein's ability to transfer its [2Fe-2S] cluster to other proteins, such as NAF-1, highlights its role in maintaining iron-sulfur cluster balance within cells (Nechushtai2020The).

In healthy cells, CISD1 is implicated in maintaining mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of CISD1 leads to decreased oxidative phosphorylation, increased oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, indicating its protective role against oxidative stress and its importance in energy production (Nechushtai2020The). MitoNEET's interaction with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1) suggests its involvement in mitochondrial dynamics and cellular metabolism (Nechushtai2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CISD1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), CISD1 dysfunction is associated with mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster loss, which contributes to the pathophysiology of PD. The accumulation of iron-depleted CISD1, especially in its dimer form, is linked to impaired mitochondrial function and increased oxidative stress, exacerbating PD symptoms such as reduced climbing ability and lifespan in model organisms (Bitar2024Ironsulfur). The gene's role in mitochondrial quality control and iron metabolism is crucial, and its dysregulation can lead to neurodegenerative phenotypes (Martinez2024Mitochondrial).

In cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CISD1 acts as an oncogene. High CISD1 expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased cell proliferation and migration in LUAD. The gene's expression is negatively correlated with several immune checkpoint genes, suggesting a role in immune evasion (Jiang2022Systematic). These findings highlight CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target for both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, given its involvement in critical cellular processes such as iron homeostasis and mitochondrial function.

## Interactions
CISD1, also known as mitoNEET, is a mitochondrial protein that participates in various interactions crucial for cellular function. It forms homodimers through a disulfide bond, particularly under conditions where its iron-sulfur cluster is depleted. This dimerization is significant in the context of Parkinson's disease, as it is linked to the pathophysiological effects associated with PINK1 mutations (Bitar2024Ironsulfur; Bitar2023Ironsulfur).

CISD1 interacts with the iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), transferring its 2Fe/2S cluster to IRP1, which is essential for maintaining iron homeostasis and aconitase activity. This interaction is particularly important under oxidative stress conditions (Ferecatu2014The; Bitar2023Ironsulfur).

CISD1 is also a target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination, forming a complex with PRKN (Parkin). This interaction is enhanced by PINK1 activation and ubiquitination, playing a role in mitochondrial quality control through mitophagy (Martinez2024Mitochondrial; Bitar2024Ironsulfur).

Additionally, CISD1 interacts with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1) on the outer mitochondrial membrane, which is crucial for its role in mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism (Nechushtai2020The). These interactions highlight CISD1's involvement in redox balance, iron metabolism, and mitochondrial dynamics.
