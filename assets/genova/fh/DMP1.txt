# DMP1

## Overview
Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) is a gene that encodes the dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1, a non-collagenous protein crucial for the biomineralization of bone and dentin. This protein is primarily expressed in osteocytes and odontoblasts, where it plays a significant role in the formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix. DMP1 is characterized by its highly acidic nature and is involved in the regulation of hydroxyapatite formation, a key component of bone and dentin mineralization. The protein also plays a pivotal role in phosphate homeostasis by interacting with fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which is essential for maintaining phosphate balance in the body. Mutations in the DMP1 gene can lead to conditions such as autosomal-recessive hypophosphatemic rickets, highlighting its importance in bone and dental health (Qin2007Dentin; Zhao2011A).

## Structure
The DMP1 protein is encoded by the DMP1 gene, which consists of six exons, with exon 6 encoding the majority of the protein (Qin2007Dentin; Silvent2013The). The protein is characterized by a highly acidic nature, with numerous serine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid residues, which are potential sites for phosphorylation by casein kinases I and II (Qin2007Dentin). The full-length DMP1 protein is cleaved into two functional fragments: a 37-kDa N-terminal fragment and a 57-kDa C-terminal fragment, the latter containing 41 phosphate groups (Qin2007Dentin; Silvent2013The).

DMP1 contains several conserved motifs, including the integrin-binding RGD motif and the ASARM peptide, which are crucial for its function in mineralization and cell attachment (Silvent2013The). The protein also has a nuclear localization site and DSPP-binding sites, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation (Silvent2013The). The presence of a signal peptide encoded by exon 2 facilitates its secretion (Silvent2013The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are essential for DMP1's role in biomineralization, with the protein expected to contain 53 phosphate groups in its full-length form (Qin2007Dentin). The gene produces two splice variant isoforms, one of which lacks exon 5, and this variant is more abundant in humans (Qin2007Dentin; Silvent2013The).

## Function
Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) is a non-collagenous protein that plays a critical role in the biomineralization of bone and dentin, as well as in phosphate homeostasis. In healthy human cells, DMP1 is primarily active in osteocytes and odontoblasts, where it influences the formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix (Qin2007Dentin; Lu2008Studies). DMP1 is involved in the regulation of hydroxyapatite formation, a key component of bone and dentin mineralization. It promotes the nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals, particularly through its non-phosphorylated form, while the phosphorylated form does not affect hydroxyapatite formation (Qin2007Dentin).

DMP1 also plays a significant role in phosphate homeostasis by interacting with fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a hormone that regulates phosphate metabolism. This interaction is crucial for maintaining phosphate balance in the body, and mutations in the DMP1 gene can lead to conditions such as autosomal-recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (Qin2007Dentin; Zhao2011A). Additionally, DMP1 is involved in the maturation of osteoblasts into osteocytes, which is essential for proper bone development and mineralization (Qin2007Dentin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DMP1 gene are associated with autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR), a genetic disorder characterized by impaired phosphate homeostasis and bone mineralization issues. This condition is marked by hypophosphatemia, skeletal deformities, and normal serum vitamin D levels (Zhao2011A; Ichikawa2016A). The mutations lead to increased levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which inhibits renal phosphate reabsorption and reduces 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis, resulting in the clinical manifestations of rickets (Qin2007Dentin; Ichikawa2016A).

In Corriedale sheep, a novel nonsense mutation in the DMP1 gene was identified as the cause of inherited rickets, suggesting that similar mutations in humans could lead to ARHR (Zhao2011A). The mutation results in a truncated DMP1 protein, disrupting its function in bone mineralization and phosphate regulation (Zhao2011A). DMP1 mutations have also been linked to dental defects and enthesopathy, which involves calcification of tendons and ligaments, potentially affecting spinal movements (Unknownauthors2022FirstreportinArgentinaofapathogenicDMP1variantassociatedwithautosomalrecessivehypophosphatemicrickets). These findings highlight the critical role of DMP1 in maintaining bone and dental health.

## Interactions
Dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in biomineralization and gene regulation. DMP1 specifically binds to DNA sequences with a consensus sequence of CCCG(G/T)ATGT, similar to binding sites for Ets1 and Ets2 transcription factors, which contain a GGA core. This binding is demonstrated through electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), indicating that DMP1 forms specific complexes with DNA (Hirai1996Interaction).

DMP1 interacts with D-type cyclins, particularly cyclins D2 and D3, but not with cyclin D1. This interaction is less efficient than with the retinoblastoma protein (RB) and is not affected by mutations that disrupt RB binding, suggesting a distinct interaction mechanism (Hirai1996Interaction). DMP1 can also be phosphorylated by cyclin D-dependent kinases, which may regulate its transcriptional activity (Hirai1996Interaction).

In addition to its role in transcription, DMP1 is involved in the regulation of DSPP expression during dentinogenesis. The COOH-terminal end of DMP1 can bind to the DSPP promoter, activating its transcription, which suggests a regulatory role in DSPP expression (Prasad2010Dentin).
