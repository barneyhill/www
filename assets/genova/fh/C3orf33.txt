# C3orf33

## Overview
C3orf33, also known as AC3-33, is a human gene located on chromosome 3 that encodes a novel secretory protein involved in the regulation of transcriptional activity. The protein, also referred to as AC3-33, plays a significant role in modulating the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including proliferation, transformation, and apoptosis. AC3-33 is characterized by its ability to inhibit the transcriptional activity of specific transcription factors such as Elk1 and c-jun, thereby suppressing AP-1 activity, a key player in tumorigenesis (HU2015Analysis; Hao2010AC333). The protein is secreted and has been detected in both cell lysates and culture supernatants, indicating its role as a secretory protein. It is expressed across a range of human tissues and is conserved among several mammalian species, underscoring its potential importance in mammalian biology (Hao2010AC333). The expression of C3orf33 varies in different cancer types, suggesting its involvement in cancer pathogenesis and its potential as a biomarker for certain malignancies (HU2015Analysis).

## Function
The C3orf33 gene, also known as AC3-33, encodes a novel secretory protein involved in the regulation of transcriptional activity in human cells. This protein is implicated in modulating the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as proliferation, transformation, and death. Specifically, AC3-33 inhibits the transcriptional activity of Elk1 and c-jun, but not c-fos, through this pathway, leading to a suppression of AP-1 activity, a transcription factor involved in tumorigenesis (HU2015Analysis; Hao2010AC333).

AC3-33 is a secretory protein confirmed by its presence in both cell lysate and cell culture supernatant, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. It is expressed in various human tissues, including both normal and abnormal tissues, and is conserved across several mammalian species, indicating its potential importance in mammals (Hao2010AC333). The protein is predicted to have a molecular mass of 29.3 kDa and a pI of 9.9, with a putative signal peptide near the N terminus, suggesting its role in secretion (Hao2010AC333). The expression of C3orf33 is variable in different cancers, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis (HU2015Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
C3orf33, also known as AC3-33, has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. The gene is highly expressed in certain carcinomas, such as squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, adenocarcinoma of the rectum, and hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (HU2015Analysis). Conversely, its expression is reduced in leukemia cell lines, indicating a possible differential role in different cancer types (HU2015Analysis).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), C3orf33 is part of an 11-DNA methylation biomarker panel that serves as an independent predictor for overall survival in stage I-II patients. This suggests that methylation changes in C3orf33 may influence patient prognosis (Wang2021Identification).

The gene's expression is also influenced by chromatin states, as seen in K562 cells, where decreased active epigenetic marks lead to reduced expression of C3orf33. This indicates that chromatin modifications can significantly impact its expression levels (Wang2019Identifying).

While C3orf33 has been studied in the context of familial atrial fibrillation, it is not considered a high-priority candidate for this condition, and its clinical significance in this area remains unclear (Weeke2014Wholeexome).

## Interactions
The human gene C3orf33, also known as AC3-33, encodes a secretory protein that interacts with various transcription factors and signaling pathways. AC3-33 is known to inhibit the transcriptional activity of Elk1 and c-jun through the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway by reducing the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, while not affecting the phosphorylation of JNK/SAPK or p38 MAPK (Hao2010AC333). It also suppresses AP-1 activity by inhibiting its translocation into the nucleus or its binding with DNA, as demonstrated by diminished binding of the AP-1 complex to specific probes in the presence of AC3-33 (Hao2010AC333).

AC3-33 has been shown to significantly inhibit the transcriptional activity of AP-1, suggesting a regulatory role in the AP-1 pathway. This interaction was demonstrated using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system, which showed that overexpression of AC3-33 in human cell lines led to reduced AP-1 activity (Zhang2010Prokaryotic). The protein's ability to modulate AP-1 activity indicates its potential involvement in the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis (Zhang2010Prokaryotic). The specific physical interactions between AC3-33 and AP-1, such as whether they form a stable complex or interact transiently, are not detailed in the available data (Zhang2010Prokaryotic).
