# C1orf105

## Overview
C1orf105 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 105. While the precise biological function of this protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in various cellular processes due to its involvement in the 1q24q25 chromosomal region. This region is clinically significant as deletions here are associated with 1q24q25 deletion syndrome, which manifests in phenotypic abnormalities such as growth retardation and developmental delay (Chatron2015Refinement). The protein encoded by C1orf105 may play a role in these developmental processes, although its specific contributions are not yet clearly defined. Further research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms by which C1orf105 influences these clinical outcomes (Lefroy20181q24).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the C1orf105 gene, located on chromosome 1, is primarily associated with its involvement in the 1q24q25 deletion syndrome. This chromosomal region deletion is linked to a range of phenotypic abnormalities, including growth retardation, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Studies have identified that the intermediate region of the 1q24q25 deletion, which includes C1orf105, is particularly associated with growth retardation and developmental delay (Chatron2015Refinement). Although the specific role of C1orf105 in these conditions is not fully detailed, alterations in this region are suggested to contribute to the observed clinical features.

In a study involving a mother and son with a 672 kb microdeletion at 1q24q25, which includes C1orf105, typical skeletal features were observed without intellectual disability. This suggests that while C1orf105 and other genes in the region may be implicated in intellectual disability, the presence of skeletal features might be linked to other genetic factors, such as microRNAs encoded within the region (Lefroy20181q24). The variability in clinical presentations indicates that the deletion's impact may depend on the specific genes involved and the extent of the deletion.
