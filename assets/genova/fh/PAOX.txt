# PAOX

## Overview
The PAOX gene encodes the enzyme polyamine oxidase, a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent oxidoreductase involved in the catabolism of polyamines. Polyamine oxidase plays a critical role in the polyamine back-conversion pathway, where it oxidizes acetylated polyamines to produce spermidine and putrescine, thereby maintaining polyamine homeostasis within cells (Binda1999A; VUJCIC2003Genomic). This enzyme is primarily localized in the peroxisomes and is essential for cellular growth and differentiation due to its involvement in regulating polyamine levels, which are crucial for DNA stabilization and gene expression (Di2019Exploring; Xuan2023Polyamines:). Although PAOX is expressed at low levels in many cell types, its activity is more pronounced in certain cancer cell lines, indicating its potential role in pathological conditions (Ivanova2024Polyamine).

## Structure
The human polyamine oxidase (PAOX) enzyme is a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of approximately 55 kDa, containing a non-covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a cofactor (VUJCIC2003Genomic). The primary structure of PAOX includes a sequence of 511 amino acids (VUJCIC2003Genomic). The enzyme features a U-shaped catalytic tunnel, approximately 30 Å in length, which is integral to its function, connecting the substrate-binding and FAD-binding domains (Binda1999A). 

The secondary structure of PAOX includes elements of the Rossmann fold, a common motif in proteins that bind nucleotides, which is involved in FAD binding (Wu2003Cloning). The tertiary structure reveals a specific 3D conformation necessary for enzymatic activity, with the FAD-binding domain deeply embedded within the protein (Binda1999A). The enzyme's structure is stabilized by interactions involving specific residues, such as Glu62 and Glu170, which form a protonated pair at the tunnel's turning point (Binda1999A).

PAOX shares significant sequence homology with other FAD-dependent oxidoreductases, suggesting a similar folding topology and FAD-binding site (Binda1999A). The enzyme is involved in the polyamine back-conversion pathway, oxidizing acetylated polyamines to produce spermidine and putrescine (VUJCIC2003Genomic).

## Function
Polyamine oxidase (PAOX) is an enzyme involved in the catabolism of polyamines, which are essential for cellular growth and differentiation. In healthy human cells, PAOX primarily functions in the peroxisomes, where it catalyzes the oxidation of N1-acetylated polyamines such as N1-acetylspermine and N1-acetylspermidine. This enzymatic activity results in the production of spermidine, putrescine, and hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species that can influence cellular redox balance (Xuan2023Polyamines:; SánchezJiménez2019Polyamines).

PAOX plays a crucial role in maintaining polyamine homeostasis by regulating the levels of polyamines within cells. This regulation is important for cellular proliferation and apoptosis, as polyamines are involved in various biological processes, including DNA stabilization and gene expression (Di2019Exploring). Despite its significant role in polyamine metabolism, PAOX is expressed at low levels in many cell types, suggesting that its contribution to polyamine catabolism may be limited under normal physiological conditions (Ivanova2024Polyamine). The enzyme's activity is more pronounced in certain cell lines with elevated polyamine pools, such as neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cells (Ivanova2024Polyamine).

## Clinical Significance
The PAOX gene, encoding polyamine oxidase, plays a significant role in the metabolism of polyamines, and its genetic variations have been linked to various diseases. In the context of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), polymorphisms at the PAOX rs1046175 locus have been associated with an increased risk of the disease in the Chinese Han population. The minor allele frequency of this locus is 0.0238, and individuals with the GC/CC genotype at this site show a higher diagnostic efficacy for NSCLC when using plasma levels of N1,N12-diacetylspermine (DAS) as a biomarker. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for DAS levels is higher in these individuals compared to those with the GG genotype, suggesting that the mutant PAOX rs1046175 site may enhance NSCLC diagnosis (Wang2019Gene).

While the context does not provide specific information on PAOX's role in neurodegenerative diseases, it is known that polyamine oxidases, including PAOX, are involved in polyamine catabolism, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of this process can contribute to pathological conditions, potentially impacting cell proliferation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress responses. However, specific details on PAOX's involvement in neurodegenerative disorders are not provided in the context.
