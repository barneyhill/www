# GPR63

## Overview
GPR63 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 63, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is involved in various signaling pathways, primarily through its interaction with lipid molecules such as sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate (dhS1P), albeit with low affinity (Niedernberg2003Sphingosine). GPR63 is expressed in both central and peripheral tissues, including the brain and gastrointestinal tract, suggesting its involvement in neurological and physiological processes (Niedernberg2003Sphingosine). The receptor plays a role in calcium and cAMP signaling pathways, influencing cellular functions such as proliferation and receptor trafficking (Morri2018Optical; Li2021Identification). Clinically, GPR63 has been implicated in genetic conditions like microcephaly, where its mutations can modify disease phenotypes, particularly in the context of ciliopathies (Snedeker2019Gpr63).

## Function
GPR63 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that functions as a low-affinity receptor for sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate (dhS1P), which are known to signal through high-affinity S1P receptors (S1P1-5) and mediate various biological responses (Niedernberg2003Sphingosine). Despite its low affinity, GPR63 is considered a physiologically relevant target due to the concentrations of S1P in plasma and serum (Niedernberg2003Sphingosine). It is involved in mobilizing intracellular calcium in cells, indicating a role in calcium signaling pathways (Niedernberg2003Sphingosine).

GPR63 is expressed in various brain regions, including the thalamus and caudate nucleus, as well as in peripheral tissues such as the stomach and small intestine (Niedernberg2003Sphingosine). Its expression in the brain suggests a potential role in neurological processes, possibly influencing cell proliferation and feeding behavior (Niedernberg2003Sphingosine). The receptor is also present in human endothelial and smooth muscle cell lines, indicating a potential role in these cell types (Niedernberg2003Sphingosine).

In addition to its role in calcium signaling, GPR63 has been implicated in modulating intracellular cAMP levels when optically activated, suggesting it may influence intracellular signaling pathways related to cAMP (Morri2018Optical).

## Clinical Significance
GPR63 has been implicated as a genetic modifier in the context of microcephaly, particularly in Ttc21b mouse mutants. Mutations or alterations in GPR63 expression can influence the severity of microcephaly, a condition characterized by reduced brain size. Specifically, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in GPR63, which results in a missense mutation, has been identified as potentially deleterious in certain genetic backgrounds, such as the FVB mouse strain. This mutation affects the coat protein complex I (COPI) binding sequence, which is involved in protein transport and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Snedeker2018Gpr63is; Snedeker2019Gpr63).

GPR63's interaction with Ttc21b is significant, as it may exacerbate phenotypes associated with impaired retrograde trafficking within the primary cilium. In Ttc21b mutants, GPR63 mutations can lead to more severe developmental issues, including increased embryonic lethality and novel phenotypes such as spina bifida (Snedeker2019Gpr63). These findings suggest that GPR63 polymorphisms may contribute to the variability in ciliopathies and other structural birth defects, highlighting its potential clinical significance in modifying disease phenotypes related to ciliary function (Snedeker2019Gpr63).

## Interactions
GPR63, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in various interactions that influence its function and signaling pathways. It has been shown to interact with melanocortin receptors, specifically MC4R, where it exerts an inhibitory effect on cAMP accumulation. This interaction likely results from a reduction in the membrane expression of MC4R proteins, suggesting a role for GPR63 in modulating receptor trafficking and signaling (Li2021Identification).

GPR63 also interacts with lipid molecules, such as sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and dioleoylphosphatidic acid (doPA), which act as low-affinity agonists. These interactions lead to calcium mobilization in cells expressing GPR63, indicating its involvement in calcium signaling pathways (Niedernberg2003Sphingosine). Additionally, GPR63 has been identified as a receptor for 14,15-EET, where it forms hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with the lipid, suggesting a unique binding mechanism due to the absence of a critical positive charge residue (Nagarajan2021Mapping).

The receptor's interactions are not limited to lipids; it also participates in protein-protein interactions. The C-terminus of GPR63 is crucial for these interactions, affecting receptor regulation and trafficking, particularly in the context of ciliary function and microcephaly in mouse models (Snedeker2018Gpr63is).
