# TAF11L8

## Overview
TAF11L8 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 11 like 8, which is involved in the regulation of transcription. This protein is part of the TFIID complex, a crucial component of the transcription preinitiation complex that is responsible for the initiation of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II. TAF11L8 is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in facilitating the binding of the TATA-box binding protein to DNA, thereby influencing the transcriptional activity of various genes. The precise biological functions and interactions of TAF11L8 are still under investigation, but it is believed to play a significant role in the regulation of gene expression and may have implications in various cellular processes and disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
