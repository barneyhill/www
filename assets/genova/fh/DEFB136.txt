# DEFB136

## Overview
DEFB136 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 136, which is part of the defensin family known for their antimicrobial properties. Defensin beta 136 is categorized as an antimicrobial peptide, playing a crucial role in the innate immune response by providing a first line of defense against pathogens. The gene is located on chromosome 8 and has been studied for its involvement in various biological processes and disease contexts, particularly in cancer. Research has highlighted its significance in differentiating between cancer types and its potential impact on patient prognosis, making it a subject of interest for therapeutic targeting (Ramroach2020Lung; Frankel2014Genome‐wide).

## Clinical Significance
The DEFB136 gene, part of the defensin family, has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer. In lung cancer, DEFB136 is identified as a differentiator gene that aids in the classification of cancer types, such as lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Alterations in DEFB136, along with other differentiator genes, are associated with a lower survival rate and fewer months of being disease/progression-free, suggesting its potential as a drug target (Ramroach2020Lung).

In esophageal adenocarcinoma, DEFB136 is part of a copy number aberration (CNA) on chromosome 8, which correlates with poorer survival outcomes. This CNA is associated with significant biological functions related to cancer, such as 'cell death and survival,' 'cellular development,' and 'cellular growth and proliferation,' indicating its potential clinical significance in prognosis (Frankel2014Genome‐wide).

While the specific clinical implications of DEFB136 mutations or expression alterations are not detailed, its involvement in these CNAs and its role as a differentiator gene in cancer classification highlight its importance in cancer prognosis and potential therapeutic targeting.
