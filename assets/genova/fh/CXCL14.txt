# CXCL14

## Overview
CXCL14, also known as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14, is a gene that encodes a chemokine protein involved in various physiological processes, particularly in immune surveillance and homeostasis. The CXCL14 protein is characterized by its unique structural features, including a canonical chemokine fold and a distinctive five amino acid insertion, which contribute to its regulatory functions (Peterson2006Structural). Unlike other chemokines, CXCL14 does not form dimers and is expressed constitutively in epithelial tissues, where it plays a crucial role in recruiting dendritic cell precursors and maintaining immune homeostasis (Schaerli2005Cutaneous; Meuter2008Constitutive). Additionally, CXCL14 acts as a natural inhibitor of the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling axis, influencing immune cell trafficking and tissue homeostasis (Tanegashima2013CXCL14). The gene's expression is implicated in various cancers, where it can function as either a tumor suppressor or promoter, depending on the context (Gowhari2021Chemokine).

## Structure
The CXCL14 protein, also known as BRAK, adopts the canonical chemokine fold, which includes a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet packed against a C-terminal α-helix. It features an N-terminal loop stabilized by two disulfide bonds and a single turn of 3_10 helix just before β-strand 1 (Peterson2006Structural). The structure is characterized by low backbone RMSD values (~0.5 Å) for most residues, indicating a well-ordered protein, although regions such as the N-loop (residues 1-13) and the extended 40s loop (residues 40-47) exhibit conformational disorder (Peterson2006Structural).

A unique feature of CXCL14 is a five amino acid insertion (41 VSRYR 45) between strands β2 and β3, which is crucial for its regulation and proteasomal degradation (Peterson2006Structural). The protein does not form dimers in solution, existing only as a monomer under tested conditions (Peterson2006Structural). CXCL14 lacks N-terminal residues essential for biological activity in other CXC chemokines, contributing to its unique structural and functional properties (Peterson2006Structural). The study does not mention specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for CXCL14 (Peterson2006Structural).

## Function
CXCL14, also known as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14, is a chemokine involved in various homeostatic processes in healthy human cells. It is constitutively expressed in epithelial tissues such as the skin, gut, and kidney, where it plays a role in immune surveillance and the maintenance of epithelial dendritic cells (Meuter2008Constitutive). CXCL14 is particularly abundant in the epidermis and is associated with both basal and more differentiated keratinocytes, suggesting its involvement in homeostatic immune processes rather than inflammatory ones (Schaerli2005Cutaneous).

The protein acts as an attractant for CD14+ dendritic cell precursors, facilitating their recruitment to the epidermal niches where they differentiate into Langerhans cell-like cells with potent antigen-presentation functions (Schaerli2005Cutaneous). This recruitment and differentiation process is crucial for maintaining the pool of Langerhans cells in the skin, contributing to the homeostasis of cutaneous dendritic cells (Schaerli2005Cutaneous).

CXCL14 also functions as a natural inhibitor of the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling axis, binding to the CXCR4 receptor with high affinity and modulating important physiological processes such as development, stem cell maintenance, and immune responses (Tanegashima2013CXCL14). This modulation suggests a complex role for CXCL14 in immune cell trafficking and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CXCL14 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal carcinoma, CXCL14 is often downregulated, which may contribute to immune deficiencies and a disordered immune environment, potentially facilitating tumor development and metastasis (LIN2014Expression). This downregulation is frequently due to promoter hypermethylation, which is associated with poor prognosis and increased metastasis (Wang2023Data). In gastric cancer, CXCL14 expression is significantly reduced, likely due to hypermethylation of its promoter region, which may contribute to tumor progression (HU2013Abnormal).

In glioblastoma, CXCL14 is upregulated and correlates with aggressive tumor features, enhancing migration, proliferation, and sphere-forming ability of glioblastoma stem cells. This expression is inversely correlated with patient survival, indicating a protumorigenic role (Fazi2019The). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the loss of CXCL14 expression is linked to low infiltration of dendritic cells, suggesting a role in immune evasion (Shurin2005Loss).

CXCL14's role in cancer is complex, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context and cancer type (Gowhari2021Chemokine).

## Interactions
CXCL14, also known as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14, is involved in several protein interactions, particularly with the chemokine receptor CXCR4. CXCL14 directly interacts with CXCR4, mediating platelet migration and function. This interaction is crucial for platelet migration, as demonstrated by experiments showing that CXCR4-deficient cells do not migrate towards CXCL14, indicating the necessity of CXCL14-CXCR4 interaction for this process (Witte2020The). Immunoprecipitation studies have confirmed the direct interaction between CXCL14 and CXCR4, with co-precipitation observed in HEK293 cells co-transfected with CXCL14 and CXCR4 tagged plasmids (Witte2020The).

CXCL14 also acts as a positive allosteric modulator of CXCR4, enhancing the receptor's response to its primary ligand, CXCL12. This modulation does not involve the formation of CXCL14-CXCL12 heterodimers but rather induces allosteric changes in CXCR4, which lowers the activation threshold for CXCL12 (Collins2017Epithelial). CXCL14's interaction with CXCR4 is significant in the context of HIV-1 infection, as it may facilitate viral entry by stabilizing preferred conformations of CXCR4 (Collins2017Epithelial). These interactions highlight CXCL14's role in modulating chemokine receptor systems and influencing immune cell migration and activation.
