# SHISAL2B

## Overview
The SHISAL2B gene encodes the protein shisa like 2B, which is involved in various cellular processes, including developmental and stress response pathways. As a regulatory protein, shisa like 2B is implicated in modulating signaling pathways such as those involving fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and Wnt, which are crucial for vertebrate head development (Krivoruchko2021Genomewide). The protein's role in cellular stress responses is highlighted by its upregulation in retinal Müller glia under oxidative stress conditions, suggesting a protective function in retinal health (Leinonen2024A). Additionally, shisa like 2B is part of regulatory networks that may influence immune responses, particularly in the context of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (Cao2023Identifying). Despite these associations, the precise mechanisms and clinical implications of SHISAL2B in human health and disease are still being explored.

## Clinical Significance
The SHISAL2B gene has been implicated in various biological processes and conditions, although specific diseases directly resulting from its mutations or altered expression are not well-documented. In a study on rd10 mice, SHISAL2B was found to be upregulated in retinal Müller glia following TMB treatment, suggesting a role in cellular stress responses and oxidative phosphorylation, which may contribute to cone survival in retinopathy models (Leinonen2024A). 

In the context of embryonic development, SHISAL2B is associated with head development in vertebrates, interacting with growth factors such as FGF and Wnt. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in SHISAL2B results in an amino acid change that could affect these interactions, potentially impacting ontogenesis (Krivoruchko2021Genomewide). 

Additionally, SHISAL2B has been identified in regulatory networks related to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), suggesting a possible role in immune system interactions (Cao2023Identifying). However, the specific clinical implications of SHISAL2B in human diseases remain under investigation, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in disease mechanisms.
