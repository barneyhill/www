# CYB5A

## Overview
The CYB5A gene encodes cytochrome b5 type A, a membrane-bound hemoprotein that plays a pivotal role in electron transfer processes within cells. This protein is categorized as a cytochrome, specifically involved in the modulation of enzymatic activities through electron donation. Cytochrome b5 type A is integral to various metabolic pathways, including fatty acid desaturation, cholesterol biosynthesis, and drug metabolism, by interacting with enzymes such as cytochrome P450s. Structurally, it is characterized by a heme-binding domain and is anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, facilitating its function in electron transfer (Deng2011Structural; Bhatt2017Role). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing steroid hormone biosynthesis, particularly in the adrenal gland (Auchus1998Cytochrome; Stark2015CYB5A). Mutations in CYB5A can lead to clinical conditions such as congenital methemoglobinemia and disorders of sex development, highlighting its significance in human health (Giordano1994A; Leung2019Isolated).

## Structure
Cytochrome b5 type A (CYB5A) is a membrane-bound hemoprotein involved in electron transfer processes. The primary structure of CYB5A consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function (Deng2011Structural). The tertiary structure of CYB5A is characterized by a heme-binding domain, where the heme is sandwiched between two helix-loop-helix motifs. The heme iron is ligated by the side chains of two histidine residues, which are crucial for its electron transfer capabilities (Deng2011Structural; Bhatt2017Role).

CYB5A contains a specific fold consisting of six helices and a five-strand beta-sheet, which is a common feature among cytochrome b5 family members (Deng2011Structural). The protein is anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane through a C-terminal hydrophobic region, which is responsible for its membrane localization (Deng2011Structural). CYB5A can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which allows for variations in its structure and function (Bhatt2017Role). These structural features enable CYB5A to act as an electron donor to various enzymes, including stearoyl-CoA desaturase and cytochrome P450 enzymes (Deng2011Structural).

## Function
The CYB5A gene encodes cytochrome b5, a hemoprotein that plays a crucial role in various biochemical processes within healthy human cells. Cytochrome b5 is involved in the electron transfer necessary for the desaturation and elongation of fatty acids, cholesterol biosynthesis, and drug metabolism. It is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum and outer mitochondrial membrane, where it influences several metabolic pathways and helps maintain cellular homeostasis (Stark2015CYB5A).

In the adrenal gland, cytochrome b5 is essential for the 17,20-lyase activity of cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1), which is critical for the biosynthesis of androgens. This activity is particularly important for the conversion of pregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and subsequently to androstenedione, a weak androgen (Nakamura2011Human; Auchus1998Cytochrome). Cytochrome b5 enhances the enzymatic activity of P450c17 by facilitating allosteric interactions rather than direct electron transfer, thereby increasing the efficiency of androgen biosynthesis (Auchus1998Cytochrome).

Additionally, cytochrome b5 is involved in the detoxification of hydroxylamine metabolites in the liver, working alongside cytochrome b5 reductase to reduce these potentially harmful compounds (Sacco2010Cytochrome). This function is important for the metabolism of xenobiotics and the prevention of drug-induced toxicity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYB5A gene can lead to several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in electron transfer and steroid hormone biosynthesis. One significant condition associated with CYB5A mutations is congenital methemoglobinemia, where hemoglobin is unable to release oxygen effectively. This condition is often linked to a splicing mutation in the CYB5A gene, resulting in a truncated protein and reduced cytochrome b5 levels, as seen in patients with a 16-bp deletion in the cDNA (Giordano1994A).

CYB5A mutations also contribute to disorders of sex development (DSD) and isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency, particularly in genetic males. These conditions are characterized by impaired androgen production due to reduced 17,20-lyase activity, which is typically enhanced by cytochrome b5. Patients with these mutations often exhibit severe DSD and methemoglobinemia, although some genetic females with CYB5A mutations may not show DSD and can maintain normal sexual development and fertility (Leung2019Isolated).

Additionally, polymorphisms in the CYB5A gene, such as SNP rs1790834, have been associated with a reduced risk of rheumatoid arthritis in women. This polymorphism is linked to increased androgen levels, which may influence the disease's pathology (Stark2015CYB5A).

## Interactions
CYB5A, or cytochrome b5 type A, is involved in various protein-protein interactions, particularly with cytochrome P450 enzymes. It interacts with cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1), where its binding is modulated by the liganded state of CYP17A1. This interaction is influenced by the presence of different substrates in the CYP17A1 active site, which affects the amount of cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) needed to disrupt the CYB5A-CYP17A1 interaction. Key residues involved in this interaction include Glu-48 and Glu-49 on CYB5A and Arg-347, Arg-358, and Arg-449 on CYP17A1 (Estrada2013Substratemodulated).

CYB5A also forms both enthalpy-driven and entropy-driven complexes with various CYPs. Enthalpy-driven complexes, characterized by negative enthalpic terms, are observed with microsomal CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP17A1, likely involving electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Yablokov2017Thermodynamics). The interaction between CYB5A and CYP17A1 is particularly significant for enhancing CYP17A1's 17,20-lyase activity, which is crucial for androgen production (Estrada2013Substratemodulated).

Additionally, CYB5A interacts with proteins such as CYB4R3, CYP3A5, FADS2, SCD, and ACSL family members, indicating its involvement in various cellular and metabolic pathways (Khan2013Protein). These interactions suggest that CYB5A plays a role in the regulation of cytochrome P450 activity and other metabolic processes.
