# SCN4B

## Overview
The SCN4B gene encodes the sodium voltage-gated channel beta subunit 4, a critical component of the voltage-gated sodium channel complex. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane auxiliary subunit, which plays a significant role in modulating the function of the channel's pore-forming alpha subunits. The SCN4B protein is characterized by an extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain, a single transmembrane segment, and an intracellular C-terminal domain, which collectively contribute to its involvement in cell adhesion and electrical signaling (Bon2016SCN4B; LI2013Mutations). Functionally, the beta-4 subunit is essential for the regulation of sodium channel gating kinetics and voltage dependence, impacting muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and cardiac rhythm (Yu2003Sodium; LI2013Mutations). Beyond its physiological roles, SCN4B has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cardiac arrhythmias and cancer, where its expression and interaction with other proteins influence disease progression and prognosis (Bon2016SCN4B; Gong2018Preserved).

## Structure
The SCN4B gene encodes the beta-4 subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels, which is characterized by a specific protein topology. The primary structure of the SCN4B protein includes an extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain, a single transmembrane segment, and an intracellular C-terminal domain (Bon2016SCN4B; LI2013Mutations). The extracellular domain is similar to cell adhesion molecules, suggesting a role in cell adhesion (Bon2016SCN4B). 

The secondary structure likely includes alpha-helical and beta-sheet formations, typical of immunoglobulin-like domains, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to facilitate interactions with other proteins and cellular components. 

In terms of quaternary structure, the SCN4B protein functions as part of a larger sodium channel complex, interacting with the pore-forming alpha subunit and other auxiliary subunits to modulate channel gating and voltage dependence (LI2013Mutations). 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context. The SCN4B protein is expressed in both cardiac and epithelial cells, indicating its diverse functional roles (Bon2016SCN4B).

## Function
The SCN4B gene encodes the sodium channel β4 subunit, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the epithelial phenotype in mammary cells. In healthy human cells, particularly in non-excitable tissues, SCN4B is strongly expressed, suggesting its involvement in maintaining normal cellular functions and epithelial cell integrity (Bon2016SCN4B; Doray2021The). The β4 subunit is involved in cell-cell adhesion and neurite extension, contributing to the structural organization of epithelial cells (Doray2021The).

In the context of sodium channel function, the β4 subunit modulates the activity of the alpha subunits, influencing the kinetics and voltage dependence of sodium channel gating. This modulation is essential for the proper conduction of electrical signals, which is critical for muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission (Yu2003Sodium). The β4 subunit is also implicated in cardiac function, where it contributes to the generation and propagation of the cardiac action potential, playing a role in maintaining normal cardiac rhythm and preventing arrhythmias (LI2013Mutations; O’Malley2015Sodium). Its expression and function are crucial for the regulation of electrical excitability in muscle and nerve cells (Yu2003Sodium).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCN4B gene, which encodes the sodium channel β4 subunit, have been associated with familial atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia. Studies have identified specific mutations, such as p.V162G and p.I166L, that co-segregate with AF in an autosomal dominant pattern, suggesting a pathogenic role. These mutations affect evolutionarily conserved amino acids and are predicted to be disease-causing (LI2013Mutations). Another variant, p.Gly8Ser, has been linked to an increased risk of both common and lone AF, with significant associations found in case-control studies (Xiong2019Significant).

In addition to its role in cardiac conditions, SCN4B expression levels have been studied in the context of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Downregulation of SCN4B is observed in PTC tissues compared to normal thyroid tissues, and preserved expression is associated with better recurrence-free survival. This suggests that SCN4B expression may serve as a prognostic marker in PTC, although its downregulation is not primarily due to mutations but potentially linked to DNA methylation (Gong2018Preserved).

## Interactions
The SCN4B gene encodes the beta-4 (b4) protein, which is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function as a metastasis-suppressor in breast cancer. SCN4B/b4 interacts with RhoA, a small GTPase, to regulate cell migration and invasiveness. This interaction is crucial for maintaining normal cell behavior, as the loss of SCN4B expression leads to increased RhoA activity, promoting an amoeboid-mesenchymal hybrid phenotype that enhances cancer cell invasiveness (Bon2016SCN4B).

The SCN4B/b4 protein also modulates the activity of Na V channels, particularly Na V 1.5, by acting as an auxiliary subunit. This modulation affects the peak sodium current and persistent window current, which are important for cellular electrical signaling. The loss of SCN4B expression results in a gain-of-function of Na V 1.5, similar to what is observed in cardiac long QT syndrome LQT10 (Bon2016SCN4B).

Additionally, SCN4B/b4's intracellular C-terminus is essential for its interaction with RhoGTPases, which are involved in cell migration and invasion processes. This domain is critical for the protein's metastasis-suppressing activity, as demonstrated by experiments showing that the full-length protein is necessary to reduce cancer cell invasiveness (Bon2016SCN4B).
