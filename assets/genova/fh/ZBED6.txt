# ZBED6

## Overview
ZBED6 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger BED-type containing 6 protein, a transcription factor derived from a domesticated DNA transposon. This protein is characterized by its two BED-type zinc finger domains and an hATC dimerization domain, which are integral to its function in DNA binding and protein dimerization. ZBED6 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression, primarily acting as a repressor. It is notably involved in the regulation of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene, which is significant for muscle growth and development. The protein's regulatory functions extend to various biological processes, including development, cell proliferation, and growth, underscoring its evolutionary conservation among placental mammals (Jiang2014ZBED6; Markljung2009ZBED6).

## Structure
ZBED6 is a transcription factor derived from a domesticated DNA transposon, characterized by the presence of two BED-type zinc finger domains and an hATC dimerization domain. These domains are involved in DNA binding and protein dimerization, respectively, and are characteristic of the hAT transposase superfamily (Jiang2014ZBED6; Markljung2009ZBED6). The BED domains are highly conserved among placental mammals, with nearly 100% sequence identity across 26 species, indicating their critical role in the protein's function (Markljung2009ZBED6).

ZBED6 exists in multiple isoforms, including ZBED6a and ZBED6b, with molecular weights of 122 and 116 kDa, respectively. These isoforms likely arise from the use of alternative start codons in the ZBED6 open reading frame (Markljung2009ZBED6). The protein also appears in different molecular forms in insulin-producing cells, with larger nuclear forms (115/120 kDa) and smaller cytosolic forms (95/100 kDa), the latter lacking the N-terminal BED domains and nuclear localization signal (Wang2013Transcription).

ZBED6 contains bipartite nuclear localization signals, with one lysine- and arginine-rich sequence resembling a nucleolar localization signal found in the myogenic regulatory factor Myf5 (Markljung2009ZBED6). This nucleolar localization is crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation during myogenesis (Jiang2014ZBED6).

## Function
ZBED6 is a transcription factor derived from a domesticated DNA transposon, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It primarily functions as a repressor, notably affecting the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene, which is significant for muscle growth and development (Naboulsi2021ZBED6; Markljung2009ZBED6). ZBED6 binds to specific DNA motifs, often located near transcription start sites and within CpG islands, indicating its role in transcriptional silencing and regulation (Markljung2009ZBED6; Wang2013Transcription).

In pancreatic beta cells, ZBED6 influences gene expression, proliferation, and cell death, supporting cell survival and proliferation while potentially repressing insulin production (Wang2013Transcription). It is involved in regulating numerous pathways, binding to genes associated with transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and biosynthetic processes (Wang2013Transcription). ZBED6's activity is primarily nuclear, where it interacts with chromatin to mediate transcriptional silencing, possibly through chromatin remodeling (Markljung2009ZBED6).

The gene is highly conserved among placental mammals, underscoring its fundamental role in regulating biological processes such as development, cell proliferation, and growth (Markljung2009ZBED6). Its regulatory functions extend to influencing the expression of other genes involved in fundamental cellular activities, impacting overall organismal growth and development (Markljung2009ZBED6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the ZBED6 gene can have significant clinical implications, particularly in relation to muscle growth and cancer. ZBED6 acts as a repressor of IGF2, a gene involved in muscle development. A single nucleotide substitution in the IGF2 gene in pigs disrupts the ZBED6 binding site, leading to increased IGF2 expression and affecting muscle growth, heart size, and fat deposition (Markljung2009ZBED6). This suggests that similar mutations in humans could influence muscle-related conditions.

In cancer biology, ZBED6 has been implicated in the regulation of tumor growth. Inactivation of ZBED6 in colorectal cancer cells results in increased IGF2 expression, which may promote cell proliferation and alter tumor growth dynamics (Akhtar2015Transcriptional). ZBED6 also modulates pathways such as Wnt, Hippo, and TGF-β, which are crucial in colorectal cancer development (Akhtar2015Transcriptional).

ZBED6's role extends to metabolic diseases, where it helps maintain beta cell function and glucose tolerance. In ZBED6 knockout mice, glucose intolerance develops under a high-fat diet, indicating its importance in metabolic homeostasis and potential implications for type 2 diabetes (Wang2021ZBED6). These findings highlight the gene's potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
ZBED6 is a transcription factor that interacts with DNA to regulate gene expression, particularly influencing the expression of IGF2 and other genes involved in muscle growth and development. It binds specifically to the wild-type sequence of the IGF2 repressor region, but not to a mutant sequence, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) (Markljung2009ZBED6). ZBED6's interaction with the IGF2 gene is crucial for controlling IGF2 expression and muscle development in placental mammals (Wang2021Porcine).

ZBED6 is also involved in forming complexes with other proteins, which modulate its regulatory functions. It is coexpressed with ZC3H11A, suggesting a potential regulatory interaction between these two proteins (Markljung2009ZBED6). The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing data indicated a major RNA polymerase II binding site upstream of exon 1 of ZC3H11A, which serves as a common promoter for ZC3H11A and ZBED6, containing binding sites for transcription factors like Max, Myc, Fos, Jun, and NF-E2 (Markljung2009ZBED6).

In addition to its interaction with IGF2, ZBED6 binds to numerous other genes, with ChIP-sequencing identifying over 1,000 potential target genes in mouse C2C12 myoblasts. These binding sites are often located near transcription start sites and CpG islands, indicating a broad regulatory role (Markljung2009ZBED6).
