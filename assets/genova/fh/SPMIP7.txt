# SPMIP7

## Overview
SPMIP7 is a gene that encodes the protein sperm microtubule inner protein 7, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of sperm cells. The protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, involved in the organization and stabilization of microtubules within spermatozoa. This protein is essential for proper sperm motility and fertility, as it contributes to the formation and maintenance of the axoneme, a core component of the sperm tail. Mutations or dysregulation of SPMIP7 can lead to defects in sperm function, potentially resulting in male infertility (Qiu2020aarFDC).
