# DNAJB11

## Overview
DNAJB11 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B11, which functions as a co-chaperone within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein is part of the Hsp40 family, characterized by the presence of a J domain that is essential for its role in protein folding and quality control. DNAJB11 is involved in the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it assists in the recognition and processing of misfolded proteins, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing stress-related diseases. The protein interacts with BiP, a major ER chaperone, to facilitate the proper folding and assembly of secretory and membrane proteins. Mutations in the DNAJB11 gene have been linked to a specific form of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and other disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular function (Busch2024The; Aiello2023DNAJB11; Ruggieri2016DNAJB6).

## Structure
DNAJB11 is a protein that belongs to the Hsp40 family and is characterized by the presence of a J domain, which is crucial for its function as a co-chaperone. The protein has a predicted molecular mass of 40.5 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.8 (Ludvigsen2009Identification). The primary structure includes a signal peptide at the N-terminal, which is likely cleaved between Ala-22 and Gly-23, directing the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Ludvigsen2009Identification). 

The secondary structure of DNAJB11 is composed of 31.5% alpha helix, 18.5% extended strand, 8.96% beta turn, and 41.04% random coil (Yan2021The). The protein is strongly associated with the ER membrane and is oriented towards the ER lumen (Ludvigsen2009Identification). DNAJB11 contains an RGD motif towards the C-terminal, which may play a role in cell adhesion by binding to integrins (Ludvigsen2009Identification).

DNAJB11 is involved in the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway and interacts with BiP, a protein involved in various processes in the ER such as protein translocation, folding, and degradation (Ruggieri2016DNAJB6; Ludvigsen2009Identification). The protein does not have an ER retrieval sequence, suggesting potential secretion (Ludvigsen2009Identification).

## Function
DNAJB11, a member of the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40), functions as a co-chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a crucial role in protein folding and quality control. It acts as a co-factor for the HSP70-chaperone BiP, facilitating the folding and assembly of secretory and membrane proteins within the ER. DNAJB11 is involved in the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it recognizes misfolded proteins for ubiquitination and degradation, preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins that can lead to cellular stress and disease (Ruggieri2016DNAJB6).

In healthy cells, DNAJB11 contributes to the proper maturation and cleavage of proteins, such as polycystin-1 (PC1), which is essential for maintaining cellular functions. The protein is involved in sterol/cholesterol biosynthesis and chaperone-dependent protein folding pathways, indicating its broad role in cellular homeostasis (Busch2024The). DNAJB11's activity is crucial for the proper cleavage of PC1, a process linked to the prevention of cyst formation in the kidneys (Busch2024The). Its function in maintaining protein homeostasis underscores its importance in cellular stress responses and the prevention of diseases related to protein misfolding.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAJB11 gene are associated with a specific form of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), characterized by non-enlarged cystic kidneys and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) occurring later in life compared to typical ADPKD. Patients with DNAJB11 mutations may also exhibit interstitial fibrosis, recurring episodes of gout, and hyperuricemia. Unlike typical ADPKD, the liver is less involved in patients with DNAJB11 mutations (Aiello2023DNAJB11). The gene encodes a protein that functions as a co-chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum, and mutations can lead to improper folding and localization of polycystin-1, contributing to cyst formation in the kidneys and liver (Busch2024The; Aiello2023DNAJB11).

DNAJB11 mutations are linked to a milder form of ADPKD compared to PKD1 mutations, with mouse models showing less severe phenotypes. The timing of DNAJB11 inactivation affects disease severity, with later inactivation resulting in milder phenotypes (Busch2024The). DNAJB11 mutations are also associated with Ivemark II syndrome, a severe fetal disorder characterized by polycystic kidneys, pancreas, and liver abnormalities (Busch2024The). The kidney phenotype in DNAJB11-related disease is between ADPKD and autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) (Busch2024The).

## Interactions
DNAJB11, a co-chaperone in the Hsp40 family, is involved in several protein interactions, primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It interacts directly with HSPA5 (also known as BiP), a major ER chaperone, enhancing its ATPase activity and inducing conformational changes that stabilize unfolded proteins. This interaction is crucial for the unfolded protein response (UPR) and prevents HSPA5 from binding to other proteins, effectively acting as 'handcuffs' to manage protein folding and degradation (Ludvigsen2009Identification; Liu2022Exosomal).

In pancreatic cancer, DNAJB11 overexpression is linked to increased EGFR expression, promoting angiogenesis and cancer progression. DNAJB11 in exosomes activates the EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway in targeted pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting its role in modulating cancer signaling pathways (Liu2022Exosomal).

In polycystic kidney disease, DNAJB11 interacts with polycystin-1 (PC1), a protein crucial for kidney function. The absence of DNAJB11 impairs PC1 cleavage, leading to an increased ratio of uncleaved PC1, which is associated with cyst formation. This interaction highlights DNAJB11's role in protein processing and its potential impact on disease pathogenesis (Busch2024The).
