# CYC1

## Overview
The CYC1 gene encodes the cytochrome c1 protein, a crucial component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III, also known as the cytochrome bc1 complex. This protein plays a vital role in cellular respiration by facilitating electron transfer within the electron transport chain, a process essential for ATP production. Cytochrome c1 is categorized as a heme protein due to its heme-binding domain, which is integral to its function in electron transport. Structurally, cytochrome c1 is anchored to the inner mitochondrial membrane, with its N-terminal domain extending into the intermembrane space, allowing interaction with other components of the electron transport chain. Mutations in the CYC1 gene can lead to various metabolic and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Iwata1998Complete; Gaignard2013Mutations; PérezMejías2020Physical).

## Structure
The CYC1 gene encodes the cytochrome c1 protein, a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III. The primary structure of cytochrome c1 consists of a polypeptide chain with 241 amino acid residues (Iwata1998Complete). The secondary structure is predominantly composed of alpha helices, with the protein described as an all-α helix-type, similar to other cytochrome c family members (Iwata1998Complete). The protein includes seven helices, with a COOH-terminal membrane helix and a distorted double-stranded β-sheet between helices α3 and α5 (Iwata1998Complete).

The tertiary structure of cytochrome c1 features a heme-binding domain, where the heme is covalently anchored to Cys 37 and Cys 40, with His 41 and Met 160 serving as heme ligands (Iwata1998Complete). The quaternary structure involves interactions with other subunits in the cytochrome bc1 complex, including the Rieske [2Fe-2S] protein and subunit 8, which is essential for complex formation (Iwata1998Complete).

Cytochrome c1 is anchored to the inner mitochondrial membrane by a hydrophobic C-terminal domain, while the N-terminal globular domain is located in the intermembrane space, containing the heme c cofactor (PérezMejías2020Physical). The protein's interaction with cytochrome c is thermodynamically favored, enhancing electron transfer within the electron transport chain (PérezMejías2020Physical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYC1 gene, which encodes the cytochrome c1 subunit of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III, are associated with a range of clinical conditions. These mutations can lead to isolated complex III deficiency, resulting in metabolic disturbances such as insulin-responsive hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and lactic acidosis, while cognitive function remains normal (Gaignard2013Mutations). Specific mutations, such as p.Trp96Cys and p.Leu215Phe, have been identified in patients, leading to reduced levels of cytochrome c1 and impaired mitochondrial function (Gaignard2013Mutations; FernándezVizarra2015Nuclear).

CYC1 mutations can also present with neurological symptoms, including optic neuropathy and demyelinating syndromes, which may mimic conditions like Leber hereditary optic neuropathy or multiple sclerosis (Heidari2021Defective). A novel variant, p.Arg317Trp, has been linked to mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy, characterized by visual loss and atypical brain MRI patterns (Heidari2021Defective).

Altered expression of CYC1 is implicated in cancer, particularly breast cancer, where higher expression levels correlate with poor prognosis and increased tumor metastasis (Han2016CYC1). Silencing CYC1 in cancer cell lines reduces metastasis and proliferation, suggesting its role in tumor growth (Han2016CYC1).
