# STPG4

## Overview
Sperm-tail PG-rich repeat containing 4 (STPG4) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is characterized by its proline and glycine-rich repeat regions. The STPG4 protein is primarily associated with the structural components of sperm tails, suggesting a role in sperm motility and fertility. Although the precise biological functions of STPG4 remain to be fully elucidated, its expression pattern indicates a potential involvement in reproductive processes. The protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its involvement in the architecture of sperm tails. Further research is needed to understand the interactions and pathways involving STPG4, as well as its clinical significance in reproductive health.
