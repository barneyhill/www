# ATP5MC2

## Overview
ATP5MC2 is a gene that encodes the ATP synthase membrane subunit c locus 2, a crucial component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. This protein is a transmembrane subunit that plays a vital role in the synthesis of ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell, by facilitating proton translocation across the mitochondrial membrane. The ATP synthase complex, also known as Complex V, is essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a process that generates ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate during cellular respiration. The ATP5MC2 gene is highly conserved across species, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular energy metabolism. Mutations or dysregulation of this gene can have significant implications for cellular energy homeostasis and are associated with various mitochondrial disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
