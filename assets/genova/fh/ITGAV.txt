# ITGAV

## Overview
The ITGAV gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha V, a critical component of the integrin family of transmembrane receptors that mediate cell adhesion and signaling. Integrin alpha V is involved in forming heterodimers with various beta subunits, facilitating interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM), which are essential for cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and survival (Loeser2020Integrin; Wang2019Integrin). The protein's structure includes a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic tail, with the β-propeller domain playing a pivotal role in integrin heterodimerization and function (Mattson2024A). ITGAV is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including wound healing, immune responses, and cancer progression, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Tan2022Integrin; Iwatate2022Machine).

## Structure
The ITGAV gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha V, a component of the integrin family of transmembrane receptors involved in cell adhesion and signaling. The primary structure of ITGAV consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains, including the I-domain and the β-propeller domain, which is crucial for its function in integrin heterodimerization (Mattson2024A). The β-propeller domain contains regions termed 'hypersensitivity-illustrated pockets' (HIP), which are essential for the interaction with β integrin subunits (Mattson2024A).

The tertiary structure of ITGAV is characterized by a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The β-propeller domain is a prominent feature, playing a critical role in the assembly and stability of integrin heterodimers, such as αVβ5 (Mattson2024A). This domain is also a target for novel inhibitors that disrupt integrin function by binding to a CRISPR-hypersensitive cavity within the β-propeller (Mattson2024A).

In its quaternary structure, ITGAV pairs with various β subunits, including ITGB5, to form functional heterodimers that mediate cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix interactions (Mattson2024A). Common post-translational modifications of ITGAV include glycosylation, which is important for its function and interaction with other molecules (Mattson2024A).

## Function
Integrin alpha V (ITGAV) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in cell-to-matrix binding, facilitating cell adhesion, migration, and signaling processes in healthy human cells (Loeser2020Integrin). ITGAV pairs with various beta subunits to form integrin receptors, such as αvβ1, αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ6, and αvβ8, which are involved in mediating interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Wang2019Integrin). These interactions are essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and tissue integrity, influencing processes like cell proliferation, survival, and migration (Loeser2020Integrin).

In healthy cells, ITGAV is involved in the regulation of signaling pathways that control cell proliferation, motility, and differentiation, which are vital for physiological processes such as wound healing and immune responses (Wang2019Integrin). ITGAV is active in the cell membrane, where it influences cellular interactions with the ECM, contributing to the organization of the cytoskeleton and the transmission of mechanical signals (Tan2022Integrin). These functions underscore the importance of ITGAV in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating normal developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
The ITGAV gene, encoding integrin subunit alpha V, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in cell adhesion and signaling pathways. In pancreatic cancer, high ITGAV expression is associated with poor prognosis, larger tumor sizes, and advanced stages, making it an independent prognostic factor for overall and disease-free survival (Iwatate2022Machine; Kemper2021Integrin). Similarly, in esophageal adenocarcinoma, ITGAV expression correlates with shortened overall survival, particularly in patients who have not undergone neoadjuvant therapy (Loeser2020Integrin).

In gastric cancer, ITGAV is overexpressed, contributing to tumor growth, migration, and invasion, and is linked to poorer survival outcomes (Wang2019Integrin). The gene's expression is also implicated in early onset inflammatory bowel disease (EO-IBD), where rare variants in ITGAV disrupt immune homeostasis, potentially leading to intestinal inflammation (AlNuman2022Exome). ITGAV's role in immune regulation is further highlighted by its involvement in immune cell activities and its association with immune-related pathways (AlNuman2022Exome).

Overall, alterations in ITGAV expression or function are linked to cancer progression, immune dysregulation, and inflammatory diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ITGAV, or integrin subunit alpha V, forms heterodimers with various beta subunits, including ITGB1, ITGB3, ITGB5, ITGB6, and ITGB8. These integrins are involved in cell adhesion and signaling processes. The ITGAV-ITGB5 heterodimer, known as integrin αVβ5, is particularly significant in cancer cell proliferation and survival. CRISPR screens have identified ITGAV as essential for cancer cell expansion, with its interaction with ITGB5 being crucial for maintaining integrin stability and function (Mattson2024A).

The interaction between ITGAV and ITGB5 is mediated through the β-propeller domain of ITGAV, which contains critical regions necessary for this interaction. Disruption of these regions can significantly reduce the stability of the integrin complex (Mattson2024A). ITGAV also interacts with the small GTPase RAC1, mediating intracellular responses crucial for cancer cell maintenance (Mattson2024A).

In prostate cancer cells, ITGAV forms a complex with THBS1 (Thrombospondin 1) and TβRI (Transforming growth factor-beta receptor type I), facilitating cell migration and adhesion. This complex is involved in the activation of latent TGF-β, influencing cell signaling pathways (Mu2024The). In liver cancer cells, ITGAV interacts with YAP and TAZ, contributing to the formation of actin stress fibers and promoting cell migration and invasion (Weiler2020TAZ).
