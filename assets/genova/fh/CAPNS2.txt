# CAPNS2

## Overview
The CAPNS2 gene encodes the calpain small subunit 2, a protein that is part of the calpain protease complex, which is involved in calcium-dependent proteolysis. This protein is categorized as a calcium-binding protease due to its role in facilitating various cellular processes through calcium signaling. The calpain small subunit 2 is essential for the proper folding and function of the large calpain subunit, acting as a chaperone during its synthesis. Unlike the conventional small subunit, css1, CAPNS2 exhibits unique structural features, such as differences in the N-terminal Gly-rich domains and a distinct interaction profile with the large subunit, which does not involve typical autolytic conversion. CAPNS2 is implicated in critical cellular functions, including cytoskeletal remodeling, signal transduction, and apoptosis, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Bin2023In; SCHÁD2002A; Spinozzi2021Calpains).

## Structure
The CAPNS2 gene encodes the calpain small subunit 2, a protein consisting of 248 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 27,659 Da (SCHÁD2002A). The primary structure of CAPNS2 shows a high similarity to the conventional small subunit, css1, with 85% similarity and 63% identity overall. Notably, the C-terminal calmodulin-like domain exhibits 73% identity, while the N-terminal Gly-rich domains differ significantly, as css2 lacks two oligo-Gly stretches present in css1 (SCHÁD2002A).

The secondary structure includes calcium-binding EF-hand motifs, with 13 out of 17 residues involved in calcium coordination being conserved, which is crucial for its function as a calcium-dependent protease (SCHÁD2002A). The tertiary structure of CAPNS2 was predicted using computational techniques, with the optimal model showing 88.8% of residues in the favored region of the Ramachandran plot, indicating a well-folded structure (Bin2023In).

In terms of quaternary structure, CAPNS2 acts as a chaperone for the large calpain subunit, aiding in its folding but binding more weakly compared to css1. It does not undergo typical autolytic conversion, suggesting a unique interaction profile with the large subunit (SCHÁD2002A).

## Function
The CAPNS2 gene encodes the Calpain small subunit 2, which is a component of the calpain protease complex. This complex is involved in calcium-dependent proteolysis, a process crucial for various cellular functions. Calpain proteins, including those associated with CAPNS2, play significant roles in cellular processes such as membrane fusion, cell propagation, cell cycle advancement, signal transduction, platelet stimulation, cytoskeleton remodeling, and apoptosis (Bin2023In). The CAPNS2 protein is active in the cytoplasm, cell membrane, and dense perinuclear region, indicating its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Bin2023In).

In healthy human cells, CAPNS2 may act as a tissue-specific companion to larger calpain subunits, aiding in their correct folding and ensuring normal protease activity. This function is essential for the regulation of cellular processes that require precise calcium signaling and proteolytic activity (Bin2023In). The calpain complex, including CAPNS2, is crucial for cytoskeletal remodeling, which is vital for cell shape and motility, and for signal transduction pathways that mediate cellular responses to external stimuli (Bin2023In).

## Interactions
CAPNS2, or calpain small subunit 2, is involved in interactions with the large subunit of calpains, specifically acting as a chaperone to aid in the folding of the 80 kDa large subunit during expression in E. coli. However, it does not bind strongly to the mature, folded protein (SCHÁD2002A). The protein shares significant sequence identity with the conventional small subunit, css1, particularly within the Ca2+-binding region, but it binds the large subunit more weakly than css1 and does not undergo typical autolytic conversion (SCHÁD2002A). Despite these differences, CAPNS2 is suggested to be a functional equivalent of the conventional small subunit, assisting the large subunit in folding into its active conformation (SCHÁD2002A). The interaction of CAPNS2 with the large subunit is transient, indicating a possible role in the initial stages of protein folding rather than in the stability of the mature enzyme complex (SCHÁD2002A). The study of CAPNS2's interactions is ongoing, and its precise physiological role remains to be fully elucidated (Spinozzi2021Calpains).
