# VPS26A

## Overview
VPS26A is a gene that encodes the protein VPS26 retromer complex component A, which is a crucial part of the retromer complex involved in endosomal protein sorting. The VPS26A protein is characterized by an arrestin-like fold and functions as a cargo adaptor within the retromer complex, facilitating the recycling of transmembrane proteins. This protein plays a significant role in the retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes back to the trans-Golgi network, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein recycling (McNally2018Endosomal; Haft2000Human). The retromer complex, including VPS26A, is vital for the retrieval of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, preventing its degradation in lysosomes and ensuring the proper function of lysosomal enzymes (Arighi2004Role). Mutations and alterations in VPS26A have been linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancers, highlighting its importance in cellular function and disease mechanisms (Hou2023The; Gambardella2016Vacuolar).

## Structure
The VPS26A protein is a component of the retromer complex, which plays a crucial role in endosomal protein sorting. Structurally, VPS26A adopts an arrestin-like fold, characterized by two beta sandwich domains connected by a flexible linker and a polar core (McNally2018Endosomal). This structure is essential for its function in the retromer complex, allowing it to interact with other proteins and cargo.

The interaction of VPS26A with VPS35, another component of the retromer complex, involves a flexible loop at the edge of its C-domain, with specific residues such as E244 forming hydrogen bonds with VPS35 (Lucas2016Structural). This interaction is critical for the stability and function of the retromer complex, as mutations in VPS26A can disrupt its incorporation into the complex (Lucas2016Structural).

VPS26A also undergoes conformational changes upon binding with SNX3, which induces the formation of a hydrophobic cargo-binding pocket between strands β10 and β18, crucial for cargo recognition (Lucas2016Structural). The protein's structure and interactions highlight its role as a cargo adaptor within the retromer complex, facilitating the recycling of transmembrane proteins (Lucas2016Structural).

## Function
VPS26A is a critical component of the retromer complex, which plays a significant role in the sorting and trafficking of proteins within cells. This complex is involved in the retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes back to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein recycling (Haft2000Human). VPS26A, along with other retromer subunits like Vps29 and Vps35, forms a multimeric complex that facilitates the retrieval of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) from endosomes to the TGN, preventing its degradation in lysosomes (Arighi2004Role).

The retromer complex, including VPS26A, is primarily active in endosomes, where it is associated with tubular profiles near endosomes, characterized by a bilayered clathrin coat (Arighi2004Role). The proper functioning of VPS26A is crucial for the recycling of CI-MPR, which is important for the sorting and function of lysosomal enzymes. Depletion of VPS26A leads to increased lysosomal degradation of CI-MPR and reduced lysosomal hydrolase activities, indicating its vital role in lysosomal function and protein sorting (Arighi2004Role). The assembly of VPS26A into the retromer complex is essential for its function, as its deletion in mice is embryonic lethal, highlighting its critical role in mammalian development (Haft2000Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the VPS26A gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. In the context of Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonisms, specific mutations in VPS26A, such as p.Lys93Glu and p.Met112Ile, have been identified. The p.Lys93Glu mutation was found in a Canadian female with Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) and her sister, suggesting a potential link to the disease. The p.Met112Ile mutation was identified in a sporadic PD case, though its pathogenicity remains uncertain (Gambardella2016Vacuolar).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), VPS26A is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, advanced tumor stages, and smoking-related gene mutations such as KRAS and TP53. VPS26A expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint markers, indicating its role in immune escape and cancer progression. The gene's expression correlates with the activation of the EGFR/ERK signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, which underscores its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in PAAD (Hou2023The).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of VPS26A in both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, emphasizing the need for further research into its role in disease mechanisms.

## Interactions
VPS26A is a component of the retromer complex, which plays a crucial role in endosomal sorting and trafficking. It interacts with other core retromer components, such as VPS29 and VPS35, forming a heterotrimeric complex essential for the proper sorting of integral membrane proteins (McMillan2016Atypical). VPS26A also interacts with SNX27, a cargo adaptor protein, which is vital for the sorting of specific cargo proteins, including the glucose transporter GLUT1. This interaction prevents the lysosomal degradation of these proteins (McMillan2016Atypical).

Mutations in VPS26A, such as the p.K297X mutation, disrupt its association with SNX27, leading to defective sorting of SNX27 cargo proteins. This mutation results in a specific defect in endosomal sorting, highlighting the importance of the SNX27-retromer-WASH sorting pathway for neuronal health (McMillan2016Atypical). The p.K297X mutation also shows an enhanced association with proteins like PKD2 and DEN ND4C, indicating altered interaction dynamics due to the mutation (McMillan2016Atypical).

VPS26A's interactions are not limited to the retromer complex. It is involved in a broader interactome, with studies identifying numerous proteins that interact with VPS26A, many of which are involved in endosomal transport (McMillan2016Atypical).
