# FAM174C

## Overview
FAM174C is a gene that encodes a small membrane protein, which is a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 174 member C. This protein is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus and plays a critical role in vesicle trafficking. It interacts with the Golgi tether component TBC1D23 through a TLY-like motif, which is essential for the capture and recycling of vesicles between endosomes and the Golgi. The interaction between FAM174C and TBC1D23 is crucial for maintaining proper cellular function, as disruptions in this interaction can lead to impaired vesicle capture (CattinOrtolá2023Cargo). The protein's involvement in the endosome/Golgi system underscores its importance in cellular transport mechanisms (CattinOrtolá2023Cargo).

## Interactions
FAM174C is a small membrane protein located in the Golgi apparatus, and it interacts with the Golgi tether component TBC1D23. This interaction is facilitated by a TLY-like motif present in FAM174C, which binds to the C-terminal domain of TBC1D23 with an affinity of 16 µM. This binding is crucial for vesicle capture, as it is part of the mechanism by which TBC1D23 captures vesicles that recycle between endosomes and the Golgi. Mutations that disrupt this peptide binding result in a loss of vesicle capture, highlighting the significance of the interaction between FAM174C and TBC1D23 in vesicle trafficking (CattinOrtolá2023Cargo).

The TBC1D23 protein recognizes and binds to an acidic TLY motif found in several proteins, including FAM174C, syntaxin-16, and carboxypeptidase D (CPD). This motif is part of a sequence pattern [DE]>=3/5[TS][LIV][YFW] that is common among proteins involved in the endosome/Golgi system. The interaction between TBC1D23 and these proteins is essential for the tethering and capture of vesicles at the Golgi apparatus (CattinOrtolá2023Cargo).
