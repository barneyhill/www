# PIKFYVE

## Overview
PIKFYVE is a gene that encodes the phosphoinositide kinase, FYVE-type zinc finger containing protein, which is a critical enzyme involved in phosphoinositide metabolism. This kinase is primarily responsible for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P), lipids that play essential roles in endosomal trafficking and cellular signaling pathways (Ikonomov2011The; Shisheva2008PIKfyve:). The PIKFYVE protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a FYVE finger domain that targets it to endosome membranes, and a catalytic domain that facilitates its kinase activity (Ikonomov2009PIKfyveArPIKfyveSac3). PIKFYVE is integral to maintaining endomembrane homeostasis and is involved in various cellular processes, such as endosome-to-trans-Golgi network transport and glucose uptake in muscle cells (Rutherford2006The; Liu2013Phosphatidylinositol). Dysregulation or mutations in the PIKFYVE gene are linked to several pathological conditions, including lysosomal storage disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (Xia2024Inhibition; Tsuruta2009PIKfyve).

## Structure
The PIKFYVE protein is a large, evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by a single-copy gene. It contains several functional domains that contribute to its structure and function. The N-terminal region includes a FYVE finger domain, which targets the protein to PtdIns(3)-enriched endosome membranes (Ikonomov2009PIKfyveArPIKfyveSac3). Following this is the DEP domain, whose function remains uncharacterized. The middle section of PIKFYVE features two domains: Cpn60_TCP1, which shows sequence similarity to molecular chaperonins, and a CHK homology region with conserved cysteine, histidine, and lysine residues unique to PIKFYVE orthologs. The region of conserved lysine is homologous to spectrin repeats (Ikonomov2009PIKfyveArPIKfyveSac3).

The C-terminal region of PIKFYVE contains the catalytic domain responsible for its kinase activities, including the synthesis of PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(5)P (Ikonomov2009PIKfyveArPIKfyveSac3). The Cpn60_TCP1 domain is crucial for recruiting the ArPIKfyve-Sac3 subcomplex, and a PIKFYVE mutant lacking this domain cannot bind the subcomplex (Ikonomov2009PIKfyveArPIKfyveSac3). The interaction with the ArPIKfyve-Sac3 subcomplex is essential for activating PIKFYVE kinase activity, with the Cpn60_TCP1 and CH domains playing a critical role in this process (Ikonomov2009PIKfyveArPIKfyveSac3). The PAS complex, which includes PIKFYVE, ArPIKfyve, and Sac3, is vital for the homeostatic control of PtdIns(3,5)P2 (Ikonomov2009PIKfyveArPIKfyveSac3).

## Function
The PIKFYVE gene encodes a phosphoinositide kinase that is crucial for synthesizing phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P), which are important for endosomal trafficking and cellular responses to external stimuli (Ikonomov2011The; Shisheva2008PIKfyve:). PIKFYVE is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with early endosomes, where it regulates endosome-to-trans-Golgi network (TGN) retrograde transport, maintaining endomembrane homeostasis (Rutherford2006The; Shisheva2008PIKfyve:). 

The enzyme's activity is essential for the proper sorting and trafficking of endosomal cargo, ensuring that receptors and other proteins are correctly recycled or directed to their appropriate cellular destinations (Rutherford2006The). PIKFYVE's role in synthesizing PI(3,5)P2 is critical for endosomal sorting and the regulation of endomembrane dynamics, preventing the formation of swollen endosomal structures (Rutherford2006The). 

PIKFYVE also plays a role in glucose uptake in muscle cells, being involved in insulin-stimulated and contraction-stimulated glucose uptake by promoting the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 (Liu2013Phosphatidylinositol). The kinase's activity is crucial for maintaining energy balance in skeletal muscle, especially during muscle contraction (Liu2013Phosphatidylinositol).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the PIKFYVE gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. PIKFYVE deficiency can lead to lysosomal storage disorders characterized by the accumulation of enlarged lysosomes and cytoplasmic vacuolation, which are linked to impaired lysosomal fission and homeostasis (Xia2024Inhibition). In platelets, the loss of PIKFYVE results in a lysosomal disease that causes inflammation and thrombosis in mice, highlighting its role in maintaining lysosomal enzyme trafficking and homeostasis (Min2014Loss). This deficiency leads to excessive lysosomal secretion, contributing to endothelial damage and systemic inflammation (Min2014Loss).

In neurons, PIKFYVE is crucial for the degradation of CaV1.2 channels, preventing excitotoxic cell death. Mutations affecting PIKFYVE or its regulatory proteins can lead to reduced levels of phosphatidylinositol (3,5) bisphosphate, causing neuronal defects such as ataxia and neuronal death (Tsuruta2009PIKfyve). These mutations are linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Zolov2012In). PIKFYVE mutations are also associated with congenital cataracts and familial benign corneal dystrophy (Xia2024Inhibition).

## Interactions
PIKFYVE is a lipid kinase that plays a crucial role in phosphoinositide metabolism and interacts with several proteins to form multiprotein complexes. One of the primary interactions of PIKFYVE is with the ArPIKfyve and Sac3 proteins, forming the PAS core complex. This complex is essential for the synthesis and regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2), a key lipid involved in endocytic membrane homeostasis. The interaction between PIKFYVE and the ArPIKfyve-Sac3 subcomplex is mediated by specific domains within PIKFYVE, such as the Cpn60_TCP1 and CH homology domains, which are critical for binding and activating PIKFYVE kinase activity (Ikonomov2009PIKfyveArPIKfyveSac3).

PIKFYVE also interacts with components of the SNX17-Retriever-CCC-WASH complex, which is involved in endosomal recycling. It colocalizes with these complexes and is crucial for the recruitment of their subunits to endosomes. This interaction is important for the recycling of integrins and other proteins, affecting processes like cell migration and endosomal sorting (Giridharan2022Lipid). The activity of PIKFYVE is necessary for the production of phosphoinositide lipids, such as PI3,5P2 and PI5P, which are essential for the function and localization of these complexes (Giridharan2022Lipid).
