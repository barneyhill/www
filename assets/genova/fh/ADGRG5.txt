# ADGRG5

## Overview
ADGRG5, also known as GPR114, is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G5, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain and is involved in various physiological processes, including immune response regulation and cell signaling (Knierim2019Genetic; Stoveken2018Gedunin). The protein undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage facilitated by the GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, which is essential for its activation and function (Langenhan2019Adhesion). ADGRG5 is primarily expressed in immune cells and the central nervous system, indicating its potential role in immune cell function and neurological processes (Stoveken2018Gedunin). The receptor's activation involves a unique mechanism of self-cleavage, and it can be modulated by small molecules, suggesting possible therapeutic applications in immune modulation and disease treatment (Stoveken2018Gedunin).

## Structure
ADGRG5, also known as GPR114, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family, characterized by a complex molecular structure. The protein includes a seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain, which is typical of GPCRs, and is anchored in the plasma membrane (Knierim2019Genetic). A notable feature of ADGRG5 is the GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, which facilitates autoproteolytic cleavage at the GPCR proteolysis site (GPS), resulting in the formation of N-terminal (NTF) and C-terminal (CTF) fragments (Langenhan2019Adhesion). This cleavage is crucial for receptor activation and function, as the NTF can modulate the activity of the CTF (Langenhan2019Adhesion).

ADGRG5 is associated with Gαs signaling, although its precise molecular structure has not been fully elucidated (Maser2020Adhesion). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is common in adhesion GPCRs, potentially affecting its function and stability. The gene encoding ADGRG5 exhibits significant variability, with multiple transcript variants resulting from alternative splicing, which can lead to differences in the N and C termini of the protein (Knierim2019Genetic). These structural variations may influence the receptor's expression and signaling properties.

## Function
ADGRG5, also known as GPR114, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family, which plays a significant role in cell signaling. These receptors are involved in various physiological processes, including immune response regulation and potentially influencing cell adhesion and migration. ADGRG5 is primarily expressed in immune cells and the central nervous system, suggesting its involvement in immune cell function and possibly in neurological processes (Stoveken2018Gedunin).

The activation of ADGRG5 involves a unique mechanism where a tethered agonist is generated through self-cleavage during biosynthesis, resulting in a two-part receptor with an extracellular domain and a 7-transmembrane spanning domain (Stoveken2018Gedunin). Small molecules, such as gedunin and khivorin derivatives, have been identified as partial agonists for ADGRG5, with 3-a-acetoxydihydrodeoxygedunin (3-a-DOG) being a notable example. These compounds can activate ADGRG5 by binding to orthosteric sites, which are similar due to shared peptide sequences with other aGPCRs (Stoveken2018Gedunin). The activation of ADGRG5 by these small molecules suggests potential therapeutic applications, particularly in modulating immune responses and possibly in cancer and neurological diseases (Stoveken2018Gedunin).
