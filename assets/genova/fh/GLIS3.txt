# GLIS3

## Overview
GLIS3 is a gene that encodes the GLIS family zinc finger 3 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the GLIS subfamily of Kruppel-like zinc finger proteins. This protein is characterized by its five C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, which are essential for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Kim2003GLIS3). The GLIS3 protein functions as both a transcriptional activator and repressor, with its activity varying depending on the cell type and context (Kim2003GLIS3). It plays a crucial role in the development and function of pancreatic beta cells, insulin production, and thyroid hormone biosynthesis, among other physiological processes (Chou2017The; Scoville2020Transcription). Mutations in the GLIS3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, including neonatal diabetes, congenital hypothyroidism, and polycystic kidney disease, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal endocrine and metabolic functions (Scoville2020Transcription; Alghamdi2017Extended).

## Structure
The GLIS3 protein is a member of the GLIS subfamily of Kruppel-like zinc finger proteins, characterized by the presence of five C2H2-type zinc finger motifs. These motifs are crucial for DNA binding and are highly homologous to those found in GLIS1, with a 93% identity (Kim2003GLIS3). The zinc finger domain (ZFD) is encoded by exons 2-4, and the exon-intron junctions within this region are conserved with those of GLIS1, suggesting a close evolutionary relationship (Kim2003GLIS3). The secondary structure analysis indicates that the second half of each zinc finger motif consists of an alpha-helix (Kim2003GLIS3).

GLIS3 functions as both a repressor and activator of transcription, with its activity varying by cell type. The N- and C-termini of GLIS3 contain domains necessary for optimal transcriptional activation (Kim2003GLIS3). The protein localizes predominantly to the nucleus, with its nuclear localization dependent on a region containing the fifth zinc finger motif and a putative nuclear localization signal (Kim2003GLIS3). The protein's interaction with transcriptional modulators, such as Wwtr1/TAZ, involves specific motifs in the C-terminal region, which are essential for its transcriptional activity (Kang2009Glis3). The GLIS3 protein is also associated with primary cilia, indicating its involvement in ciliary function (Kang2009Glis3).

## Function
GLIS3 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various physiological processes, particularly in the development and function of pancreatic beta cells and insulin production. In healthy human cells, GLIS3 is crucial for the differentiation and maturation of pancreatic beta cells, which are responsible for insulin secretion. It regulates the transcription of insulin and other genes critical for beta-cell function, such as Ins1/2, Nkx6.1, and Mafa, by binding to specific DNA sequences in their promoters (Chou2017The; Scoville2020Transcription). GLIS3 interacts with other transcription factors like PDX1 and NEUROD1, enhancing its regulatory effects on insulin gene expression (Scoville2021GLIS3:).

GLIS3 is also involved in thyroid hormone biosynthesis, where it regulates genes essential for thyroid function, such as NIS and MCT8 (Scoville2020Transcription). In the kidney, GLIS3 contributes to maintaining normal function, and its deficiency can lead to polycystic kidney disease (Scoville2020Transcription). The protein is primarily active in the cell nucleus, where it exerts its regulatory functions through its zinc-finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and nuclear localization (Chou2017The). Overall, GLIS3 is vital for maintaining normal endocrine functions and metabolic health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GLIS3 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions, primarily affecting the thyroid and pancreas. GLIS3 mutations can lead to Neonatal Diabetes and congenital Hypothyroidism (NDH), a syndrome characterized by congenital hypothyroidism, neonatal diabetes, elevated intraocular pressure, cholestasis, polycystic kidney disease, facial dysmorphisms, and mild mental retardation (Scoville2020Transcription; Alghamdi2017Extended). Specific mutations include frameshift mutations that delete the transactivation domain, point mutations in the DNA-binding domain, and deletions of exons, which result in altered thyroid hormone levels and variable thyroid gland development (Scoville2020Transcription).

GLIS3 is also implicated in diabetes, with mutations linked to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. These mutations affect pancreatic beta-cell differentiation and function, leading to severe diabetes in Glis3-deficient mice (Yang2016Differential). Pathogenic variants in GLIS3 are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, and individuals with these variants may be particularly sensitive to sulfonylureas, a class of diabetes medications (Meulebrouck2023Pathogenic).

GLIS3 mutations are also linked to other conditions such as congenital glaucoma, hepatic fibrosis, and developmental delay, highlighting the gene's broad clinical significance (Alghamdi2017Extended).

## Interactions
GLIS3 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It physically interacts with HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases, including Itch, Smurf2, and NEDD4, through its N-terminal region. These interactions are mediated by the WW domains of the ligases and the PY 461 motif of GLIS3. The interaction with Itch is particularly strong and leads to GLIS3 polyubiquitination, reducing its stability and transcriptional activity (ZeRuth2015HECT).

GLIS3 also binds to specific DNA sequences, such as the Glis3 response element (Glis3RE) in the insulin promoter, through its zinc finger domain. This binding is crucial for insulin gene transcription and is enhanced by interactions with other transcription factors like Pdx1, MafA, and NeuroD1 (Yang2009The).

In pancreatic β-cells, GLIS3 activates the Ngn3 promoter and interacts with the Hnf6 protein. This interaction is mediated by the proline-rich region of GLIS3 and the homeodomain of Hnf6, suggesting a role in regulating gene expression during pancreatic development (Kim2012Glis3).

GLIS3 also forms a complex with the transcriptional modulator Wwtr1, mediated by a P/LPXY motif in GLIS3. This interaction enhances GLIS3's transcriptional activity and influences the subcellular localization of Wwtr1 (Kang2009Glis3).
