# DDX53

## Overview
DDX53 is a gene that encodes the protein DEAD-box helicase 53, a member of the DEAD-box protein family characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif. This family of proteins is primarily involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including RNA unwinding, translation initiation, and splicing. The DDX53 protein, which contains a unique KH domain and an SF2 helicase core domain, is implicated in RNA processing and gene expression regulation, particularly in the cerebellum and testis (Abdelhaleem2003The; Yuan2024Lossoffunction). The gene itself is intron-less, encoding a single exon, which suggests a streamlined genetic structure (Faheem2023Disruption). DDX53 has been associated with several clinical conditions, including hereditary spastic paraplegia-like disorders and cancer, where it plays a role in drug resistance and cell proliferation (Gréen2016Using; Yuan2024Lossoffunction).

## Structure
The DDX53 protein is composed of 631 amino acids and features several distinct domains that contribute to its function. At the N-terminus, it contains a KH (K homology) domain, which is unique within the DDX family and may indicate overlapping biological functions with other proteins such as DDX43 (Yuan2024Lossoffunction). The C-terminus of the protein houses an SF2 helicase core domain, spanning amino acids 222 to 601, which is crucial for its helicase activity (Yuan2024Lossoffunction). This domain is typical of the DEAD-box protein family, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), and is involved in ATP-dependent RNA unwinding (Abdelhaleem2003The).

The DDX53 gene is intron-less, encoding a single exon, which suggests a streamlined structure without alternative splicing variants (Faheem2023Disruption). The protein's expression is predominantly found in the cerebellum and testis, with the highest levels in the cerebellum, indicating a potential role in neurological functions (Yuan2024Lossoffunction). While specific post-translational modifications are not detailed in the available context, the presence of conserved domains suggests potential regulatory modifications typical of helicase proteins.

## Function
DDX53, or DEAD-box helicase 53, is a member of the DEAD-box protein family, which is characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD). These proteins are integral to various aspects of RNA metabolism, including translation initiation, splicing, and ribosome assembly. DDX53 is implicated in RNA processing, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression within healthy human cells. It is typically active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it contributes to cell proliferation and differentiation. The protein's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its significance in maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DDX53 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A loss-of-function mutation in DDX53 is associated with a hereditary spastic paraplegia-like disorder, characterized by symptoms such as hypertonia, spastic dystonia, and visual impairment. This mutation leads to degeneration in cerebral white matter, as observed in MRI scans of affected individuals (Yuan2024Lossoffunction). DDX53 mutations have also been linked to autism spectrum disorder, although studies suggest that its role in ASD is limited, as disruptions in DDX53 do not significantly affect neuronal function in iPSC-derived neurons (Faheem2023Disruption).

Alterations in DDX53 expression are associated with cancer progression and drug resistance. DDX53 is overexpressed in various cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, where it contributes to taxol resistance by upregulating MDR1, a transporter involved in multidrug resistance. Exosomes from taxol-resistant cells can transfer DDX53 to non-resistant cells, promoting resistance (yuan2021exosomes). Additionally, DDX53 has been linked to increased cell proliferation and resistance to anticancer drugs, potentially through the downregulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 (Gréen2016Using). These findings suggest that DDX53 plays a significant role in mediating drug resistance and cancer progression.

## Interactions
DDX53, a member of the DEAD-box helicase family, is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions. It is known to interact with several proteins, including EGFR, DDX43, HDAC2, CAPZB, and PPM1B, as identified through the BioGRID database. The interaction between DDX53 and DDX43 is particularly notable due to a high interaction score and significant sequence homology, especially in the KH domain, which is unique to DDX53 and DDX43 within the DDX family. This suggests potential overlapping biological functions (Yuan2024Lossoffunction).

DDX53 also plays a role in RNA metabolism, as evidenced by its binding to RNA sequences with consecutive U bases. RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq) analysis showed that 66.62% of DDX53 binding peaks are located in exon regions, indicating its involvement in processes such as histone modification, mRNA processing, and mRNA surveillance pathways. The analysis identified 284 peak-associated RNAs, including mRNAs, misc RNAs, lncRNAs, and snoRNAs, highlighting its role in regulating gene expression related to synaptic function and neuron migration (Yuan2024Lossoffunction).

DDX53 is also associated with the NIQI motif, which suggests a potential role in RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) related functions, although it is categorized as a low confidence rG4 helicase (Dupas2021Predicting).
