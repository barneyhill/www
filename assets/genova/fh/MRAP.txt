# MRAP

## Overview
The MRAP gene encodes the melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein, a small transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R), a G protein-coupled receptor. MRAP is characterized by its unique ability to form antiparallel homodimers, which are essential for the proper trafficking and functional expression of MC2R on the cell surface, particularly in the adrenal cortex. This interaction is vital for the receptor's response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), facilitating cortisol production during stress (Clark2019Stability; Novoselova2013Melanocortin). Beyond its primary role in the adrenal gland, MRAP is also expressed in other tissues, suggesting broader physiological functions. Mutations in the MRAP gene are linked to familial glucocorticoid deficiency, highlighting its importance in adrenal function and stress response (Meimaridou2013Familial; Duan2022A).

## Structure
The melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein (MRAP) is a small transmembrane protein characterized by a single transmembrane domain and an N-terminal domain that can be extracellular. MRAP exists in two isoforms, MRAP-a and MRAP-b, which share identical N-terminal and transmembrane domains but differ in their C-terminal regions (Dores2021Hypothesis). The protein forms unique antiparallel homodimers, a rare structural feature, which are essential for its function (Maben2016Dual; Sebag2009Opposite). These dimers are resistant to dissociation by sodium dodecyl sulfate and reducing agents, indicating a stable quaternary structure (Cooray2011Melanocortin).

The N-terminal domain of MRAP contains a critical LDYI motif, which is significant for the activation of the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) (Dores2021Hypothesis). The transmembrane domain is crucial for the interaction with MC2R, facilitating its trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (Dores2021Hypothesis). MRAP undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which occurs at a single predicted site and is important for its stability and function (Maben2016Dual). The protein's dual topology, with both N-terminal and C-terminal regions facing outward on the cell surface, is established early in biosynthesis and remains stable (Maben2016Dual).

## Function
The melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein (MRAP) is essential for the functional expression and signaling of the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) in human cells. MRAP is a small transmembrane protein that forms antiparallel homodimers, which are crucial for the trafficking of MC2R to the plasma membrane, particularly in the adrenal cortex (Clark2019Stability; Novoselova2013Melanocortin). This process is vital for the receptor's ability to respond to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), facilitating cortisol production during stress (Chan2009MRAP; Novoselova2013Melanocortin).

MRAP is highly expressed in the adrenal gland, where it plays a critical role in steroidogenesis by ensuring adequate MC2R surface expression and function (Novoselova2018MRAP). The protein's unique topology, with one N-terminus extracellular and one intracellular, allows it to maintain an association with MC2R at the cell surface, which is necessary for ACTH binding and signal transduction (Clark2019Stability). MRAP's role extends beyond the adrenal gland, as it is also expressed in other tissues, including the brain, suggesting potential involvement in broader physiological processes (Chan2009MRAP). Mutations in MRAP can lead to familial glucocorticoid deficiency, underscoring its importance in normal adrenal function (Novoselova2013Melanocortin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MRAP gene are associated with familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by adrenal insufficiency due to impaired ACTH signaling. This condition results in low cortisol levels and elevated plasma ACTH, leading to symptoms such as hypoglycemic seizures, failure to thrive, and hyperpigmentation. If untreated, FGD can be potentially fatal and may cause neurological issues due to recurrent hypoglycemia (Meimaridou2013Familial; Duan2022A).

MRAP mutations account for approximately 8-20% of FGD cases. These mutations often result in proteins lacking the transmembrane domain, causing retention of the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) in the endoplasmic reticulum and loss of function. Some missense mutations allow normal cell surface localization of MC2R but reduce receptor signaling (Meimaridou2013Familial; Duan2022A). A specific mutation, c.106+1delG, is common among patients with MRAP mutations, affecting the intron 3 donor splice site and leading to a truncated protein. This mutation is associated with early onset of symptoms, including hyperpigmentation and hypoglycemia at birth (Duan2022A).

In addition to FGD, MRAP deficiency in mice models has shown neonatal lethality due to impaired lung maturation, which can be rescued by corticosterone administration, highlighting the critical role of MRAP in adrenal physiology (Novoselova2018MRAP).

## Interactions
MRAP (melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein) is known for its critical role in the trafficking and function of the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R). It facilitates the cell surface expression of MC2R, enabling its activation by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (Cooray2007The). MRAP forms stable antiparallel homodimers and can also heterodimerize with MRAP2, another accessory protein, which influences the function and regulation of MC2R (Sebag2010Regulation; Chan2009MRAP).

MRAP's interaction with MC2R is essential for the receptor's trafficking to the plasma membrane, a process crucial for its physiological function in the adrenal gland (Novoselova2013Melanocortin). The interaction domain between MRAP and MC2R is mapped to specific amino acids, which include the transmembrane domain, highlighting the specificity of this interaction (Novoselova2013Melanocortin).

MRAP also interacts with other melanocortin receptors, such as MC1R, MC3R, MC4R, and MC5R, where it can modulate their expression and signaling. It reduces the surface expression and cAMP generation of MC4R and MC5R, indicating a broader regulatory role beyond MC2R (Chan2009MRAP). These interactions underscore MRAP's significant role in the regulation of GPCR signaling pathways.
