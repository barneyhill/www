# ALKAL1

## Overview
ALKAL1, also known as ALK and LTK ligand 1, is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as a ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinases ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) and LTK (leukocyte tyrosine kinase). The ALKAL1 protein is characterized by a three-helix bundle structure stabilized by disulfide bonds, which is essential for its role in cellular signaling. It is involved in critical pathways regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly in neural crest cells and their derivatives, influencing processes such as synapse modulation and neurogenesis (Fadeev2017ALKALs; Katic2023Multifaceted). ALKAL1's interactions with ALK and LTK receptors are crucial for the activation of signaling pathways that are significant in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer. The gene's expression is notably upregulated in colorectal cancer, where it is associated with tumor malignancy and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Chen2021ALKAL1).

## Structure
The ALKAL1 protein is characterized by a three-helix bundle structure stabilized by disulfide bonds, which is a common feature shared with ALKAL2. The C-terminal domains of ALKAL1 and ALKAL2 exhibit a high sequence identity of 66% and are structurally superimposed, indicating a conserved interface between helix A and helices B and C. This interface is maintained by conserved disulfide bonds, which are crucial for the structural integrity of the protein (De2021Structural).

The protein lacks the classically buried hydrophobic core typical of helical cytokines. Instead, helix A buries Ile77 into a hydrophobic pocket formed by Leu117, Tyr110, and the Cys104-Cys113 disulfide in the BC loop. The hydrophobic cavities are solvent-exposed and lined by conserved residues along the internal BC face and the AB loop, with hydroxyl-containing residues around the outer rim (De2021Structural).

The ALKAL1 protein interacts with ALK and LTK receptors, forming dimeric assemblies with two-fold symmetry. These interactions involve specific hydrophobic patches and residues, contributing to the cytokine-mediated activation of these receptors (De2021Structural). The protein's structure is crucial for its function in cellular signaling, although specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ALKAL1, also known as ALK and LTK ligand 1, is a protein that functions as a ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinases ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) and LTK (leukocyte tyrosine kinase). In healthy human cells, ALKAL1 is involved in critical signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly in neural crest cells and their derivatives (Fadeev2017ALKALs). These pathways are essential for proper neural development and function, influencing processes such as synapse modulation and neurogenesis (Katic2023Multifaceted).

ALKAL1 is characterized by a highly conserved FAM150 domain at its C-terminus and contains four conserved cysteines, which are crucial for its function as a ligand (Fadeev2017ALKALs). The protein is active in various cellular locations, including the cell membrane and cytoplasm, where it interacts with ALK and LTK receptors to initiate downstream signaling cascades (Mo2017Alk).

In zebrafish models, ALKAL1 has been shown to play a role in the development and maintenance of iridophores, a type of pigment cell, indicating a conserved function across species (Fadeev2017ALKALs). This suggests that ALKAL1 may have similar roles in pigment cell development and patterning in humans.

## Clinical Significance
The ALKAL1 gene, also known as augmentor-β or FAM150A, plays a significant role in the progression of colorectal cancer. It is an activating ligand for the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), which is aberrantly activated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer. Studies have shown that ALKAL1 expression is upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with tumor malignancy and poor prognosis (Chen2021ALKAL1). High ALKAL1 expression is associated with advanced clinical stages and poor overall survival in patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Chen2021ALKAL1).

Silencing ALKAL1 has been found to inhibit tumorigenesis, metastasis, and invasion of colorectal cancer cells by suppressing the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell migration and invasion (Chen2021ALKAL1). This suggests that targeting ALKAL1 and the SHH pathway could be a therapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer. The gene's interaction with the SHH pathway highlights its role in cancer cell migration and invasion, further emphasizing its clinical significance in colorectal cancer progression (Chen2021ALKAL1).

## Interactions
ALKAL1 (ALK and LTK ligand 1) is a protein that interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases, specifically ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) and LTK (leukocyte tyrosine kinase). These interactions are crucial for the activation of signaling pathways involved in cell growth and differentiation. ALKAL1 forms a disulfide-stabilized three-helix bundle structure that allows it to bind to ALK and LTK receptors at specific sites. At site 1, ALKAL1 uses a hydrophobic patch surrounded by arginine residues to interact with the LTK receptor's TNFL subdomain, which accommodates ALKAL1 through a conserved hydrophobic platform (De2021Structural). At site 2, ALKAL1's short helix A and the tip of the BC hairpin engage the second receptor molecule, with specific phenylalanine residues protruding into a conserved hydrophobic pocket on LTK (De2021Structural).

The interactions of ALKAL1 with LTK are mediated by specific polar contacts and are influenced by the EGFL domain, which dictates cytokine specificity (De2021Structural). ALKAL1 is identified as a high-affinity cytokine for LTK, with specific mutations in ALKAL1 reducing receptor affinity (De2021Structural). These interactions facilitate the clustering of transmembrane helices and the activation of intracellular kinase domains, playing a significant role in therapeutic targeting in cancer (Felix2024Reanalysis).
