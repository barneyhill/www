# VAX2

## Overview
VAX2 is a gene that encodes the ventral anterior homeobox 2 protein, a transcription factor characterized by its homeodomain, which facilitates DNA binding and gene regulation. This protein plays a pivotal role in the development and function of the retina, particularly influencing the ventral region and the distribution of retinoic acid, which is crucial for cone photoreceptor cell function and visual acuity (Alfano2011Vax2; Alfano2016First). VAX2 is expressed predominantly in neuronal tissues, with significant enrichment in the retina, and exists in two isoforms with distinct sub-cellular localizations, suggesting diverse functional roles (Alfano2016First). Beyond its role in eye development, VAX2 is implicated in cancer progression, interacting with signaling pathways such as Sonic hedgehog and influencing gene expression related to tumorigenesis (Hong2023The; Kim2006Hedgehogregulated). Mutations in VAX2 have been associated with retinal diseases and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Alfano2018Identification; Guo2019Depletion).

## Structure
The VAX2 gene encodes a transcription factor that contains a homeodomain, which is a key structural domain typically forming a helix-turn-helix motif. This motif is crucial for the protein's function in DNA binding and gene regulation (Alfano2018Identification). The secondary structure of the VAX2 protein includes alpha helices, and the presence of a helix-turn-helix structure is predicted to encompass the entire homeodomain. A specific variant, p.Leu139Arg, alters this structure, leading to the absence of a beta strand, which may result in protein misfolding (Alfano2018Identification).

VAX2 has two known isoforms with distinct sub-cellular localizations. Isoform-1 is localized to the nucleus, while isoform-2 is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. This differential localization suggests distinct functional roles for each isoform in retinal cells (Alfano2016First). The presence of a VxPx consensus sequence in the N-terminal part of VAX2 may be involved in trafficking to the photoreceptor outer segment, indicating a role in cellular transport processes (Alfano2016First). The study of VAX2 in various models highlights its involvement in eye development and potential implications in retinal diseases.

## Function
The VAX2 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and function of the retina, particularly in the ventral region. In healthy human cells, VAX2 is involved in the specification of the ventral eye and is crucial for the proper distribution of retinoic acid within the retina. This distribution is essential for the appropriate expression of genes in cone photoreceptor cells, which are vital for color vision and visual acuity (Alfano2011Vax2; Alfano2016First).

VAX2 is expressed in neuronal tissues, with significant enrichment in the retina. It has two isoforms: isoform-1, which localizes to the nucleus, and isoform-2, which is expressed throughout the cell and partially co-localizes with actin filaments. In the retina, VAX2 is found in either the nuclear or cytoplasmic compartment depending on the cell type, with notable enrichment in the outer segment of cone photoreceptors (Alfano2016First).

The gene is also implicated in the regulation of cone opsin expression, which is crucial for photoreceptor function and maintenance. VAX2's role in these processes suggests its involvement in photoreceptor homeostasis and retinal health (Alfano2011Vax2; Alfano2018Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the VAX2 gene have been implicated in several ocular and non-ocular conditions. In the context of retinal diseases, a heterozygous non-synonymous variant, c.416T>G (p.Leu139Arg), has been identified in patients with cone dystrophy. This variant leads to protein mislocalization and degradation, suggesting a loss-of-function phenotype, and is associated with central vision loss and reduced color discrimination (Alfano2018Identification). VAX2 mutations have also been linked to bilateral rod/cone photoreceptor dystrophy and mild optic atrophy, as observed in a patient with a genomic deletion affecting VAX2 (Norgett2015A).

Beyond ocular conditions, VAX2 expression is significantly upregulated in certain cancers. In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), high VAX2 expression is associated with poor prognosis and contributes to the malignant progression of the disease by modulating the ERK signaling pathway (Guo2019Depletion). Similarly, in gastric cancer, VAX2 overexpression promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and is linked to metastasis (Hong2023The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of VAX2 in both retinal and cancer pathologies.

## Interactions
VAX2 is a transcription factor that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in eye development and cancer progression. In the context of eye development, VAX2 interacts with the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, which regulates its nuclear localization. This interaction is crucial for the proper development of the optic nerve and the establishment of dorsal-ventral polarity in the retina. The phosphorylation of VAX2 at serine 170, likely mediated by protein kinase A (PKA), controls its shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm, with Shh antagonizing this phosphorylation to promote nuclear localization (Kim2006Hedgehogregulated).

In gastric cancer, VAX2 is involved in the VAX2-LINC01189-hnRNPF signaling axis. VAX2 binds to the promoter of LINC01189, a long non-coding RNA, repressing its transcription. This interaction is confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and luciferase reporter assays. LINC01189 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation by VAX2 promotes gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis. VAX2 also influences the expression of hnRNPF, a protein involved in gene expression and signal transduction, further contributing to cancer progression (Hong2023The).
