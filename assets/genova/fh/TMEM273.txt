# TMEM273

## Overview
TMEM273 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 273, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions are not yet fully understood. Research has highlighted its significance in the context of cancer, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where its expression levels have been linked to patient prognosis. High expression of TMEM273 is associated with poor clinical outcomes, making it a potential biomarker for these diseases (Yu2020High; Fan2022Transmembrane). Further studies are needed to elucidate the specific roles and mechanisms of TMEM273 in cellular physiology and pathology.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
TMEM273 has been implicated in the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In LUAD, TMEM273 is part of a transmembrane protein-based risk model that predicts patient outcomes. High expression levels of TMEM273, along with TMEM164 and TMEM125, are associated with poor prognosis, characterized by increased cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and immunosuppression. Patients with high-risk scores, which include elevated TMEM273 expression, tend to have worse overall survival and recurrence-free survival (Fan2022Transmembrane).

In AML, TMEM273 is one of the mRNAs linked to poor overall survival. It is included in a prognostic risk model that categorizes patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. High-risk patients, with elevated TMEM273 expression, show significantly lower survival rates. This model, which also includes SH3TC2 and ENPP2, has a high predictive value for patient outcomes (Yu2020High).

These findings suggest that alterations in TMEM273 expression are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in both LUAD and AML, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for prognosis in these cancers. However, specific mutations in TMEM273 and their direct effects on disease mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.
