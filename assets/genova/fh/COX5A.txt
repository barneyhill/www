# COX5A

## Overview
The COX5A gene encodes the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A, a vital component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain's Complex IV, also known as cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). This protein is integral to the process of oxidative phosphorylation, facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, which is essential for ATP production in eukaryotic cells (Čunátová2020Role; Fornuskova2010Novel). As a structural subunit, COX5A plays a crucial role in the assembly and stability of the CcO complex, ensuring the proper integration of other subunits and the formation of the functional holoenzyme (Čunátová2020Role; Fornuskova2010Novel). Located on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, COX5A is involved in regulating the activity of cytochrome c oxidase and, consequently, cellular energy metabolism (Čunátová2020Role; Fornuskova2010Novel). Mutations in the COX5A gene can lead to mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its critical role in maintaining cellular respiration and energy homeostasis (Baertling2017Mutation).

## Function
The COX5A gene encodes a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), also known as Complex IV, which is a critical component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This enzyme complex is essential for oxidative metabolism, facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, a process that is crucial for ATP production in cells (Čunátová2020Role; Fornuskova2010Novel). COX5A is involved in the proper assembly and function of the CcO complex, playing a significant role in the early stages of its assembly. It ensures the correct incorporation of other subunits, such as Cox1, and is necessary for the formation of the fully assembled CcO holoenzyme (Čunátová2020Role; Fornuskova2010Novel).

In healthy human cells, COX5A is located on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it contributes to the structural integrity and functional efficiency of the CcO complex. This subunit is also involved in the regulation of COX activity and energy metabolism, impacting cellular respiration and ATP synthesis (Čunátová2020Role; Fornuskova2010Novel). Despite its critical role in CcO assembly, COX5A deficiency does not significantly affect the activity of other oxidative phosphorylation complexes, indicating its specific importance for CcO function (Fornuskova2010Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COX5A gene, which encodes a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), are associated with several severe clinical conditions. Pathogenic variants in COX5A can lead to mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, resulting in diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), lactic acidemia, and failure to thrive. These conditions were observed in siblings with a homozygous variant c.319C>T; p.(Arg107Cys), which disrupts the COX5A/COX4 interface, crucial for complex IV stability and function (Baertling2017Mutation). The mutation leads to isolated complex IV deficiency, characterized by decreased enzymatic activity and reduced levels of holo-complex IV (Baertling2017Mutation).

Another study identified a novel homozygous variant, c.266 T > G, resulting in a p.(Ile89Ser) substitution, which also leads to reduced COX5A protein levels and decreased complex IV activity. This variant was associated with a milder phenotype, including failure to thrive, lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia, and short stature, without cardiovascular or neurodevelopmental involvement (Torraco2022A).

Alterations in COX5A expression have been linked to increased migration and invasiveness in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Čunátová2020Role). Additionally, COX5A abnormalities are associated with growth retardation, abnormal lactate metabolism, and aging-related diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease (Yuan2023CLPP).

## Interactions
COX5A is a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV) and plays a crucial role in its assembly and function. It interacts with other subunits within the complex, particularly forming a heterodimer with COX4, which is essential for the assembly of Complex IV. This interaction is critical for the integration of COX1, a key step in the assembly process (Baertling2017Mutation; Fornuskova2010Novel). The arginine at position 107 in COX5A forms multiple interactions with COX4, including hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions, which are vital for stabilizing the COX5A/COX4 interface (Baertling2017Mutation).

The COX5A subunit is also involved in the formation of respiratory supercomplexes, which include the dimeric form of cytochrome c oxidase. Knockdown studies have shown that COX5A is necessary for the proper assembly of these supercomplexes, as its depletion leads to the accumulation of subcomplexes and affects the overall assembly of Complex IV (Fornuskova2010Novel). COX5A's interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and functional capacity of the cytochrome c oxidase complexes, as evidenced by its role in stabilizing the COX5A/COX4 interface and facilitating the assembly of the holoenzyme (Baertling2017Mutation; Fornuskova2010Novel).
