# MIPEP

## Overview
The MIPEP gene encodes the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP), a metalloprotease that plays a pivotal role in the maturation of mitochondrial proteins. MIP is involved in the processing of precursor proteins within the mitochondrial matrix, following an initial cleavage by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP). This secondary cleavage by MIP is crucial for the stability and functionality of mitochondrial proteins, which are essential for cellular energy metabolism and the assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes (Eldomery2016MIPEP; Marcondes2015Substrate). MIP is characterized by its requirement for metal ions, particularly Mn^2+, and its expression is notably high in energy-demanding tissues such as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle (Gakh2002Mitochondrial; Adamec2002Mitochondrial). Mutations in the MIPEP gene have been linked to severe clinical conditions, including left ventricular non-compaction and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, underscoring its critical role in mitochondrial function and human health (Wang2023Case; Eldomery2016MIPEP).

## Function
The MIPEP gene encodes the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP), a crucial enzyme in the maturation of mitochondrial proteins. MIP is responsible for processing precursor proteins that are imported into the mitochondrial matrix. These precursor proteins initially undergo cleavage by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP), which removes the majority of the N-terminal targeting sequence. MIP then performs a secondary cleavage, removing an octapeptide from the newly formed N-terminus, which is essential for the stability and maturation of mitochondrial proteins (Eldomery2016MIPEP; Marcondes2015Substrate).

MIP is a metalloprotease that requires metal ions for its activity, with Mn^2+ being a significant activator. It is a soluble monomer with a zinc ion binding motif, and its activity is influenced by specific substrate residues, indicating a role in stabilizing interactions necessary for processing (Gakh2002Mitochondrial; Adamec2002Mitochondrial).

The enzyme is highly expressed in tissues with high energy demands, such as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism. Proper MIP function is critical for the assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, which are essential for efficient ATP production (Gomez‐Fabra2021Mitochondrial; Eldomery2016MIPEP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MIPEP gene are associated with a range of severe clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in mitochondrial function. Biallelic variants in MIPEP have been linked to a syndrome characterized by left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC), developmental delay, seizures, severe hypotonia, and cataracts, often resulting in infantile or childhood death (Eldomery2016MIPEP). These mutations lead to decreased protease activity and impaired mitochondrial function, as demonstrated in model organisms (Eldomery2016MIPEP).

In a case report, a Chinese infant with novel compound heterozygous variants in MIPEP presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), severe lactic acidosis, and hypotonia. This case highlighted the role of MIPEP in mitochondrial diseases, expanding the phenotypic spectrum to include cardiomyopathy and systemic impairments (Wang2023Case). The report also noted a significant reduction in mitochondrial DNA copy number, underscoring MIPEP's crucial role in mitochondrial function (Wang2023Case).

The MIPEP gene's involvement in the maturation of mitochondrial proteins suggests that its mutations can disrupt the oxidative phosphorylation system, potentially leading to combined deficiencies in this system (Coenen2005Mutation). These deficiencies manifest as neurological and muscular symptoms due to impaired energy production.
