# ELP4

## Overview
ELP4 is a gene that encodes the protein elongator acetyltransferase complex subunit 4, which is a critical component of the Elongator complex. This complex is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional elongation, tRNA modification, and polarized exocytosis, and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. The ELP4 protein, as part of the Elongator complex, plays a significant role in the nervous system, contributing to neuronal development and function. It is involved in processes such as nerve cell growth cone motility, axon outgrowth, and neuronal migration. The Elongator complex, including ELP4, is also crucial for the modification of transfer RNAs, which enhances the translation of codon-biased genes, particularly in the peripheral nervous system. Mutations or deletions in the ELP4 gene have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and Rolandic epilepsy, highlighting its importance in normal neurodevelopmental processes (Addis2015Microdeletions; Strug2009Centrotemporal).

## Function
ELP4 is a subunit of the Elongator complex, which is involved in several critical cellular processes, including transcriptional elongation, tRNA modification, and polarized exocytosis. This complex is composed of six subunits (ELP1-ELP6) and plays a significant role in both nuclear and cytoplasmic functions in eukaryotic cells (Strug2009Centrotemporal). ELP4, as part of the Elongator complex, is crucial for the transcription of genes that regulate the actin cytoskeleton, cell motility, and migration. These functions are particularly important in the nervous system, where they contribute to nerve cell growth cone motility, axon outgrowth and guidance, neuritogenesis, and neuronal migration during development (Strug2009Centrotemporal).

The Elongator complex, including ELP4, is also involved in the modification of transfer RNAs (tRNAs), enhancing the translation of codon-biased genes. This modification is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and neuron survival, particularly in the peripheral nervous system (Goffena2018Elongator). ELP4's role in these processes underscores its importance in normal cellular function and development, particularly in the context of neurodevelopmental processes and disorders (Addis2015Microdeletions).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ELP4 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. ELP4 microdeletions have been linked to language impairment, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), developmental delay, intellectual disability, and aniridia, an abnormality of the iris. These conditions often involve speech and language delays, social communication difficulties, and cognitive delays (Addis2015Microdeletions). In autism cohorts, ELP4 microdeletions are found in individuals with ASD, all of whom experience language delays. A case-control analysis showed a significant association between ELP4 CNVs and ASD, with no such CNVs found in control groups (Addis2015Microdeletions).

ELP4 is also implicated in Rolandic epilepsy, a common childhood epilepsy characterized by centrotemporal sharp waves (CTS) on EEG. The gene is identified as a susceptibility factor for this condition, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ELP4, such as rs986527, being associated with an increased risk of CTS (Strug2009Centrotemporal). The ELP4 gene's involvement in these disorders suggests a complex genotype-phenotype relationship, where disruptions in ELP4 may affect neuronal development and function, leading to the observed clinical manifestations (Addis2015Microdeletions; Strug2009Centrotemporal).

## Interactions
ELP4 is a component of the Elongator complex, which is involved in tRNA modification and transcriptional processes. In Arabidopsis, ELP4 forms part of the ELP456 sub-complex, interacting specifically with ELP5 and ELP6 to form a heterohexameric ring structure. This interaction is crucial for the structural and functional integrity of the Elongator complex. The ELP4 protein in Arabidopsis has been shown to form hydrogen bonds with ELP5 and ELP6, with specific residues involved in these interactions identified through AlphaFold Multimer predictions. For instance, in the AtELP4-AtELP6 interface, residues such as Arg256 and His259 of AtELP4 interact with Glu147 and His181 of AtELP6 (Jun2024Evolutionary). 

In yeast, the Elongator subcomplex, including ELP4, specifically recognizes and interacts with tRNA, which is essential for its role in tRNA modification. Mutations in ELP4 can impair tRNA binding and reduce Elongator activity, leading to cellular defects (Jun2022AtELP4). The evolutionary conservation of these interactions between Arabidopsis and yeast suggests their significance in maintaining the Elongator complex's function across species (Jun2024Evolutionary).
