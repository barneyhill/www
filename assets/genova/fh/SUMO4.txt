# SUMO4

## Overview
SUMO4 (small ubiquitin-like modifier 4) is a gene that encodes a member of the SUMO protein family, which is involved in the post-translational modification process known as sumoylation. This process is critical for regulating protein function, stability, localization, and activity. The SUMO4 protein plays a significant role in modulating the NFκB signaling pathway, which is essential for immune response, inflammation, and cell survival. As a regulatory protein, SUMO4 influences various cellular processes by interacting with and modifying transcription factors and other proteins involved in DNA repair and immune regulation. Its interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and have implications in disease pathogenesis, particularly in autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders (Guo2005Proteomic; Wang2008SUMO4; Garvin2022SUMO4).

## Structure


## Function
SUMO4 (small ubiquitin-like modifier 4) is involved in the post-translational modification process known as sumoylation, which regulates protein function by altering their stability, localization, and activity. In healthy human cells, SUMO4 plays a crucial role in regulating the NFκB signaling pathway, which is associated with immune response, inflammation, cell survival, and apoptosis. SUMO4 interacts with the inhibitory protein IκBα, stabilizing it and preventing its degradation, thereby keeping NFκB inactive in the cytoplasm. Upon stimulation, IκBα is phosphorylated and degraded, allowing NFκB to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of immune-responsive genes. SUMO4 acts as a negative feedback regulator by inhibiting NFκB activity, thus controlling the immune response and maintaining immune homeostasis (Wang2008SUMO4).

SUMO4 also sumoylates various transcription factors, including AP-1, AP-2a, STAT-1, and STAT-3, affecting their activity and localization. For instance, SUMO4 sumoylation inhibits the transcriptional activity of AP-1 and AP-2a while enhancing the DNA binding capacity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which acts as an antagonist for NFκB and AP-1. This regulatory role impacts cellular responses to environmental changes and stress (Guo2005Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SUMO4 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. The M55V polymorphism in SUMO4 is associated with an increased susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D). This variant is linked to higher activation of transcription factors and increased risk of T1D, especially in Asian populations such as Japanese and Korean (Bohren2004A; Wang2008SUMO4). The M55V mutation affects the JAK/STAT and NFκB signaling pathways, which are crucial for immune response regulation. Dysregulation of these pathways due to the M55V variant may contribute to T1D pathogenesis by affecting cytokine signaling and β-cell survival (Wang2008SUMO4).

In addition to T1D, SUMO4 polymorphisms have been linked to other autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroid disease and rheumatoid arthritis, though not consistently across all populations (Wang2008SUMO4). Alterations in SUMO4 expression have also been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where a variant affects stress granule dynamics, potentially influencing disease progression (Osmanovic2022A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SUMO4 in various diseases through its role in immune and stress response pathways.

## Interactions
SUMO4 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. It promotes the activity of the SENP1 protease, which is essential for deconjugating SUMO1-3, thereby maintaining SUMO homeostasis. This interaction is specific, as demonstrated by increased deconjugation activity of SENP1 when incubated with recombinant SUMO4 (Garvin2022SUMO4). SUMO4 also interacts with the BRCA1-A complex component RAP80, which contains tandem SIM-UIM motifs. In SUMO4-deficient cells, there is a hyper-accumulation of RAP80 foci, which can be reversed by complementation with SUMO4-WT, indicating a regulatory role in RAP80 recruitment (Garvin2022SUMO4).

SUMO4's interaction with SENP1 is crucial for regulating RAP80 recruitment, a component of the BRCA1-A complex involved in DSB repair. This interaction is important for maintaining SUMO conjugate homeostasis, which is relevant to cancer biology and potential therapeutic targeting of the SUMO pathway (Garvin2022SUMO4). The interaction between SUMO4 and SENP1 is not due to its C-terminal residues but rather its ability to form a complex with SENP1, highlighting the importance of SUMO4's non-conjugated form in effective DSB repair (Garvin2022SUMO4).
