# ST6GALNAC6

## Overview
ST6GALNAC6 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST6 N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 6, which is a member of the glycosyltransferase family. This enzyme is involved in the process of glycosylation, specifically in the addition of sialic acid to glycoproteins and glycolipids, a modification that plays a crucial role in cell-cell interactions and signaling. The protein encoded by ST6GALNAC6 is particularly significant in the synthesis of disialyl-Lewis x (di-sLe x) structures and higher disialogangliosides, which are important in various biological processes, including immune response and cancer progression (Dall’Olio2014Sialosignaling:). Alterations in the expression of ST6GALNAC6 have been associated with cancer, where its dysregulation can influence tumorigenicity and metastasis through changes in glycosylation patterns (Häuselmann2014Altered; Ščupáková2021Clinical).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ST6GALNAC6 is implicated in cancer progression through its role in glycosylation, particularly in the synthesis of disialyl-Lewis x (di-sLe x) structures. In malignant epithelial tissues, ST6GALNAC6 expression is often downregulated due to epigenetic silencing, which is associated with cancer progression and metastasis (Häuselmann2014Altered). In breast cancer, ST6GALNAC6 is upregulated in metastatic sites compared to primary tumors, suggesting its involvement in the progression of metastatic disease through N-glycan biosynthesis and sialylation (Ščupáková2021Clinical). 

The enzyme is also involved in the biosynthesis of higher disialogangliosides, with its expression showing down-regulation in cancer, although specific diseases or conditions directly related to ST6GALNAC6 gene mutations are not detailed (Dall’Olio2014Sialosignaling:). The upregulation of ST6GALNAC6 in metastases indicates its potential role in enhancing tumorigenicity and metastasis, particularly in the context of altered glycosylation patterns that affect cancer cell behavior and immune evasion (Ščupáková2021Clinical). These alterations in glycosylation are linked to increased cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis, highlighting the clinical significance of ST6GALNAC6 in cancer biology (Häuselmann2014Altered).
