# RSPH9

## Overview
The RSPH9 gene encodes the radial spoke head component 9, a protein integral to the structure and function of motile cilia and flagella. This protein is a part of the radial spoke head-neck complex, which plays a crucial role in the motility of these cellular appendages by interacting with the central pair of microtubules. The RSPH9 protein is categorized as a structural component within the axonemal complex, contributing to the assembly and stability of radial spokes, which are essential for effective ciliary beating and flagellar movement (Meng2023Highresolution; Zhu2018Rsph9). Mutations in the RSPH9 gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia and male infertility, underscoring its clinical significance in respiratory and reproductive health (Aprea2023Pathogenic; Reish2010Founder).

## Structure
The RSPH9 protein is a component of the radial spoke head complex, which is crucial for the motility of cilia and flagella. It is part of the RS head-neck complex, which includes Rsph1, Rsph4a, Rsph9, and Rsph3b subunits, forming a two-fold symmetric brake pad-shaped structure (Meng2024Multiscale). The RS head consists of Rsph4a-Rsph9-Rsph1 protomers, which can assemble independently, and Rsph9 is involved in intensive interactions with Rsph4a and Rsph16, forming part of the interaction network within the RS head-neck complex (Meng2023Highresolution).

The RS head-neck complex exists in both monomer and dimer forms, with the monomer structure featuring a compact body and two extending Rsph1 arms, made up of two copies of Rsph1/Rsph4a/Rsph9 (Meng2023Highresolution). Rsph9 is suggested to be part of the RS3 head, interacting with LRRC23 and forming a core structure with Rsph4a, characterized by a double hump feature (Meng2023Highresolution). The RS head-neck dimer consists of two copies of the RS head-neck connected by an arch bridge of Rsph16-Rsph16' (Meng2024Multiscale). The molecular structure of Rsph9 contributes to the overall RS-CP interaction and cilia motility (Meng2024Multiscale).

## Function
The RSPH9 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the radial spoke head structure within the axonemes of motile cilia and flagella. In healthy human cells, RSPH9 plays a vital role in the assembly of radial spokes and the stability of the central pair microtubules, which are essential for the proper motility of these structures (Zhu2018Rsph9). The radial spokes, where RSPH9 is located, interact with the central pair of microtubules to regulate the ciliary beat, which is crucial for effective ciliary function (Zou2020Loss).

RSPH9 is functionally conserved in both respiratory cilia and sperm flagella, indicating its role in maintaining proper motility in these structures (Aprea2023Pathogenic). In sperm, RSPH9 is involved in the structural integrity and function of the flagella, contributing to normal sperm motility (Aprea2023Pathogenic). The protein's activity is crucial for processes such as fluid movement in the respiratory system and sperm motility, impacting respiratory function and fertility (Sedykh2016Novel). The absence or mutation of RSPH9 can lead to structural defects in cilia and flagella, resulting in conditions like primary ciliary dyskinesia and male infertility (Aprea2023Pathogenic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RSPH9 gene are clinically significant as they are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by defects in the motility of cilia. This condition leads to chronic respiratory infections, lung damage, and subfertility due to ineffective ciliary function (AlMutairi2023Mapping; Reish2010Founder). A specific mutation, c.801_803delGAA (p.Lys268del), has been identified in Bedouin families, causing cilia dysmotility and central-microtubular-pair abnormalities (Reish2010Founder). This mutation is linked to respiratory issues, including neonatal respiratory distress and chronic bronchitis, as well as infertility (AlMutairi2023Mapping; Reish2010Founder).

In addition to PCD, RSPH9 mutations are implicated in male infertility due to asthenozoospermia, a condition marked by reduced sperm motility. This is attributed to the absence of RSPH9 in sperm flagella, leading to abnormal radial spoke head composition and morphological defects (Aprea2023Pathogenic). The loss of RSPH9 function in mice has also been linked to hydrocephalus, highlighting its role in neurological conditions (Zou2020Loss). These findings underscore the importance of RSPH9 in maintaining normal ciliary and flagellar function.

## Interactions
RSPH9 is a component of the radial spoke head-neck complex in cilia, where it interacts with several other proteins to maintain ciliary structure and function. It forms part of the RS head core complex along with RSPH1, RSPH4A, and RSPH3B, contributing to a two-fold symmetric structure essential for ciliary motility (Meng2024Multiscale). RSPH9 is involved in significant interactions with RSPH16, forming an intense hydrogen bond/salt-bridge interaction network, and also interacts with RSPH4A, RSPH3B, and RSPH23, which are crucial for the stability and function of the RS head-neck complex (Meng2024Multiscale).

In the context of axonemal complexes, RSPH9 is suggested to interact with LRRC23, a potential component of the RS3 complex, indicating its role in the composition and function of this complex (Meng2024Multiscale). These interactions are vital for the structural integrity and function of the radial spoke complex, which is essential for the proper movement of cilia. The disruption of these interactions, such as through mutations in RSPH9, can lead to conditions like primary ciliary dyskinesia, highlighting the importance of these protein interactions in maintaining ciliary function (Sedykh2016Novel).
