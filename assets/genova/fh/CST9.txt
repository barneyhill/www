# CST9

## Overview
CST9 is a gene that encodes the protein cystatin 9, which is a member of the type 2 cysteine protease inhibitor family. This protein plays a critical role in the immune system by regulating proteolytic activities and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Cystatin 9 functions primarily as a cysteine protease inhibitor, acting in the extracellular space to prevent excessive protease activity that could lead to tissue damage and inflammation. It is particularly noted for its immunomodulatory effects, such as enhancing the intracellular killing of pathogens like Francisella tularensis by macrophages and modulating inflammatory responses through pathways like mTOR (EavesPyles2013Immunomodulatory; Holloway2018Cystatins). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting tissues from protease-mediated damage.

## Structure


## Function
Cystatin 9 (CST9) is a member of the type 2 cysteine protease inhibitor family, primarily known for its role in regulating immune responses and maintaining tissue homeostasis. CST9 functions as a cysteine protease inhibitor, helping to balance proteolytic activities by inhibiting cysteine proteases, which is crucial for preventing excessive cytokine production and tissue breakdown (EavesPyles2013Immunomodulatory). This protein is active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to tissue integrity and protection against protease-mediated damage (Holloway2018Cystatins).

CST9 has been shown to modulate immune responses by enhancing the intracellular killing of the bacterium Francisella tularensis by macrophages, while also restraining inflammation. It achieves this by inducing autophagy in macrophages through the regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway and promoting the upregulation of proteins involved in anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis (EavesPyles2013Immunomodulatory). CST9 also prevents the escape of Francisella tularensis from macrophage phagosomes, reducing cytosolic replication and subsequent inflammatory cytokine release (EavesPyles2013Immunomodulatory). These functions suggest that CST9 plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis in healthy human cells.
