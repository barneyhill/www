# NEXN

## Overview
The NEXN gene encodes the protein nexilin, an actin-binding protein that plays a critical role in the structural integrity and function of muscle cells, particularly in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. Nexilin is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein due to its involvement in actin filament stabilization and its localization to Z-discs in striated muscle and dense bodies in smooth muscle cells. The protein's structure, which includes actin-binding domains and an immunoglobulin superfamily domain, is essential for its function in maintaining sarcomeric integrity and facilitating proper muscle contraction. Mutations in the NEXN gene have been linked to cardiomyopathies, such as dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, highlighting its importance in cardiovascular health (Wang2010Mutations; Noureddine2023Structural; Zhu2018NexilinNEXN).

## Structure
Nexilin, encoded by the NEXN gene, is a protein with a molecular weight of 78 kDa and consists of 656 amino acids. Its primary structure includes an amino-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD), a coiled-coil (CC) domain, another ABD, and a carboxy-terminal immunoglobulin superfamily class (IGcam) domain (Shao2024In; Noureddine2023Structural). The protein is highly conserved between mice and humans, sharing 88% identity (Shao2024In).

Nexilin's structure is crucial for its function in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. The C-terminal ABD and IGcam domains are essential for cardiac function, while the N-terminal ABD and coiled-coil domains are not as critical (Shao2024In). Mutations in these domains can lead to cardiomyopathies, such as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), by affecting the protein's ability to bind F-actin or alpha-actinin, leading to disruptions in sarcomeric units and Z-disk integrity (Wang2010Mutations; Noureddine2023Structural).

The protein's tertiary structure involves its overall 3D folding, which is necessary for its interaction with actin filaments and maintaining cytoskeletal integrity. However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The NEXN gene encodes the protein nexilin, which plays a crucial role in actin filament binding and is expressed in both striated and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In striated muscle, nexilin localizes to the Z-discs, contributing to mechanical stability and proper muscle contraction by stabilizing actin filaments (Zhu2018NexilinNEXN). In smooth muscle cells, nexilin is found at dense bodies and dense bands, which are analogous to Z-discs, and is involved in actin polymerization, maintaining the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton (Zhu2018NexilinNEXN).

Nexilin's expression is regulated by actin polymerization and actin-sensitive transcriptional coactivators, including myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs) and YAP/TAZ, which influence its expression through the proximal promoter (Zhu2018NexilinNEXN). The protein is essential for maintaining the F/G-actin ratio, which is critical for actin dynamics and cell migration (Zhu2018NexilinNEXN). NEXN also plays a role in inhibiting the TLR4 and NF-κB signaling pathways, which are involved in inflammatory responses, thereby contributing to vascular health and reducing atherosclerosis risk (Hu2019Long). Overall, nexilin is vital for the organization and stability of the actin cytoskeleton, influencing muscle cell function and cardiovascular health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NEXN gene, which encodes the protein nexilin, are associated with several cardiac conditions, most notably dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Pathogenic variants in NEXN can lead to progressive DCM, typically manifesting in adults around 50 years of age, but cases have been reported in children as well. For instance, a heterozygous NEXN variant in a boy led to transient DCM at 3 months, which resolved by 4 months, while a girl with homozygous variants presented with severe neonatal DCM and died shortly after birth (Bruyndonckx2021Childhood). 

NEXN mutations can disrupt the organization of actin filaments, affecting cardiac muscle function and leading to heart failure. In mouse models, the knockout of NEXN results in rapid progression to a fulminant DCM phenotype, characterized by left ventricular dilation and decreased cardiac function (Aherrahrou2015Knockout). 

NEXN is also implicated in congenital heart defects, such as atrial septal defects (ASDs). Overexpression of NEXN can inhibit the cardiac transcription factor GATA4, crucial for heart development, leading to ASDs in both mice and humans (Yang2014NEXN). These findings underscore the clinical significance of NEXN in cardiac health and disease.

## Interactions
NEXN, also known as nexilin, is an actin-binding protein that plays a crucial role in cardiac and smooth muscle cells. In cardiomyocytes, NEXN is a component of junctional membrane complexes (JMCs) and interacts with key junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) proteins such as RyR2 and junctophilin-2 (Jph2). These interactions are essential for the stability and formation of T-tubules, which are critical for proper calcium handling and cardiac function (Liu2019Nexilin; Wang2020Nexilin). NEXN's absence leads to impaired calcium transients and abnormal expression of junctional proteins, highlighting its importance in cardiac physiology (Liu2019Nexilin).

In smooth muscle cells, NEXN is involved in actin polymerization and is regulated by myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs) and YAP/TAZ, which are actin-controlled transcriptional coactivators. These interactions suggest a role for NEXN in maintaining the F/G-actin ratio and influencing cell migration (Zhu2018NexilinNEXN). NEXN also interacts with the long noncoding RNA NEXN-AS1, which enhances its transcriptional activity by interacting with the 5′ flanking region of the NEXN gene, thereby upregulating its expression (Hu2019Long). These interactions underscore NEXN's multifaceted role in cellular structure and function.
