# MIGA1

## Overview
MIGA1 (mitoguardin 1) is a gene that encodes the mitoguardin 1 protein, which is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, particularly mitochondrial fusion. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and cellular homeostasis by interacting with MitoPLD, a phospholipase D family member, to facilitate the fusion of mitochondrial outer membranes. MIGA1 is also implicated in the regulation of the Hippo/YAP1 signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation and differentiation through its effects on YAP1 phosphorylation and localization. Additionally, MIGA1 interacts with endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins, contributing to the formation of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites, although these interactions are less pronounced compared to its homolog MIGA2 (Zhang2016Mitoguardin; Xu2020Migamediated; Yan2023Mitoguardin).

## Structure


## Function
MIGA1 (mitoguardin 1) is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial fusion, a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and cellular homeostasis. MIGA1, along with its homolog MIGA2, regulates mitochondrial fusion through its interaction with MitoPLD, a phospholipase D family member. MitoPLD hydrolyzes cardiolipin to produce phosphatidic acid, which facilitates the fusion of mitochondrial outer membranes (Zhang2016Mitoguardin).

In mammalian cells, overexpression of MIGA1 leads to mitochondrial clustering and hyperfusion, while knockdown results in mitochondrial fragmentation, indicating its necessity for maintaining mitochondrial structure (Zhang2016Mitoguardin). MIGA1 also enhances MitoPLD function by facilitating its dimer formation and stabilizing the protein, preventing its degradation (Zhang2016Mitoguardin).

MIGA1 is involved in regulating the Hippo/YAP1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation. It influences YAP1 phosphorylation and subcellular localization, affecting YAP1's transcriptional activity and the expression of its target genes (Yan2023Mitoguardin). MIGA1's role in mitochondrial dynamics and signaling pathways underscores its importance in cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis.

## Interactions
MIGA1 (mitoguardin 1) is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein involved in various cellular processes, including mitochondrial dynamics and function. It has been shown to interact with VAP proteins, specifically VAPA and VAPB, which are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane proteins. These interactions are crucial for the formation of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCS), which play a significant role in cellular homeostasis. However, MIGA1 exhibits a low affinity for VAP proteins compared to its homolog MIGA2, with the interaction between MIGA1 and VAPA being detected only in one direction, indicating weak binding (Xu2020Migamediated).

MIGA1 is also involved in the regulation of the Hippo/YAP1 signaling pathway in ovarian granulosa cells. It influences the phosphorylation and localization of YAP1, a transcriptional co-activator, by increasing AKT activity. This interaction affects YAP1's movement from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby regulating cell proliferation (Liu2023Mitoguardin2). MIGA1's role in these pathways highlights its importance in cellular signaling and mitochondrial function, although its interactions are less pronounced compared to MIGA2.
