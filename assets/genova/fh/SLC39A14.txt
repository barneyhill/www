# SLC39A14

## Overview
SLC39A14 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 39 member 14, also known as ZIP14, which is a member of the LIV-1 subfamily of zinc transporters. This protein functions as a divalent metal transporter, facilitating the cellular uptake of essential metal ions such as zinc, manganese, iron, and cadmium through its eight transmembrane domains (Tuschl2016Mutations; Liuzzi2006Zip14). ZIP14 is crucial for maintaining metal ion homeostasis, impacting various physiological processes including neurotransmitter synthesis and insulin secretion (Tuschl2016Mutations; Maxel2019The). The protein is predominantly expressed in the liver, brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, where it plays a significant role in metal ion regulation (Tominaga2005SLC39A14). Mutations in SLC39A14 are linked to hypermanganesemia with dystonia type 2, a disorder characterized by elevated manganese levels and neurological symptoms (Tuschl2016Mutations; Zhang2023A).

## Structure
The SLC39A14 gene encodes a divalent metal transporter protein, also known as ZIP14, which is part of the LIV-1 subfamily of zinc transporters. The protein contains eight transmembrane domains (TMDs) that facilitate the transport of metal ions across cell membranes, including zinc, manganese, iron, and cadmium (Tuschl2016Mutations; Liuzzi2006Zip14). These TMDs are interlinked by intracellular and extracellular loops, with TMD II, III, IV, and VII forming a pore crucial for metal transport (Tuschl2016Mutations).

ZIP14 features a histidine-rich motif (HXHXHX) and a metalloprotease motif (H/EEXPHEXGD), which are essential for its metal-binding and transport functions (Tuschl2016Mutations; Liuzzi2006Zip14). The protein is known to localize to the cell membrane and cytoplasm, indicating its role in cellular metal ion uptake (Tuschl2016Mutations).

SLC39A14 produces multiple isoforms through alternative splicing, with isoform 2 demonstrating a greater ability to transport manganese compared to isoform 1 (Tuschl2016Mutations). The protein's structure and function are affected by various mutations, which can impair its metal transport capabilities and lead to clinical disorders (Tuschl2016Mutations).

## Function
The SLC39A14 gene encodes a protein that is part of the SLC39 family of divalent metal transporters, primarily involved in the homeostasis of manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) in human cells. This protein facilitates the uptake of Mn and Zn into cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining metal ion balance, which is essential for various physiological processes (Tuschl2016Mutations; Liuzzi2006Zip14). 

In healthy human cells, SLC39A14 is expressed in the liver, where it aids in the uptake of Mn for biliary excretion, preventing Mn accumulation and its associated neurotoxic effects (Tuschl2016Mutations). The gene is also expressed in other tissues, including the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, indicating its broader role in metal ion regulation (Tominaga2005SLC39A14). 

SLC39A14 is localized to the cell membrane and cytoplasm, particularly in hepatocytes and neurons, where it facilitates the transport of Mn and Zn into cells (Tuschl2016Mutations). This transport activity is critical for processes such as neurotransmitter synthesis and insulin secretion, impacting both neurological and metabolic functions (Tuschl2016Mutations; Maxel2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC39A14 gene are associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder known as hypermanganesemia with dystonia type 2 (HMNDYT2). This condition is characterized by elevated manganese levels in the blood, leading to neurological symptoms such as childhood-onset parkinsonism-dystonia, motor regression, developmental delays, and generalized dystonia (Tuschl2016Mutations; Zhang2023A). Patients often exhibit specific MRI findings, including T1-weighted hyperintensity in the globus pallidus and striatum, indicative of manganese deposition (Tuschl2016Mutations).

The disorder results from loss-of-function mutations in SLC39A14, which impair manganese transport, causing its accumulation in the brain and blood (Rodichkin2022Hereditary). Despite elevated manganese levels, blood levels of other metals like zinc, iron, and cadmium remain normal (Zhang2023A). Clinical manifestations include severe generalized dystonia, spasticity, and parkinsonian features such as hypomimia, tremor, and bradykinesia (Rodichkin2022Hereditary).

Current treatments, including chelation therapy with CaNa2 EDTA and dietary manganese restriction, have shown limited effectiveness, highlighting the need for early intervention and further research into targeted therapies (Rodan2018Novel; Rodichkin2022Hereditary).

## Interactions
SLC39A14, also known as ZIP14, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes and metal ion homeostasis. It plays a critical role in regulating G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signaling pathways, particularly by modulating phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity. This regulation is crucial for maintaining basal cAMP levels, which are important for signaling pathways such as the PTH1R-cAMP-CREB pathway in chondrocytes (Hojyo2011The). SLC39A14's role in GPCR signaling is unique and not compensated by other zinc transporters, indicating specific interactions that facilitate zinc delivery to target molecules, potentially involving unidentified molecular chaperones (Hojyo2011The).

In pancreatic beta-cells, SLC39A14 influences insulin secretion and mitochondrial function. Silencing SLC39A14 affects the expression of mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, which is essential for insulin secretion. This suggests that SLC39A14 may interact with proteins regulating mitochondrial metabolism and insulin processing (Maxel2019The). The transporter also affects the expression of Chromogranin A, a regulatory pro-hormone involved in insulin secretion, indicating its role in modulating protein interactions related to insulin storage and release (Maxel2019The). These interactions highlight SLC39A14's involvement in critical cellular functions through its regulatory effects on protein networks.
