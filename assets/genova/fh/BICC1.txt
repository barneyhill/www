# BICC1

## Overview
BICC1 is a gene that encodes the BicC family RNA binding protein 1, a crucial player in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. This protein is characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities, primarily facilitated by its three K-homology (KH) domains, and its ability to form higher-order structures through a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain. BICC1 is involved in various cellular processes, including mRNA stability and translation, and plays a significant role in maintaining normal epithelial cell function, particularly in the kidneys. It interacts with several protein complexes, such as the Ccr4-Not deadenylase complex, to mediate mRNA repression and is implicated in the regulation of gluconeogenesis and organ laterality. Mutations in the BICC1 gene are linked to renal conditions like polycystic kidney disease and have broader implications in pancreatic development and cancer (Fu2010Loss; Dowdle2022BicaudalC; Rothé2020Role).

## Structure
The BICC1 protein is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function in RNA binding and regulation. It contains three tandem K-homology (KH) domains near the N-terminus, which are crucial for RNA binding. The KH2 domain is identified as the main determinant of RNA-binding activity, while KH1 and KH3 contribute minimally (Dolma2020Defining). These domains feature a GXXG motif, integral for RNA binding, though it does not confer target specificity (Dolma2020Defining).

The C-terminal region of BICC1 includes a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which is essential for self-polymerization and the formation of higher-order structures. This polymerization is crucial for the localization of BICC1 in cytoplasmic foci and the silencing of bound mRNAs (Rothé2015Bicc1). The SAM domain forms a helical structure with six SAM units per turn, stabilized by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (Rothé2015Bicc1). The polymerization of the SAM domain is not necessary for RNA binding but is essential for mRNA silencing (Rothé2015Bicc1).

BICC1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function and interactions. The protein's ability to form homo- or heterooligomers is mediated by its SAM domain, impacting its localization and function (Rothé2015Bicc1).

## Function
The BICC1 gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in healthy human cells. BICC1 is involved in mRNA recognition and regulation, primarily through its three KH domains and two KH-like domains, which are essential for RNA binding. The KH2 domain, with its GKGG motif, is particularly important for this function (Dowdle2022BicaudalC). BICC1 interacts with the Ccr4-Not deadenylase complex to mediate mRNA repression by removing poly(A) tails, a process independent of the SAM domain or RNA presence (Dowdle2022BicaudalC).

In the kidneys, BICC1 is involved in maintaining normal epithelial cell function by regulating mRNA stability and translation, impacting processes such as cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeleton organization. This regulation is crucial for preventing cyst formation, as seen in polycystic kidney disease (Fu2010Loss). BICC1 also plays a role in renal gluconeogenesis by interacting with the CTLH complex to regulate the expression of gluconeogenic enzymes like FBP1 and PEPCK (Leal-Esteban2018Role).

BICC1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it forms regulatory networks that help cells adapt to changing conditions and modify functions during development (Dowdle2022BicaudalC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BICC1 gene are associated with several renal conditions, particularly polycystic kidney disease (PKD). In humans, mutations such as a heterozygous premature stop codon and an E932G mutation in the SAM domain have been linked to unilateral cystic renal dysplasia (Rothé2020Role). In mice, mutations in Bicc1, such as those in the jcpk and bpk alleles, result in renal cysts and serve as models for autosomal dominant and recessive polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD and ARPKD) (Rothé2015Bicc1). These mutations lead to defective silencing of target mRNAs, contributing to cyst formation (Piazzon2012Bicc1).

BICC1 mutations also affect the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, leading to hyperactivity that is associated with cystic renal dysplasia (Kraus2011Two). The gene's role in regulating cAMP signaling and miRNA-induced gene silencing is crucial for maintaining normal kidney function, and its disruption can result in cystic growth (Tran2010The).

Beyond renal implications, BICC1 is implicated in pancreatic development and cancer. In pancreatic cancer, BICC1 is associated with lymph node metastasis and immune infiltration, correlating with poorer prognosis (Meng2023Lymph). The gene's dysregulation is also linked to other cancers, including gastric and oral cancers (Meng2023Lymph).

## Interactions
BICC1 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and regulation. It forms ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that are crucial for specifying organ laterality. BICC1 interacts with ANKS3 and ANKS6 proteins, which modulate its ability to bind mRNA. ANKS3 competes with mRNA for binding to BICC1's KH domains, while ANKS6 can destabilize this inhibitory interaction, allowing BICC1 to bind mRNA (Rothé2023Bicc1).

BICC1 also interacts with the CTLH complex, which is involved in the degradation of gluconeogenic enzymes. This interaction is mediated by the SAM domain of BICC1, which can bind to the CTLH complex independently through ARMC8 and through polymerization surfaces that can be blocked by ANKS3 (Leal-Esteban2018Role).

In addition, BICC1 is known to interact with the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, influencing mRNA translation and decay. It specifically binds to the Drosophila homolog of the CNOT3 subunit (Rothé2020Role). These interactions highlight BICC1's role in regulating mRNA stability and translation, as well as its involvement in cellular processes related to organ development and metabolism.
