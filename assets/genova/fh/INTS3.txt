# INTS3

## Overview
The INTS3 gene encodes the integrator complex subunit 3 protein, which is a vital component of the integrator complex involved in RNA processing and DNA repair. The protein is characterized by its structural features, including an elongated, HEAT-repeat-like, all α-helical structure that forms a stable dimer, essential for its function in DNA double-strand break repair and nucleic acid binding (Li2021Structural). INTS3 plays a significant role in transcription termination and RNA processing, particularly in the regulation of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and replication-dependent histone mRNAs (Skaar2015The). It is also a crucial component of the DNA damage response, acting as a scaffold within the SOSS1 complex to stabilize interactions necessary for effective DNA repair (Jia2021Crystal). The protein's interactions, particularly with INTS6, are essential for maintaining genomic stability, and disruptions in these interactions can lead to increased cancer risk and genomic instability (Skaar2009INTS3; Li2021Structural).

## Structure
The INTS3 protein is a component of the integrator complex involved in RNA processing and DNA repair. Structurally, the C-terminal domain of INTS3 is characterized by an elongated, HEAT-repeat-like, all α-helical structure, consisting of 11 HEAT repeats that form a right-handed α-solenoid (Li2021Structural). This domain forms a stable dimer, which is crucial for its function in DNA double-strand break repair and nucleic acid binding (Li2021Structural). The dimerization is facilitated by a surface area of 1702.3 Å², stabilized by hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions (Li2021Structural).

The INTS3 C-terminal domain interacts with the C-terminal region of INTS6, forming a complex that resembles a 'butterfly' structure, with the INTS3 dimer forming the wings (Jia2021Crystal). The interaction with INTS6 involves specific residues and is essential for maintaining the SSB1 protein level, which is important for DNA repair (Li2021Structural). The INTS3 protein also contains a DEAD motif and a Von Willebrand factor type A domain, which may facilitate protein-protein interactions (Jia2021Crystal).

The study of INTS3 did not provide specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms (Li2021Structural).

## Function
INTS3 is a component of the Integrator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription termination and RNA processing in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, replication-dependent histone mRNAs, and genes with polyadenylated mRNAs. INTS3, along with other components of the Integrator complex, binds to snRNA loci and is involved in the processing of snRNA, although its role in snRNA processing is considered minor compared to other subunits like INTS9 (Skaar2015The).

The Integrator complex, including INTS3, is associated with RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) and is implicated in transcription termination, particularly at snRNA and replication-dependent histone mRNA loci. Depletion of INTS3 results in the progression of Pol II beyond termination sites, indicating its role in transcription termination (Skaar2015The). INTS3 is also involved in the regulation of replication-dependent histone mRNA processing, where its depletion leads to increased levels of unprocessed histone RNAs and their polyadenylation (Skaar2015The).

INTS3 is part of a broader regulatory mechanism that ensures proper transcription termination and RNA processing, contributing to genomic stability in cells (Skaar2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the INTS3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. INTS3 plays a critical role in the DNA damage response by regulating the transcription and stability of hSSB1, a protein essential for DNA repair processes. Disruptions in INTS3 can lead to decreased hSSB1 levels, resulting in impaired DNA repair and increased genomic instability, which are factors associated with cancer development (Skaar2009INTS3). 

INTS3 is also involved in the recruitment of RAD51 to DNA damage sites and the activation of ATM signaling pathways, both crucial for effective DNA repair. Deficiencies in these processes due to INTS3 mutations or knockdown can lead to radiosensitivity and genomic instability, further contributing to cancer risk (Skaar2009INTS3). 

The interaction between INTS3 and Ints6 is essential for maintaining SSB1 protein levels, which are important for the DNA double-strand break repair pathway. Mutations that impair this interaction can disrupt DNA repair mechanisms, potentially leading to disease (Li2021Structural). The clinical significance of INTS3 mutations or expression changes is underscored by their potential link to cancer and radiosensitivity syndromes (Skaar2009INTS3).

## Interactions
The human gene INTS3 encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the DNA damage response and repair mechanisms. INTS3 forms part of the SOSS1 complex, where it acts as a scaffold, stabilizing interactions with other subunits such as SOSSC and hSSB1, which are essential for double-strand DNA break (DSB) repair (Jia2021Crystal). The C-terminal domain of INTS3 dimerizes, facilitating the recognition of longer single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and enhancing the binding affinity of the INTS3/hSSB1 complex to ssDNA (Jia2021Crystal; Li2021Structural).

INTS3 interacts with the integrator complex subunit 6 (INTS6) through its C-terminal region. This interaction is mediated by conserved residues and is crucial for maintaining SSB1 protein levels, which are involved in the DNA repair pathway (Jia2021Crystal; Li2021Structural). The interaction between INTS3 and INTS6 is essential for recruiting INTS6 to DNA damage sites, and mutations affecting their binding impair DNA repair (Jia2021Crystal).

INTS3 also plays a role in the stability and nuclear localization of hSSB1, stimulating the exonuclease activities of exonuclease 1 (Exo1) (Li2021Structural). It regulates hSSB1 at the transcriptional level, and its depletion leads to decreased hSSB1 levels, affecting the DNA damage response (Skaar2009INTS3).
