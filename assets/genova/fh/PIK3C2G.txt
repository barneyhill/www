# PIK3C2G

## Overview
PIK3C2G is a gene that encodes the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 2 gamma, a member of the class II phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks). This protein functions as a kinase, playing a pivotal role in insulin signaling pathways, particularly within the liver. It is involved in the production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) on early endosomes, which is crucial for the sustained activation of Akt2, a serine/threonine kinase. This process is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis and regulating glycogen storage. The interaction of PIK3C2G with Rab5, a small GTPase, facilitates its recruitment to endosomal membranes, underscoring its importance in endosomal trafficking and metabolic regulation. Alterations in the PIK3C2G gene have been linked to metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, highlighting its clinical significance in metabolic health (Braccini2015PI3KC2γ; Daimon2008Association).

## Function
PIK3C2G encodes the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 2 gamma, a class II phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) that plays a significant role in insulin signaling, particularly in the liver. This protein is involved in the insulin-mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is crucial for metabolic control. PIK3C2G associates with Rab5-GTP and is recruited to Rab5-positive early endosomes, where it produces a pool of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2). This pool is necessary for the delayed and sustained activation of endosomal Akt2, a process essential for glucose homeostasis (Braccini2015PI3KC2γ).

PIK3C2G selectively influences glycogen synthase activity, which is critical for glycogen accumulation in the liver. In the absence of PIK3C2G, there is a reduction in Akt2 activation, leading to decreased glycogen storage and increased triglyceride production, which can result in insulin resistance and adiposity (Braccini2015PI3KC2γ). The protein's activity is largely localized to early endosomes, where it supports long-term Akt2 activation, impacting signaling to specific subcellular targets such as glycogen synthase (Gulluni2019Class). This mechanism is orchestrated by Rab5, a critical controller of endosomal system organization in the liver (Gulluni2019Class).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PIK3C2G gene have been associated with several metabolic disorders, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies have identified significant associations between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PIK3C2G gene and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. For instance, the SNP 4 (C437T) has been linked to higher HbA1c levels and a greater prevalence of diabetes, with the TT genotype showing an odds ratio of 2.21 for developing the disease (Daimon2008Association). 

The PIK3C2G gene is also implicated in insulin resistance and related metabolic conditions. Loss of PI3K-C2γ function, as observed in knockout mice, leads to insulin resistance, increased adiposity, and fatty liver, especially under a high-fat diet. These conditions are associated with dyslipidemia and altered expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism (Braccini2015PI3KC2γ). 

Furthermore, the gene's role in sustaining Akt2 activation is crucial for proper insulin signaling. Deficiency in PI3K-C2γ results in impaired glucose metabolism and increased hepatic glucose output, contributing to metabolic disorders (Braccini2015PI3KC2γ). These findings suggest that PIK3C2G plays a protective role against metabolic diseases, and its dysfunction may precede the development of type 2 diabetes.

## Interactions
PIK3C2G, a class II phosphoinositide 3-kinase, interacts with Rab5, a small GTPase involved in endosomal trafficking. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of PIK3C2G to Rab5-positive early endosomes, where it produces phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2). This lipid product is essential for the delayed and sustained activation of Akt2, a serine/threonine kinase, specifically in the liver (Braccini2015PI3KC2γ). The interaction between PIK3C2G and Rab5 is enhanced in the presence of active Rab5, similar to other known Rab5 effectors (Braccini2015PI3KC2γ).

PIK3C2G's role as a Rab5 effector is significant in the context of insulin signaling, where it selectively controls endosomal Akt2 activation. This interaction is vital for the spatial and temporal regulation of insulin signaling, affecting metabolic responses in the liver (Braccini2015PI3KC2γ). The absence of PIK3C2G impairs Akt phosphorylation on endosomes, highlighting its functional relevance in these pathways (Braccini2015PI3KC2γ). These interactions underscore PIK3C2G's role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and its potential implications in conditions like insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (Braccini2015PI3KC2γ).
