# ANKRD55

## Overview
ANKRD55 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 55 protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes. The ankyrin repeat domain 55 protein is primarily involved in immune regulation and has been associated with autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is expressed in immune cells, particularly CD4+ T lymphocytes, and interacts with components of the intraflagellar transport complex, indicating a potential role in ciliary transport pathways. Additionally, ANKRD55 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which are involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis, highlighting its potential involvement in regulatory processes related to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (Ugidos2019Interactome; Mena2024ANKRD55).

## Structure
ANKRD55 is characterized by a series of nine ankyrin (ANK) repeats, each 33 residues long, primarily located in the N-terminal half of the protein. These ANK repeats form a helix-turn-helix conformation, a common structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions. The ANK repeats are predicted to fold into a single linear solenoid ANK domain, a feature found in many proteins that interact with a diverse range of other proteins (Ugidos2019Interactome; Mena2024ANKRD55). The C-terminal half of ANKRD55 is mostly disordered (Mena2024ANKRD55).

ANKRD55 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, with isoform 001 being the full-length version containing all nine ankyrin repeats, while isoform 005 shares only the last repeat (Ugidos2019Interactome). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at several sites. Experimentally detected phosphorylation sites include THR6, SER436, and SER475, with SER436 and SER597 predicted as 14-3-3 binding phosphosites, which are important for regulatory processes (Ugidos2019Interactome; Mena2024ANKRD55). These modifications suggest a role in regulatory pathways, potentially involving protein complex formation and stabilization (Ugidos2019Interactome).

## Function
ANKRD55 is a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its interactions with other proteins. It contains ankyrin repeat motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting its involvement in diverse biological pathways (Mena2024ANKRD55). ANKRD55 is expressed in immune cells, particularly CD4+ T lymphocytes, where it plays a role in immune regulation and is associated with autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis (Mena2024ANKRD55).

In microglial cells, ANKRD55 interacts with components of the intraflagellar transport complex B (IFT-B), specifically the IFT46-IFT56 heterodimer, indicating a potential role in ciliary transport pathways independent of ciliogenesis (Mena2024ANKRD55). Although ANKRD55 is not detected in primary cilia, it localizes to the centrosome or basal body, suggesting a function related to microtubule organizing centers (Mena2024ANKRD55).

ANKRD55 also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which are involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis, indicating its potential role in regulatory processes (Mena2024ANKRD55). These interactions suggest that ANKRD55 may participate in specialized pathways related to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (Mena2024ANKRD55).

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD55 is implicated in several autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Variations in the ANKRD55 gene, particularly the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6859219, have been associated with an increased risk of developing MS and RA. This SNP is a significant cis-eQTL that affects ANKRD55 expression levels, which are linked to autoimmune pathogenesis (Ugidos2019Interactome; Lill2013Genomewide; Alloza2011ANKRD55). 

In addition to autoimmune diseases, ANKRD55 is also associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), where the SNP rs6859219 has been confirmed as a genetic marker (Reinards2014CD226). The gene's involvement in these conditions suggests a role in immune response regulation.

ANKRD55 has also been identified as a component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex, specifically the IFT-B complex, which is crucial for ciliary function. Disruption of ANKRD55 can lead to ciliary dysfunction, potentially contributing to human ciliopathies (Drew2017Integration; Drew2016A). Furthermore, low expression of ANKRD55 is linked to poor prognosis in various cancers, indicating its potential clinical significance in cancer outcomes (Xu2021Identification).

## Interactions
ANKRD55 is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. It has been identified as a component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex, specifically the IFT-B complex, interacting with proteins such as IFT46, IFT56, IFT74, and IFT81. These interactions suggest a role in ciliary transport pathways, although ANKRD55 is not primarily involved in ciliogenesis (Drew2017Integration; Mena2024ANKRD55).

ANKRD55 also interacts with several proteins involved in immune signaling pathways. It has been shown to interact with 14-3-3 protein family members, including YWHAE, YWHAZ, YWHAH, YWHAB, YWHAQ, and YWHAG, which are regulatory molecules involved in processes like cell cycle control and apoptosis (Ugidos2019Interactome; Mena2024ANKRD55). These interactions are supported by bioinformatics predictions and experimental validations, such as immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (Ugidos2019Interactome).

ANKRD55 has been implicated in interactions with proteins involved in nucleotide and ATP binding, nuclear transport, and cell cycle processes, including RPS3, TUBB, CLTC, SMC1A, SMC3, PRKDC, and VIM (Ugidos2019Interactome). These interactions highlight its potential role in various cellular processes and its involvement in autoimmune diseases.
