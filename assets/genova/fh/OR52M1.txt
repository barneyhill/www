# OR52M1

## Overview
OR52M1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily M member 1, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This protein is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, and plays a crucial role in the olfactory system by detecting odorant molecules. The OR52M1 protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants and initiates signal transduction pathways that contribute to the perception of smell (Alonso2008Overdominance). The gene is involved in enhancing genetic diversity among olfactory receptors, which may improve the ability to discriminate between similar odorants. Additionally, OR52M1 has been studied in the context of artificial intelligence applications due to the complexity of its molecular interactions (Achebouche2022Application). Changes in the methylation patterns of OR52M1 have been associated with ovarian cancer, and its expression has been examined in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Erdogan2020Genome‑wide; Ansoleaga2015Decrease).

## Structure
The OR52M1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of GPCRs. The primary structure of the OR52M1 protein consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function as an olfactory receptor. The secondary structure includes alpha helices, which are common in the GPCR family and contribute to the receptor's ability to span the cell membrane.

The tertiary structure of OR52M1 involves the three-dimensional folding of these alpha helices, allowing the receptor to interact with specific odorant molecules. This folding is crucial for the receptor's function in signal transduction. Quaternary structure is generally not applicable to OR52M1, as these receptors typically function as monomers.

Post-translational modifications of the OR52M1 protein may include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are common in GPCRs and can affect receptor function and stability. These modifications play a role in the receptor's localization and activity within the olfactory system. The specific domains and prominent folds of OR52M1 contribute to its role in detecting and responding to odorant signals.

## Function
OR52M1 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR52M1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to olfactory acuity (Alonso2008Overdominance).

The function of OR52M1 in healthy human cells is primarily associated with its role in olfactory receptor activity. The gene is involved in increasing genetic diversity in olfactory receptors, which may enhance the ability to discriminate among closely related odorants. This increased diversity is thought to be a response to the loss of functional olfactory receptors in humans compared to other primates (Alonso2008Overdominance).

In the context of artificial intelligence applications, OR52M1 has been identified as challenging to predict in terms of its interactions with compounds, indicating complexity in its molecular interactions and potential variability in its function (Achebouche2022Application). Despite these challenges, OR52M1 remains a significant component of the olfactory system, contributing to the nuanced perception of odors.

## Clinical Significance
The OR52M1 gene has been implicated in the development of ovarian cancer through alterations in its methylation patterns. A study on monozygotic twins discordant for ovarian carcinoma found that OR52M1 was hypomethylated in the twin with ovarian cancer compared to non-twin healthy siblings. This hypomethylation suggests a potential association between OR52M1 and ovarian cancer, indicating that changes in its methylation status may play a role in cancer development (Erdogan2020Genome‑wide).

In the context of neuropsychiatric disorders, the expression of olfactory receptors, including OR52M1, has been studied in chronic schizophrenia. Although the study did not find significant alterations in OR52M1 expression specifically, it highlighted the general down-regulation of olfactory receptor genes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia. This down-regulation is thought to be influenced by antipsychotic treatments and the age of onset, suggesting that OR52M1, along with other olfactory receptors, may be affected by factors beyond DNA methylation in neuropsychiatric conditions (Ansoleaga2015Decrease).

Overall, while direct clinical implications of OR52M1 mutations are not extensively documented, its altered methylation and expression patterns are associated with ovarian cancer and potentially with schizophrenia.
