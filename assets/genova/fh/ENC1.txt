# ENC1

## Overview
ENC1, or ectodermal-neural cortex 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the BTB-Kelch family, which is characterized by its role in cytoskeletal organization and cellular signaling. The ENC1 protein is primarily expressed in the nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in neuronal differentiation and development. It contains six kelch repeats that facilitate actin-binding, allowing it to interact with the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cytoskeletal remodeling and various cellular processes such as cell shape changes and movement (Hernandez1997ENC1:; Zhao2000Transient). Additionally, ENC1 features a BTB/POZ domain that supports protein-protein interactions, potentially enabling the formation of homodimers or heterodimers, which may stabilize actin filaments (Hernandez1997ENC1:). Beyond its role in the nervous system, ENC1 is transiently induced during adipocyte differentiation and is involved in early stages of this process by influencing actin dynamics and cytoskeletal reorganization (Zhao2000Transient). ENC1 also modulates the transcription factor Nrf2 at the translational level, impacting cellular antioxidant responses (Wang2009EctodermalNeural).

## Structure
The ENC1 protein is a member of the BTB-Kelch family, characterized by conserved amino terminal BTB/POZ and carboxy terminal Kelch protein interaction domains, linked by an intervening BACK domain in some family members (Worton2017EctodermalNeural). These domains are implicated in cellular functions requiring cytoskeletal stability. ENC1 has been found to colocalize with cytoplasmic actin and bind to nuclear proteins such as RB1, E2F transcription factor, and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), as well as NFE2-related factor 2 (NRF2) (Worton2017EctodermalNeural).

ENC1 exists in two isoforms, 67kDa and 57kDa. The 67kDa isoform is attributed to the full-length coding region, while the 57kDa isoform is a shorter, amino-terminally truncated version (Worton2017EctodermalNeural). These isoforms have distinct roles in osteoblastic differentiation, with the 57kDa isoform promoting mineralization more effectively than the 67kDa isoform (Worton2017EctodermalNeural). The knockdown of the 57kDa isoform promotes osteoblast mineralization, while the knockdown of the 67kDa isoform inhibits it, indicating distinct biochemical properties (Bhuiyan2018Systematic). ENC1 may also act as an E3 ligase substrate adaptor, although no specific target protein has been identified (Worton2017EctodermalNeural).

## Function
ENC1 (ectodermal-neural cortex 1) encodes a protein that is a member of the BTB-Kelch family, known for its role in cytoskeletal organization and cellular signaling. The ENC1 protein is primarily expressed in the nervous system and plays a significant role in neuronal differentiation and development. It contains six kelch repeats in its C-terminal half, which are associated with actin-binding activity, allowing it to interact with the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is crucial for cytoskeletal remodeling, which is necessary for various cellular processes, including cell shape changes and movement (Hernandez1997ENC1:; Zhao2000Transient).

ENC1 also contains a BTB/POZ domain at its N terminus, facilitating protein-protein interactions that may enable ENC1 to form homodimers or heterodimers, potentially cross-linking and stabilizing actin filaments (Hernandez1997ENC1:). In addition to its role in the nervous system, ENC1 is transiently induced during adipocyte differentiation, where it is involved in the early stages of this process by influencing actin dynamics and cytoskeletal reorganization (Zhao2000Transient). ENC1 also down-regulates the transcription factor Nrf2 at the translational level, impacting cellular antioxidant responses (Wang2009EctodermalNeural).

## Clinical Significance
The ENC1 gene is implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is often associated with poor prognosis. In breast cancer, ENC1 is linked to increased metastasis and radio-resistance, with its expression regulated by a super-enhancer region. This regulation involves the Hippo signaling pathway, promoting the nuclear translocation of YAP1 and TAZ, which enhances the expression of genes like GLI1, CTGF, and FGF1, contributing to the malignancy and radio-resistance of breast carcinoma cells (Li2021Aberrant).

In lung cancer, ENC1 is highly expressed and contributes to tumor progression by modulating the MAPK signaling pathway. Its downregulation has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in the aggressiveness of lung cancer (Wu2021Ectodermal‑neural).

ENC1 is also overexpressed in colorectal cancer, where it promotes growth and metastasis through the JAK2-STAT5-AKT signaling axis. Its dysregulation is associated with advanced tumor stages and poor survival (He2024The).

In endometrial cancer, ENC1 expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and is associated with poorer overall survival, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (He2022Upregulated).

## Interactions
ENC1 is an actin-binding protein that interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, playing a role in cytoskeletal organization. It co-localizes with actin filaments in various cell lines, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a physical interaction with actin filaments (Hernandez1997ENC1:). ENC1 contains six kelch repeats, which are associated with actin-binding, and a BTB/POZ domain that may facilitate protein-protein interactions, potentially allowing ENC1 to form homodimers or heterodimers (Hernandez1997ENC1:).

ENC1 also interacts with the transcription factor RB p110 in the nuclear matrix, suggesting a role in nuclear processes (Resch2003Assessing). The full-length ENC1 isoform can bind to nuclear proteins such as Retinoblastoma protein (RB1), E2F transcription factor, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and NFE2-related factor 2 (NRF2) (Worton2017EctodermalNeural). ENC1 is involved in a regulatory network with the transcription factor MYC, where it is upregulated by MYC binding to its promoter region, a process influenced by the long non-coding RNA MIAT (Li2021Long). These interactions highlight ENC1's involvement in both cytoskeletal dynamics and nuclear regulatory pathways.
