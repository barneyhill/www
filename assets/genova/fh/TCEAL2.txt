# TCEAL2

## Overview
TCEAL2, or Transcription Elongation Factor A (SII)-Like 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of transcription elongation. The TCEAL2 protein is part of a family of transcription elongation factors that play a crucial role in the modulation of gene expression by influencing the elongation phase of transcription. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and proliferation. Alterations in the expression of TCEAL2 have been associated with several types of cancer, where it may function as a tumor suppressor, as evidenced by its down-regulation in malignancies such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme (TCEAL2; p&gt; Aisa2022Comprehensive; Zhou2020&lt).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TCEAL2 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), TCEAL2 is significantly down-regulated compared to normal kidney tissues. This down-regulation is associated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis. Overexpression of TCEAL2 in ccRCC cell lines has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (TCEAL2; p&gt; Zhou2020&lt).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), TCEAL2 expression is also significantly reduced. Higher expression levels of TCEAL2 are associated with better overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Aisa2022Comprehensive).

In gastric cancer, the regulation of TCEAL2 by the transcription factor CREB1 is altered. Normally, CREB1 negatively regulates TCEAL2, but this regulation is lost in cancerous cells, suggesting a dysfunctional mechanism in gastric carcinogenesis (Yu2022The).

In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), TCEAL2 is part of a prognostic model based on sphingolipid metabolism-associated genes. Its expression is significantly lower in COAD tissues compared to normal tissues, indicating a potential role in the disease's pathology (Yuan2022Identification).
