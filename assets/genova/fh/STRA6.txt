# STRA6

## Overview
STRA6 is a gene that encodes a multitransmembrane protein functioning as a cell-surface receptor and transporter for vitamin A (retinol). The STRA6 protein is integral to the uptake and transport of retinol across cell membranes, acting as a receptor for retinol-binding protein (RBP) and facilitating the delivery of vitamin A into cells. This process is essential for maintaining vitamin A homeostasis, particularly in tissues with high demand, such as the retina, brain, and epithelial tissues (Kelly2016Transport; Kawaguchi2015Vitamin). STRA6's unique mechanism allows for energy-independent vitamin A uptake, which is critical for various physiological processes, including vision, immune function, and cellular differentiation (Amengual2014STRA6; Kawaguchi2015Vitamin). Mutations in the STRA6 gene can lead to a range of congenital malformations, underscoring its significance in human health and development (Wu2014Adaptive; Pasutto2007Mutations).

## Structure
The STRA6 protein is a multitransmembrane receptor involved in the uptake of vitamin A. It consists of nine transmembrane domains, five extracellular domains, and four intracellular domains (Dhokia2021A; Kawaguchi2015Vitamin). The transmembrane domains form a passageway for vitamin A transport, with specific residues in or near transmembrane helices VI and VII being critical for this process (Kawaguchi2015Vitamin). The protein's structure allows it to bind retinol-binding protein (RBP) with high affinity, facilitating the transport of retinol across the plasma membrane (Wu2014Adaptive).

STRA6's interaction with RBP is characterized by a high affinity, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 59 nM, which is crucial for its role in mediating retinol influx into cells (Kawaguchi2015Vitamin). The protein also exhibits a unique mechanism of vitamin A uptake that does not require cellular energy, as metabolic inhibitors do not stop the uptake process (Kawaguchi2015Vitamin).

Mutations in STRA6 can lead to various malformations, including congenital heart defects and mental retardation, highlighting its importance in human health (Wu2014Adaptive). STRA6 is also involved in the synthesis of retinoic acid, an active metabolite of vitamin A essential for vision and other biological processes (Elkazzaz2021STRA6).

## Function
The STRA6 gene encodes a multitransmembrane cell-surface receptor that plays a crucial role in the uptake and transport of vitamin A (retinol) in human cells. STRA6 functions as a receptor for retinol-binding protein (RBP), facilitating the transport of vitamin A across cell membranes, which is essential for maintaining vitamin A homeostasis (Kelly2016Transport; Kawaguchi2015Vitamin). This process is particularly important in tissues with high vitamin A demand, such as the retina, brain, and epithelial tissues, where STRA6 is highly expressed (Amengual2014STRA6; Kelly2016Transport).

In the retina, STRA6 is vital for maintaining ocular retinoid homeostasis and photoreceptor function, as it facilitates the uptake of vitamin A from circulating holo-RBP4 (Kelly2016Transport). In the brain, STRA6 ensures adequate retinoid levels, which are crucial for normal brain function, especially under conditions of dietary vitamin A restriction (Kelly2016Transport). STRA6 also plays a role in the skin, where it regulates retinoid uptake, influencing keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, thereby maintaining normal epidermal structure and function (Skazik2014Downregulation).

The receptor's activity is modulated by retinoids and other compounds, which can influence the direction of retinol transport, either promoting uptake or release, depending on cellular needs (Kawaguchi2015Vitamin). This bidirectional transport capability is crucial for maintaining vitamin A balance in various tissues, impacting physiological processes such as vision, immune function, and cellular differentiation (Amengual2014STRA6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STRA6 gene are associated with a broad spectrum of congenital malformations, including anophthalmia (absence of one or both eyes), congenital heart defects, diaphragmatic hernia, alveolar capillary dysplasia, lung hypoplasia, and intellectual disabilities (Pasutto2007Mutations). These mutations can lead to conditions such as Matthew-Wood syndrome, characterized by severe developmental abnormalities (Segel2009Pulmonary). Specific missense mutations, such as P90L, T321P, P293L, T644M, and R655C, have been identified and are believed to affect the protein's structure and function, impacting the retinoic acid pathway crucial for morphogenesis (Pasutto2007Mutations).

STRA6 mutations are also linked to the PDAC spectrum, which includes pulmonary hypoplasia, diaphragmatic hernia, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, and cardiac defects (Chassaing2013Mutation). The G304K mutation, for instance, results in mislocalization of the STRA6 protein and reduced vitamin A uptake, leading to diminished retinoic acid levels and subsequent eye malformations (Casey2011First). The phenotypic variability associated with STRA6 mutations suggests that other genes in the vitamin A pathway may also contribute to these conditions (Chassaing2013Mutation).

## Interactions
STRA6 interacts with retinol-binding protein (RBP), specifically binding both holo-RBP (RBP bound to retinol) and apo-RBP (RBP without retinol). This interaction is crucial for vitamin A uptake, as STRA6 mediates the release of retinol from holo-RBP and its subsequent transport into cells (Kawaguchi2015Vitamin). STRA6's interaction with RBP is transient, with a half-life of about 10 minutes, allowing for continuous vitamin A uptake (Kawaguchi2015Vitamin).

STRA6 also interacts with cellular retinol-binding protein I (CRBP-I) and lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), although these interactions are not essential for its function. CRBP-I and LRAT can enhance STRA6's activity by modulating retinol loading and release (Kawaguchi2015Vitamin). STRA6's activity is further influenced by small molecules like β-ionone, which can stimulate its function by inhibiting retinol loading (Kawaguchi2015Vitamin).

In addition to its role in vitamin A transport, STRA6 is involved in various signaling pathways. It is phosphorylated by JAK2, which is necessary for retinol transport and activates the JAK2/STAT5 cascade, positioning STRA6 as a 'cytokine signaling transporter' (Dhokia2021A). STRA6 also interacts with calmodulin, a Ca2+-dependent interaction that may induce conformational changes affecting retinol diffusion or interactions with other proteins (Widjaja-Adhi2020The).
