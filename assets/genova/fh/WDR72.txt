# WDR72

## Overview
WDR72 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 72 protein, which is integral to the process of enamel formation in teeth. The protein is characterized by its WD40 repeat domains, which form β-propeller structures that facilitate protein-protein interactions, particularly in vesicle trafficking and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Katsura2014WDR72). These interactions are crucial for the protein's role in the maturation stage of enamel development, where it aids in calcium transport and the removal of matrix proteins by ameloblasts (Zhang2019WDR72). Mutations in the WDR72 gene are linked to amelogenesis imperfecta, a condition marked by defective enamel formation, and distal renal tubular acidosis, highlighting its significance in both dental and renal health (Rungroj2018Distal; Lee2010Novel). The protein's structural and functional attributes underscore its importance in maintaining enamel integrity and its potential involvement in broader cellular processes (Katsura2022WDR72).

## Structure
The WDR72 protein is composed of 1102 amino acids and features a complex molecular structure characterized by two clusters of WD40 repeat domains at the N-terminus and a unique C-terminus (Katsura2014WDR72). The WD40 domains form two 7-bladed β-propeller structures, which are common in proteins involved in protein-protein interactions (Katsura2014WDR72). These β-propeller folds serve as docking sites for protein interactions, contributing to the protein's role in vesicle trafficking (Katsura2014WDR72). Following the β-propellers, the protein has an α-solenoid fold at the C-terminus, which is involved in stabilizing and inducing membrane curvature (Katsura2014WDR72).

The C-terminal region of WDR72 is crucial for its localization and function, particularly in the Golgi apparatus, and includes a CAAX motif that undergoes post-translational modifications such as prenylation (Husein2022Identification). These modifications are essential for the protein's localization and function, and mutations affecting this region can lead to amelogenesis imperfecta (Husein2022Identification). The structural configuration of WDR72 is similar to vesicle coat proteins, suggesting its involvement in membrane deformation complexes and intracellular trafficking (Katsura2014WDR72).

## Function
The WDR72 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the maturation stage of enamel formation, particularly in ameloblasts, which are cells responsible for enamel development. In healthy human cells, WDR72 is involved in calcium transport and the removal of matrix proteins during enamel maturation. It functions as a scaffolding protein, forming beta propeller blade structures that facilitate the assembly of protein complexes, which are essential for the localization of SLC24A4, a calcium transporter, along the distal ameloblast membrane (Zhang2019WDR72; Wang2015Critical).

WDR72 is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process critical for the reabsorption of enamel proteins by ameloblasts. This endocytic activity is vital for the proper mineralization and hardening of enamel (Wang2015Critical; Lee2010Novel). The protein also influences vesicle trafficking and microtubule dynamics, which are important for cellular processes such as ion transport and matrix pH regulation (Katsura2022WDR72).

The absence of WDR72 results in enamel hypomaturation, characterized by softer enamel due to impaired protein removal and calcium excretion, highlighting its essential role in maintaining enamel integrity (Wang2015Critical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR72 gene are clinically significant as they are associated with several hereditary conditions. Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a primary condition linked to WDR72 mutations, characterized by defective enamel formation. This condition can manifest as hypomaturation AI, where the enamel is not fully mineralized, leading to rapid attrition and discoloration of teeth (Zhang2019WDR72; Lee2010Novel). Various mutations, including frameshift, stop-gain, and missense mutations, have been identified in individuals with AI, suggesting that a complete absence of the WDR72 protein is necessary for the condition to manifest (Zhang2019WDR72).

WDR72 mutations are also implicated in distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), a condition characterized by impaired urinary acidification, leading to metabolic acidosis and other renal complications. Missense mutations in WDR72 can cause dRTA, potentially without the presence of AI (Rungroj2018Distal; Wang2022A). The gene's role in kidney function is further supported by its association with nephrolithiasis and higher serum creatinine levels (Wang2022A).

The combination of AI and dRTA is highly specific to WDR72 mutations, although some patients may present with only one of these conditions, indicating variability in the clinical presentation (Bockenhauer2024Distal).

## Interactions
WDR72 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in enamel maturation. It is associated with clathrin-mediated endocytosis components, such as clathrin, AP2A1, and AP2B1, indicating its role in endocytosis by ameloblasts during enamel maturation (Wang2015Critical). WDR72 also interacts with proteins involved in ubiquitination, suggesting a potential role in ubiquitination-dependent endocytosis (Wang2015Critical). 

The protein structure of WDR72 is predicted to have a membrane-coating architecture, similar to proteins involved in vesicle coat complexes like COPI, COPII, and Clathrin. This structural similarity suggests that WDR72 may function as a vesicle coat protein, facilitating vesicle formation and trafficking (Katsura2014WDR72). Immunolocalization studies have shown the presence of AP2, a component of Clathrin coatomers, supporting WDR72's role in vesicle formation (Katsura2014WDR72).

WDR72 is also implicated in interactions with proteins involved in microtubule dynamics, such as dynein, MAP1, and TPP1, which are crucial for microtubule assembly and stabilization (Katsura2022WDR72). These interactions highlight WDR72's role in vesicle trafficking and its potential impact on cellular processes related to enamel formation.
