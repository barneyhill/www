# CCDC92

## Overview
CCDC92 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 92 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to metabolism and viral interactions. The protein plays a significant role in insulin resistance and lipid metabolism, impacting conditions such as type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease (Xiao2018Association). Additionally, CCDC92 is implicated in adipocyte differentiation, which is crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Beyond its metabolic functions, CCDC92 exhibits antiviral properties by interacting with the Ebola virus nucleoprotein, thereby inhibiting viral replication and transcription (Kuroda2020Identification). This dual role in metabolic and infectious disease contexts underscores the potential of CCDC92 as a target for therapeutic interventions (Tang2023Transcriptomewide).

## Function
The CCDC92 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in insulin resistance, a critical factor in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary heart disease (CHD). The protein is involved in metabolic processes that affect cardiovascular health, particularly through its impact on insulin resistance and lipid metabolism. CCDC92 interacts with other proteins at the centriole-ciliary interface and is implicated in adipocyte differentiation, which is essential for maintaining proper metabolic function (Xiao2018Association).

In healthy human cells, CCDC92's involvement in these processes suggests it may contribute to the regulation of glucose and lipid homeostasis, which are vital for preventing metabolic disorders. The protein's role in adipocyte differentiation indicates its importance in the development and function of fat cells, which are crucial for energy storage and hormone production. By influencing insulin resistance, CCDC92 indirectly affects the risk of myocardial infarctions, as insulin resistance is a significant contributor to CHD (Xiao2018Association).

Overall, CCDC92 is an important player in cellular processes related to metabolism and cardiovascular health, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in metabolic diseases.

## Clinical Significance
CCDC92 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression or interactions. In the context of coronary artery disease (CAD), CCDC92 was investigated for its potential role at a genetic locus associated with the disease. Although CRISPRa experiments increased CCDC92 expression, they did not significantly alter the expression of ICAM1, an endothelial phenotype marker, suggesting that CCDC92 may not be the causal gene for CAD at this locus (Wünnemann2023Multimodal). 

In type 2 diabetes (T2D), CCDC92 has been identified as a gene with a protective effect against the disease when its expression is genetically elevated. This association was confirmed through transcriptome-wide association studies and co-localization analysis, indicating that CCDC92 may play a role in the genetic predisposition to T2D, particularly in visceral adipose tissue (Tang2023Transcriptomewide).

CCDC92 also plays a role in inhibiting Ebola virus (EBOV) replication and transcription. It interacts with the viral nucleoprotein, forming a complex that disrupts viral replication and transcription processes, thereby attenuating EBOV infection (Kuroda2020Identification). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in both metabolic and infectious diseases.

## Interactions
CCDC92 is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, particularly in the context of Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. It interacts with the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP), forming a complex with NP and viral RNA, which suggests that CCDC92 binds to the NP-RNA complex without interfering with NP oligomerization or NP-RNA binding (Kuroda2020Identification). This interaction is crucial for its antiviral activity, as CCDC92 retains NP in the cytoplasm and prevents its interaction with VP40, a matrix protein essential for NP transport to the cell surface (Kuroda2020Identification). The C-terminal coiled-coil domain of CCDC92 is necessary for binding to NP, and deletion of this region results in loss of interaction (Kuroda2020Identification).

CCDC92 also forms a complex with NP and VP35, a viral polymerase co-factor, which may disrupt functional viral replication and transcription complexes (Kuroda2020Identification). This interaction is part of the mechanism by which CCDC92 exerts its antiviral effects, as evidenced by reduced virus-driven luciferase expression in cells expressing CCDC92 (Kuroda2020Identification).
