# SFT2D2

## Overview
SFT2D2 is a gene that encodes the protein SFT2 domain containing 2, which is primarily involved in intracellular transport processes. This protein functions as a vesicle transporter within multipass membranes and plays a significant role in the endosome-to-Golgi retrieval pathway, crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and the proper functioning of the Golgi apparatus (Liu2022The). The SFT2D2 protein is associated with the Golgi apparatus and is implicated in vesicle-mediated transport, contributing to the maintenance of Golgi structure and function (Liu2022The). It is also involved in protein trafficking and secretion pathways, which are vital for cellular processes such as protein sorting and distribution. Beyond its fundamental cellular roles, SFT2D2 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including its potential involvement in breast cancer metastasis and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its broader significance in human health and disease (Chen2019Identifying; Mukadam2018Analysis).

## Function
The SFT2D2 gene encodes a protein involved in intracellular transport processes, specifically functioning as a vesicle transporter of multipass membranes. This protein plays a crucial role in the endosome-to-Golgi retrieval pathway, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper functioning of the Golgi apparatus (Liu2022The). The SFT2D2 protein is associated with the Golgi apparatus and is implicated in vesicle-mediated transport, contributing to the maintenance of Golgi structure and function. It is involved in protein trafficking and secretion pathways, which are vital for cellular processes such as protein sorting and distribution (Liu2022The).

In healthy human cells, the SFT2D2 protein is active in the trafficking of vesicles between endosomes and the Golgi apparatus, ensuring the proper recycling and distribution of cellular components. This function is critical for the regulation of various cellular activities, including the processing and modification of proteins and lipids. The protein's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function (Liu2022The). The SFT2D2 gene spans 16,834 base pairs and includes eight exons and seven introns, with introns potentially regulating gene expression and alternative splicing (Liu2022The).

## Clinical Significance
The SFT2D2 gene has been implicated in breast cancer, particularly in its role in metastatic behaviors and subtyping. Alterations in the expression and methylation status of SFT2D2 are associated with different breast cancer subtypes, such as basal and HER2-like, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for molecular subtyping and understanding metastatic behaviors in breast cancer (Chen2019Identifying). 

SFT2D2 is also part of a 15-gene expression signature that has been linked to bone metastasis in breast cancer patients. This signature, which includes SFT2D2, has been shown to predict bone metastasis in both ER-positive and ER-negative tumors, indicating its clinical significance in the prognosis and potential treatment strategies for breast cancer patients with bone metastases (Chen2018Organotropism:; SavciHeijink2016A).

While the role of SFT2D2 in other diseases is not extensively detailed, its involvement in vesicle trafficking and cellular homeostasis suggests that mutations or altered expression could potentially impact other conditions, although specific associations with diseases beyond breast cancer are not well-documented in the provided context.

## Interactions
SFT2D2 is involved in protein interactions that play a role in intracellular transport and membrane trafficking. In the context of antiviral signaling, SFT2D2 has been identified as a novel regulatory component of the MAVS signalosome. It interacts with MAVS (Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling protein) in an RNA-dependent manner, promoting signaling within the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway. This interaction is crucial for the modulation of MAVS protein-protein interactions, which are essential for antiviral signaling. The study found that SFT2D2, among other proteins, showed increased interaction with MAVS after RNase treatment, indicating that RNA alters these interactions (Gokhale2023Cellular).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, SFT2D2 has been implicated in endosomal protein sorting. It is required for the endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR) and localizes to retromer-positive endosomes. This suggests that SFT2D2 may interact with components of the retromer complex, which is involved in the trafficking of membrane proteins. The study highlights the role of SFT2D2 in the regulation of endosomal protein sorting, which could impact amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease pathology (Mukadam2018Analysis).
