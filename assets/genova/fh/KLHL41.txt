# KLHL41

## Overview
KLHL41 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 41, which is a muscle-specific protein involved in the stabilization of skeletal muscle sarcomeres. This protein is characterized by the presence of a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and multiple Kelch repeat motifs, which facilitate its role as a molecular chaperone. Unlike other Kelch proteins that typically promote protein degradation, KLHL41 stabilizes nebulin, a critical sarcomeric protein, through nonproteolytic ubiquitination, thereby maintaining muscle integrity and function (RamirezMartinez2017KLHL41; Shi2019Kelchlike). The gene is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle and is regulated by a super-enhancer, indicating its importance in muscle differentiation and function (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). Mutations in KLHL41 are linked to nemaline myopathy, a severe muscle disorder, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (RamirezMartinez2017KLHL41).

## Structure
KLHL41 is a protein characterized by the presence of several key domains, including a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and six Kelch repeat motifs. The BTB domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and is crucial for forming ubiquitin ligase complexes by binding to Cullin3 (Shi2019Kelchlike). The Kelch repeat motifs form a β-propeller structure, which acts as a scaffold for substrate binding, playing a significant role in the protein's tertiary structure (Lambrughi2016The; Shi2019Kelchlike). The BACK domain serves as a linker between the BTB and Kelch domains, although its specific biological functions are not well understood (Shi2019Kelchlike).

KLHL41 is involved in nonproteolytic ubiquitination, a process crucial for its role in stabilizing skeletal muscle sarcomeres (RamirezMartinez2017KLHL41). The protein undergoes poly-ubiquitination, particularly in the BTB domain, which is essential for its function in stabilizing nebulin, a key sarcomeric protein (RamirezMartinez2017KLHL41). Mutations in KLHL41 have been linked to nemaline myopathy, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity for normal muscle function (Shi2019Kelchlike). The protein's structure and function are highly conserved, with significant homology to KLHL40, another member of the Kelch family (Shi2019Kelchlike).

## Function
The KLHL41 gene encodes a muscle-specific Kelch protein that plays a crucial role in stabilizing skeletal muscle sarcomeres. In healthy human cells, KLHL41 functions by preventing the aggregation and degradation of nebulin, an essential component of the sarcomere, through a process of nonproteolytic ubiquitination. This stabilization is vital for maintaining the organized structure of sarcomeres, which is necessary for proper muscle contraction and function (RamirezMartinez2017KLHL41). KLHL41 acts as a molecular chaperone, stabilizing nebulin and maintaining muscle integrity, distinguishing its function from other Kelch proteins that typically promote protein degradation (RamirezMartinez2017KLHL41).

KLHL41 is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle and is associated with muscle differentiation. It shows high expression levels in myotubes, suggesting upregulation upon myoblast fusion to form multinucleated myotubes (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). The gene's expression is regulated by a super-enhancer, characterized by strong histone acetylation and DNA hypomethylation, indicative of active transcription (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). KLHL41's role in stabilizing sarcomeric proteins is essential for muscle function, and its absence can lead to severe muscle disorders such as nemaline myopathy (RamirezMartinez2017KLHL41).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KLHL41 gene are associated with nemaline myopathy (NM), a severe congenital muscle disorder characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, and the presence of nemaline bodies in muscle fibers. These mutations lead to disorganized sarcomeres and abnormal protein aggregates, resulting in reduced muscle contractile force and potentially fatal outcomes (RamirezMartinez2017KLHL41; Jirka2018Dysregulation). KLHL41 deficiency disrupts the ubiquitination and degradation of NRAP, a thin filament chaperone, causing its abnormal accumulation. This accumulation interferes with the formation of mature myofibrils, contributing to the pathophysiology of NM (Jirka2018Dysregulation).

In KLHL41 knockout mice, the absence of functional KLHL41 protein results in neonatal lethality and severe muscle abnormalities, mirroring the human condition (RamirezMartinez2017KLHL41). The study of KLHL41's role in muscle development and its interactions with sarcomeric proteins like nebulin and NRAP provides insights into potential therapeutic targets for NM. Modulating KLHL41's chaperone activity or targeting NRAP levels could offer new treatment strategies for this currently untreatable condition (RamirezMartinez2017KLHL41; Jirka2018Dysregulation).

## Interactions
KLHL41 is involved in several critical interactions within skeletal muscle cells, primarily through its role in stabilizing sarcomeric proteins. It interacts with nebulin (NEB), a key component of the sarcomere, preventing its aggregation and promoting its solubility, which is crucial for maintaining muscle structure integrity (RamirezMartinez2017KLHL41). KLHL41 also interacts with NRAP, another sarcomeric protein, facilitating its ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome pathway. This interaction is essential for the transition from pre-myofibrils to mature myofibrils, and its dysregulation can contribute to the pathophysiology of nemaline myopathy (Jirka2018Dysregulation).

KLHL41 forms complexes with other proteins, such as KLHL40, suggesting a potential heterodimeric function. The BTB domain of KLHL41 is crucial for its interaction with the CUL3 complex and for self-association, which is necessary for its stabilizing activity (RamirezMartinez2017KLHL41). KLHL41's interactions with proteins like filamin-C (FLNC) and nebulin fragments have been identified through tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry, highlighting its role in muscle protein stabilization (RamirezMartinez2017KLHL41). These interactions underscore KLHL41's function as a molecular chaperone, stabilizing sarcomeres and maintaining muscle function.
