# HAAO

## Overview
The HAAO gene encodes the enzyme 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase, a crucial component of the kynurenine pathway, which is the primary route for tryptophan catabolism in mammals. This enzyme is categorized as a dioxygenase and is characterized by a cupin fold, a structural motif common among enzymes that incorporate oxygen into substrates. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, leading to the production of quinolinic acid, a precursor for NAD+ biosynthesis, an essential cofactor in cellular metabolism (Davis2022Probing; Wang2020Observing). The activity of 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase is dependent on a nonheme iron ion and is regulated to prevent neurotoxicity associated with excessive quinolinic acid production (Wang2020Observing). The gene's expression and function have significant implications for neurological health and have been linked to various clinical conditions, including autism spectrum disorder and alcohol dependence (Higazi2021Expression; Boros2018Genetic).

## Structure
The human gene HAAO encodes the enzyme 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAO), which is involved in the kynurenine pathway. The enzyme is characterized by a cupin fold, a common structural motif in dioxygenases, and is composed of two cupin domains, suggesting it may have arisen from gene duplication and fusion (Davis2022Probing). The structure of human HAO has been solved with different metal ions at the active site, showing similarities to bacterial and yeast enzymes but with distinct differences in metal binding (Davis2022Probing).

Mammalian HAO, including the human form, is longer than its bacterial counterparts and contains only one metal-binding site, lacking the rubredoxin-like binding site found in bacterial and yeast HAOs (Davis2022Probing). The enzyme's active site binds a nonheme iron ion, coordinated by a 2-His-1-Glu facial triad, which is crucial for its catalytic function (Wang2020Observing). The enzyme is a homodimeric protein, with each subunit containing the cupin structural fold (Wang2020Observing). The structural studies indicate that mammalian HAOs may have evolved from simpler forms found in bacteria and yeast (Davis2022Probing).

## Function
The HAAO gene encodes the enzyme 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase, which plays a crucial role in the kynurenine pathway, a major route of tryptophan catabolism in mammals. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) to produce 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde (ACMS), which can nonenzymatically convert to quinolinic acid (QUIN) (Davis2022Probing). QUIN is a precursor for the biosynthesis of the nicotinamide ring of NAD+, an essential cofactor in cellular metabolism (Wang2020Observing). The enzyme's activity requires a ferrous ion and molecular oxygen, and it can be inhibited by certain metabolites and metal chelators (Davis2022Probing).

In healthy human cells, HAAO facilitates the conversion of tryptophan metabolites into compounds that are further processed into essential cellular components like NAD+ (Davis2022Probing). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is characterized by a cupin barrel fold, binding one metal ion per functional unit (Đilović2009Crystal). The regulation of QUIN production by HAAO is crucial, as excessive QUIN can lead to neurotoxicity by overstimulating NMDA receptors, highlighting the enzyme's role in maintaining neurological health (Wang2020Observing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HAAO gene, which encodes the enzyme 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase, have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), decreased expression of the HAAO gene has been observed, correlating with the severity of autism symptoms. This reduction in expression may lead to impaired mitochondrial function due to decreased NAD synthesis, contributing to ASD pathogenesis (Higazi2021Expression; Boccuto2013Decreased). 

Genetic alterations in the HAAO gene have also been associated with alcohol dependence and behavioral disorders. The Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism identified a linkage between the chromosomal region where HAAO is located and these conditions (Boros2018Genetic). Additionally, a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the HAAO gene, rs3816183, has been linked to hypospadiasis, a birth defect, although the mechanism remains unclear (Boros2018Genetic).

Alterations in the kynurenine pathway, where HAAO plays a critical role, have been implicated in various neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, highlighting the clinical significance of this gene in human health (Boros2018Genetic).
