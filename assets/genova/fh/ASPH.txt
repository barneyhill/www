# ASPH

## Overview
Aspartate beta-hydroxylase (ASPH) is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane protein known for its role in post-translational modification through hydroxylation. The ASPH protein is categorized as a 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) oxygenase, characterized by its involvement in hydroxylating aspartate and asparagine residues within epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains of proteins. This enzymatic activity is crucial for modulating calcium binding and protein interactions, impacting various cellular processes such as cell migration, adhesion, and signaling pathways (Peng2020ASPH; Pfeffer2019Aspartateasparagineβhydroxylase). ASPH is implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, including bone formation, neuronal migration, and cancer progression, where it influences key pathways like Notch and Wnt signaling (Peng2020ASPH; Tong2017Phosphorylation). The gene's expression and activity are linked to conditions such as exertional heat illness, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, and various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Endo2022Variants; Tang2017Aspartate).

## Structure
The ASPH protein, encoded by the human ASPH gene, is a multidomain protein that includes a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, a hinge region, and an oxygenase (OXY) domain. The OXY domain contains a core double-stranded beta-helix (DSBH) motif, flanked by several alpha-helices, characteristic of 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) oxygenases (Krishnan2024Unusual; Pfeffer2019Aspartateasparagineβhydroxylase). The TPR domain, consisting of six tandem repeating pairs of anti-parallel helices, forms a solenoid-like structure and is crucial for substrate recognition and binding (Krishnan2024Unusual; Pfeffer2019Aspartateasparagineβhydroxylase).

ASPH is a type 2 integral membrane protein with a short amino-terminal domain projecting into the cytoplasm, followed by a transmembrane domain and a highly charged region projecting into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (Dinchuk2000Aspartyl). The protein's active site features a metal ion coordinated by two histidine residues, His679 and His725, which is unusual for 2OG oxygenases (Pfeffer2019Aspartateasparagineβhydroxylase).

ASPH undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in over 10 isoforms, including a truncated form known as humbug, which lacks the catalytic domain (Dinchuk2000Aspartyl; Pfeffer2019Aspartateasparagineβhydroxylase). The protein is involved in post-translational modifications, specifically hydroxylation, and is linked to various biological processes and diseases (Pfeffer2019Aspartateasparagineβhydroxylase).

## Function
The ASPH gene encodes aspartate beta-hydroxylase, a type II transmembrane protein involved in several critical cellular processes. ASPH plays a significant role in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation and cellular senescence in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). It is associated with bone mineral density and positively correlates with osteogenic markers such as RUNX2 and COL1A1, enhancing osteogenesis and bone formation (Peng2020ASPH). ASPH expression is higher in young BMSCs and decreases with cellular senescence, suggesting its role in maintaining bone health and preventing age-related bone loss (Peng2020ASPH).

ASPH is also involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, crucial for bone formation, and positively correlates with GSK3B and CTNNB1 expression. Its inhibition affects the Gsk3β/β-catenin signaling pathway, indicating its role in bone formation and cellular senescence regulation (Peng2020ASPH). In neuronal cells, ASPH is involved in cell migration and adhesion through its hydroxylase activity, which modulates the Notch signaling pathway. This activity is essential for cell motility and adhesion, impacting processes like neuronal migration and plasticity (Tong2017Phosphorylation). ASPH's catalytic domain is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it hydroxylates aspartate and asparagine residues in EGF-like domains of proteins, influencing calcium binding and protein interactions (Peng2020ASPH).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ASPH gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of exertional heat illness (EHI) and malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS), rare pathogenic variants in the ASPH gene have been identified as novel genetic causes. These variants, such as V54A and K88T, affect calcium homeostasis and increase heat-induced oxidative stress, contributing to the pathogenesis of these conditions (Endo2022Variants).

In cancer, ASPH is frequently overexpressed and linked to tumor progression and poor prognosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ASPH overexpression disrupts mitochondrial DNA stability, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and aggressive tumor features (Tang2017Aspartate). ASPH is also implicated in cholangiocarcinoma, where its knockdown reduces tumor progression by affecting RB1 phosphorylation (Huang2018Aspartate). In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), ASPH overexpression enhances cell motility and invasion through the Notch signaling pathway, making it a potential therapeutic target (Barboro2020Aspartate).

ASPH is also involved in bone health, where its expression influences osteogenic differentiation and cellular senescence in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, potentially impacting age-related bone loss and osteoporosis (Peng2020ASPH).

## Interactions
Aspartate beta-hydroxylase (ASPH) is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes and cancer progression. ASPH interacts with Notch receptors and ligands, hydroxylating cbEGF-like domains, which enhances Notch signaling by promoting receptor-ligand interactions and facilitating receptor cleavage by ADAM10/17, leading to increased cell proliferation and migration (Zheng2020Diverse; Kanwal2020Aspartate). ASPH also interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), leading to its phosphorylation through enhanced binding of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 2, CDK4, and cyclins D1 and E, which contributes to cell cycle progression (Kanwal2020Aspartate; Huang2018Aspartate).

ASPH's interaction with vimentin supports tumor growth and metastasis, while its involvement in the SRC kinase pathway, through interactions with ADAM12/15, promotes extracellular matrix degradation and tumor invasiveness (Kanwal2020Aspartate). ASPH also binds to GSK-3β, preventing its inactivation and contributing to the malignant phenotype of cells (Zheng2020Diverse). These interactions highlight ASPH's role in modulating key signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
