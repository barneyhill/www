# CATSPERG

## Overview
The CATSPERG gene encodes the cation channel sperm associated auxiliary subunit gamma, a protein that plays a crucial role in sperm function. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is involved in the regulation of calcium ion channels, which are essential for sperm motility and fertility. The proper functioning of these channels is critical for the physiological processes that enable sperm to navigate the female reproductive tract and achieve fertilization. Mutations or dysregulation of the CATSPERG gene can lead to impaired sperm motility and are associated with certain forms of male infertility (Qiu2020aarFDC).
