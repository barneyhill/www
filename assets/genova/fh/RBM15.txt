# RBM15

## Overview
RBM15 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 15, a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various aspects of RNA processing and regulation. This protein is characterized by its RNA-binding motifs and a Spen paralogue and orthologue domain (SPOC), which are essential for its roles in RNA splicing, polyadenylation, and transcriptional regulation (Xie2019RBM15; Zolotukhin2009Nuclear). RBM15 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it participates in the regulation of gene expression by interacting with other proteins and RNA molecules, including long noncoding RNAs and components of the m6A methylation complex (Zolotukhin2009Nuclear; Bose2023Characterization). The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications such as methylation and ubiquitylation, which influence its stability and activity (Zhang2015Crosstalk). Clinically, RBM15 has been implicated in various cancers, where it affects tumor progression and immune response, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cai2021RBM15; Zhao2022N6Methyladenosine).

## Structure
RBM15 is a protein characterized by its distinct domain architecture, which includes three RNA-binding motifs (RBMs) located at the N-terminus and a Spen paralogue and orthologue domain (SPOC) at the C-terminus (Xie2019RBM15; Zolotukhin2009Nuclear). These domains are crucial for its function in RNA processing and transcriptional regulation. The RBMs facilitate RNA binding, while the SPOC domain is involved in transcriptional repression (Zolotukhin2009Nuclear).

RBM15 undergoes post-translational modifications, including methylation and ubiquitylation. Methylation occurs at the R578 site, which is located between the RNA-binding domain and the SPOC domain, and is mediated by PRMT1. This modification is significant for the protein's stability and function (Zhang2015Crosstalk). Ubiquitylation, facilitated by an E3 ligase, leads to the degradation of RBM15, affecting its concentration and role in RNA splicing (Zhang2015Crosstalk).

The protein also exists in splice variant isoforms, which may influence its functional roles in various cellular processes (Zhang2015Crosstalk). These structural features and modifications underscore RBM15's involvement in RNA processing and regulation.

## Function
RBM15 is an RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in RNA processing, including alternative splicing, polyadenylation, and protein translation, which are essential for gene regulation in healthy human cells (Zhang2015Crosstalk). It is involved in the regulation of RNA splicing by binding to specific intronic regions of pre-mRNA of genes important for megakaryopoiesis, such as GATA1, RUNX1, and c-MPL, and recruiting splicing factors like SF3B1 for alternative splicing (Zhang2015Crosstalk). This regulation is critical for the differentiation of megakaryocytes, large cells found in bone marrow (Zhang2015Crosstalk).

RBM15 also influences exon usage in various genes, including transcription factors like RUNX1, GATA1, STAT5A, and TAL1, which are important for megakaryocytic differentiation (Zhang2015Crosstalk). It affects UTR utilization, mixed exon usage, and intron retention, impacting hematopoiesis and RNA splicing through multiple pathways (Zhang2015Crosstalk). RBM15 is methylated by PRMT1, which leads to its degradation via ubiquitylation, affecting its concentration and thereby influencing RNA splicing and cell differentiation (Zhang2015Crosstalk). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, residing in nuclear splicing speckles (Zhang2015Crosstalk).

## Clinical Significance
RBM15 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, a process crucial for RNA modification. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), high RBM15 expression is linked to poor prognosis and is associated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint markers. Knockdown of RBM15 significantly inhibits pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhao2022N6Methyladenosine). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RBM15 promotes tumor progression by regulating m6A modification of YES1 mRNA, enhancing its stability and oncogenic potential. This makes RBM15 a potential target for therapeutic strategies in HCC (Cai2021RBM15).

RBM15 is also involved in cervical cancer (CC), where its knockdown reduces tumor progression and affects the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, indicating its role as an oncogene in CC (Zhang2023Knockdown). In osteosarcoma, RBM15 expression is higher in tumor tissues and is associated with immune cell activity, particularly NK cell activation, suggesting its involvement in tumor development and immune response modulation (Jiang2023Identification). Additionally, RBM15 mutations have been identified in malignant and borderline phyllodes tumors, indicating a potential role in malignant transformation (GarciaDios2018MED12).

## Interactions
RBM15 (RNA binding motif protein 15) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and regulation. It interacts with the splicing factor SF3B1, facilitating the inclusion of specific exons in pre-mRNA molecules, a process regulated by PRMT1-mediated methylation (Zhang2015Crosstalk). RBM15 also binds to long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) such as FIRRE and XIST, primarily through its RNA recognition motifs, which interact with stem-loop structures in these lncRNAs (Bose2023Characterization).

RBM15 is a component of the m6A methylation complex, interacting with METTL3 and METTL14 to guide the writer complex to specific RNA sequence motifs, influencing mRNA stability and translation (Bose2023Characterization). It also interacts with the nuclear export receptor NXF1, facilitating mRNA export by acting as a bridge between NXF1 and the DEAD-box protein DBP5 at the nuclear pore complex (Zolotukhin2009Nuclear).

In the context of protein degradation, RBM15 is methylated by PRMT1, which enhances its ubiquitylation by the E3 ligase CNOT4, leading to its degradation. This process is crucial for controlling RNA splicing and is mediated by the methylation of RBM15 at the R578 site (Zhang2015Crosstalk).
