# TNFAIP3

## Overview
TNFAIP3, also known as A20, is a gene that encodes the TNF alpha induced protein 3, a zinc finger protein with significant roles in regulating immune responses and inflammation. The protein functions primarily as a ubiquitin-editing enzyme, modulating the ubiquitination status of key signaling molecules within the NF-κB pathway, which is crucial for controlling inflammatory and immune responses (Vereecke2011Genetic; Wertz2004Deubiquitination). A20's structure includes an N-terminal ovarian tumor (OTU) domain responsible for deubiquitination activity and multiple C-terminal zinc finger motifs that facilitate its ubiquitin ligase activities. These structural features enable A20 to perform ubiquitin editing, thereby modulating protein stability and signaling pathways. The gene's mutations are linked to various autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis (Zhou2015Lossoffunction; Musone2011Sequencing).

## Structure
TNFAIP3, also known as A20, is a zinc finger protein characterized by its complex molecular structure, which plays a critical role in its function as a regulator of inflammation and immune responses. The protein features an N-terminal ovarian tumor (OTU) domain, which is essential for its deubiquitination activity. This domain is complemented by multiple C-terminal zinc finger motifs that are crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activities. These structural elements enable TNFAIP3 to perform ubiquitin editing, a process vital for modulating protein stability and signaling pathways.

The protein's activity and stability are influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can alter its functional state. TNFAIP3 exists in several splice variant isoforms, which may exhibit differences in their regulatory functions, potentially affecting the protein's role in immune response modulation. The presence of these isoforms suggests a level of complexity in the regulation of TNFAIP3's activity, allowing it to adapt to various cellular contexts and signaling environments. The combination of these structural features and modifications underscores the protein's importance in maintaining immune homeostasis.

## Function
The TNFAIP3 gene encodes the A20 protein, a crucial regulator of immune responses and inflammation in healthy human cells. A20 functions as a ubiquitin-editing enzyme, modulating the ubiquitination status of key components in the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is essential for controlling inflammatory and immune responses (Vereecke2011Genetic; Wertz2004Deubiquitination). It acts as a negative-feedback regulator of NF-κB activation, terminating NF-κB signaling and pro-inflammatory gene expression in response to stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (Vereecke2011Genetic).

A20's function is largely dependent on its ubiquitin-editing capabilities, with its N-terminal domain exhibiting deubiquitinating activity and its C-terminal zinc-finger domain possessing E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity. These activities allow A20 to remove specific polyubiquitin chains from NF-κB signaling molecules and promote the degradation of its targets, thereby maintaining the balance of NF-κB signaling and preventing chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases (Vereecke2011Genetic; Wertz2004Deubiquitination). A20 is also involved in regulating B cell functions, preventing excessive B cell survival and autoimmunity by restricting NF-κB activation signals downstream of CD40 (Tavares2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TNFAIP3 gene, which encodes the A20 protein, are associated with a range of autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Loss-of-function mutations in TNFAIP3 lead to a condition known as Haploinsufficiency of A20 (HA20), characterized by early-onset systemic inflammation. This condition results from impaired regulatory function of A20, leading to sustained NF-κB signaling and increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF (Zhou2015Lossoffunction). HA20 shares clinical features with Behçet's disease but has distinct genetic causes (FrancoJarava2018TNFAIP3).

TNFAIP3 mutations have also been linked to various autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. These mutations often result in hyperactivation of inflammatory pathways, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Zhang2022Novel; Musone2011Sequencing). In some cases, TNFAIP3 mutations lead to complex autoimmunity, as seen in patients with conditions like lupus nephritis and adult-onset Still's disease (Zhang2022Novel; Lawless2018A).

Alterations in TNFAIP3 expression or function can also contribute to cancer, as A20 acts as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts (Zhou2015Lossoffunction).

## Interactions
TNFAIP3, also known as A20, is a protein that plays a critical role in regulating immune responses through its interactions with various proteins. A20 interacts with receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) as part of the TNF receptor 1 signaling complex. It deubiquitinates K63-linked ubiquitin chains from RIP1 and adds K48-linked chains, targeting RIP1 for proteasomal degradation (Wertz2004Deubiquitination; Verstrepen2010Expression). A20 also interacts with TRAF2 and TRAF6, inhibiting NF-κB activation by disrupting their interactions with E2 enzymes (Verstrepen2010Expression).

A20 forms complexes with E3 ubiquitin ligases such as Itch and RNF11, which are necessary for inactivating NF-κB signaling (Verstrepen2010Expression). It also interacts with TAX1BP1, which acts as an 'ubiquitin receptor' essential for limiting cytokine-induced NF-κB activation (Verstrepen2010Expression). Additionally, A20 binds to the WD40 domain of ATG16L1, controlling the autophagic response and NF-κB activation, which is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis (SerramitoGómez2019The).

Mutations in TNFAIP3, such as the p.(Lys91*) mutation, impair A20's ability to interact with proteins involved in ubiquitinylation and NF-κB signaling, leading to enhanced inflammasome activation (Rajamäki2018Haploinsufficiency). These interactions highlight A20's complex role in modulating immune and inflammatory responses.
