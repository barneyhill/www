# SLC22A16

## Overview
The SLC22A16 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 16, which is a transmembrane transporter involved in the uptake of organic cations and carnitine. This protein is a member of the solute carrier family 22 (SLC22), known for its role in facilitating the transport of various substrates across cellular membranes. SLC22A16 is characterized by its 12 alpha-helical transmembrane domains, which are integral to its function in transporting molecules such as carnitine, essential for fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria (Koepsell2007Polyspecific; Volk2013OCTs). The protein is predominantly expressed in tissues with high energy demands, including the testis and bone marrow, and has been implicated in processes such as sperm maturation and hematopoiesis (Galluccio2022Bacterial; Yee2021Emerging). Additionally, SLC22A16 has clinical significance due to its involvement in drug transport and resistance, particularly in cancer cells, where it influences the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents (Novak2015Wholeexome; Galluccio2022Bacterial).

## Structure
The SLC22A16 gene encodes a protein that is part of the solute carrier family 22, known for its role in transporting organic cations and carnitine. The protein is predicted to have a membrane topology consisting of 12 alpha-helical transmembrane domains (TMDs), which are characteristic of its secondary structure (Koepsell2007Polyspecific; Volk2013OCTs). The protein features an intracellular N-terminus and C-terminus, with a large glycosylated extracellular loop between TMDs 1 and 2, and a large intracellular loop with phosphorylation sites between TMDs 6 and 7 (Koepsell2007Polyspecific; Volk2013OCTs). These loops are important for the protein's function and regulation, with the extracellular loop containing conserved cysteines that may form disulfide bridges, potentially playing a role in oligomerization (Volk2013OCTs).

The tertiary structure of SLC22A16 has not been crystallized, but sequence analysis suggests potential beta sheet-like configurations in certain regions, such as the extracellular loop, which shares sequence identity with chicken beta-crystallin B3 (Engelhart2020Systems). The protein is involved in carnitine transport and is expressed in various tissues, including bone marrow and testis, with implications in fatty acid oxidation and cancer (Galluccio2022Bacterial).

## Function
The SLC22A16 gene encodes a carnitine transporter protein, which is crucial for the regulation of fatty acid oxidation in human cells. This transporter facilitates the uptake of carnitine, a molecule essential for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria, where they undergo β-oxidation to produce energy (Galluccio2022Bacterial; Engelhart2020Systems). SLC22A16 is predominantly expressed in tissues with high energy demands, such as the testis, bone marrow, and hematopoietic tissues, and is also found in the endometrium, where its expression is regulated by progesterone (Galluccio2022Bacterial).

In the testis, SLC22A16 plays a significant role in the maturation of spermatozoa by regulating carnitine levels, which are vital for sperm motility and maturation (Yee2021Emerging). The transporter is also expressed in CD34+ cells and leukemia cells, indicating its involvement in hematopoietic processes (Galluccio2022Bacterial). Additionally, SLC22A16 is part of the OCTN/OCTN-related subgroup of the SLC22 family, which is associated with the transport of carnitine derivatives and possibly the antioxidant ergothioneine, suggesting a broader role in cellular metabolism and protection against oxidative stress (Engelhart2020Systems).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC22A16 gene is clinically significant due to its role in drug transport and its association with various diseases. In cancer, SLC22A16 is upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, which rely on mitochondrial metabolism and fatty acid oxidation. Inhibition of SLC22A16 reduces the growth and viability of AML cells and enhances the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents like daunorubicin and cytarabine (Galluccio2022Bacterial). In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mutations in SLC22A16, such as R150Q and L325R, have been identified in cases with poor outcomes. These mutations may affect drug transport and sensitivity to doxorubicin, a key component of DLBCL treatment (Novak2015Wholeexome).

SLC22A16 also plays a role in drug resistance in melanoma. The gene's upregulation enhances intracellular doxorubicin accumulation, leading to increased cytotoxicity when combined with chemotherapy and cold physical plasma (Sagwal2018Combination). In breast cancer, polymorphisms in SLC22A16 have been studied for their association with doxorubicin-induced febrile neutropenia, although no significant link was found (Faraji2016Association). These findings highlight the gene's potential as a therapeutic target and its impact on treatment outcomes in various cancers.
