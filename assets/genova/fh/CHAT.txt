# CHAT

## Overview
The CHAT gene encodes the enzyme choline O-acetyltransferase (ChAT), which is a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). ChAT is categorized as a transferase enzyme, specifically involved in catalyzing the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to choline, resulting in the formation of ACh. This neurotransmitter plays a vital role in various physiological processes, including muscle activation, memory, and learning. The enzyme is predominantly active in cholinergic neurons, facilitating synaptic transmission by ensuring the availability of ACh. Beyond the nervous system, ChAT is also expressed in non-neuronal cells, such as muscle and immune cells, indicating its broader physiological roles. Mutations in the CHAT gene are linked to congenital myasthenic syndromes, highlighting its clinical significance in neuromuscular transmission disorders (Hálová2018CHAT; RochaDias2020Influence; Fujii2001The).

## Structure
The choline O-acetyltransferase (ChAT) enzyme is responsible for synthesizing acetylcholine and has a complex molecular structure. The crystal structure of recombinant rat ChAT, which is similar to human ChAT, was determined at 2.5 Å resolution and includes residues 18-617 of the full-length, 645-residue enzyme (Cai2004Choline). ChAT is composed of two structural domains: the N domain (residues 102-401) and the C domain (residues 18-101 and 402-617). Both domains exhibit alpha/beta folds, with a core structure of six beta strands and three helices (Cai2004Choline). The N domain contains additional helices that cover the central sheet, while the C domain's sheet forms part of the interface between the two domains (Cai2004Choline).

The active site of ChAT is located in a solvent-accessible tunnel at the interface of these domains, which serves as the binding site for substrates like acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) and choline (Cai2004Choline). The enzyme is regulated by phosphorylation, with specific sites such as Ser450 and Thr466 enhancing its activity (Cai2004Choline). ChAT also exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with a notable 82 kDa variant found in primates (Cai2004Choline).

## Function
The CHAT gene encodes the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), which is essential for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). ChAT catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to choline, forming ACh, a critical neurotransmitter involved in various physiological functions, including muscle activation, memory, and learning (Hálová2018CHAT; RochaDias2020Influence). This enzyme is primarily active in cholinergic neurons, where it supports synaptic transmission by ensuring the availability of ACh for neurotransmission (RochaDias2020Influence).

ChAT is also expressed in non-neuronal cells, such as muscle, immune, epithelial, and endothelial cells, indicating its broader physiological roles beyond the nervous system (Hálová2018CHAT). In the immune system, ACh synthesized by ChAT in lymphocytes acts as an autocrine and/or paracrine factor, regulating immune function and suggesting a role in neuro-immune interactions (Fujii2001The). The presence of ChAT in various cell types highlights its importance in maintaining normal cholinergic function, which is crucial for cognitive processes and conscious awareness (Hálová2018CHAT).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHAT gene, which encodes the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, are associated with congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), a group of disorders characterized by impaired neuromuscular transmission. These mutations can lead to a specific form of CMS known as ChAT-CMS, which is often associated with episodic apnea and can be life-threatening. Patients with ChAT-CMS may experience sudden apnea and a progressive decrease in acetylcholine release during neuromuscular transmission, sometimes resulting in permanent ventilator dependency (Shen2011Functional).

Several specific mutations in the CHAT gene, such as p.Arg207His and p.Val136Met, have been linked to severe phenotypes and fatal outcomes. These mutations can cause significant reductions in enzymatic activity, with p.Arg207His leading to a 100-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency (Arredondo2015Choline). The clinical manifestations of CHAT mutations include muscle weakness, developmental delays, and respiratory issues, with some patients requiring mechanical ventilation (Arredondo2015Choline).

The CHAT gene mutations are classified as presynaptic types and account for approximately 5% of CMS cases. These mutations result in deficient resynthesis of acetylcholine, leading to symptoms such as apnea, dyspnea, and feeding difficulties (Zhang2020Congenital).

## Interactions
The CHAT protein, also known as choline O-acetyltransferase, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, influencing its function in synthesizing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. CHAT interacts with amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, specifically Aβ40 and Aβ42, through allosteric binding sites. These interactions can enhance or inhibit CHAT's catalytic activity. Aβ42 is noted to enhance CHAT's activity by 20-30%, while Aβ40 shows variable effects, sometimes acting as a weak potentiating ligand or a blocker. The binding of Aβ peptides to CHAT can potentially block the choline entrance of the catalytic tunnel, affecting its function (Baidya2022Allosteric).

In the context of cell signaling, CHAT acts as an adaptor protein linking signals from tyrosine kinases to Cas family proteins. It forms a complex with Cas and Crk proteins, which is crucial for the activation of Rap1 through the Cas-Crk-C3G signaling pathway. This interaction is essential for cell adhesion and morphology changes, as demonstrated by the effects of a membrane-targeted form of CHAT, Myr-Chat, which enhances integrin-mediated adhesion and induces cell periphery spreading and branching (Sakakibara2002Novel).
