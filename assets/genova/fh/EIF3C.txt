# EIF3C

## Overview
The EIF3C gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit C (eIF3c), a critical component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex. This complex is essential for the initiation phase of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells, playing a pivotal role in the assembly of the pre-initiation complex and facilitating the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to mRNA (Emmanuel2013eIF3c:). The eIF3c protein functions as a scaffold within the eIF3 complex, interacting with other subunits to form a stable structure necessary for translation initiation (Marchione2013The). It is involved in critical interactions with ribosomal proteins and other initiation factors, ensuring accurate mRNA recruitment and AUG codon recognition (Valášek2017Embraced). The ubiquitous expression of EIF3C in human cells underscores its fundamental role in cellular growth and proliferation, and its dysregulation has been linked to various malignancies, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhao2022Targeting).

## Structure
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit C (eIF3c) is a component of the eIF3 complex, which plays a critical role in the initiation of protein synthesis. eIF3c serves as a central scaffold within the complex, forming a dimer with eIF3a that interacts with other subunits containing PCI domains, such as eIF3e, eIF3k, eIF3l, and eIF3m, as well as MPN domain subunits like eIF3f and eIF3h, to create a stable PCI/MPN octamer (Marchione2013The). The eIF3c subunit is involved in binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit, which is crucial for the formation of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) (Hinnebusch2006eIF3:).

eIF3c has a molecular mass of approximately 106,143.8 Da and undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at multiple serine and threonine residues, which are important for regulating its activity during translation initiation (Marchione2013The). The N-terminal domain of eIF3c interacts with other initiation factors such as eIF1 and eIF5, coordinating AUG recognition, a critical step in translation initiation (Valášek2017Embraced). The structural organization of eIF3c within the eIF3 complex is essential for its function in mRNA recruitment and 40S ribosomal subunit association (Herrmannová2019Adapted).

## Function
The EIF3C gene encodes a core subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which is essential for the initiation phase of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. This complex plays a critical role in the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex, facilitating the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA's Cap region, a key step in translation initiation (Emmanuel2013eIF3c:). EIF3C is crucial for stabilizing the binding of the 40S subunit to mRNA and is necessary for recognizing the starting AUG codon, ensuring accurate translation initiation (Emmanuel2013eIF3c:).

In healthy human cells, EIF3C is ubiquitously expressed and is not compensated by other cellular factors, underscoring its fundamental role in translation regulation (Emmanuel2013eIF3c:). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of translation, impacting cell growth and proliferation. By mediating interactions between eIF3 and other components of the translation initiation complex, EIF3C ensures the proper assembly and function of the eIF3 complex, which is vital for normal cellular function and gene expression (Emmanuel2013eIF3c:).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EIF3C gene have been implicated in the progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Studies have shown that down-regulation of EIF3C in NPC cell lines leads to inhibited cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, suggesting its role in tumor growth and progression (Zhao2022Targeting). In vivo experiments further demonstrated that reducing EIF3C expression suppressed tumor formation and growth in mouse models, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhao2022Targeting).

EIF3C is also associated with immune modulation in the tumor microenvironment. Lower expression of EIF3C correlates with higher infiltration of CD8+ T cells, which are crucial for anti-tumor immune responses. This suggests that EIF3C may play a role in immune evasion by tumors, potentially affecting the efficacy of immunotherapy (Li2024A). Overexpression of EIF3C has been observed to suppress CD8+ T-cell activity, further supporting its involvement in immune response modulation (Li2024A).

These findings indicate that EIF3C not only contributes to tumorigenesis through its effects on cell proliferation and survival but also through its impact on the immune landscape of tumors, making it a significant factor in cancer progression and treatment response.

## Interactions
EIF3C is a core subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which plays a crucial role in the assembly of the 43S and 48S pre-initiation complexes (PICs) during translation initiation. EIF3C interacts directly with eIF4G to facilitate mRNA loading onto the 43S PICs, highlighting its specific role in mRNA recruitment (Herrmannová2019Adapted). It is part of a trimeric complex with eIF3a and eIF3e, forming a structural core essential for the assembly of the eIF3 complex (Herrmannová2019Adapted). EIF3C also interacts with ribosomal proteins Rps13/uS15 and Rps27/eS27, although efficient 40S binding requires support from other eIF3 subunits (Herrmannová2019Adapted).

The eIF3 complex, including eIF3C, promotes the formation of the 43S and 48S PICs by aiding the loading of Met-tRNAiMet and mRNA onto the 40S ribosomal subunit (Herrmannová2019Adapted). EIF3C's interactions are crucial for the structural integrity and function of the eIF3 complex, and its knockdown results in significant defects in 48S PIC assembly (Herrmannová2019Adapted). These interactions underscore the importance of eIF3C in translation initiation and its potential as a therapeutic target in certain malignancies (Emmanuel2013eIF3c:).
