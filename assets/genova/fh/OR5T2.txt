# OR5T2

## Overview
The OR5T2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily T member 2, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral to the olfactory system, facilitating the detection and discrimination of odor molecules. The OR5T2 protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is involved in the initial steps of odorant signal transduction, which ultimately leads to the perception of smell. The genetic diversity observed in OR5T2 and other olfactory receptor genes is thought to be maintained by balancing selection, potentially due to overdominance, which enhances the ability to detect a wide range of odorants (Alonso2008Overdominance). This diversity is particularly important given the reduced number of functional olfactory receptors in humans compared to other primates, suggesting that selective pressures may play a role in maintaining the functional capacity of these receptors (Alonso2008Overdominance).

## Function
The OR5T2 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. Each olfactory neuron expresses just one allele from a single OR gene, and the heterozygosity in OR genes like OR5T2 can double the number of different odorant-binding sites available, enhancing olfactory acuity (Alonso2008Overdominance).

The study by Alonso et al. suggests that olfactory receptors, including OR5T2, may have been maintained by balancing selection, potentially due to overdominance. This genetic diversity is thought to improve the ability to discriminate among closely related odorants, which is significant given the loss of functional ORs in humans compared to other primates (Alonso2008Overdominance). The enrichment of genes with higher heterozygosity than expected within the olfactory receptor activity class indicates that these receptors are not merely evolving neutrally but may be subject to selective pressures that enhance their functional roles in olfactory perception (Alonso2008Overdominance).
