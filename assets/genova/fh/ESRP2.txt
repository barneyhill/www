# ESRP2

## Overview
ESRP2 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, a critical process for generating protein diversity in epithelial cells. The protein, also named epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2, is a splicing factor that plays a pivotal role in maintaining epithelial cell identity by modulating the splicing of pre-mRNAs, particularly those involved in cell adhesion, cytoskeleton organization, and intracellular signaling. ESRP2 is known for its interaction with GU-rich motifs on pre-mRNAs, influencing the inclusion or exclusion of specific exons, which is essential for the proper functioning of epithelial tissues (Bhate2015ESRP2). The protein is particularly significant in the liver, where it regulates the transition from neonatal to adult splice isoforms, crucial for liver maturation and function (Bhate2015ESRP2). Additionally, ESRP2's role extends to various pathological conditions, including cancer and developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Hyun2021Dysregulation; Caetano2024Functional).

## Function
ESRP2 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2) is a critical regulator of alternative splicing in epithelial cells, influencing the expression of specific splice isoforms that are essential for maintaining epithelial cell identity and function. In epithelial cells, ESRP2, along with its paralog ESRP1, regulates the splicing of the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene, promoting the inclusion of exon IIIb to produce the epithelial isoform FGFR2-IIIb, while repressing the mesenchymal isoform FGFR2-IIIc (Warzecha2009ESRP1). This regulation is crucial for maintaining the epithelial phenotype and is involved in processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation (Warzecha2009ESRP1).

In the liver, ESRP2 plays a significant role in the postnatal maturation of hepatocytes by controlling the switch from neonatal to adult splice isoforms. This transition is vital for the liver's development from a hematopoietic organ in the embryo to a major metabolic tissue in adults (Bhate2015ESRP2). ESRP2 is responsible for regulating splicing events that affect cell-cell adhesion, cytoskeleton rearrangement, and intracellular signaling, which are essential for the functional competence of hepatocytes (Bhate2015ESRP2). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it binds to GU-rich motifs on pre-mRNAs, modulating the splicing of alternative exons (Bhate2015ESRP2).

## Clinical Significance
ESRP2 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2) plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in alternative splicing and its regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In Wilms tumor, a type of kidney cancer primarily affecting children, ESRP2 acts as a tumor suppressor. It is epigenetically repressed by DNA hypermethylation, which disrupts the mesenchymal to epithelial transition during early kidney development, contributing to tumor pathogenesis (Legge2021The).

In breast cancer, ESRP2 and its antisense transcript ESRP2-AS are hypomethylated and overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and lower disease-free survival. This upregulation is associated with increased tumor relapse risk, highlighting its prognostic relevance (Heilmann2017Genome-wide).

ESRP2 is also implicated in liver cancer, particularly in the context of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Suppression of ESRP2 leads to the accumulation of fetal NF2 splice variants, promoting YAP/TAZ signaling and contributing to hepatobiliary carcinogenesis. Low ESRP2 expression is linked to higher recurrence rates and reduced survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients (Hyun2021Dysregulation).

Additionally, ESRP2 mutations have been associated with orofacial clefts, as disruptions in ESRP2 can lead to craniofacial developmental issues (Caetano2024Functional).

## Interactions
ESRP2 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2) is known to participate in several physical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in the regulation of alternative splicing events. ESRP2 interacts with Arkadia (RNF111), a functional regulator that modulates its splicing function. This interaction involves the ubiquitination of ESRP2 on specific lysine residues within the RRM2 and RRM3 domains, enhancing its splicing ability without leading to protein degradation (Mizutani2015The). Immunoprecipitation studies have confirmed that Arkadia physically interacts with both ESRP2 and ESRP1 in HEK293T cells, suggesting a direct modulation of ESRP2's splicing function (Mizutani2015The).

ESRP2 also binds to specific RNA sequences, particularly GU-rich motifs. UV crosslinking experiments demonstrated that ESRP2, along with ESRP1, binds to the ISE/ISS-3 RNA sequence, which is crucial for the splicing regulation of FGFR2 (Warzecha2009ESRP1). This binding is sequence-specific, as mutations in the GU or UG dinucleotides disrupt the interaction (Warzecha2009ESRP1). ESRP2's role in splicing regulation is further supported by its involvement in maintaining epithelial-specific splicing patterns, particularly in the context of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Warzecha2009ESRP1).
