# FAT2

## Overview
FAT2 is a gene that encodes the FAT atypical cadherin 2 protein, a member of the cadherin superfamily, which is characterized by its role as a type I transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in crucial biological processes such as cell polarity and migration, particularly within epithelial cells. FAT2 is essential for the proper alignment and polarization of cell protrusions, facilitating effective collective cell migration. The protein interacts with the WAVE complex, a key player in cell protrusion formation, by influencing its localization at the leading edge of cells. This interaction is vital for the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, which are necessary for directed cell migration (Williams2022Fat2). In Drosophila, FAT2 plays a significant role in planar cell polarity, particularly in the follicle epithelium, indicating its conserved function across species (Viktorinová2009The). The gene's involvement in various cancers, with mutations linked to both favorable and unfavorable prognoses, underscores its potential as a prognostic and therapeutic biomarker (Wang2022Somatic; Zhou2021Identification).

## Structure
The FAT2 protein is a type I transmembrane protein and a member of the cadherin superfamily, characterized by a large extracellular domain. This domain includes 32 cadherin repeats, one Laminin G (LamG) domain, and two EGF-like domains, which are common features among FAT family proteins (Katoh2006Comparative; Peng2021Role). The extracellular region is relatively conserved across the FAT family, while the cytoplasmic regions are more divergent (Katoh2006Comparative). 

The FAT2 protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage, a process observed in other FAT family members like FAT1 and FAT4, which are cleaved by Furin to form a heterodimer (KATOH2012Function). Although specific post-translational modifications for FAT2 are not detailed, such modifications are common in cadherin proteins and may include glycosylation, which can influence protein function and stability.

The intracellular domain of FAT2 is crucial for its function, particularly in axon organization and cytoskeletal interactions, as seen in studies involving Drosophila (Vien2023Conserved). However, detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of FAT2, as well as splice variant isoforms, is not provided in the available context.

## Function
FAT2 (FAT atypical cadherin 2) is a protein that plays a significant role in cell polarity and migration, particularly in epithelial cells. It is involved in the polarization of cell protrusions, which is crucial for collective cell migration. FAT2 is necessary for aligning cell protrusions in a common direction, facilitating effective migration. In the absence of FAT2, protrusions become misaligned, leading to migration failure (Williams2022Fat2).

FAT2 interacts with the WAVE complex, a key player in building cell protrusions, by influencing the localization of the WAVE complex, particularly the Sra1 subunit, at the leading edge of cells. This interaction is critical for the formation of protrusions and proper cell migration (Williams2022Fat2). FAT2 acts non-cell-autonomously to concentrate the WAVE complex at the leading edge, promoting the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, which are essential for directed cell migration (Williams2022Fat2).

In Drosophila, FAT2 is crucial for planar cell polarity, particularly in the follicle epithelium, where it helps orient actin filaments and maintain the proper shape of egg chambers (Viktorinová2009The). This function is conserved across species, indicating a fundamental role in cell polarity and tissue organization.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FAT2 gene have been associated with various cancers, including stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) and gastric cancer (GC). In STAD, FAT2 mutations are linked to a better prognosis, with increased survival times and improved progression-free survival and overall survival. These mutations are associated with a higher tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, contributing to an inflamed tumor microenvironment and potentially enhancing tumor immunogenicity (Wang2022Somatic). In gastric cancer, FAT2 mutations are also correlated with a better prognosis, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role. The mutations may affect intracellular material transport and signal transduction processes, impacting pathways like the Hippo signaling pathway, which is often dysregulated in GC (Zhou2021Identification).

High expression of FAT2, however, is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including gastric cancer, breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, and colorectal cancer. This suggests that while mutations in FAT2 can be beneficial in certain contexts, overexpression may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (Wang2022Somatic). The dual role of FAT2 in cancer highlights its potential as a prognostic and therapeutic biomarker.

## Interactions
The FAT2 protein interacts with the WAVE complex, a crucial component in cell migration and protrusion formation. FAT2 is localized to the trailing edge of cells and recruits the WAVE complex to the leading edge of adjacent cells, stabilizing WAVE complex polarity for directed cell migration. This interaction is essential for polarizing cell protrusions and aligning cell polarities across an epithelium, facilitating coordinated collective cell migration (Williams2022Fat2). FAT2 colocalizes with the WAVE complex at leading-trailing cell-cell interfaces, with a strong Spearman's correlation of 0.71, indicating a significant interaction. This colocalization is crucial for the organization of cell protrusions during migration (Williams2022Fat2).

The interaction between FAT2 and the WAVE complex is non-cell-autonomous but highly localized, with FAT2 puncta enriching the WAVE complex at corresponding puncta across the cell-cell interface. This interaction aligns cell protrusions across the epithelium, facilitating directionally persistent collective migration (Williams2022Fat2). The study suggests that FAT2 may promote WAVE complex accumulation through positive regulators like active Rac, PIP3, or membrane-localized proteins that bind the WAVE complex (Williams2022Fat2).
