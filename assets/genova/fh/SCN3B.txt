# SCN3B

## Overview
The SCN3B gene encodes the sodium voltage-gated channel beta subunit 3, a critical component of the voltage-gated sodium (Na v) channels that are essential for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in excitable cells, including neurons and cardiac myocytes. The protein product of SCN3B, the β3 subunit, is a transmembrane protein characterized by an extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular carboxyl-terminal region. This subunit plays a pivotal role in modulating the function of the α subunits of Na v channels by influencing their voltage sensitivity, channel trafficking, and gating kinetics (Namadurai2014Crystal; Glass2020Computational). The β3 subunit is involved in maintaining normal cardiac rhythm and has been implicated in various cardiac arrhythmias, including Brugada Syndrome and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, due to its interactions with the Na v 1.5 α subunit and other cellular components (Valdivia2009Lossoffunction; Ishikawa2013Novel).

## Structure
The SCN3B gene encodes the β3 subunit of the sodium voltage-gated channel, which plays a crucial role in modulating the function of the α subunits in these channels. The β3 subunit is characterized by a single extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular carboxyl-terminal region (Namadurai2014Crystal). The Ig domain of the β3 subunit crystallizes as a trimer, and this trimeric assembly is also observed in vivo, suggesting a significant role in the protein's function (Namadurai2014Crystal; Salvage2020Supramolecular).

The primary structure of the β3 subunit includes specific residues such as Val-86, Val-12, Val-30, and Ala-106, which are critical for its stability and function. Mutations in these residues can lead to misfolding or destabilization of the trimeric structure, impacting its physiological role (Namadurai2014Crystal). The secondary structure features typical Ig domain β-sheets, with unique structural elements like a buried disulfide bond (Cys-21-96) and surface-exposed hydrophobic contacts that stabilize the trimer (Namadurai2014Crystal).

The β3 subunit can undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which are unlikely to interfere with trimer assembly due to the orientation of glycosylation sites (Namadurai2014Crystal). The quaternary structure involves the formation of monomers, dimers, and trimers, with the trimeric form being predominant and stabilized by specific intersubunit interactions (Namadurai2014Crystal).

## Function
The SCN3B gene encodes the β3 subunit of voltage-gated sodium (Na v) channels, which are essential for initiating action potentials in excitable cells such as neurons and cardiac myocytes. These channels consist of an α subunit forming the central pore and β subunits that modulate voltage sensitivity and channel trafficking. The β3 subunit, in particular, is involved in cardiac conduction, as it modulates the Na v channel's voltage sensitivity and influences the spatial distribution of the α subunit, contributing to the precise control of Na v channel behavior in different tissues (Glass2020Computational).

In the heart, the β3 subunit plays a critical role in maintaining normal cardiac rhythm by modulating the activity of α subunits in a cell type-specific manner. It affects channel expression, gating kinetics, and pharmacological responses, which are crucial for the regulation of sodium channel function and cardiac excitability (Angsutararux2021Molecular). The β3 subunit interacts non-covalently with the α-subunit and is involved in modulating voltage-dependent activation and the time course of recovery from inactivation (Angsutararux2021Molecular).

The β3 subunit's dynamic behavior and its interaction with the α subunit are influenced by lipid composition, which plays a role in its dynamical behavior (Glass2020Computational). It can trimerize via its immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and induce higher-order oligomerization of Na v channel α subunits (Glass2020Computational).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCN3B gene, which encodes the sodium voltage-gated channel beta subunit 3, have been implicated in several cardiac arrhythmias. Brugada Syndrome (BrS) is one such condition associated with SCN3B mutations. The V110I mutation in SCN3B has been identified in patients with BrS and is linked to impaired intracellular trafficking and function of the Nav1.5 sodium channel, leading to reduced sodium current (INa) and increased risk of arrhythmias (Ishikawa2013Novel). Another mutation, L10P, also affects the electrophysiological properties of Nav1.5, contributing to BrS (Ishikawa2013Novel).

SCN3B mutations are also associated with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF). The V54G mutation results in a significant reduction in sodium current density and affects the trafficking of the Nav1.5 channel, contributing to the pathogenesis of IVF (Valdivia2009Lossoffunction). 

In addition to BrS and IVF, SCN3B mutations have been linked to atrial fibrillation (AF). Variants in the promoter region, such as c.-324C>A, can increase SCN3B expression, potentially leading to AF by altering cardiac electrical stability (Lin2022Two). These findings underscore the role of SCN3B in cardiac arrhythmias and highlight its clinical significance.

## Interactions
The SCN3B gene encodes the β3 subunit of the sodium voltage-gated channel, which interacts with the Na v 1.5 α subunit, a critical component in cardiac sodium channels. The β3 subunit can form monomers, dimers, and trimers, which associate with the Na v 1.5 α subunit, influencing its gating properties and electrophysiological behavior (Namadurai2014Crystal; Salvage2020Supramolecular). These interactions are relatively weak in solution but become significant on the plasma membrane, where the β3 subunit can bind at up to four sites symmetrically around the Na v 1.5 α subunit (Namadurai2014Crystal; Salvage2020Supramolecular).

The β3 subunit's intracellular region can bind to the carboxy-terminal domain of the α subunit, stabilizing fast inactivation and affecting the channel's voltage sensitivity (Namadurai2015A). The β3 subunit also interacts with cell adhesion molecules such as neurofascin-186, contactin, and tenascins, which are important for neurite growth and the localization of Na v channels to nodes of Ranvier (Namadurai2015A; Namadurai2014Crystal). These interactions highlight the β3 subunit's role in modulating sodium channel function and its potential impact on cardiac and neuronal physiology.
