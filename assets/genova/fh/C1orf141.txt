# C1orf141

## Overview
C1orf141 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 141. This protein is currently not well-characterized in terms of its specific biological function or classification into a known protein family, such as kinases or receptors. However, emerging research suggests that C1orf141 may play a role in immune system regulation, as evidenced by its association with autoimmune conditions like Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease and psoriasis. Genetic variants in the IL23R-C1orf141 region have been linked to increased susceptibility to these diseases, indicating a potential involvement in immune-related pathways (Sakono2020Variants). Further studies are required to elucidate the precise biological functions and mechanisms of action of the C1orf141 protein.

## Clinical Significance
C1orf141 has been implicated in the susceptibility to Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease, a systemic inflammatory disorder affecting pigment cell-containing organs. Genetic studies have identified significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL23R-C1orf141 region and VKH disease in Japanese populations. Specifically, the T allele of rs78377598 and the G allele of rs117633859 in this region are more frequent in VKH patients, suggesting these variants increase disease risk (Sakono2020Variants). The IL23R-C1orf141 region's involvement in VKH disease pathogenesis is thought to be related to immune system dysregulation, particularly through the activation of type 17 helper T cells (Th17), which are implicated in autoimmune diseases (Sakono2020Variants).

In addition to VKH disease, C1orf141 has been associated with psoriasis, although its exact role in this condition is not fully understood (Sakono2020Variants). The gene's expression in the iris and its potential interactions with immune-related pathways suggest that alterations in C1orf141 may contribute to the development of these diseases. However, the precise mechanisms by which C1orf141 influences these conditions remain to be elucidated, and further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance.
