# CYCS

## Overview
The CYCS gene encodes cytochrome c, somatic, a small heme protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular respiration and apoptosis. As a component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, cytochrome c facilitates electron transfer between Complex III and Complex IV, which is essential for ATP production and cellular energy supply (Santucci2019Cytochrome; Kulikov2011Cytochrome). Structurally, cytochrome c is characterized by its highly conserved CXXCH motif and a tertiary structure stabilized by a covalently attached heme group, which is crucial for its electron transport function (Zaidi2013The; Salviati2021Cytochrome). Beyond its role in energy metabolism, cytochrome c is involved in apoptosis, where it interacts with apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) to form the apoptosome, triggering caspase activation and cell death (Santucci2019Cytochrome; Kulikov2011Cytochrome). The protein's multifunctionality is further highlighted by its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating cell fate (AlvarezPaggi2017Multifunctional).

## Structure
Cytochrome c (CYCS) is a small heme protein encoded by the CYCS gene, located on chromosome 7p15.3. The protein consists of 104 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 11,458 Da after the removal of the initial methionine (Salviati2021Cytochrome). Its primary structure includes a highly conserved CXXCH motif, where cysteine residues form thioether bonds with the heme group, essential for the protein's maturation and function (Zaidi2013The).

The secondary structure of cytochrome c is characterized by four alpha helices, a short anti-parallel beta sheet, and three omega loops (Salviati2021Cytochrome). The tertiary structure is stabilized by the covalent attachment of the heme group, which is coordinated by histidine 19 and methionine 81 (Salviati2021Cytochrome). This structure is crucial for its role in electron transport and apoptosis.

Cytochrome c functions as a monomer, lacking a quaternary structure. It undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at serine 47 and threonine 28, which regulate its interaction with cytochrome c oxidase and affect electron transport chain activity (Kalpage2019Serine‐47; Mahapatra2017Phosphorylation). These modifications are significant for its function in oxidative phosphorylation and apoptosis.

## Function
Cytochrome c, encoded by the CYCS gene, is a crucial component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, facilitating electron transfer between Complex III and Complex IV. This process is essential for ATP production, which is vital for cellular energy supply (Santucci2019Cytochrome; Kulikov2011Cytochrome). In healthy cells, cytochrome c is located in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, where it performs its primary function as an electron carrier (Zaidi2013The).

Beyond its role in energy production, cytochrome c also acts as a detoxifying agent by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as radicals and hydrogen peroxide, thus contributing to the cell's antioxidant defenses (Santucci2019Cytochrome). The protein's structure, including its heme group and axial ligands His18 and Met80, is critical for maintaining its high redox potential, which is necessary for its electron transport function (Zaidi2013The).

Cytochrome c is also involved in apoptosis, a programmed cell death process. Upon release into the cytosol, it interacts with apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) to form the apoptosome, leading to caspase activation and cell death (Santucci2019Cytochrome; Kulikov2011Cytochrome). This dual role in both cellular respiration and apoptosis underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating cell fate (Kulikov2011Cytochrome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYCS gene, which encodes cytochrome c, are associated with thrombocytopenia 4 (THC4), a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by mild thrombocytopenia. Patients with THC4 have a reduced number of platelets that are of normal size and morphology but do not experience prolonged bleeding episodes. The G41S mutation was first identified in a New Zealand family, while the Y48H mutation was found in an Italian family. Both mutations lead to increased apoptotic activity and reduced respiratory function, indicating a pathogenic role in thrombocytopenia (Karsisiotis2016Increased; De2014Mutations).

The G41S mutation enhances the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by promoting a pro-apoptotic conformation of cytochrome c, increasing peroxidase activity, and altering the protein's dynamics, particularly in the 40-57 Ω-loop region. This mutation affects the energy landscape of cytochrome c, making it more prone to adopt non-native conformations that are pro-apoptotic (Karsisiotis2016Increased; Morison2008A). The Y48H mutation, located near the heme redox center, interferes with electron flow, leading to reduced oxygen consumption and cytochrome c content, further contributing to the condition (De2014Mutations). These mutations highlight the critical role of cytochrome c in apoptosis and cellular bioenergetics, impacting platelet production and leading to thrombocytopenia (De2014Mutations).

## Interactions
Cytochrome c (CYCS) is involved in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a pivotal role in apoptosis and electron transport. It interacts with Apaf-1 to form the apoptosome, a crucial step in the activation of caspase-9 and the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (AlvarezPaggi2017Multifunctional; Santucci2019Cytochrome). Cytochrome c also binds to cardiolipin in the mitochondrial membrane, which is essential for its release into the cytosol and subsequent apoptotic activity (AlvarezPaggi2017Multifunctional; Santucci2019Cytochrome).

In addition to its role in apoptosis, cytochrome c interacts with various proteins in the electron transport chain, including cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) and cytochrome bc1 complex (CcR), facilitating electron transfer (AlvarezPaggi2017Multifunctional). It also forms complexes with cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP), where specific lysine residues on cytochrome c interact with negatively charged residues on CcP, crucial for catalytic reduction of peroxides (AlvarezPaggi2017Multifunctional).

Cytochrome c's interactions extend to nucleic acids, where it competes with histones for binding to the histone chaperone NRP1, and interacts with transfer RNA (tRNA) to inhibit apoptosome formation, thus preventing apoptosis (AlvarezPaggi2017Multifunctional). These interactions underscore its multifunctional role in cellular processes.
