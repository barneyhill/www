# SP1

## Overview
The SP1 gene encodes the Sp1 transcription factor, a pivotal protein in the regulation of gene expression. As a member of the Sp/KLF family, Sp1 is characterized by its zinc finger DNA-binding domain, which enables it to bind to GC-rich motifs in DNA, thereby facilitating the transcription of numerous genes (Suske1999The). The Sp1 transcription factor is integral to various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and response to hormonal signals, due to its role in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cell cycle control and other critical pathways (Solomon2008A; Black2001Sp1). Sp1's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, which influence its stability and DNA-binding capacity (Solomon2008A). Clinically, alterations in SP1 expression are associated with several cancers, making it a target of interest for therapeutic interventions (Safe2023Specificity; Guan2011Sp1).

## Structure
The Sp1 transcription factor is characterized by its distinct molecular structure, which includes a highly conserved DNA-binding domain composed of three Cys2His2-type zinc finger motifs located near the C-terminus. These zinc fingers are crucial for DNA binding, with each finger exhibiting a typical globular folding pattern consisting of an alpha helix and an antiparallel beta sheet, stabilized by zinc coordination and hydrophobic interactions (Oka2004NMR). The zinc fingers of Sp1 interact with DNA, with fingers 2 and 3 recognizing four base pairs each, while finger 1 uses a unique recognition mode involving fewer residues, allowing for high-affinity binding to various DNA sequences (Oka2004NMR).

The N-terminal region of Sp1 is rich in glutamine and serine/threonine residues, which are important for its transcriptional activity (Suske1999The). Sp1 also contains specific activation and inhibitory domains that contribute to its transcriptional properties (Suske1999The). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation can affect Sp1's activity, and multiple splice variants exist, contributing to its functional diversity. The protein can form dimers, as evidenced by the presence of a 190-kD species in non-reducing conditions, likely a dimer of 95-kD polypeptides linked by disulfide bonds (Briggs1986Purification).

## Function
The SP1 transcription factor is a critical regulator of gene expression in healthy human cells, influencing various molecular processes and cellular functions. SP1 is a member of the Sp/KLF family and is characterized by its zinc finger DNA-binding domain, which allows it to bind to GC-rich motifs in DNA, facilitating the transcription of numerous genes (Suske1999The; Solomon2008A). It plays a significant role in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cell cycle control, such as p21 waf1/cip1 and p15 INK4b, and interacts with Smad proteins, which are major effectors of TGF-b signaling (Black2001Sp1).

SP1 is involved in the regulation of genes critical for cell growth and differentiation, and its activity is modulated by various signaling pathways, including those triggered by insulin and other hormones (Solomon2008A). It acts as a transducer of insulin signaling in the nucleus, where its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation, affecting its stability and DNA binding activity (Solomon2008A). SP1 also plays a role in maintaining methylation-free CpG islands, which is crucial for the expression of housekeeping genes (Höller1988Sp1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SP1 gene, which encodes the Sp1 transcription factor, have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. Sp1 is overexpressed in various cancers, including liver, gastric, prostate, and glioma, and is associated with poor prognosis and decreased disease-free survival (Safe2023Specificity; Guan2011Sp1). In glioma, high Sp1 expression correlates with increased tumor invasiveness and poor clinical outcomes, partly due to its role in upregulating MMP-2, a matrix metalloproteinase involved in tumor invasion (Guan2011Sp1).

Sp1 also interacts with long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs, contributing to cancer cell proliferation, survival, and drug resistance (Safe2023Specificity). In breast cancer, Sp1's interaction with Sp3 and long non-coding RNAs affects β-catenin levels, while in hepatocellular carcinoma, it induces LncRNA DUBR, promoting stemness and drug resistance (Safe2023Specificity).

Phosphorylation of Sp1 by kinases such as PKC influences its DNA binding and transcriptional activity, impacting gene expression in disease contexts like cancer and atherosclerosis (Tan2009Sp1). Targeting Sp1 interactions with DNA and other molecules is a promising strategy in cancer treatment, with compounds like mithramycin A showing potential in modulating Sp1 activity (Vizcaíno2015Sp1).

## Interactions
The Sp1 transcription factor is known to interact with a variety of proteins, playing a crucial role in transcription regulation. Sp1 interacts with the transcription factor E2F, particularly E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3, but not E2F4 and E2F5. This interaction is essential for the activity of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter, with Sp1 binding to E2F through its C-terminal domain, which includes the zinc fingers and domain D (Karlseder1996Interaction).

Sp1 also interacts with Oct-1, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of human U2 snRNA gene expression. This interaction is both physical and functional, enhancing the binding of Oct-1 to DNA and stimulating transcription (Strom1996The).

In addition, Sp1 has been shown to interact with various proteins identified through a two-hybrid screening, including Hsc70, HCF-1, SF3A120, and HSph2. These interactions suggest Sp1's involvement in diverse cellular processes (Gunther2000AsetofproteinsinteractingwithtranscriptionfactorSp1identifiedinatwohybridscreening).

Sp1 can also be recruited to non-Sp1 sites in promoters through interactions with other DNA-binding proteins, as demonstrated in the human neurofilament (H) promoter (Elder1992Targeting).
