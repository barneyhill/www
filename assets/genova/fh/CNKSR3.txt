# CNKSR3

## Overview
CNKSR3, or Connector Enhancer of Kinase Suppressor of Ras 3, is a gene that encodes a scaffold protein known as CNKSR family member 3. This protein is part of the CNK family, which is involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those related to the regulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in renal cells. CNKSR3 is characterized by its unique structure, which includes an N-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM domain), a CRIC domain, and a PDZ domain, but notably lacks the C-terminal SH3 and PH domains found in other CNK family members. This structural distinction suggests a specialized role in modulating signaling pathways, such as the RAF/ERK cascade, by acting as a scaffold protein. CNKSR3 is a direct target of the mineralocorticoid receptor and plays a significant role in sodium reabsorption in the kidney, with implications for conditions like diabetic kidney disease (Soundararajan2012Scaffold; Ziera2009Cnksr3; Iyengar2015GenomeWide).

## Structure
CNKSR3 is a member of the 'connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of RAS' (CNK) family and is characterized by several protein interaction domains. It contains an N-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM domain), a conserved region in CNK proteins known as the CRIC domain, and a PDZ domain (Ziera2009Cnksr3; ziera2009identification). Unlike other CNK family members, CNKSR3 lacks the C-terminal half that includes the proline-rich SRC-homology-3 (SH3) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, which are present in CNK1 and CNK2 (Ziera2009Cnksr3). This structural difference suggests that CNKSR3 may not form a fully active protein complex, potentially affecting its role in signal transduction pathways (ziera2009identification).

The PDZ domain of CNKSR3 is crucial for its function, particularly in the regulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), as it facilitates interactions with other proteins involved in sodium transport (Soundararajan2012Scaffold). The absence of specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, limits a comprehensive understanding of CNKSR3's molecular structure (Soundararajan2012Scaffold; Ziera2009Cnksr3).

## Function
The CNKSR3 gene encodes a scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in renal cells. It is a direct target of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and is highly expressed in the connecting tubule (CNT) and cortical collecting duct (CCD) of the kidney, which are key sites for sodium reabsorption regulated by aldosterone (Ziera2009Cnksr3; ziera2009identification). CNKSR3 is involved in maintaining aldosterone-mediated transepithelial sodium transport by modulating the RAF/ERK signaling pathway. Overexpression of CNKSR3 increases ENaC activity, while silencing its expression significantly reduces sodium absorption (Ziera2009Cnksr3; ziera2009identification).

CNKSR3 functions as a scaffold protein, influencing signal transduction and affecting the assembly of signaling networks. It appears to inhibit the RAF/ERK signaling cascade, as its overexpression reduces MEK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas its silencing increases it (Ziera2009Cnksr3). This protein is part of the CNK family, which includes CNK1 and CNK2, known for their roles in RHO/JNK and RAS/ERK signal transduction. However, CNKSR3 lacks certain domains present in CNK1 and CNK2, which may limit its ability to form fully active protein complexes, thus diminishing RAF/ERK signaling activity (Ziera2009Cnksr3).

## Clinical Significance
The CNKSR3 gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) through its role in regulating the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) on the apical membrane of cells in the distal nephron. CNKSR3 is a direct target of the mineralocorticoid receptor and is highly expressed in the renal cortical collecting duct, where it is upregulated in response to aldosterone. This gene is involved in the assembly of ENaC and its regulators, which is essential for the stimulation of ENaC function by aldosterone. Clinically, the blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key therapeutic strategy for DKD and other proteinuric kidney diseases, and inhibition of aldosterone may further limit renal fibrosis. The significant association between DKD and markers near CNKSR3 is consistent with clinical trial data showing that RAAS or aldosterone receptor blockade can slow DKD progression. However, further research is needed to determine whether CNKSR3 directly regulates DKD pathogenesis through its effects on ENaC activity or by promoting aldosterone-dependent fibrosis. Additionally, CNKSR3's expression in the tubulointerstitial compartment of the kidney correlates with urine albumin levels and the urine albumin:creatinine ratio, suggesting its potential role in DKD-related pathogenesis.

## Interactions
CNKSR3, a member of the connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of Ras family, is involved in various protein interactions that modulate cellular signaling pathways. It functions as a scaffold protein, facilitating the assembly of multiprotein complexes. CNKSR3 is known to interact with components of the RAF/ERK signaling pathway, potentially inhibiting it. Overexpression of CNKSR3 has been shown to reduce MEK1/2 phosphorylation, while its silencing increases phosphorylation, indicating its role in modulating this pathway (Ziera2009Cnksr3).

CNKSR3 is also a direct target of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which is activated by aldosterone. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), a key player in sodium absorption in the kidney. The CNKSR3 promoter contains aldosterone-responsive regions that bind MR, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments (Ziera2009Cnksr3).

While CNKSR3 lacks the C-terminal SH3 and PH domains found in other CNK family members, it contains an N-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM domain), a CRIC domain, and a PDZ domain, which are involved in protein interactions. These domains suggest that CNKSR3 can still participate in scaffolding functions despite the absence of SH3 and PH domains (Ziera2009Cnksr3).
