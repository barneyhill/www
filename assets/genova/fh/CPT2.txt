# CPT2

## Overview
Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) is a gene that encodes the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, a crucial component of the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a transferase and is located on the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a vital role in the conversion of acyl-carnitines into acyl-CoAs, facilitating the β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) (BONNEFONT2004Carnitine; Violante2013Carnitine). The CPT2 gene is essential for energy production, particularly in tissues with high metabolic demands such as the heart, liver, and skeletal muscle. Mutations in the CPT2 gene can lead to carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency, a metabolic disorder with varying clinical manifestations, including myopathic, hepatocardiomuscular, and neonatal forms (Zach2019Unrecognized; Musumeci2007Identification). The enzyme's activity is influenced by its interactions with other mitochondrial components, such as cardiolipin, which are critical for its stability and function (Meinhardt2021Cardiolipin).

## Structure
The carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that facilitates its role in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The primary structure of CPT2 includes a unique sequence insertion of amino acids 179-208, which is not found in other carnitine acyltransferases and is hypothesized to serve as a membrane anchor (Rufer2009Structural). The secondary structure of CPT2 consists of 27 alpha helices and 18 beta strands, organized into amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains. Each domain contains a six-stranded, central antiparallel beta sheet surrounded by alpha helices (Rufer2006The).

The tertiary structure features a unique 30 amino acid insert in the amino-terminal domain, forming antiparallel helices that protrude from the domain and are involved in membrane association (Rufer2006The). The quaternary structure of CPT2 is generally monomeric, although it can form oligomers under certain conditions, influenced by the type and concentration of detergents used during purification (Rufer2009Structural).

CPT2 shares structural similarities with other carnitine acyltransferases, such as carnitine acetyltransferase and carnitine octanoyltransferase, but has distinct features that contribute to its specific function and regulation (Rufer2009Structural). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence its catalytic activity and interactions (Rufer2009Structural).

## Function
Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) is an enzyme located on the inner mitochondrial membrane, playing a crucial role in the transport and oxidation of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) within mitochondria. It facilitates the conversion of acyl-carnitines into acyl-CoAs, which are essential substrates for mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation (mFAO), a key energy production process in tissues such as the heart, liver, and skeletal muscle (BONNEFONT2004Carnitine; Violante2013Carnitine). This conversion is vital for the breakdown of fatty acids and subsequent ATP production, especially during periods of fasting or increased energy demand (BONNEFONT2004Carnitine).

CPT2 is part of the carnitine shuttle system, which includes carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT). CPT1 converts activated acyl units into acylcarnitines, which are transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane by CACT. CPT2 then converts these acylcarnitines back into acyl-CoAs, enabling their entry into the β-oxidation pathway (Violante2013Carnitine). This process is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis and is particularly important in tissues that rely heavily on fatty acid oxidation (BONNEFONT2004Carnitine). CPT2's activity is crucial for normal metabolic function, and its deficiency can lead to metabolic disorders characterized by impaired fatty acid oxidation (BONNEFONT2004Carnitine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CPT2 gene lead to carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) deficiency, a disorder affecting the mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. This deficiency manifests in three clinical phenotypes: a mild adult myopathic form, a severe infantile hepatocardiomuscular form, and a lethal neonatal form. The adult form is characterized by recurrent episodes of muscle pain, weakness, rhabdomyolysis, and myoglobinuria, often triggered by exercise or fasting (Zach2019Unrecognized; Musumeci2007Identification). The infantile form presents with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, liver failure, cardiomyopathy, and peripheral myopathy, posing significant health risks (Isackson2006Identification; Thuillier2003Correlation). The neonatal form is the most severe, often resulting in early death due to symptoms like dysmorphic features and renal dysplasia (Isackson2006Identification; Thuillier2003Correlation).

Specific mutations, such as p.Ser113Leu, are common in the adult form and are associated with mild phenotypes, while others like p.Pro504Leu are linked to severe infantile presentations (Isackson2008CPT2; Joshi2020Muscle). The severity of the disease correlates with the residual activity of the CPT II enzyme, with lower activity observed in more severe forms (BONNEFONT2004Carnitine).

## Interactions
Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. CPT2 interacts with carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) on the inner mitochondrial membrane. This interaction is hypothesized to facilitate the channeling of acylcarnitine substrates from CACT into CPT2, creating a microenvironment for efficient substrate transport (Rufer2006The; Rufer2009Structural). The interaction is supported by the charge distribution on CPT2's surface, which is suited for interaction with cardiolipin, a lipid required for CACT activity (Rufer2006The).

CPT2 is also associated with the mitochondrial membrane through its interaction with cardiolipin. Cardiolipin stabilizes CPT2 and enhances its catalytic efficiency, particularly in the presence of L-carnitine. This interaction is crucial for CPT2's stability and function, as evidenced by structural and computer-based analyses (Meinhardt2021Cardiolipin). Variants of CPT2, such as P50H, show altered interaction patterns with cardiolipin, which may affect membrane association and enzyme stability (Meinhardt2021Cardiolipin). These interactions highlight the importance of the lipid environment in CPT2's activity and its role in energy metabolism.
