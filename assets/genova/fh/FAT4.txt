# FAT4

## Overview
FAT4 is a gene that encodes the protein FAT atypical cadherin 4, a member of the cadherin superfamily known for its role in cell adhesion and signaling. The FAT4 protein is characterized by a large extracellular domain with multiple cadherin repeats, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail, which collectively facilitate its function in maintaining planar cell polarity (PCP) and regulating cell proliferation through the Hippo signaling pathway (Katoh2006Comparative; Medina2023Structure). As an atypical cadherin, FAT4 is involved in crucial cellular processes, including mechanotransduction in lymphatic endothelial cells and the maintenance of apicobasal polarity in epithelial tissues (KATOH2012Function; Betterman2020Atypical). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in various cancers and chronic diseases, where mutations and alterations can disrupt normal cellular functions and contribute to disease pathogenesis (Zhang2016History; Huang2019Targeted).

## Structure
The FAT4 protein is a member of the cadherin superfamily, characterized by a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domain of FAT4 contains 34 cadherin repeats, two Laminin G (LamG) domains, and three EGF domains, which are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and signaling (Katoh2006Comparative). The protein's structure allows it to form heterophilic interactions with Dachsous1 (Dchs1), contributing to planar cell polarity (PCP) regulation (Medina2023Structure).

The interaction between FAT4 and Dchs1 is facilitated by an extended interface along the extracellular cadherin (EC) domains 1-4, characterized by a high affinity due to an extensive network of salt bridges (Medina2023Structure). The FAT4-Dchs1 complex exhibits a head-to-tail arrangement, with specific domains adopting typical cadherin folds and resolving calcium ions at interdomain transitions (Medina2023Structure).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence FAT4's interactions, although human FAT4 is not efficiently phosphorylated by the Four-jointed homologs, unlike its Drosophila counterparts (Medina2023Structure). The cytoplasmic region of FAT4 contains novel motifs, VCSVxPxLP and SDYxS, which are conserved among FAT family members (Katoh2006Comparative).

## Function
The FAT4 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the atypical cadherin family, playing a crucial role in maintaining planar cell polarity (PCP) and regulating cell proliferation through the Hippo signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, FAT4 is involved in maintaining apicobasal polarity in epithelial tissues by interacting with Dachsous1 at cell-cell boundaries. This interaction is essential for the proper orientation and function of cells within tissues (KATOH2012Function; Medina2023Structure).

FAT4 is also critical in lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) polarity, particularly in response to mechanical stimuli such as laminar shear stress. It coordinates LEC polarity, which is vital for the development and function of lymphatic vessels. In FAT4-deficient cells, there is a failure to elongate in the direction of flow, indicating its role in mechanotransduction (Betterman2020Atypical).

The protein's intracellular region interacts with the Mpdz/Mupp1-Mpp5/Pals1 complex, which is important for maintaining cell polarity and inhibiting YAP1-mediated cell proliferation. This function is crucial for preventing uncontrolled cell growth and maintaining tissue architecture (KATOH2012Function). FAT4's role in these processes underscores its importance in normal cellular and tissue function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FAT4 gene have been implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In cancer, FAT4 is frequently mutated in several types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), breast cancer, gastric cancer, and esophageal cancer. In HCC, particularly those associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV), non-synonymous mutations in FAT4 are common and are believed to contribute to carcinogenesis by affecting protein function and expression levels (Huang2019Targeted). In breast cancer, FAT4 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its expression is often lost due to promoter methylation, leading to increased tumorigenicity (Qi2008Identification). In esophageal cancer, certain polymorphisms in FAT4 are associated with altered cancer risk, with some variants providing a protective effect (Du2013Nonsynonymous).

FAT4 mutations are also linked to disrupted cell adhesion and signaling, contributing to increased cell migration and invasion, as observed in gastric cancer (Zhang2016History). Beyond cancer, FAT4 is involved in chronic diseases like coronary artery disease, where it influences miR720 expression and planar cell polarity signaling (Zhang2016History). These findings underscore the clinical significance of FAT4 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
FAT4, a member of the cadherin superfamily, engages in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It forms heterophilic interactions with Dachsous1 (Dchs1) at cell-cell boundaries, which are essential for maintaining planar cell polarity (PCP) and tissue organization. This interaction is characterized by a high affinity due to an extensive network of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, particularly involving the extracellular cadherin (EC) domains 1-4 of both proteins (Medina2023Structure). 

FAT4 also interacts with the Mpdz/Mupp1-Mpp5/Pals1 complex, which is crucial for maintaining apicobasal polarity in epithelial tissues (KATOH2012Function). This interaction is significant for FAT4's role in inhibiting YAP1-mediated cell proliferation and maintaining PCP (KATOH2012Function). 

In lymphatic endothelial cells, FAT4 is involved in mechanotransduction, interacting with VEGFR3 to transduce flow-induced signals, which is vital for maintaining cell polarity and proper lymphatic vessel function (Betterman2020Atypical). These interactions highlight FAT4's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and structural organization.
