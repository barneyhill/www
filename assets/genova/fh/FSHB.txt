# FSHB

## Overview
The FSHB gene encodes the beta subunit of the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a critical glycoprotein hormone involved in the regulation of reproductive processes in humans. This gene is located on chromosome 11 and is responsible for the synthesis of the beta subunit, which, in combination with a common alpha subunit, forms the biologically active FSH heterodimer. The FSHB-encoded protein is characterized by a cystine-knot motif, a structural feature common among growth factors, which is essential for its stability and function (Fox2001ThreeDimensional). The FSH hormone plays a pivotal role in the development and function of the gonads, influencing processes such as ovarian follicle maturation in females and spermatogenesis in males (Bernard2010Mechanisms). Variations in the FSHB gene have been linked to reproductive disorders, highlighting its significance in fertility and endocrine health (Nagirnaja2010Genomics; Trevisan2019Effects).

## Structure
The FSHB gene encodes the beta subunit of the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a glycoprotein crucial for reproductive processes. The primary structure of the FSHB protein consists of 111 amino acids, characterized by a conserved sequence that forms a 'seatbelt' structure, essential for its function (Zhao2010Cloning; Nagirnaja2010Genomics). The secondary structure includes specific conformational features, such as β-hairpins stabilized by disulfide bonds extending from a cystine knot, which is a common motif in cystine-knot growth factors (Fox2001ThreeDimensional).

The tertiary structure of FSHB involves the folding of its subunits into a compact form, with the β-subunit's C-terminal loop wrapping around the α-subunit, forming a 'seat belt' loop (Fox2001ThreeDimensional). In terms of quaternary structure, FSHB associates with the alpha subunit to form a heterodimer, which is crucial for its biological activity (Fox2001ThreeDimensional).

Post-translational modifications, particularly N-linked glycosylation, are vital for the stability and function of the FSHB protein. Glycosylation at specific asparagine residues is crucial for proper assembly and secretion of the FSH dimer, affecting its biological activity (Wang2016A). These modifications are essential for the protein's structural integrity and receptor binding capabilities.

## Function
The FSHB gene encodes the beta subunit of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a glycoprotein hormone crucial for reproductive processes in humans. FSH is synthesized and secreted by gonadotrope cells in the anterior pituitary gland and functions as a dimeric glycoprotein consisting of a common alpha subunit and a unique beta subunit, the latter conferring biological specificity (Bernard2010Mechanisms). The beta subunit, encoded by FSHB, dictates the binding specificity to the FSH receptor, which is essential for the hormone's function (Grigorova2006Haplotype).

In females, FSH is responsible for the proliferation and survival of follicular somatic cells and the recruitment of ovarian follicles into development, leading to ovulation (Grigorova2006Haplotype). It stimulates ovarian follicle growth, maturation, and estrogen synthesis by granulosa cells (Bernard2010Mechanisms). In males, FSH is essential for Sertoli cell proliferation and the maintenance of sperm quality in the testes (Grigorova2006Haplotype). It regulates spermatogenesis by targeting Sertoli cells in the testes (Bernard2010Mechanisms).

The FSHB subunit undergoes N-glycosylation, which is critical for the proper assembly, secretion, and function of the hormone. This process ensures the efficient formation of the FSH dimer and its stability in circulation (Kumar2018Fshb). The presence of N-glycans on the FSHB subunit is vital for the hormone's biological activity, including its role in testis development, sperm production, and ovarian function (Kumar2018Fshb).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the FSHB gene, which encodes the beta subunit of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), are associated with several reproductive disorders. Inactivating mutations in FSHB can lead to infertility in both sexes, with females experiencing primary amenorrhea and males showing azoospermia and hypogonadism due to isolated FSH deficiency (Nagirnaja2010Genomics; Trevisan2019Effects). 

A specific polymorphism, the FSHB -211 G>T variant, significantly affects reproductive endocrinology. In men, the T-allele is linked to lower serum FSH levels, reduced testicular volume, and increased risk of idiopathic infertility (Rull2018FSHB; Grigorova2011Genetically). In women, this variant is associated with increased serum gonadotropin levels, longer menstrual cycles, later menopause, and a higher risk of idiopathic infertility (Ruth2016Genetic; Rull2018FSHB). 

The FSHB gene is also implicated in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), with certain genetic variants linked to altered FSH levels and an increased LH/FSH ratio, which are characteristic of some PCOS patients (Bohaczuk2020FSHB). These genetic variations highlight the critical role of FSHB in maintaining normal reproductive function and its potential impact on fertility-related conditions.

## Interactions
The FSHB gene encodes the beta subunit of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which interacts with the alpha subunit to form the active FSH hormone. This hormone plays a crucial role in reproductive processes by binding to the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) on target cells. The interaction between FSH and FSHR is characterized by a 'handclasp' manner, where the hormone binds to the receptor's ectodomain, primarily through electrostatic attractions and aromatic stacking interactions (Jiang2014Structural; Fan2005Structure).

The specificity of the FSH-FSHR interaction is mediated by both the alpha and beta subunits of FSH, with key interactions involving specific residues such as K179 of FSHR, which forms a channel on the molecular surface of FSH. This channel is crucial for the selectivity of FSH binding, preventing other hormones like CG/LH from binding to FSHR (Fan2005Structure). The interaction also induces conformational changes in FSH, particularly in the C terminus of the FSH-alpha subunit, which undergoes a substantial rotation upon binding to the receptor (Fan2005Structure). These interactions and conformational changes are essential for the specificity and function of FSH in activating its receptor.
