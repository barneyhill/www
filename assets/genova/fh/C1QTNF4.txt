# C1QTNF4

## Overview
C1QTNF4 is a gene that encodes the protein C1q and TNF related 4, also known as CTRP4, which is a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family. This protein is characterized by its unique structure, comprising two tandem C1q-like domains, and is involved in various cellular processes, including immune response modulation and inflammation regulation. C1q and TNF related 4 functions as a regulatory protein, influencing pathways such as NF-κB and STAT3, which are critical in inflammatory and metabolic processes. The protein interacts with nucleolin, serving as its cell surface receptor, and is implicated in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and cancer-related inflammation, highlighting its clinical significance in immune modulation and disease pathogenesis (Vester2021Nucleolin; Pakzad2020C1QTNF4; Li2011Identification).

## Structure
The C1QTNF4 protein is a unique member of the C1QTNF family, characterized by its two tandem C1q-like domains connected by a short linker, without a collagen-like region (Vester2021Nucleolin; Tom2005The). The primary structure of C1QTNF4 consists of amino acid sequences forming these domains, which are crucial for its function and interaction with receptors (Vester2021Nucleolin).

The secondary structure includes the typical features of C1q domains, such as beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function (Ghai2007C1q). The tertiary structure of C1QTNF4 involves the folding of these domains into a three-dimensional conformation that facilitates receptor binding and oligomerization (Vester2021Nucleolin).

In terms of quaternary structure, C1QTNF4 can form various oligomeric states, including monomers, trimers, hexamers, and potentially higher-molecular-weight species. This oligomerization is primarily driven by the second C1q-like domain, which is responsible for receptor binding and interaction with nucleolin (Vester2021Nucleolin). The protein's ability to oligomerize is essential for its role in immune modulation and interaction with cell surface receptors (Vester2021Nucleolin).

## Function
C1QTNF4, also known as CTRP4, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of inflammatory pathways. The protein is part of the C1q/TNF-related protein family, which is implicated in immune response modulation, inflammation, and metabolic regulation. C1QTNF4 is known to activate the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway and up-regulate the production of interleukin (IL)6, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, contributing to its role as a tumor-promoting regulator of inflammation (Pakzad2020C1QTNF4).

In the context of energy homeostasis, C1QTNF4 has been shown to influence food intake and energy balance through the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. Overexpression of C1QTNF4 in the hypothalamus of mice leads to decreased food intake and modulation of neuropeptides, suggesting a potential role in regulating energy balance in humans as well (Li2020C1qTNFrelated).

C1QTNF4 also plays a role in modulating inflammation and leptin sensitivity, particularly in the context of diet-induced obesity. It can inhibit NF-κB signaling and reduce microglial activation, which are associated with improved leptin signaling and reduced hypothalamic inflammation (Ye2021C1qTNFrelated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the C1QTNF4 gene have been associated with several diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A specific mutation, p.His198Gln, has been identified in SLE patients and is thought to inhibit some TNF-mediated cellular responses, such as NF-κB activation and TNF-induced apoptosis, potentially contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Pakzad2020C1QTNF4; Pullabhatla2017Dea). This mutation may also affect the interaction between C1QTNF4 and its receptor, nucleolin, which could play a role in the development of SLE (Vester2021Nucleolin).

C1QTNF4 is also implicated in cancer-related inflammation. It can activate the NF-κB and IL6/STAT3 pathways, which are crucial for tumor cell survival and resistance to apoptosis. Overexpression of C1QTNF4 in cancer cells has been shown to enhance these pathways, suggesting its role as a tumor-promoting inflammatory regulator (Li2011Identification).

Alterations in C1QTNF4 expression levels have been linked to inflammatory pathways, potentially affecting immune modulation and contributing to autoimmune conditions. The gene's expression is higher in males, which may be relevant for diseases like SLE that exhibit a female-biased prevalence (Vester2021Nucleolin).

## Interactions
C1QTNF4, also known as CTRP4, interacts with nucleolin, which acts as its cell surface receptor. This interaction is mediated by the second C1q-like domain of C1QTNF4 and the C terminus of nucleolin. The binding is confirmed through in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that domain 2 of C1QTNF4 and the R4G region of nucleolin are involved in this interaction (Vester2021Nucleolin). C1QTNF4 is found in various oligomeric forms, such as trimeric and hexameric, which bind similarly well to nucleolin, although monomeric forms show reduced binding (Vester2021Nucleolin).

C1QTNF4 also competes with lactoferrin for binding to nucleolin, indicating a shared binding site, while lipopolysaccharide (LPS) does not compete, suggesting a different binding interface (Vester2021Nucleolin). The interaction with nucleolin is part of a multiprotein signaling complex that includes annexin A2, calreticulin, and TLR4 on endothelial cells, and heat shock proteins, TLR2, and TLR4 on THP-1 cells (Vester2021Nucleolin). This complex suggests a role for C1QTNF4 in modulating innate immunity, potentially in an anti-inflammatory capacity (Vester2021Nucleolin).
