# UBAP1L

## Overview
The UBAP1L gene encodes the ubiquitin associated protein 1 like, which is a protein involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation and signal transduction. This protein is characterized by its ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which facilitates interactions with ubiquitinated proteins, suggesting a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The precise biological functions of UBAP1L remain under investigation, but it is believed to be involved in cellular homeostasis and may have implications in certain pathological conditions. Research into UBAP1L and its encoded protein continues to uncover its potential roles in cellular mechanisms and disease pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
