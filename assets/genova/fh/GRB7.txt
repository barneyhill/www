# GRB7

## Overview
The GRB7 gene encodes the growth factor receptor-bound protein 7 (Grb7), an adaptor protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways. Grb7 is characterized by its multidomain structure, including a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, which is crucial for its interactions with phosphorylated tyrosine residues on target proteins. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, such as cell migration, proliferation, and signal transduction, by interacting with receptor tyrosine kinases and other signaling molecules (Holt2005Adapter; Porter2005Grb7SH2). Grb7's function is particularly significant in the context of cancer, where its overexpression and interactions with proteins like ErbB2 are linked to tumor progression and metastasis (Chu2019Grb7; Bai2007GRB7). The protein's ability to form dimers and undergo post-translational modifications further modulates its activity and specificity in signaling pathways (Bradford2019Characterization; Peterson2012Dimerization).

## Structure
The GRB7 protein is an adaptor protein characterized by a conserved multidomain structure. It includes an N-terminal proline-rich region, a Ras-associating-like (RA) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a BPS (between pleckstrin and src) domain, and a C-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain (Daly1998The; Godamudunage2017Grb7). The SH2 domain is crucial for binding phosphorylated tyrosine residues on target proteins, such as the ErbB2 receptor, which is significant in breast cancer (Porter2005Grb7SH2). The SH2 domain of GRB7 is unique in that it forms a homodimer, which is unusual for SH2 domains, and this dimerization is thought to contribute to binding specificity (Porter2007Grb7; Porter2005Grb7SH2).

The GRB7 protein can exist in multimeric forms, primarily as dimers, and its dimerization is influenced by the phosphorylation state of its SH2 domain (Bradford2019Characterization; Peterson2012Dimerization). The RA and PH domains are capable of oligomerization, although the exact role of this oligomerization in GRB7 function is not fully understood (Godamudunage2017Grb7). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including tyrosine phosphorylation, which affects its function and interactions (Peterson2012Dimerization). Alternative splicing results in different isoforms, such as hGrb10β, which has a 55 amino acid extension at the N terminus and a 46 amino acid deletion affecting the PH domain (Daly1998The).

## Function
The GRB7 gene encodes the Grb7 protein, an adaptor protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, Grb7 plays a crucial role in regulating cell migration, a process essential for wound healing and immune responses. It achieves this by targeting focal contacts and interacting with specific phosphoinositides, which facilitates its phosphorylation by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (Holt2005Adapter). The Grb7 protein contains several domains, including the SH2 domain, which is vital for protein-protein interactions and subcellular localization, enhancing cell motility (Holt2005Adapter).

Grb7 is also involved in Ras-mediated signaling through its RA domain, which associates with active forms of Ras GTPases, indicating its role in signal transduction processes (Holt2005Adapter). The PH domain of Grb7 binds to specific phosphoinositides, leading to conformational changes that allow phosphorylation by FAK, further promoting cell migration (Holt2005Adapter). Additionally, Grb7 interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and is implicated in processes like cell proliferation and apoptosis (LucasFernandez2008Genomic). These interactions highlight Grb7's role in modulating signaling pathways critical for cellular functions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GRB7 gene are significantly associated with various cancers, including breast, ovarian, esophageal, and gastric cancers. In breast cancer, GRB7 is often co-amplified with HER-2/Neu, leading to enhanced HER-2/Neu-mediated signal transduction and tumor formation. This co-amplification is linked to increased phosphorylation of HER-2/Neu and AKT, contributing to aggressive tumor behavior (Bai2007GRB7). In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), high GRB7 expression is associated with increased risk of recurrence and poor prognosis. Inhibition of GRB7 in TNBC cell lines reduces cell motility, invasion, and promotes apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Giricz2011GRB7).

In ovarian cancer, GRB7 and its variant GRB7v are frequently upregulated, correlating with high-grade tumors characterized by increased cell proliferation and metastasis. GRB7 primarily promotes cell migration and invasion, while GRB7v enhances cell proliferation through ERK signaling (Wang2010Differential). GRB7's role in cancer is further emphasized by its involvement in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which is critical for cell proliferation and survival in many cancers (Chen2018Methylationassociated).

## Interactions
GRB7 is an adaptor protein that participates in various physical interactions crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in cancer development. It interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases such as erbB2, EGFR, and other ERBB family members, facilitating signal transduction that influences cell migration and proliferation (Chu2019Grb7; Holt2005Adapter). The SH2 domain of GRB7 is essential for binding to phosphotyrosine residues on these receptors, as well as on non-receptor tyrosine kinases like FAK, which phosphorylates GRB7 and promotes cell migration (Han1999Association; Shen2002Association).

GRB7 also interacts with the transcriptional regulator FHL2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, with the RA and PH domains of GRB7 being sufficient for this interaction (Siamakpour‐Reihani2008The). Additionally, GRB7 binds to phosphoinositides through its PH domain, which is crucial for its role in cell migration (Shen2002Association). The protein also forms complexes with other proteins such as HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) and Filamin-A, which are involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and stress granule formation (Chu2019Grb7). These interactions highlight GRB7's multifaceted role in cellular processes related to cancer progression.
