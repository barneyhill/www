# DMBT1

## Overview
DMBT1, or Deleted in Malignant Brain Tumors 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional glycoprotein belonging to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily. The protein, also known as gp340 or SALSA, is characterized by its multiple SRCR domains, which facilitate its role in immune defense, epithelial homeostasis, and tumor suppression. DMBT1 is primarily expressed in epithelial cells on mucosal surfaces, where it functions as a pattern recognition receptor, binding to a variety of pathogens and contributing to host-microbe interactions. The protein's involvement in immune regulation and its potential tumor suppressor role have been highlighted in various studies, linking alterations in the DMBT1 gene to diseases such as cancer and inflammatory conditions (Diegelmann2013Intestinal; Alharbi2021Maintenance; Ligtenberg2010Deleted).

## Structure
The DMBT1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily, characterized by multiple SRCR domains. These domains are crucial for binding a wide range of pathogens and are highly conserved, featuring specific disulfide bonds formed by eight cysteine residues (Holmskov1999Cloning; Ligtenberg2010Deleted). The protein structure includes 13 SRCR domains, followed by two CUB domains, a 14th SRCR domain, and a zona pellucida (ZP) domain at the C-terminal end (Reichhardt2020Structures; Ligtenberg2010Deleted). The SRCR domains are arranged like 'pearls on a string' and are separated by SRCR-interspersed domains (SIDs), which contain glycosylation sites (Reichhardt2020Structures).

The DMBT1 protein undergoes extensive glycosylation, with up to 14 potential N-linked glycosylation sites and numerous O-linked sites, primarily in the SIDs (Ligtenberg2010Deleted). This glycosylation contributes significantly to the protein's molecular weight and functional diversity. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, resulting in variants with different numbers of SRCR domains (SCHULZ2002Identification; Reichhardt2020Structures). These structural features enable DMBT1 to function in innate immunity, epithelial homeostasis, and tumor suppression.

## Function
The DMBT1 gene encodes a glycoprotein that is part of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily, playing a significant role in immune defense, cellular differentiation, and tissue regeneration. In healthy human cells, DMBT1 is involved in host-microbe interactions by binding to a wide variety of pathogens through its SRCR domains, which are crucial for its function in pathogen recognition and clearance (Alharbi2021Maintenance). The protein is expressed in epithelial cells on mucosal surfaces, such as the lungs, gut, and oral mucosa, where it contributes to maintaining epithelial integrity and mucosal homeostasis (Diegelmann2013Intestinal; Madsen2013A).

DMBT1 functions as a pattern recognition receptor, aggregating bacteria and inhibiting bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells, which is essential for antibacterial host defense (Diegelmann2013Intestinal). It also plays a role in the regulation of inflammatory responses, as its expression is upregulated by proinflammatory stimuli, suggesting its involvement in conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (Diegelmann2013Intestinal). Additionally, DMBT1 is implicated in angiogenesis, influencing the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in lung epithelial cells, which is important for transitioning from inflammation to tissue regeneration (Müller2015Deleted).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DMBT1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and inflammatory conditions. In breast cancer, specific polymorphisms in the DMBT1 gene, such as rs2981745 and rs11523871, have been associated with increased risk. These polymorphisms are linked to decreased promoter activity and lower expression levels of DMBT1, which may contribute to breast cancer susceptibility (Tchatchou2010Identification). The gene's expression is often down-regulated in breast carcinomas compared to normal tissue, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Braidotti2004DMBT1).

In the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, DMBT1 variants like rs2981745 and rs2981804 have been associated with disease susceptibility and severity. These variants may affect the expression of DMBT1 and its interaction with transcription factors involved in inflammatory responses, potentially influencing the progression of IBD (GlapaNowak2021Genetic; Diegelmann2013Intestinal).

DMBT1 is also involved in immune regulation and has been linked to immune-related diseases such as asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus, highlighting its role in the tumor microenvironment and immune processes (Gan2021Significance).

## Interactions
The DMBT1 protein, also known as gp340 or SALSA, is involved in a variety of interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in immune defense mechanisms. It binds specifically to collectin proteins such as surfactant protein A (SP-A) and surfactant protein D (SP-D), which are crucial components of the mucosal immune defense system, suggesting a role for DMBT1 in innate immunity (Madsen2013A). DMBT1 also interacts with dimeric trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) in a calcium-dependent manner, but not with monomeric TFF3 or TFF2, indicating a specific interaction that may be relevant in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (Madsen2013A).

In addition to these interactions, DMBT1 acts as a pattern recognition receptor, binding to various microorganisms, including Helicobacter pylori, several strains of streptococcus, and viruses such as HIV-1 and influenza A (Madsen2013A). The protein also interacts with components of the complement system, such as mannose-binding lectin (MBL), ficolins, and C1q, modulating the lectin pathway of complement activation (Reichhardt2012The). These interactions highlight the multifunctional role of DMBT1 in immune defense and epithelial development.
