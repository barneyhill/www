# AK4

## Overview
Adenylate kinase 4 (AK4) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein involved in cellular energy homeostasis and stress response. The protein, also named adenylate kinase 4, belongs to the adenylate kinase family, which is known for catalyzing the reversible transfer of phosphate groups among adenine nucleotides. However, AK4 is unique within this family due to its lack of enzymatic activity in vitro, attributed to a specific amino acid substitution that impairs its catalytic function (Liu2009Enzymatically). Despite this, AK4 plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function by interacting with other mitochondrial proteins, such as the ADP/ATP translocase, to regulate nucleotide balance and support cellular survival under stress conditions (Panayiotou2010Evidence; Liu2009Enzymatically). AK4 is predominantly expressed in tissues with high energy demands and is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and pulmonary hypertension, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and prognosis (Jan2012Adenylate; Wujak2021Adenylate).

## Structure
Adenylate kinase 4 (AK4) is a mitochondrial protein with a structure that includes a central CORE domain and two flanking domains: the LID and NMP bind domains. The CORE domain is structurally conserved across adenylate kinases, while the NMP bind domain is responsible for nucleotide monophosphate binding and maintains a similar orientation to native AK4 (Liu2009Crystal). The LID domain in AK4, particularly in the L171P mutant, directly contacts the CORE and NMP bind domains, resulting in a compact, closed conformation without substrate binding, which is distinct from other known closed forms of adenylate kinases (Liu2009Crystal).

AK4 is characterized by its lack of enzymatic activity in vitro, attributed to the replacement of a key arginine residue with glutamine (Gln159), which compromises its ability to catalyze phosphoryl group transfer (Liu2009Enzymatically). The protein can adopt 'open' and 'closed' conformations in the absence and presence of substrate analogs, respectively (Liu2009Enzymatically). AK4's structure suggests it may function through interactions with other mitochondrial proteins, such as the ADP/ATP translocase, rather than through catalytic activity (Liu2009Enzymatically).

## Function
Adenylate kinase 4 (AK4) is a mitochondrial protein involved in cellular energy homeostasis and stress response. Despite being enzymatically inactive in vitro, AK4 retains the ability to bind nucleotides and interacts with the mitochondrial ADP/ATP translocase (ANT), which is crucial for maintaining ADP/ATP balance in mitochondria (Liu2009Enzymatically). AK4 is localized in the mitochondrial matrix and is primarily expressed in tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain, heart, kidney, and liver (Panayiotou2010Evidence; Panayiotou2014The).

AK4 plays a role in promoting cell survival and proliferation, particularly under stress conditions like hypoxia and oxidative stress. Its expression increases in response to these stressors, providing protective benefits to cells (Dzeja2009Adenylate; Liu2009Enzymatically). Knockdown of AK4 results in increased cell death and decreased proliferation, while overexpression enhances cell survival (Liu2009Enzymatically). AK4's interaction with ANT and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) suggests it may influence mitochondrial membrane permeability and energy balance, contributing to its role in stress response and cellular energy regulation (Liu2009Enzymatically).

## Clinical Significance
Adenylate kinase 4 (AK4) has been implicated in various diseases, primarily due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In lung cancer, AK4 is significantly upregulated, correlating with advanced disease stages, poor prognosis, and increased metastasis. It downregulates the transcription factor ATF3, which is associated with the invasive phenotype of lung cancer cells. High AK4 expression is linked to reduced overall and disease-free survival, making it a marker of poor clinical outcomes (Jan2012Adenylate).

In breast cancer, AK4 contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Its expression is regulated by the m6A writer protein METTL3, and elevated AK4 levels are associated with increased resistance to tamoxifen. This resistance is linked to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and p38 kinase activation, which suppress mitochondrial apoptosis (Liu2020Adenylate).

AK4 also plays a role in pulmonary hypertension (PH), where it is upregulated in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells under hypoxic conditions. This upregulation is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and contributes to cell proliferation and glycolytic metabolism, which are characteristic of PH (Wujak2021Adenylate).

In pancreatic cancer, AK4 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is involved in the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells, regulated by TRIM29 and DDX3X (Hao2021TRIM29).

## Interactions
Adenylate kinase 4 (AK4) is known to interact with several mitochondrial proteins, playing a significant role in cellular energy homeostasis. AK4 forms complexes with hexokinase 2 (HK2), voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), and adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) to enhance ADP recycling, which is crucial for ATP production (Fujisawa2016Modulation). AK4 also interacts with ANT in the context of oxidative stress, where it modulates ANT function to suppress cytochrome c release, thereby providing protective benefits to cells (Liu2009Enzymatically). 

AK4's interaction with ANT is further supported by its ability to bind nucleotides, despite being enzymatically inactive in vitro. This interaction is crucial for maintaining ADP/ATP homeostasis in mitochondria (Liu2009Enzymatically). AK4 also interacts with the mitochondrial permeability-transition pore complex, which includes ANT and VDAC, suggesting its role in modulating mitochondrial membrane permeability (Panayiotou2014The). 

In the context of cancer, AK4 is involved in stabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma. This interaction is part of a positive feedback loop where AK4 enhances intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, stabilizing HIF-1α (Jan2019Adenylate).
