# SLC39A13

## Overview
The SLC39A13 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 39 member 13, commonly referred to as ZIP13, which is a member of the zinc transporter family. ZIP13 is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus and plays a critical role in the intracellular transport of zinc, facilitating its movement from the Golgi to the cytoplasm. This transmembrane protein is essential for maintaining zinc homeostasis, which is vital for various cellular processes, including the activation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways. These pathways are crucial for the development and maintenance of connective tissues, influencing processes such as collagen production and myogenic differentiation (Shoji2024Possible; Fukada2008The). Mutations in SLC39A13 are linked to spondylocheiro dysplastic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in connective tissue disorders (Dusanic2018Novel).

## Function
The SLC39A13 gene encodes the zinc transporter ZIP13, which plays a crucial role in maintaining zinc homeostasis within cells. ZIP13 is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus and is involved in the intracellular transport of zinc, facilitating its movement from the Golgi to the cytoplasm. This transport is essential for various cellular processes, including the activation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways, which are critical for the development and maintenance of connective tissues (Fukada2008The).

ZIP13 influences the nuclear translocation of Smad proteins, which are phosphorylated downstream of BMP or TGF-β receptor complexes. These proteins contain a zinc-binding motif necessary for DNA binding, highlighting the importance of zinc transport in gene expression regulation (Fukada2008The). In healthy cells, ZIP13 is also involved in myogenic differentiation, with its expression being upregulated during myogenic stimulation. This suggests a role in the early differentiation of muscle cells (Shoji2024Possible).

ZIP13's function extends to the regulation of collagen production, impacting skin integrity and bone metabolism. Its activity is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of connective tissues, influencing organismal outcomes such as bone and skin health (Bin2018The; Fukada2008The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC39A13 gene are associated with spondylocheiro dysplastic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (SCD-EDS), a subtype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome characterized by connective tissue abnormalities. This condition is marked by features such as short stature, skeletal deformities, skin hyperextensibility, and joint hypermobility (Dusanic2018Novel; Kumps2020The). The SLC39A13 gene encodes a zinc transporter protein, and mutations can lead to disruptions in zinc homeostasis, affecting processes like collagen hydroxylation, which is crucial for connective tissue integrity (Dusanic2018Novel).

Specific mutations, such as the homozygous nonsense mutation c.830G>A, p.W277*, result in premature termination of the protein, leading to a loss of function and contributing to the clinical manifestations of SCD-EDS (Dusanic2018Novel). The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and has been reported in a limited number of families worldwide (Dusanic2018Novel).

Patients with SCD-EDS often exhibit a reduced ratio of pyridinoline to deoxypyridinoline in urine, indicating a deficiency in hydroxylated collagen crosslinks, which serves as a diagnostic marker for the condition (Kumps2020The). The clinical presentation can include muscular hypotonia, particularly in early childhood, and distinct facial features (Kumps2020The).

## Interactions
The SLC39A13 gene encodes a zinc transporter protein, ZIP13, which is involved in various interactions within cellular processes. ZIP13 is known to participate in the BMP/TGF-β signaling pathways, which are crucial for connective tissue development. It affects the nuclear localization of phosphorylated Smad proteins, suggesting potential interactions with these proteins, which are key mediators in the signaling pathway (Fukada2008The). The protein's role in zinc transport is essential for the proper functioning of zinc-binding proteins and the nuclear translocation of zinc itself, impacting the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of Smad proteins (Fukada2008The).

ZIP13 has been shown to transport both zinc and iron ions, similar to other ZIP family members like ZIP8 and ZIP14. This dual transport capability suggests interactions with proteins involved in metal ion transport and metabolism (Fukunaka2024ZIP13). The SLC39A13 protein is also implicated in the regulation of type 1 collagen and Smad7 expression in response to TGF-β stimulation, indicating interactions with transcription factors or their regulatory pathways (Fukada2008The). Despite these functional interactions, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available literature.
