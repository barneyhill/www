# IL20RB

## Overview
The IL20RB gene encodes the interleukin 20 receptor subunit beta, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by forming part of receptor complexes for cytokines such as IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24. These cytokines belong to the IL-10 family and are integral to immune regulation, tissue homeostasis, and host defense mechanisms (Chen2018IL20). The protein encoded by IL20RB forms heterodimers with other receptor subunits like IL-20RA or IL-22RA1, facilitating signaling pathways that modulate immune responses and inflammation (Beute2022The). IL20RB is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells, including keratinocytes, where it contributes to skin homeostasis and barrier function, as well as in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, influencing their migration and function (Bech2016Interleukin). Its involvement in various signaling pathways underscores its significance in maintaining tissue integrity and modulating immune responses, with implications in cancer progression and inflammatory diseases (He2022IL20RB; Li2023IL20RB).

## Structure


## Function
The IL20RB gene encodes the interleukin 20 receptor subunit beta, which is a critical component of receptor complexes that mediate the signaling of cytokines IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24. These cytokines are part of the IL-10 family and are involved in immune regulation, tissue homeostasis, and host defense (Chen2018IL20). IL20RB forms heterodimers with IL-20RA or IL-22RA1, facilitating the signaling pathways that regulate immune responses and inflammation (Beute2022The).

In healthy human cells, IL20RB is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, such as keratinocytes, and plays a role in maintaining skin homeostasis and barrier function. It is involved in processes like cell proliferation and differentiation, which are crucial for tissue repair and homeostasis (Beute2022The). The receptor is also expressed in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, where it participates in the regulation of dendritic cell migration and function, although its expression is not significantly altered by inflammatory stimuli like LPS or IL-20 (Bech2016Interleukin).

IL20RB's activity in epithelial cells and its involvement in signaling pathways suggest its role in modulating immune responses and maintaining tissue integrity, contributing to the organism's overall defense mechanisms (Beute2022The; Chen2018IL20).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IL20RB gene have been implicated in various cancers and inflammatory conditions. In papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC), IL20RB is overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and reduced overall survival. This overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting a role in tumor progression through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway (Cui2019Overexpression).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), high IL20RB expression is linked to poor prognosis and is associated with immune cell infiltration, particularly T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which are correlated with adverse outcomes (Zhang2022Interleukin). IL20RB is also overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, where it enhances stemness and chemotherapy resistance through the STAT3 signaling pathway, contributing to tumor progression and poor patient outcomes (Li2023IL20RB).

In the context of oral mucosal candidiasis, IL20RB signaling is involved in modulating host defense, with IL20RB-deficient mice showing reduced disease severity (Beute2022The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of IL20RB in various diseases, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
IL20RB, or interleukin 20 receptor subunit beta, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in various biological processes. It forms part of the receptor complex for cytokines such as IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24, interacting with these ligands to activate downstream signaling pathways, including the JAK1/STAT3 pathway. This interaction is crucial in promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, particularly in lung and pancreatic cancers (He2022IL20RB; Li2023IL20RB).

In the context of Toxoplasma gondii infection, IL20RB interacts with the parasite's rhoptry protein 18 (TgROP18). This interaction occurs at the extracellular domain of IL20RB and leads to the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway, which is involved in host immune responses (Kong2020TgROP18). The interaction between TgROP18 and IL20RB has been confirmed through various assays, including fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) (Xia2018GenomeWide).

IL20RB also forms a heterodimer with IL22RA1, acting as a receptor for IL-20 and IL-24, which is implicated in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway in papillary renal cell carcinoma (Cui2019Overexpression). These interactions highlight IL20RB's role in immune signaling and cancer progression.
