# TSTD2

## Overview
TSTD2 is a gene that encodes the protein thiosulfate sulfurtransferase-like domain containing 2, which is part of the rhodanese-fold domain-containing family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in sulfur metabolism, featuring an N-terminal acylphosphatase domain and a C-terminal rhodanese domain. The TSTD2 protein is implicated in mitochondrial functions, potentially influencing cellular redox balance and detoxification processes. Although the precise biochemical activities of TSTD2 remain unclear, it is suggested to play a role in sulfur transfer processes, similar to other proteins in its family, which are known for their roles in sulfur trafficking and hydrogen sulfide metabolism (Alsohaibani2023RhodaneseFold).

## Structure


## Function
The TSTD2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the rhodanese-fold domain-containing family, which is involved in sulfur metabolism. The TSTD2 protein consists of 516 amino acid residues and includes an N-terminal acylphosphatase domain and a C-terminal rhodanese (Rhd) domain. An alternative translation initiation can produce a shorter isoform containing only the Rhd domain (Alsohaibani2023RhodaneseFold). While the specific functions of TSTD2 in humans are not well-documented, it is suggested to be involved in sulfur transfer processes, similar to other rhodanese-fold proteins, which are known for their roles in sulfur trafficking and hydrogen sulfide metabolism (Alsohaibani2023RhodaneseFold).

The TSTD2 protein is associated with mitochondrial functions, potentially influencing cellular redox balance and detoxification processes. It may play a role in reducing antioxidants like glutathione and thioredoxin, detoxifying reactive oxygen species, and regulating cellular homeostasis (Kubota2022Serum). Despite these associations, the exact biochemical activities of TSTD2, such as its ability to catalyze sulfur atom transfers, remain unclear, and its physiological functions in human cells have not been fully elucidated (Alsohaibani2023RhodaneseFold).

## Clinical Significance
The TSTD2 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily related to its role in atherosclerosis and related diseases. Elevated levels of serum anti-TSTD2 antibodies have been identified as potential biomarkers for atherosclerosis-induced ischemic stroke and chronic kidney disease (CKD). These elevated antibody levels are significantly higher in patients with acute cerebral infarction and CKD compared to healthy individuals, suggesting a link between TSTD2 and these conditions (Kubota2022Serum). The study by Kubota et al. also highlights a correlation between increased anti-TSTD2 antibody levels and risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as male gender, hypertension, older age, smoking, and alcohol consumption (Kubota2022Serum).

In the context of non-syndromic familial tall stature, a nonsense mutation in the TSTD2 gene was identified, suggesting a potential role in bone growth and development. This mutation was found alongside other gene variants in a family with tall stature, indicating an oligogenic origin involving ciliary genes (Weiss2021Evidence). However, the specific clinical significance of TSTD2 mutations in diseases remains to be fully elucidated, as the physiological functions of TSTD2 in humans are not well-documented (Alsohaibani2023RhodaneseFold).
