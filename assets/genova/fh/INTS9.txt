# INTS9

## Overview
The INTS9 gene encodes the integrator complex subunit 9, a protein that is a vital component of the Integrator complex, which is involved in the processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). This protein is categorized as part of the RNA processing machinery and is crucial for the 3'-end processing of uridine-rich snRNAs, playing a significant role in RNA maturation and transcription regulation (Albrecht2018Integrator). INTS9 forms a heterodimer with INTS11, constituting the catalytic core of the Integrator complex, which is essential for the biogenesis of spliceosomal snRNPs and the transcriptional activation of neighboring protein-encoding genes (Albrecht2018Integrator). The protein's interaction with INTS11 is mediated by their C-terminal regions, which is critical for the endonucleolytic activity of the Integrator complex (Albrecht2012snRNA). Additionally, INTS9 is implicated in maintaining the structural integrity of nuclear bodies and regulating gene expression by modulating RNA polymerase II activity (Huang2020Integrator). Alterations in INTS9 expression have been associated with various diseases, including gliomas and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Lin2023Decoding; Cihlarova2022BRAT1).

## Structure
The INTS9 protein is a component of the Integrator complex, which is involved in the processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). INTS9 forms a heterodimer with INTS11, which is crucial for its function in snRNA 3' end processing. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal regions of both proteins, with the smallest fragment of INTS9 capable of binding to INTS11 being amino acids 497 to 658 (Albrecht2012snRNA). The crystal structure of the C-terminal domains of INTS9 and INTS11 has been solved, revealing a common domain formed upon heterodimerization, which is essential for the endonucleolytic activity of the Integrator complex (Albrecht2018Integrator).

INTS9 is highly similar to the CPSF100 subunit, part of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPF) complex, and is predicted to have alpha-helical structures with protein-protein interaction folds such as ARM, HEAT, TPR, and vWA (Fianu2024Reconstitution). The protein is largely disordered, with regions of high protein binding propensity, except for a stretch in the C-terminal region (Fianu2024Reconstitution). INTS9 is an inactive paralog of CPSF100, and its interaction with INTS11 is necessary for the cleavage function of the Integrator complex (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14).

## Function
INTS9 is a critical component of the Integrator complex, which plays a significant role in RNA processing and transcription regulation in healthy human cells. It forms a heterodimer with INTS11, constituting the catalytic core of the Integrator complex, which is essential for the 3'-end processing of uridine-rich small nuclear RNAs (UsnRNAs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). This processing is crucial for the biogenesis of spliceosomal snRNPs and the transcriptional activation of neighboring protein-encoding genes (Albrecht2018Integrator).

The Integrator complex, including INTS9, is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of Cajal bodies and histone locus bodies, which are nuclear structures essential for snRNA biogenesis and histone mRNA production. Knockdown of INTS9 leads to the disassembly of these structures, indicating its importance in nuclear body stability (Albrecht2018Integrator).

INTS9 also plays a role in transcription termination. It binds to snRNA loci and is involved in the processing of snRNA transcripts, ensuring proper maturation and preventing inappropriate polyadenylation. Depletion of INTS9 results in increased levels of unprocessed snRNA, highlighting its role in transcription termination and RNA processing (Skaar2015The).

In addition, INTS9 is implicated in the regulation of gene expression by preventing the transition of RNA polymerase II from a paused state into productive elongation, thereby repressing gene activity and maintaining proper gene expression levels (Huang2020Integrator).

## Clinical Significance
The INTS9 gene, a component of the integrator complex, has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In gliomas, a type of brain tumor, INTS9 expression is significantly elevated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with higher tumor grades, increased cell proliferation, and poor prognosis, particularly in IDH-wildtype and IDH-mutant astrocytomas (Lin2023Decoding). INTS9 is linked to TP53 mutations, which impair cell cycle regulation, potentially leading to increased INTS9 levels and altered gene expression (Lin2023Decoding). 

The gene is also associated with changes in the immune microenvironment, such as increased macrophage activity and decreased monocyte levels, which may contribute to an immunosuppressive environment that supports tumor growth and immune evasion (Lin2023Decoding). 

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, INTS9, as part of the INTS11/INTS9 heterodimer, is involved in RNA processing and transcription regulation. Mutations in the integrator complex, including INTS9, are linked to severe neurodevelopmental syndromes characterized by intellectual disability, epilepsy, and brain abnormalities (Cihlarova2022BRAT1).

## Interactions
INTS9 is a component of the Integrator complex, where it forms a heterodimer with INTS11, creating the catalytic core essential for the 3'-end processing of UsnRNAs and enhancer RNAs. This interaction is facilitated by their C-terminal domains, which form a common domain upon heterodimerization (Albrecht2012snRNA; Albrecht2018Integrator). The INTS9/INTS11 heterodimer further associates with INTS4 to form a heterotrimeric complex known as the Integrator 'cleavage module', which is responsible for the endonucleolytic activity of the Integrator complex (Albrecht2018Integrator).

The interaction between INTS9 and INTS11 is robust and specific, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation assays, and remains strong even under high salt and denaturing conditions (Albrecht2012snRNA). The binding site for INTS9 within INTS11 is located between amino acids 503 to 600, while the interaction region within INTS9 spans amino acids 565 to 658 (Albrecht2012snRNA).

INTS9 also interacts with BRAT1, forming a trimeric complex with INTS11, which is crucial for the regulation of neurodevelopmental genes (Dokaneheifard2023BRAT1). These interactions highlight the critical role of INTS9 in RNA processing and gene regulation.
