# ADGRA1

## Overview
ADGRA1, also known as GPR123, is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor A1, a member of the adhesion GPCR family. This receptor is characterized by its lack of the GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, distinguishing it from other adhesion GPCRs that typically undergo autoproteolytic cleavage (Hamann2015International; Krishnan2016Classification). ADGRA1 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a significant role in neural signal transduction and is implicated in processes such as emotion regulation, learning, and memory (Zhang2021ADGRA1). The receptor's involvement in the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β and MEK/ERK pathways highlights its importance in energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation (Zhang2021ADGRA1). Additionally, alterations in ADGRA1 expression have been associated with kidney diseases, suggesting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion).

## Structure
ADGRA1, also known as GPR123, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Unlike most adhesion GPCRs, ADGRA1 lacks the GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, which is typically involved in receptor autoproteolysis and the formation of N-terminal and C-terminal fragments (Hamann2015International; Krishnan2016Classification). This absence suggests that ADGRA1 does not undergo the autoproteolytic cleavage common to other members of its family (Krishnan2016Classification).

ADGRA1 features a long C-terminal region containing an ETTV motif, which interacts with PDZ domains in other proteins, such as the tumor endothelial marker 5 (TEM5) protein. This interaction indicates a role in modulating signal transduction through its C-terminal region (Zhang2021ADGRA1). The receptor is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it is involved in processes such as emotion regulation, learning, and memory (Zhang2021ADGRA1).

The primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ADGRA1 are not detailed in the available literature, nor are specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms mentioned (Hamann2015International; Krishnan2016Classification).

## Function
ADGRA1, also known as GPR123, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in mediating cellular responses to external stimuli. This gene is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in regions such as the hypothalamus, cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and spinal cord, with notably higher expression in the hypothalamus (Zhang2021ADGRA1). ADGRA1 is involved in the transduction of neural signals and is implicated in regulating energy expenditure and thermogenesis, primarily through the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis (Zhang2021ADGRA1).

In male mice, ADGRA1 negatively regulates energy expenditure and thermogenesis, as evidenced by increased core body temperatures and elevated expression of thermogenic markers in ADGRA1-deficient models (Zhang2021ADGRA1). The gene modulates the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β and MEK/ERK pathways in the hypothalamus, affecting metabolic processes and energy homeostasis (Zhang2021ADGRA1). These pathways are crucial for sympathetic neuron development and survival, indicating ADGRA1's role in maintaining energy balance through GPCR signaling pathways (Zhang2021ADGRA1). The gene's function in these processes suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders if its molecular mechanisms are further elucidated (Zhang2021ADGRA1).

## Clinical Significance
The ADGRA1 gene, also known as GPR123, is associated with several kidney diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. Specifically, it has been linked to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and membranous diabetic nephropathy (mDN). In CKD, the expression of ADGRA1 is significantly increased, with a reported fold change of 5.460, indicating a substantial upregulation in this condition. Similarly, in mDN, the gene's expression is elevated with a fold change of 3.564 (CazorlaVázquez2018Adhesion). These changes in expression levels suggest that ADGRA1 may play a role in the pathophysiology of these kidney diseases, potentially serving as a biomarker or therapeutic target.

While the context does not provide specific information on mutations or interaction alterations for ADGRA1, the gene's involvement in kidney disease highlights its clinical significance. The absence of the GAIN domain in ADGRA1, which is present in other adhesion G protein-coupled receptors, may influence its functional mechanisms and interactions, although this aspect requires further investigation (Folts2019Adhesion; Purcell2018Adhesion). Overall, the altered expression of ADGRA1 in kidney diseases underscores its potential impact on renal health.
