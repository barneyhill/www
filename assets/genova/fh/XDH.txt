# XDH

## Overview
The XDH gene encodes the enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase, a critical component of purine metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as an oxidoreductase and is responsible for catalyzing the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and subsequently xanthine to uric acid, processes essential for the degradation and excretion of purines. Xanthine dehydrogenase is a complex enzyme that requires several cofactors, including molybdenum, iron-sulfur clusters, and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), to function effectively (Leimkühler1998Xanthine; Reschke2017Protonation). The enzyme exists in two interconvertible forms: xanthine dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidase, each playing distinct roles in cellular metabolism and disease states (Pritsos2000Cellular). XDH is predominantly active in the liver and intestine, with its activity influencing uric acid levels and impacting antioxidant defense mechanisms (Bortolotti2021Xanthine). Mutations in the XDH gene can lead to disorders such as xanthinuria, and altered expression of the gene has been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer (Chen2017Xanthine; Collazo2021Identification).

## Structure
Xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) is a complex enzyme involved in purine metabolism, characterized by its intricate molecular structure. The primary structure of XDH consists of a polypeptide chain encoded by the XDH gene, which includes binding sites for essential cofactors such as molybdenum, iron-sulfur clusters, and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (Leimkühler1998Xanthine). The secondary structure of XDH features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its stability and function (Reschke2017Protonation).

The tertiary structure of XDH forms a complex three-dimensional shape, with the molybdenum cofactor coordinated by dithiolene sulfurs of a molybdopterin ligand, along with oxygen ligands and a terminal sulfido group, arranged in a distorted square-pyramidal geometry (Reschke2017Protonation). This configuration is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity, facilitating the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid (Dietzel2009Mechanism).

In terms of quaternary structure, XDH typically exists as a homodimer, with each monomer containing one molybdopterin cofactor, two [2Fe-2S] centers, and one FAD cofactor (Enroth2000Crystal). The enzyme can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity (Reschke2017Protonation). XDH also exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, allowing for functional diversity (Reschke2017Protonation).

## Function
The XDH gene encodes the enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase, which plays a critical role in purine metabolism by catalyzing the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. This enzymatic activity is essential for the final steps of purine degradation, facilitating the breakdown and excretion of purines, which are components of nucleic acids (Levartovsky2000XDH; Pritsos2000Cellular). In healthy human cells, XDH is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for maintaining uric acid levels, impacting antioxidant defense and cellular redox balance (Bortolotti2021Xanthine).

XDH exists in two forms: xanthine dehydrogenase, which reduces NAD+ by a direct two-electron reduction, and xanthine oxidase, which reduces molecular oxygen by a single electron. These forms are interconvertible and play significant roles in disease states and xenobiotic metabolism (Pritsos2000Cellular). The enzyme's activity is highest in the liver and intestine, with lower activity in other tissues such as the heart, brain, lung, and kidney (Pritsos2000Cellular). The conversion of xanthine to uric acid by XDH is a key process in purine catabolism, especially in humans and higher primates, due to the absence of uricase, leading to higher uricemia levels compared to other mammals (Bortolotti2021Xanthine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the XDH gene can lead to xanthinuria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by low uric acid levels and high excretion of xanthine and hypoxanthine in urine. Xanthinuria is classified into three types: Type I is due to mutations in the XDH gene alone, Type II involves both XDH and aldehyde oxidase deficiencies, and Type III is associated with molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis failure (Collazo2021Identification; Xu2020A). 

Type I xanthinuria results from isolated XDH deficiency, leading to hypouricemia and increased xanthine levels in serum and urine. This condition can cause complications such as urinary tract calculi, acute renal failure, or myositis due to xanthine deposition in tissues (Nakamura2012Identification; Sakamoto2001Identification). 

Altered expression of XDH is also implicated in cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), decreased XDH activity is associated with higher tumor stages and poorer prognoses. XDH downregulation promotes TGFβ signaling and cancer stem cell-related gene expression, contributing to cancer progression and metastasis (Chen2017Xanthine). These findings suggest that XDH expression levels may serve as a clinical indicator in cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

## Interactions
Xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) is involved in several interactions with other proteins and cofactors. In Arabidopsis thaliana, XDH interacts with proteins involved in the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis pathway, although direct interactions with CNX1 and ABA3 were not detected, suggesting that the direct transfer of di-oxo Moco to the XOR family via these interactions is unlikely (Kaufholdt2016Identification). 

XDH also interacts with specific amino acids that influence its enzymatic activity. For instance, the binding of NAD+ to XDH results in a significant upshift in the redox potential, influenced by the positive charge on the NAD+ ring and the protonation state of Asp429, which is in proximity to the flavin ring and the nicotinamide region of NAD+ (Ishikita2011Protein). 

The enzyme's structure includes two iron-sulfur clusters, Fe͞S I and Fe͞S II, which are involved in electron transfer processes. These clusters facilitate electron transfer from the molybdenum center to the Fe͞S centers, playing a crucial role in the enzyme's function (Enroth2000Crystal). 

XDH's interactions with nucleic acids are also significant, as they influence cellular oxidative stress responses, although specific details on these interactions are not provided in the context.
