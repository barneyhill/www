# ZNF33B

## Overview
ZNF33B is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 33B, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) domains. These proteins are typically involved in transcriptional regulation, acting as transcription factors that bind to specific DNA sequences to modulate gene expression. Zinc finger protein 33B is implicated in various biological processes, including transcriptional regulation and interaction with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is part of a network of recently duplicated KRAB-ZNF genes, suggesting a role in the functional diversification or adaptation in primates (Nowick2010Rapid). The gene has been associated with clinical conditions such as childhood asthma and pediatric sepsis, where its interactions and expression levels may influence disease susceptibility and progression (Lee2022Zinc; Lu2022LNCZNF33B2:1).

## Clinical Significance
The ZNF33B gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in relation to its interactions and expression levels. In the context of childhood asthma, ZNF33B has been shown to interact with sex and atopy-related markers. A study identified significant gene-by-sex interactions involving ZNF33B, suggesting that it may play a role in the sex-specific genetic architecture of atopy and asthma. Specifically, SNPs in the ZNF region, such as rs2483695 and rs2484297, demonstrated significant interactions with sex, indicating a potential influence of ZNF33B on atopy in childhood asthma (Lee2022Zinc).

Additionally, the ZNF33B gene has been associated with sepsis in pediatric patients. The lnc-ZNF33B-2:1 gene, a long non-coding RNA related to ZNF33B, has been linked to an increased risk of organ dysfunction and death in pediatric sepsis. The rs579501 polymorphism in this gene is associated with a higher susceptibility to sepsis, particularly in children under 12 months and male patients. This polymorphism may alter the gene's interactions, potentially creating a binding site for certain microRNAs, which could contribute to the pathogenesis of sepsis (Lu2022LNCZNF33B2:1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZNF33B in both asthma and sepsis, underscoring its potential as a biomarker for these conditions.

## Interactions
ZNF33B, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with TRIM28, a transcriptional co-repressor, in leukemic K562 cells. This interaction is affected by an acetylation-mimic mutation (K304Q) in TRIM28, which alters the interaction dynamics and impacts gene expression regulation (Chang2023AcetylationMimic). ZNF33B is also part of a network of recently duplicated KRAB-ZNF genes, suggesting potential functional diversification or adaptation in primates (Nowick2010Rapid).

In the context of childhood asthma, ZNF33B interacts with sex and atopy-related markers. A significant gene-by-sex interaction was observed with the SNP rs1255383, affecting transmission patterns in males and females with atopy. This SNP also interacts with sex for high IgE and eosinophil counts, markers of atopy (Lee2022Zinc).

ZNF33B's expression is influenced by its interactions with other genomic elements. For instance, a single nucleotide polymorphism in its 5' untranslated region affects superovulation traits in cattle, indicating its role in reproductive biology (Li2022Expression). These interactions highlight ZNF33B's involvement in transcriptional regulation and its potential impact on various biological processes.
