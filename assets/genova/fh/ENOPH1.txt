# ENOPH1

## Overview
ENOPH1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme enolase-phosphatase 1, which plays a critical role in the methionine salvage pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a phosphatase and is involved in the conversion of 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate to 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate, a key step in recycling methionine from methylthioadenosine. Enolase-phosphatase 1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly under stress conditions such as oxidative stress and ischemia (Lee2015Proteomics; Zhang2016Cerebral). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as aci-reductone dioxygenase 1, further underscore its role in cellular metabolism and stress response (Zhang2016Cerebral). Dysregulation of ENOPH1 has been associated with various diseases, including glioma and colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Su2018Enolasephosphatase; Peng2022Amino).

## Structure
ENOPH1 (enolase-phosphatase 1) is a protein involved in the methionine salvage pathway, characterized by its complex molecular structure. The primary structure of ENOPH1 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that determine its unique properties and function. The secondary structure includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and folding.

The tertiary structure of ENOPH1 forms its functional three-dimensional shape, essential for its enzymatic activity. This structure allows the protein to interact with other molecules and perform its role in the methionine salvage pathway effectively. ENOPH1 may also form quaternary structures if it associates with other proteins, although specific details on such complexes are not provided.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can occur in ENOPH1, potentially influencing its activity and function. These modifications are crucial for regulating the protein's role in cellular processes. Specific domains and folds within ENOPH1 contribute to its enzymatic activity, although detailed descriptions of these features are not available in the provided context. The protein's structure and modifications are integral to its function in the methionine salvage pathway.

## Function
ENOPH1 (enolase-phosphatase 1) is an enzyme involved in the methionine salvage pathway, which is crucial for recycling methionine from methylthioadenosine. This pathway is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting cell growth by increasing polyamine levels, which are essential for various cellular functions (Lee2015Proteomics). ENOPH1 catalyzes the conversion of 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate to 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate, a key step in the methionine salvage pathway (Vasconcellos2020Dynamic).

The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in cellular metabolism and homeostasis. It is involved in stress response and cell apoptosis, particularly under conditions of oxidative stress (Zhang2016Cerebral). ENOPH1's activity is linked to the regulation of polyamine synthesis, which is vital for cell proliferation and development (Vasconcellos2020Dynamic).

In the context of healthy human cells, ENOPH1's precise functions are not fully elucidated, but its involvement in the methionine salvage pathway suggests a role in maintaining cellular metabolic balance and supporting normal cell growth and proliferation (Lebedev2016A).

## Clinical Significance
ENOPH1 (enolase-phosphatase 1) has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In glioma, a type of brain tumor, ENOPH1 expression is significantly increased compared to normal brain tissues, particularly in higher-grade gliomas. This overexpression correlates with shorter overall survival in glioma patients, suggesting its role in tumor progression and as a potential therapeutic target (Su2018Enolasephosphatase). Knockdown studies in glioma cell lines have shown that reducing ENOPH1 expression leads to decreased cell proliferation and migration, indicating its involvement in tumor growth and spread (Su2018Enolasephosphatase).

In colorectal cancer, ENOPH1 is part of a risk signature associated with immunotherapy responses and clinical prognosis. It is downregulated in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, which aligns with findings from the Human Protein Atlas (Peng2022Amino). Additionally, ENOPH1 is involved in methionine biosynthesis and has been studied in the context of BRAFV600E mutant colon cancer cells, although its clinical significance in this setting remains less clear (Grbčić2021Proteomic).

Overall, ENOPH1's dysregulation is linked to cancer progression and may serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target in certain malignancies.

## Interactions
ENOPH1 (enolase-phosphatase 1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play a significant role in cellular processes, particularly under stress conditions such as ischemia. One notable interaction is with aci-reductone dioxygenase 1 (ADI1), a downstream protein involved in cell apoptosis and oxidoreductase reactions. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed a physical interaction between ENOPH1 and ADI1, which is enhanced under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions, a model for ischemia (Zhang2016Cerebral). This interaction is crucial as it influences the translocation of ADI1 from the nucleus to the cytosol, suggesting that ENOPH1 may restrict ADI1 within the nucleus under normal conditions (Zhang2016Cerebral).

ENOPH1's interaction with ADI1 is also implicated in the regulation of membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), potentially leading to the degradation of tight junction proteins and basal membrane components, contributing to blood-brain barrier disruption during ischemic events (Zhang2016Cerebral). These interactions highlight ENOPH1's role in promoting oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, which are critical in endothelial cell apoptosis and blood-brain barrier integrity under ischemic conditions (Zhang2016Cerebral).
