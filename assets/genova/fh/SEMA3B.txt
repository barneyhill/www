# SEMA3B

## Overview
SEMA3B is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 3B, a member of the semaphorin family known for its role in axonal guidance and cellular signaling. Semaphorin 3B is a secreted protein that interacts with neuropilin and plexin receptors to mediate various biological processes, including apoptosis, cell migration, and angiogenesis (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins). It is particularly significant in the nervous system, where it helps establish neural connectivity by repelling axons from inappropriate areas. Beyond its neural functions, semaphorin 3B is involved in the cardiovascular, immune, and musculoskeletal systems, and it plays a critical role in tumor suppression, influencing cancer progression and cellular homeostasis (Fard2021Semaphorins). The gene's expression and function are regulated through complex interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, including its antisense RNA, SEMA3B-AS1, which modulates its expression through epigenetic mechanisms (Guo2019MiR6872). SEMA3B's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in various cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor, and its potential as a therapeutic target is being explored (Tomizawa2001Inhibition; Zhang2020A).

## Structure
SEMA3B, a member of the semaphorin family, is characterized by a semaphorin domain, an immunoglobulin-like domain, and a basic domain. The semaphorin domain is a signature feature of semaphorins and is typically associated with a β-propeller architecture, which is crucial for its function in cell guidance and signaling (Siebold2013Structural). The protein's secondary structure likely involves beta sheets and alpha helices, common in semaphorin proteins, although specific details for SEMA3B are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure of SEMA3B involves the folding of its domains, which is essential for its interaction with receptors such as Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) and Neuropilin-2 (Nrp2) (Sharma2012Receptor). The quaternary structure may involve dimerization, a common feature in semaphorin signaling mechanisms, although specific details for SEMA3B are not mentioned.

Post-translational modifications of SEMA3B can include glycosylation, which may affect its stability and interactions. The existence of splice variants may lead to different isoforms of SEMA3B, potentially resulting in distinct functional roles, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the context provided. Overall, the structural elements of SEMA3B are integral to its role in axonal guidance and cell signaling.

## Function
SEMA3B, a member of the semaphorin family, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in axonal guidance, where it functions by repelling axons from inappropriate areas, thus forming molecular boundaries essential for proper neural connectivity (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins). SEMA3B interacts with neuropilin and plexin receptors to mediate cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell migration, and angiogenesis (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins). In the nervous system, SEMA3B is expressed in neurons and glial cells, contributing to neural connectivity and cytoskeletal organization (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins).

Beyond the nervous system, SEMA3B is involved in the cardiovascular, immune, and musculoskeletal systems, influencing processes like cell death and cytoskeletal organization (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins). It also plays a role in tumor suppression, indicating its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing abnormal cell growth (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins). In bone homeostasis, SEMA3B regulates osteoclast and osteoblast activity, reducing bone resorption and promoting bone synthesis. A deficiency in SEMA3B is associated with osteopenia and increased osteoclastogenesis, highlighting its role in maintaining bone density and health (Fard2021Semaphorins).

## Clinical Significance
SEMA3B is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor gene. In lung cancer, SEMA3B mutations, such as the D561N amino acid change, are associated with the loss of its growth-suppressing function. These mutations are often accompanied by promoter hypermethylation, leading to gene silencing and contributing to cancer progression (Tomizawa2001Inhibition). The reexpression of wild-type SEMA3B in lung cancer cells can inhibit growth and induce apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tomizawa2001Inhibition).

In gliomas, SEMA3B is frequently silenced through promoter methylation, particularly in higher-grade tumors, suggesting a role in tumor progression and as a potential marker for glioma grade (Pang2016Mechanism). In breast cancer, higher SEMA3B expression is associated with better survival outcomes, although its expression does not significantly vary across different tumor subtypes (Zhang2020A). SEMA3B also plays a role in the tumor microenvironment and immune response, influencing cancer stemness and potentially affecting treatment response (Zhang2020A).

## Interactions
SEMA3B interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and cancer progression. It forms complexes with neuropilin receptors (NRP1 and NRP2) and plexins, particularly plexin-A2 and plexin-A4, which are essential for its signal transduction. These interactions are crucial for SEMA3B's function in inhibiting angiogenesis and tumorigenesis (Sabag2014The). In glioma, SEMA3B expression correlates positively with its receptors NRP2 and PLXNA2, indicating its involvement in signaling pathways that affect cancer processes (Valiulyte2020A).

SEMA3B also interacts with its antisense long non-coding RNA, SEMA3B-AS1, which upregulates SEMA3B expression. This interaction involves the protein MLL4, a histone methylation enzyme, which binds to SEMA3B-AS1, enhancing SEMA3B expression through epigenetic regulation (Guo2019MiR6872). The transcription factor Sp1 activates the transcription of SEMA3B and SEMA3B-AS1, although its binding is influenced by the methylation status of CpG sites in the promoter region (Guo2019MiR6872). These interactions suggest that SEMA3B and its associated molecules play a critical role in regulating gene expression and cellular processes related to cancer progression.
