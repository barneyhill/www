# CLEC1B

## Overview
CLEC1B is a gene that encodes the C-type lectin domain family 1 member B (CLEC-2), a type II transmembrane receptor predominantly expressed on platelets and various immune cells. This receptor is part of the C-type lectin receptor family and is characterized by its carbohydrate recognition domain and cytoplasmic tyrosine-based motif, which are integral to its function in cellular signaling. CLEC-2 plays a pivotal role in platelet activation and aggregation, primarily through its interaction with the endogenous ligand podoplanin, which triggers a cascade of intracellular signaling events. Beyond hemostasis, CLEC-2 is involved in maintaining blood-lymphatic separation during embryonic development and modulating immune and inflammatory responses. Its expression and function have significant implications in pathological conditions, including cancer, where it may act as a tumor suppressor, and in thrombo-inflammatory processes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Jing2023Comprehensive; Gupta2012Dectin1; Rayes2019Functional).

## Structure
CLEC1B, also known as CLEC-2, is a type II transmembrane receptor that is part of the C-type lectin receptor family. The protein is characterized by a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and a cytoplasmic tyrosine-based motif, which are key features of its molecular structure (Gupta2012Dectin1). The extracellular domain of CLEC1B includes a semi-helical loop region crucial for ligand binding, with hydrophobic and electrostatic features determining ligand interaction (Gupta2012Dectin1). 

The CLEC1B protein typically forms dimers but can oligomerize into larger complexes upon ligand binding (Nagae2014A). The quaternary structure involves disulfide-linked homodimers, and the protein can be cleaved into a soluble form (Gupta2012Dectin1). The interaction with ligands such as podoplanin and rhodocytin involves specific binding modes, with electrostatic interactions playing a significant role (Nagae2014A). 

CLEC1B also has splice variant isoforms derived from the omission of exon 2 and 2/4, which exhibit different expression profiles and subcellular localization compared to the full-length protein (Gupta2012Dectin1). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in platelet activation and aggregation.

## Function
The CLEC1B gene encodes the C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2), a type II transmembrane receptor primarily expressed on platelets and various immune cells, including myeloid cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and NK cells (Jing2023Comprehensive). In healthy human cells, CLEC-2 plays a crucial role in platelet activation and aggregation by binding to its endogenous ligand, podoplanin (PDPN). This interaction triggers a signal transduction pathway involving the hemi-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (hemITAM), Syk phosphorylation, and PLCγ2 activation, leading to platelet aggregation (Etemad2020Correlation; Rayes2019Functional).

CLEC-2 is also involved in maintaining blood-lymphatic separation during embryonic development, as its deletion leads to blood-lymphatic mixing (Rayes2019Functional). The receptor is implicated in immune and inflammatory responses, regulating leukocyte recruitment and activation through interactions with podoplanin (Tone2019C‐type). In the context of cancer, CLEC-2 is downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, and its overexpression can inhibit the proliferation and migration of cancer cells, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role (Jing2023Comprehensive). CLEC-2's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in both hemostasis and immune regulation.

## Clinical Significance
CLEC1B, also known as CLEC-2, is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in platelet activation and immune responses. Alterations in CLEC1B expression are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its downregulation correlates with poor prognosis and tumor progression. High expression of CLEC1B is linked to favorable survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in HCC (Jing2023Comprehensive). 

CLEC1B is also involved in thromboinflammation, acting as a molecular bridge between platelets and immune cells, which links inflammation and thrombosis. Its interaction with podoplanin is crucial for maintaining vascular integrity in inflamed tissues, and its deficiency can lead to increased bleeding and impaired thrombus formation (Meng2021The; Rayes2019Functional). 

In the context of immune responses, CLEC1B expression affects the recruitment of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, influencing the prognosis of cancers like HCC and bladder urothelial cancer (BLCA) (Jing2023Comprehensive; Xu2022Clinical). The gene's involvement in immune modulation and its potential as a target for immunotherapy highlight its clinical significance in cancer treatment (Zhang2021A).

## Interactions
CLEC1B, also known as CLEC-2, is a type II transmembrane receptor that participates in various protein-protein interactions, primarily through its extracellular lectin-like domain. One of its primary interactions is with podoplanin, a type I transmembrane protein. This interaction is crucial for several physiological processes, including platelet aggregation, tumor metastasis, and immune cell migration. The binding between CLEC-2 and podoplanin involves an electrostatic interaction between a conserved sequence in podoplanin and arginines in CLEC-2, which is essential for maintaining vascular integrity and preventing blood-lymphatic mixing during development (Rayes2019Functional).

CLEC1B is also involved in dendritic cell (DC) migration. It interacts with podoplanin on fibroblastic reticular cells, facilitating DC motility by reducing actomyosin contractility and promoting actin polymerization. This interaction is necessary for DC migration from peripheral tissues to lymph nodes (Acton2012Podoplanin-Rich).

In addition to podoplanin, CLEC1B interacts with various exogenous ligands, such as the snake venom toxin rhodocytin and sulfated polysaccharides like fucoidan. These interactions can lead to platelet activation and aggregation, highlighting CLEC1B's role in thrombo-inflammatory processes (Alshehri2015Activation; Rayes2019Functional).
