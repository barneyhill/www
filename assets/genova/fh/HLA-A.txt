# HLA-A

## Overview
HLA-A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I family, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system. The HLA-A protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on the surface of nearly all nucleated cells, where it is involved in presenting endogenous peptide antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). This antigen presentation is crucial for immune surveillance, enabling the detection and elimination of infected or malignant cells (Crux2017Human; Bodmer1987The). The HLA-A protein forms a heterodimer with β2-microglobulin, which is essential for its stability and function on the cell surface (Krangel1979Assembly). The polymorphic nature of HLA-A alleles contributes to the diversity of immune responses, influencing susceptibility to various infections and autoimmune diseases (Crux2017Human).

## Structure
The HLA-A gene encodes a protein that is a part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are integral membrane glycoproteins found on almost all human cells. The HLA-A protein consists of a polymorphic heavy chain that is noncovalently associated with a nonpolymorphic light chain, β2-microglobulin (Krangel1979Assembly). The heavy chain is a 41,000 dalton glycoprotein embedded in the membrane via a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids near its carboxy terminus, with most of the polypeptide on the cell's external surface (Krangel1979Assembly).

The heavy chain of HLA-A includes three extracellular domains: α1, α2, and α3. The α1 and α2 domains form a peptide-binding groove, which is crucial for presenting peptide antigens to T cells (Krangel1979Assembly). The α3 domain interacts with CD8 co-receptors, playing a role in immune recognition (Gao1997Crystal). The protein undergoes glycosylation, a post-translational modification, involving the addition of complex oligosaccharides, which include sialic acid, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine (Krangel1979Assembly).

HLA-A molecules typically form heterodimers with β2-microglobulin, contributing to their quaternary structure and stability on the cell surface (Krangel1979Assembly). The assembly and maturation of these antigens involve the conversion of high mannose oligosaccharides to complex forms, which is essential for their function and expression (Krangel1979Assembly).

## Function
HLA-A is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are crucial for immune function. These proteins are expressed on the surface of nearly all nucleated cells and are involved in presenting endogenous peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), a process essential for immune surveillance. This presentation allows the immune system to detect and eliminate infected or malignant cells, maintaining cellular integrity and organismal health (Crux2017Human; Bodmer1987The).

The HLA-A protein consists of a glycosylated heavy chain that is noncovalently associated with β2-microglobulin, forming a complex that is essential for its stability and function. This complex is involved in the presentation of peptide antigens to CD8+ T cells, which is a critical step in the immune response (Krangel1979Assembly; Bodmer1987The). The assembly and maturation of HLA-A involve glycosylation and association with β2-microglobulin, processes that occur in the endoplasmic reticulum before the complex is transported to the cell surface (Krangel1979Assembly).

HLA-A molecules also interact with natural killer (NK) cells by serving as ligands for inhibitory receptors, contributing to immune tolerance and the elimination of infected or abnormal cells (Crux2017Human). The polymorphism of HLA-A alleles provides a selective advantage against diverse pathogens, influencing susceptibility to infections and autoimmune diseases (Crux2017Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression levels of the HLA-A gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of infectious diseases like HIV. Elevated expression of HLA-A is associated with poorer control of HIV, as it increases the levels of an HLA-A-derived signal peptide that binds to HLA-E, the ligand for the inhibitory NKG2A natural killer (NK) cell receptor. This interaction impairs NK cell clearance of HIV-infected cells, suggesting that therapeutic blockade of the HLA-E:NKG2A interaction might benefit HIV treatment (Ramsuran2018Elevated).

In the context of cancer, somatic mutations in the HLA-A gene can impact the mutation burden in tumors. These mutations are often late subclonal events and are associated with higher neoantigen levels, potentially facilitating tumor immune escape. Tumors with HLA-A mutations show elevated CD8+ T cell levels, indicating an immune response due to the lack of corresponding MHC-I molecule/peptide complexes (Castro2019Elevated).

HLA-A polymorphisms are also linked to autoimmune conditions such as Behcet's disease (BD). Specific alleles like HLA-A*02:07, A*26:01, and A*30:04 are associated with an increased risk of BD, while HLA-A*33:03 is associated with a decreased risk (Kang2011Associations). These alleles are linked to specific clinical manifestations of BD, such as skin lesions, arthritis, and uveitis (Kang2011Associations).

## Interactions
HLA-A, a class I major histocompatibility complex protein, engages in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in immune response. It forms complexes with β2-microglobulin and presents peptide antigens to CD8+ T cells. The study by Singh et al. identified novel interactions involving HLA-A using cross-linking mass spectrometry. Notably, HLA-A interacts with histone H2B and HMGA1, forming a complex that stabilizes its structure, particularly in the presence of interferon-alpha (IFNα) (Singh2022Identification). The interaction with H2B is significant as it occurs in both IFNα treated and untreated samples, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Singh2022Identification).

HLA-A also interacts with MDN1, a large protein from the AAA family, through its AAA domains and other structural regions. This interaction is specific to HLA-A and is enhanced in IFNα-treated samples, indicating a potential role in interferon signaling (Singh2022Identification). Additionally, HLA-A forms complexes with LRCH4, a membrane protein involved in immune response regulation, through interactions localized at its α1 and α2 domains (Singh2022Identification). These interactions highlight the dynamic nature of HLA-A in immune signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target.
