# SYNGR2

## Overview
The SYNGR2 gene encodes the protein synaptogyrin 2, a member of the synaptogyrin family characterized by its four transmembrane domains, which contribute to its role as a transmembrane protein involved in vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics. Synaptogyrin 2 is expressed in various tissues, excluding the brain, and is integral to the biogenesis of synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs), which are crucial for intracellular trafficking processes (Kedra1998Characterization; BoeszeBattaglia2020Internalization). The protein's structure, with its M-shaped topology, allows it to participate in the internalization and transport of molecules within cells, interacting with lipid rafts and forming complexes with other proteins to facilitate retrograde transport from endosomes to the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (BoeszeBattaglia2017Internalization). Synaptogyrin 2's involvement in these pathways is not only essential for normal cellular function but also exploited by pathogens, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (BoeszeBattaglia2024Cellugyrin).

## Structure
The SYNGR2 protein, encoded by the SYNGR2 gene, is a member of the synaptogyrin family and is characterized by its four transmembrane domains, which contribute to its M-shaped topology. This structure suggests that both the N-terminal and C-terminal ends are localized on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Kedra1998Characterization). The protein is involved in vesicle trafficking and is predicted to have four membrane-spanning helices, indicating its presence in synaptic vesicles (Kedra1998Characterization).

The central portion of the SYNGR2 protein, encoded by exons 3 and 4, shows strong conservation, corresponding to amino acid residues 34-161 in SYNGR1a. This conservation suggests functional similarity, particularly in the N-terminal region, while the C-terminal end is more variable, likely conveying functional specificity (Kedra1998Characterization). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in vesicle biogenesis, exocytosis, and recycling via endocytosis (Walker2018Synaptogyrin2).

Post-translational modifications of SYNGR2 may include phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions (BoeszeBattaglia2017Internalization). The SYNGR2 gene also has a processed pseudogene localized in 15q11 (Kedra1998Characterization).

## Function
Synaptogyrin-2 (SYNGR2) is a transmembrane protein involved in vesicle biogenesis and membrane trafficking within cells. It is a member of the synaptogyrin family, which includes proteins with four transmembrane regions and a tyrosine-phosphorylated tail. SYNGR2 is expressed in all tissues except the brain and plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs), which are implicated in intracellular trafficking (BoeszeBattaglia2020Internalization; BoeszeBattaglia2017Internalization).

In healthy human cells, SYNGR2 is involved in the internalization and intracellular transport of various molecules. It translocates to cholesterol-rich lipid rafts on the plasma membrane, where it forms complexes with other proteins, facilitating the retrograde transport of molecules from early endosomes to the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (BoeszeBattaglia2020Internalization). This process is essential for the proper functioning of cellular pathways and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.

SYNGR2's role in vesicle trafficking is also exploited by certain pathogens, such as bacterial toxins and viruses, which hijack these pathways for their entry and intracellular transport. This highlights the protein's significance in both normal cellular processes and pathogen-host interactions (BoeszeBattaglia2024Cellugyrin).

## Clinical Significance
The SYNGR2 gene has been implicated in various cancers, particularly liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). High expression levels of SYNGR2 are associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancer types, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), bladder cancer, breast cancer, and liver cancer. Elevated SYNGR2 expression correlates with reduced overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free intervals in these cancers (Liu2023Pancancer). SYNGR2 is also linked to the tumor microenvironment, showing positive correlations with immune scores and immune cell infiltration, which may contribute to immune evasion and tumor progression (Liu2023Pancancer).

In the context of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infections, a missense mutation in SYNGR2 (p.Arg63Cys) has been identified as influencing viral replication. This mutation is associated with reduced PCV2 replication, suggesting a protective effect against the virus. The p.Arg63Cys variant is more prevalent in European pig breeds and may have arisen as an adaptive evolution post-domestication (Walker2023Functional). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of SYNGR2 mutations in viral infections and cancer prognosis.

## Interactions
Synaptogyrin-2 (SYNGR2) is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of pathogen entry and intracellular trafficking. SYNGR2 interacts with the active subunit CdtB of the cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt) from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. This interaction is essential for the internalization and retrograde transport of CdtB, which associates with cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains, also known as lipid rafts (BoeszeBattaglia2017Internalization). SYNGR2 forms part of an intracellular complex with Derlin-2, facilitating the transport of CdtB from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (BoeszeBattaglia2020Internalization).

SYNGR2 also plays a role in viral infections. It interacts with viral proteins from Bunyavirus and Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), affecting viral titers and replication (BoeszeBattaglia2020Internalization; Walker2023Functional). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, SYNGR2 interacts with the spike protein, potentially facilitating viral entry into host cells (BoeszeBattaglia2024Cellugyrin). These interactions highlight SYNGR2's role as a key component in the pathways used by certain pathogens to gain entry into host cells.
