# EED

## Overview
The EED gene encodes the embryonic ectoderm development protein, a pivotal component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is integral to chromatin remodeling and gene silencing through histone modification. The EED protein is characterized by its seven-bladed β-propeller structure, formed by WD40 repeat domains, which facilitates its interaction with other proteins, such as EZH2, within the PRC2 complex (Rakotobe2008Mapping; Spellicy2019Three). This interaction is crucial for the tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a key marker of transcriptional repression (Margueron2009Role). EED's role extends to various biological processes, including embryonic development, hematopoietic maintenance, and tumor suppression, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and epigenetic regulation (Ueda2016Propagation; Lessard1999Functional). Mutations in the EED gene are linked to several clinical conditions, such as myelodysplastic syndrome and Cohen-Gibson syndrome, highlighting its critical role in human health and disease (Ueda2012EED; Hetzelt2021Manifestation).

## Structure
The EED protein is characterized by its seven-bladed β-propeller structure, formed by WD40 repeat domains. Each WD40 repeat consists of four antiparallel β-strands, creating a β-blade, which collectively form the β-propeller structure (Rakotobe2008Mapping; Spellicy2019Three). This structure is crucial for EED's interaction with other proteins, such as EZH2, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) (Spellicy2019Three). The EED protein's C-terminal domain specifically binds to tri-methylated histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), facilitating chromatin remodeling and gene silencing (Spellicy2019Three).

EED exists in multiple isoforms, with the His-tagged isoform 3 (EED3) being one of them (Rakotobe2008Mapping). The protein's structure includes unique features in certain β-blades, such as an α-helix in the fourth β-blade (Rakotobe2008Mapping). EED's interactions with other proteins, including HIV-1 proteins and components of PRC1, highlight its role in forming various protein complexes (Rakotobe2008Mapping; Cao2014The).

Post-translational modifications, such as methylation, play a role in regulating EED's function within the PRC2 complex (Margueron2009Role). These modifications are essential for the propagation of repressive histone marks, contributing to the protein's role in epigenetic regulation (Margueron2009Role).

## Function
The EED gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing through histone modification. EED interacts with trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) via its WD40 domain, which is essential for the allosteric activation of PRC2. This interaction facilitates the propagation of repressive histone marks, maintaining transcriptional repression and ensuring the stability of repressive chromatin domains (Margueron2009Role; Ueda2016Propagation).

EED is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression by maintaining the trimethylation of H3K27, a marker associated with gene repression. This activity is vital for processes such as embryonic development, hematopoietic maintenance, and tumor suppression (Ueda2016Propagation). The protein's structural integrity, particularly its aromatic cage, is crucial for its function, as mutations can lead to reduced levels of H3K27me3 and increased susceptibility to hematologic malignancies (Ueda2016Propagation).

EED also plays a role in regulating hemopoietic cell proliferation, acting as an inhibitor to prevent excessive cell proliferation and maintain cellular homeostasis (Lessard1999Functional). Additionally, EED is involved in TNF signaling, where it translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to TNF, interacting with nSMase2 and RACK1 to mediate TNF receptor 1 signaling (Philipp2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EED gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). In myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and related neoplasms, EED mutations impair PRC2 function, leading to reduced trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and contributing to the pathogenesis of these disorders (Ueda2012EED). EED mutations are also linked to Cohen-Gibson syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by overgrowth, intellectual disability, and sometimes epilepsy. Specific mutations, such as the heterozygous missense variant c.581A > G, p.(Asn194Ser), have been identified in individuals with this syndrome (Hetzelt2021Manifestation).

EED mutations can also result in overgrowth syndromes similar to Weaver syndrome, characterized by features like macrocephaly, facial dysmorphism, and intellectual disability (Cohen2016EEDassociated; Cohen2015A). These mutations disrupt the interaction between EED and EZH2, affecting the methyltransferase activity of PRC2 (Spellicy2019Three). In the context of heart disease, EED inactivation leads to dilated cardiomyopathy due to the deregulation of gene expression and increased histone acetylation, independent of H3K27me3 (Ai2017EED). High EED expression levels are associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC) (Yu2018Roles).

## Interactions
The EED protein is a crucial component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and interacts with several proteins to facilitate its role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. EED physically interacts with other PRC2 components, including EZH2, SUZ12, and RBBP4/7, forming a complex that is essential for the tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) (Tomassi2021Polycomb; Margueron2009Role). EED's interaction with EZH2 is particularly significant, as it stabilizes the catalytic domain of EZH2, enhancing its methyltransferase activity (Tomassi2021Polycomb).

EED also interacts with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) components, such as BMI1 and RING1B, acting as a shared component between PRC1 and PRC2. This interaction is crucial for recruiting PRC1 to H3K27me3 loci and enhancing PRC1-mediated H2A ubiquitin E3 ligase activity (Cao2014The). EED's binding to PRC1 components has been confirmed in various cell types, including prostate cancer cells and mouse embryonic stem cells (Cao2014The).

Additionally, EED interacts with YY1 and the Drosophila PcG protein Pho, as part of the EED-EZH PcG protein complex, which is involved in neural tissue induction in Xenopus embryos (Satijn2001The). These interactions highlight EED's central role in coordinating the activities of polycomb group complexes in epigenetic regulation.
