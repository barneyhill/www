The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate alpha and beta subunits that form a heterotetrameric receptor. Binding of insulin or other ligands to this receptor activates the insulin signaling pathway, which regulates glucose uptake and release, as well as the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and protein. Mutations in this gene underlie the inherited severe insulin resistance syndromes including type A insulin resistance syndrome, Donohue syndrome and Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
