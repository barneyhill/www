# LTC4S

## Overview
Leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) is a gene that encodes the enzyme leukotriene C4 synthase, a crucial component in the biosynthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes, which are potent inflammatory mediators. The enzyme is a membrane-associated protein belonging to the MAPEG (membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism) superfamily and is primarily found in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells such as mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils (Lam2002Leukotriene; Khan2021Mechanistic). LTC4S catalyzes the conjugation of leukotriene A4 with glutathione to form leukotriene C4, a reaction that is pivotal in the inflammatory response, particularly in conditions like asthma (Samuelsson1987Leukotrienes; Khan2021Mechanistic). The gene's expression and the enzyme's activity are influenced by genetic polymorphisms, which have been linked to various inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases, underscoring its clinical significance (Iovannisci2007Association; Sampson2000Variant).

## Structure
The human leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) is a membrane-bound enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes. The primary structure of LTC4S consists of a 150 amino acid polypeptide, which includes two potential protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites and one potential N-glycosylation site (Lam2002Leukotriene). The secondary structure analysis reveals that LTC4S shares significant homology with the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP), featuring overlapping hydrophobic domains and similar hydrophilic loops (Lam2002Leukotriene). 

The tertiary structure of LTC4S involves the folding of these domains, contributing to its function as a membrane-associated protein. The enzyme forms a noncovalent homodimer, which is crucial for its activity (Lam2002Leukotriene). The active site of LTC4S is involved in the conjugation of leukotriene A4 with glutathione (GSH), facilitated by key residues such as Arg-51 and Tyr-93, which play roles in substrate binding and catalysis (Lam2002Leukotriene). 

LTC4S is part of the MAPEG protein superfamily, sharing structural features with other members like FLAP and microsomal glutathione S-transferases (Lam2002Leukotriene). The enzyme's structure and function are regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can modulate its activity (Lam2002Leukotriene).

## Function
Leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes, which are inflammatory lipid mediators. LTC4S catalyzes the conversion of leukotriene A4 (LTA4) to leukotriene C4 (LTC4) by conjugating LTA4 with glutathione. This reaction is a key step in the leukotriene biosynthesis pathway, which begins with the conversion of arachidonic acid into 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) by the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) (Miyata2020Cysteinyl; Khan2021Mechanistic).

LTC4, along with its metabolites LTD4 and LTE4, are known as cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) and are potent inflammatory mediators. They exert their effects by binding to specific G-protein-coupled receptors, namely CysLT1 and CysLT2, which are expressed in various cell types, including mast cells, bronchial smooth muscle cells, macrophages, monocytes, and eosinophils (Khan2021Mechanistic). These interactions lead to physiological responses such as bronchoconstriction, increased vascular permeability, and mucus secretion, contributing to the inflammatory response in conditions like asthma (Liu2021Leukotriene; Samuelsson1987Leukotrienes).

In healthy human cells, LTC4S is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum of mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils, where it facilitates the normal inflammatory response crucial for defending against pathogens and repairing tissue damage (Khan2021Mechanistic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the LTC4S gene have been associated with various inflammatory diseases, particularly asthma and cardiovascular conditions. The -444 A/C polymorphism in the LTC4S promoter is linked to increased expression of the enzyme, leading to higher synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes, which are key mediators in asthma. This variant is more prevalent in patients with aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) and is associated with increased bronchoconstriction and asthma severity (Kawagishi2002Leukotriene; Sampson2000Variant). 

In cardiovascular diseases, the -444 C allele has been associated with an increased risk of coronary artery calcium in young women, suggesting a role in subclinical cardiovascular disease through inflammatory pathways (Iovannisci2007Association). Conversely, the -1072 AA genotype is linked to an increased risk of ischemic cerebrovascular disease, while the -444 CC genotype is associated with a decreased risk, indicating that these polymorphisms may influence disease susceptibility differently (Freiberg2008Promotor).

In asthma, the -444 C allele is also associated with increased leukotriene production, which may influence the clinical response to leukotriene receptor antagonists, highlighting the potential for personalized treatment strategies based on genetic profiling (Sampson2000Variant).

## Interactions
Leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S) is involved in several key interactions with other proteins that are crucial for its function in leukotriene biosynthesis. LTC4S interacts with 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), both of which are essential for the production of leukotriene C4, a potent inflammatory mediator. These interactions occur at distinct regions of the LTC4S protein. FLAP binds to the N-terminal part or the first hydrophobic region of LTC4S, while 5-LO binds to the second hydrophilic loop of LTC4S. These interactions facilitate the transfer of arachidonic acid to 5-LO and anchor 5-LO at the nuclear envelope following cell activation (Strid2009Distinct).

LTC4S is also known to form homotrimers, which are stabilized through helix-helix interactions involving its hydrophobic regions. The first hydrophobic region (amino acids 6-27) and the third hydrophobic region (amino acids 114-135) are particularly important for this oligomerization process (Svartz2006Identification). These structural features enable LTC4S to localize to the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum, where it participates in the assembly of a multiprotein biosynthetic complex essential for leukotriene synthesis (Svartz2006Identification).
