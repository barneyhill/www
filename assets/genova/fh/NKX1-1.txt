# NKX1-1

## Overview
NKX1-1 is a gene that encodes the NK1 homeobox 1 protein, which is a member of the NKL subclass of homeobox transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by their role in regulating gene expression during development and cellular differentiation. NK1 homeobox 1 is involved in the regulation of developmental processes and is implicated in the pathogenesis of various hematopoietic malignancies, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myeloid malignancies. The protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, influencing cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis through its interaction with chromatin and transcription factor binding sites (Nagel2017NKL; Nagel2021The; Nagel2019NKL).

## Clinical Significance
NKX1-1, a member of the NKL homeobox gene family, is implicated in various hematopoietic malignancies due to its deregulation. In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), NKX1-1 is ectopically expressed, which is not typical for hematopoietic cells. This aberrant expression is often associated with chromosomal translocations that activate NKX1-1, contributing to the oncogenic processes in T-ALL by promoting cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis-related pathways (Nagel2017NKL). The deregulation of NKX1-1 and other NKL homeobox genes in T-cell lymphomas is linked to chromatin modifications and mutations in transcription factor binding sites, which can lead to disturbed proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, highlighting their role in tumorigenesis (Nagel2021The).

In myeloid malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), NKX1-1 is among the NKL homeobox genes that are deregulated. This deregulation is part of a broader pattern where these genes are either ectopically expressed or belong to the hematopoietic NKL-code, affecting transcription, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (Nagel2019NKL). The aberrant expression of NKX1-1 in these contexts underscores its potential role in the pathogenesis of hematopoietic cancers.
