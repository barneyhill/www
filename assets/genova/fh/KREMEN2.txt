# KREMEN2

## Overview
KREMEN2 is a gene that encodes the kringle containing transmembrane protein 2, a crucial component in cellular signaling pathways. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane receptor and plays a significant role in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is vital for cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Kremen2 functions as a high-affinity receptor for the Dickkopf1 (Dkk1) protein, modulating the activity of Wnt co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 through endocytosis, thereby influencing Wnt signaling in a context-dependent manner (Mao2002Kremen; Cselenyi2008ContextDependent). The protein's interactions and regulatory mechanisms are essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and proper developmental processes, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Long2023Increased; Sun2023Kremen2).

## Function
KREMEN2 encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Kremen2 acts as a high-affinity receptor for Dickkopf1 (Dkk1), forming a complex with LRP5/6, which leads to the endocytosis and removal of LRP6 from the plasma membrane, thereby inhibiting Wnt signaling (Mao2002Kremen). This regulatory mechanism is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and proper developmental processes.

In the presence of Dkk1, Kremen2 promotes the endocytosis of LRP5 and LRP6, inhibiting Wnt signaling. However, in the absence of Dkk1, Kremen2 enhances the cell-surface localization of LRP6, promoting Wnt-β-catenin signaling (Cselenyi2008ContextDependent). This dual role allows Kremen2 to act as a context-dependent regulator, influencing the localization and activity of Wnt co-receptors.

Kremen2 is primarily active at the cell membrane, where it modulates the interactions between Dkk1 and LRP5/6, impacting the downstream signaling pathways that govern cell fate decisions. This modulation is vital for processes such as embryonic development and bone formation, where precise control of Wnt signaling is necessary (Schulze2010Negative).

## Clinical Significance
KREMEN2 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In colon cancer, high KREMEN2 expression is associated with poor prognosis, including shorter overall survival and progression-free survival. It is linked to advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis, suggesting its role as an independent prognostic indicator (Long2023Increased). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), KREMEN2 is highly expressed and correlates with poor patient outcomes. It promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis by preventing SOCS3-mediated degradation of EGFR, thereby activating the PI3K-AKT and JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathways (Sun2023Kremen2).

In gastric cancer, KREMEN2 is upregulated and associated with higher pathological grades. Knockdown studies show that reducing KREMEN2 expression inhibits tumor growth and migration, indicating its role in cancer progression through the PI3K/Akt pathway (Chen2021Knockdown). KREMEN2's interaction with Kremen1, a tumor suppressor, suggests that KREMEN2 may inhibit Kremen1-induced cell death, providing a survival advantage to cancer cells (Sumia2019Kremen1induced).

## Interactions
KREMEN2 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various signaling pathways. It acts as a high-affinity receptor for the Dickkopf1 (Dkk1) protein, forming a ternary complex with Dkk1 and LRP6, which leads to the endocytosis and removal of the Wnt receptor LRP6 from the plasma membrane, thereby inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Mao2002Kremen). KREMEN2 also interacts with the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. This interaction prevents SOCS3-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), stabilizing EGFR and promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Sun2023Kremen2).

KREMEN2 can form heterodimers with KREMEN1, inhibiting KREMEN1-induced apoptotic signaling. This interaction is crucial as KREMEN1 requires homodimerization to trigger apoptosis, and KREMEN2 acts as a potent inhibitor of this process (Sumia2019Kremen1induced). In SMARCB1-deficient cancers, KREMEN2 suppresses apoptosis by promoting KREMEN1 homodimer formation, and its downregulation leads to increased KREMEN1 monomerization and apoptosis (Sasaki2024Targeting). These interactions highlight KREMEN2's role in modulating cell signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
