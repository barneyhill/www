# ECT2

## Overview
ECT2, or epithelial cell transforming 2, is a gene that encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) protein involved in the regulation of the Rho family of GTPases, particularly RhoA. The ECT2 protein plays a pivotal role in cytokinesis, the final stage of cell division, by facilitating the formation of the contractile ring and cleavage furrow ingression. Structurally, ECT2 contains several key domains, including a Dbl homology (DH) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and BRCT repeats, which are essential for its function and localization during mitosis (Chalamalasetty2006Influence; Frenette2012An). The protein's activity is regulated through phosphorylation and interactions with other proteins, such as the MKlp1-MgcRacGAP complex and anillin, which are crucial for its role in cell division (Niiya2005Phosphorylation; Frenette2012An). Clinically, ECT2 is significant due to its overexpression in various cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis, and its involvement in renal diseases like focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (Izu2012Nonfunction; Soltan2023Integration).

## Structure
The ECT2 protein, encoded by the human ECT2 gene, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) with a complex molecular structure. It contains several key domains, including a Dbl homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which are crucial for its function in catalyzing nucleotide exchange on RhoA, a small GTPase involved in cytokinesis (Chalamalasetty2006Influence; Frenette2012An). The PH domain is involved in the protein's localization to the cell cortex, likely through interactions with the plasma membrane (Chalamalasetty2006Influence).

The ECT2 protein also features two BRCT (BRCA1 C Terminus) repeats, which are essential for its localization to the central spindle during cell division (Chalamalasetty2006Influence). These domains facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as the MKlp1-MgcRacGAP complex, necessary for proper cytokinesis (Chalamalasetty2006Influence).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating ECT2's activity, particularly during mitosis (Liot2011APCcdh1). ECT2 is also subject to proteasomal degradation mediated by the APC/Cdh1 complex, which is crucial for controlling its levels post-mitosis (Liot2011APCcdh1). The protein's structure and function are further influenced by splice variant isoforms, which can affect its localization and activity.

## Function
ECT2 (epithelial cell transforming 2) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a critical role in cytokinesis, the final step of cell division. It primarily regulates the Rho family of GTPases, particularly RhoA, which is essential for the formation of the contractile ring and cleavage furrow ingression during cell division (Chalamalasetty2006Influence; Kamijo2006Dissecting). ECT2 is recruited to the central spindle during anaphase through its interaction with the centralspindlin complex, which includes MgcRacGAP and MKLP1, facilitating the localization of RhoA to the equatorial region (Kamijo2006Dissecting; Zuo2014Controlling).

Phosphorylation of ECT2 by mitotic kinases such as Cdk1 and Plk1 is crucial for its function. This modification enhances its catalytic activity, promoting the accumulation of GTP-bound RhoA, which is necessary for cytokinesis (Niiya2005Phosphorylation). ECT2's activity is regulated by its N-terminal autoinhibitory domain, which interacts with its C-terminal catalytic domains to control its GEF activity (Zuo2014Controlling).

ECT2 is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, localizing to the central spindle and cell cortex during mitosis. Its precise temporal and spatial regulation is essential for successful cytokinesis, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and preventing the formation of binucleate cells (Chalamalasetty2006Influence).

## Clinical Significance
The ECT2 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various cancers and renal diseases. In cancer, ECT2 is often overexpressed, correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis in several types, including ovarian, breast, gastric, pancreatic, colorectal, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Soltan2023Integration). High ECT2 expression is linked to poorer survival outcomes in cancers such as colorectal adenocarcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, and sarcoma (Soltan2023Integration). Genetic alterations in ECT2, primarily amplifications, are frequent in ovarian epithelial tumors, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and cervical cancer, while mutations are more common in melanoma and colorectal cancer (Soltan2023Integration).

In renal diseases, ECT2 mutations are implicated in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a condition characterized by proteinuria and renal failure. ECT2 deficiency disrupts tight junctions in epithelial cells, leading to tubulointerstitial injury and subsequent FSGS (Izu2012Nonfunction). The gene's role in maintaining cell polarity and tight junctions is crucial for renal function, and its dysfunction can result in significant renal pathology (Izu2012Nonfunction). These findings underscore ECT2's potential as a therapeutic target in both oncology and nephrology.

## Interactions
ECT2 interacts with several proteins crucial for its role in cytokinesis. It localizes to the central spindle through its BRCT domain, interacting with the MKlp1-MgcRacGAP complex, which is essential for its proper targeting and function during cell division (Chalamalasetty2006Influence). This interaction is negatively regulated by Cdk1 phosphorylation of ECT2, while the MKlp2-Aurora-B complex may regulate ECT2's central spindle association indirectly (Chalamalasetty2006Influence).

ECT2 also interacts with anillin, a cortical protein, to stabilize central spindle microtubules at the cortex during cytokinesis. This interaction is mediated by the PH domain of ECT2 and the Anillin Homology Domain (AHD) of anillin, and is crucial for generating active RhoA at the cortex, necessary for contractile ring formation (Frenette2012An). The interaction between ECT2 and anillin is independent of Cyk-4 and RhoA, suggesting a direct binding facilitated by specific domains (Frenette2012An).

In the context of cancer, ECT2 interacts with the PKC-Par6 complex, which is crucial for its oncogenic function. Phosphorylation at Thr-328 regulates its binding to this complex, leading to the activation of Rac1, a critical effector in ECT2-dependent transformation (Justilien2011Oncogenic).
