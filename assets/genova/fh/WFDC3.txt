# WFDC3

## Overview
WFDC3 is a gene that encodes the protein WAP four-disulfide core domain 3, which is part of the whey acidic protein (WAP) family. This family is characterized by the presence of WAP domains, which are known for their roles in protease inhibition and maintaining epithelial homeostasis. The WFDC3 protein is implicated in various biological processes, including immune response modulation and epithelial integrity maintenance. It is expressed in multiple tissues, such as the lung and testis, suggesting its involvement in respiratory and reproductive health. In the context of colorectal cancer, WFDC3 functions as a tumor suppressor by interacting with estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) to inhibit tumor metastasis through the repression of the TGFBR1 signaling pathway. This interaction highlights its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Small2016The; Liu2023WFDC3).

## Function
WFDC3, a member of the whey acidic protein (WAP) four-disulfide core domain family, is involved in various molecular processes, primarily related to immune response and epithelial integrity. The protein encoded by WFDC3 is characterized by the presence of WAP domains, which are known for their roles in protease inhibition and maintaining epithelial homeostasis (Small2016The). Although the specific functions of WFDC3 in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, it is suggested that WFDC3 may play a role in modulating inflammation and protecting against microbial infections due to its structural similarities with other WFDC proteins (Small2016The).

WFDC3 is expressed in various tissues, including the lung and testis, indicating its potential involvement in reproductive and respiratory health (Small2016The). The protein's activity in these tissues suggests a role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and possibly contributing to immune defense mechanisms. While the precise cellular and molecular activities of WFDC3 remain to be fully defined, its expression pattern and domain structure imply a function in epithelial protection and immune modulation, similar to other proteins in the WFDC family (Small2016The).

## Clinical Significance
WFDC3 has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene in colorectal cancer (CRC), where its expression is significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and advanced TNM stage. High expression levels of WFDC3 correlate with favorable overall survival and disease-free survival in CRC patients, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target. The gene inhibits tumor metastasis by promoting estrogen receptor beta (ERβ)-mediated transcriptional repression of TGFBR1, a key player in cancer progression (Liu2023WFDC3).

WFDC3 interacts with ERβ, enhancing its stability and preventing its degradation, which is crucial for the estrogen-mediated inhibition of CRC cell migration and invasion. This interaction also leads to the suppression of TGFBR1 and its downstream factors, SMAD2 and SMAD3, further reducing metastatic potential (Liu2023WFDC3). The clinical significance of WFDC3 is underscored by its potential as a biomarker for therapies targeting the estrogen/ERβ pathway in CRC patients (Liu2023WFDC3). In other contexts, WFDC3 has been noted to be downregulated in AEC syndrome, although its specific clinical implications in this condition are not detailed (Clements2012Mutations).

## Interactions
WFDC3 interacts with estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting tumor metastasis. WFDC3 enhances the stability of ERβ by preventing its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This stabilization is achieved by reducing the ubiquitination of ERβ, thereby increasing its expression at the post-transcriptional level (Liu2023WFDC3). The interaction between WFDC3 and ERβ was confirmed using experimental methods such as co-immunoprecipitation and GST/His-tag pull-down assays (Liu2023WFDC3).

WFDC3, through its interaction with ERβ, plays a significant role in the transcriptional repression of TGFBR1, a receptor involved in the TGFβ signaling pathway. This repression is important for reducing CRC cell migration and invasion, as TGFBR1 and its downstream factors, SMAD2 and SMAD3, are associated with cancer metastasis (Liu2023WFDC3). The interaction between WFDC3 and ERβ also enhances the binding of ERβ to specific sites on the TGFBR1 promoter, leading to decreased transcriptional activity of TGFBR1 (Liu2023WFDC3). These findings highlight the role of WFDC3 in modulating the ERβ/TGFβ signaling pathway to inhibit tumor progression in CRC.
