# CENPB

## Overview
CENPB, or centromere protein B, is a gene that encodes a DNA-binding protein crucial for centromere function and chromosomal stability. The protein, also referred to as centromere protein B, is categorized as a DNA-binding protein and plays a pivotal role in the assembly and maintenance of centromeric chromatin. It specifically binds to a 17-base pair sequence known as the CENP-B box within the alpha-satellite DNA, facilitating the organization of centromeric DNA into higher-order structures essential for kinetochore formation and chromosome segregation during cell division (Gamba2020From; Muro1992Centromere). CENPB's interactions with other centromeric proteins, such as CENP-A and CENP-C, underscore its importance in maintaining genomic stability and preventing chromosomal mis-segregation (Ohzeki2020Human; Gamba2020From). Additionally, CENPB is implicated in various clinical conditions, including its role as an autoantigen in autoimmune diseases and its involvement in cancer pathogenesis (Zian2020Proteomics; Tian2021LINC01123).

## Structure
CENPB, or centromere protein B, is a DNA-binding protein with a complex molecular structure that plays a crucial role in centromere function. The primary structure of CENPB consists of 599 amino acids in humans, with a molecular weight of approximately 80 kDa (Gamba2020From). The protein contains a DNA-binding domain located at the NH2-terminus, which includes four potential alpha helices forming a helix-turn-helix motif. This domain is responsible for binding to the CENP-B box, a specific 17-bp sequence within centromeric alpha-satellite DNA (Gamba2020From; Yoda1992A).

The COOH-terminal region of CENPB contains a dimerization domain, allowing the protein to form an antiparallel homodimer. This dimerization enables CENPB to bind two separate CENP-B boxes, facilitating the organization of centromeric DNA into a higher-order structure (Gamba2020From; Kitagawa1995Analysis). The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by distinct domains, including a central domain of unknown function and regions rich in acidic amino acids, contributing to its acidic nature (Earnshaw1987Molecular; Yoda1992A).

CENPB undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, trimethylation, and SUMOylation, which influence its stability and function at centromeres (Gamba2020From). These modifications may regulate interactions with other proteins and affect chromatin architecture.

## Function
CENPB, or centromere protein B, is a DNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in the assembly and function of centromeres in human cells. It specifically binds to a 17-base pair DNA sequence known as the CENP-B box, which is part of the alpha-satellite DNA found at human centromeres (Pluta1992Identification; Muro1992Centromere). This binding is essential for the organization of higher-order chromatin structures at the centromere, contributing to the formation of the kinetochore complex, which is crucial for proper chromosome segregation during cell division (Gamba2020From; Muro1992Centromere).

CENPB is active in the nucleus, particularly at centromeric regions, where it influences the structural organization of the centromere and kinetochore assembly (Pluta1992Identification). The protein's interaction with the CENP-B box facilitates the positioning of CENP-A nucleosomes, which are vital for maintaining centromere identity and function (Gamba2020From). CENPB also interacts with other centromere proteins, such as CENP-C, to ensure the stability and integrity of the centromere, which is essential for high-fidelity chromosome segregation (Ohzeki2020Human; Gamba2020From). These interactions highlight CENPB's role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing chromosomal mis-segregation.

## Clinical Significance
CENPB has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disrupted interactions. In glioma, CENPB is upregulated and contributes to radioresistance through the LINC01123/miR-151a/CENPB axis. This axis involves LINC01123 sponging miR-151a, leading to increased CENPB expression, which enhances tumor growth and resistance to radiation therapy (Tian2021LINC01123).

In the context of inherited rectal cancer, a variant in the CENPB gene has been identified as potentially significant. This variant is part of the WNT signaling pathway, which is often hyperactivated in colorectal cancers, suggesting a role for CENPB in colorectal carcinogenesis (Wallander2021Massive).

CENPB is also recognized as a major autoantigen in autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma. Patients with systemic sclerosis often have anti-centromere autoantibodies targeting CENPB, particularly its N-terminal region. This immune response is associated with other conditions like primary biliary cirrhosis, indicating a potential overlap in autoimmune pathophysiology (Zian2020Proteomics).

## Interactions
CENP-B interacts with DNA and other proteins to play a crucial role in centromere function. It specifically binds to a 17-bp sequence known as the CENP-B box within alphoid DNA, forming a stable complex that is essential for centromeric heterochromatin assembly (Kitagawa1995Analysis; Yoda1992A). CENP-B binds to DNA as a monomer, unlike helix-loop-helix proteins that bind as dimers, indicating its unique DNA-binding properties (Kitagawa1995Analysis).

CENP-B also forms dimers through its COOH-terminal region, which is distinct from its DNA-binding domain. This dimerization is crucial for its function and is conserved across species (Kitagawa1995Analysis; Yoda1992A). The protein is involved in forming multiprotein complexes, such as the CENP-B/Daxx complex, which is important for maintaining centromere chromatin integrity by facilitating histone deposition via the H3.3-specific chaperone Daxx (Morozov2017CENPB).

CENP-B interacts with other centromeric proteins, including CENP-A and CENP-C, and recruits heterochromatin-promoting factors like Suv39h1 and HP1, influencing chromatin states at the centromere (Otake2020CENPB). It also interacts with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and undergoes poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation upon DNA damage (Saxena2002Centromere).
