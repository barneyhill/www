# QARS1

## Overview
QARS1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase 1, which is a member of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of glutamine to its corresponding tRNA, a process essential for translating genetic information into functional proteins. Glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase 1 is integral to the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) and is involved in maintaining translational fidelity and cellular homeostasis. Beyond its primary function in protein synthesis, the enzyme also participates in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in modulating apoptotic signals through its interaction with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) (Sung2022Functional; Yu2021Aminoacyl-tRNA). Mutations in the QARS1 gene have been linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its critical role in brain development and function (Zhang2014Mutations; Chan2022A).

## Structure
The QARS1 gene encodes the glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase 1, an enzyme crucial for protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of glutamine to its corresponding tRNA. The molecular structure of QARS1 includes several important domains, such as the catalytic domain (CATD) and the tRNA-binding domain (ABD). The wild-type Arg265 residue in the CATD is involved in forming salt bridges with Glu449 and His450, which are essential for maintaining the proper conformation and catalytic function of the enzyme (Sakka2024Microcephaly). The Arg745 residue in the ABD is crucial for tRNA binding, and mutations at this site can disrupt ionic interactions, affecting the enzyme's function (Sakka2024Microcephaly).

QARS1 also contains an N-terminal domain (NTD) that is important for forming the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) and interacting with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) in a glutamine-dependent manner (Yu2021Aminoacyl-tRNA). The NTD is involved in the QARS1-ASK1 interaction, which is crucial for regulating apoptotic signals (Yu2021Aminoacyl-tRNA). The QARS1 protein is part of a tertiary subcomplex within the MSC, which includes interactions with the N-terminus of RARS1 and AIMP1, facilitating tRNA binding through dynamic structural changes (Kong2020Cell‐based).

## Function
The QARS1 gene encodes glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase 1, an enzyme that plays a critical role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of glutamine to its corresponding tRNA. This process, known as aminoacylation, is essential for the accurate translation of genetic information into proteins, ensuring proper protein assembly within the cytoplasm of human cells (Zhang2014Mutations; Chan2022A).

In healthy human cells, QARS1 is highly expressed in the developing fetal brain, particularly in regions such as the ventricular zone and cortical plate, highlighting its importance in early brain development (Zhang2014Mutations). The enzyme is a component of the multisynthetase complex (MSC), where it interacts with other proteins to maintain translational fidelity and support normal cellular functions (Zhang2014Mutations).

Beyond its role in protein synthesis, QARS1 is involved in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) in a glutamine-dependent manner, modulating apoptotic signals and contributing to cell survival. This interaction suggests that QARS1 may act as an intracellular sensor for amino acid levels, linking glutamine availability to apoptotic regulation (Sung2022Functional; Yu2021Aminoacyl-tRNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the QARS1 gene, which encodes glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase 1, are associated with several severe neurodevelopmental disorders. These include a syndrome characterized by microcephaly, progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, and epilepsy. The epilepsy linked to QARS1 variants is often drug-resistant and severe, manifesting as early infantile developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) and epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS) (Chan2022A). 

Pathogenic variants in QARS1 are linked to a rare autosomal recessive disorder known as microcephaly, progressive seizures, and cerebral and cerebellar atrophy (MSCCA). This condition often results in pharmacoresistant seizures, severe developmental delays, and hypotonia (Sakka2024Microcephaly). 

Studies have identified specific mutations, such as p.Gly45Val and p.Tyr57His, which significantly impair the aminoacylation activity of QARS1, leading to severe neurological symptoms (Zhang2014Mutations). The mutations can cause protein misfolding, affecting the enzyme's solubility and function, which is crucial for normal brain development (Zhang2014Mutations). 

The clinical presentation of QARS1 mutations can vary, with some patients exhibiting milder phenotypes, including less severe intellectual disability and fewer seizures (Johannesen2019Defining).

## Interactions
QARS1, or glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase 1, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function beyond protein synthesis. QARS1 forms a protein complex with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) in a glutamine-dependent manner. This interaction involves the C-terminal domains of both proteins and results in decreased kinase activity of ASK1, thereby reducing apoptosis (Sung2022Functional; Yu2021Aminoacyl-tRNA). The N-terminal domain of QARS1 is essential for this interaction, and mutations in this domain can affect QARS1's catalytic activity without impacting its tRNA binding ability (Yu2021Aminoacyl-tRNA).

Within the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC), QARS1 interacts with other components such as AIMP1 and RARS1. The N-terminus of QARS1 interacts with both the N-terminus of AIMP1 and RARS1, while its C-terminus is not involved in these interactions (Kong2020Cell‐based). These interactions suggest that QARS1 is positioned on the same side as the N- and C-terminus of AIMP1 and the N-terminus of RARS1, indicating its role in the structural configuration of the MSC (Kong2020Cell‐based).
