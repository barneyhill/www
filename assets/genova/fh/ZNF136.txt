# ZNF136

## Overview
ZNF136 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 136, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains and a Krüppel-associated Box (KRAB) domain. These structural features suggest that ZNF136 functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, influencing gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences (Chick2024Analysis). The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it plays a role in modulating the transcriptional landscape of the cell (Chick2024Analysis). Although the precise biological functions of ZNF136 remain largely unexplored, it has been implicated in various cellular processes and diseases, including schizophrenia, aggressive periodontitis, and diabetic nephropathy (Taiete2019Novel; Chick2024Analysis; Mansour2023Microvascular). The interactions of ZNF136 with other proteins, such as KAP1 and MAGE-A3, further underscore its role in transcriptional regulation and cellular response mechanisms (Xiao2014MAGE).

## Structure
ZNF136 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are known for facilitating DNA binding. These domains typically consist of a beta sheet and an alpha helix stabilized by a zinc ion, contributing to the protein's ability to interact with DNA (Chick2024Analysis). ZNF136 contains a Krüppel-associated Box (KRAB) domain, which is thought to function as a transcriptional repressor, although the specific functional roles of ZNF136 are not well characterized (Chick2024Analysis).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which is common among zinc finger proteins, potentially affecting its function and interactions. ZNF136 may also have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can result in variations in its structure and function (Chick2024Analysis).

While the primary structure of ZNF136 includes the sequence of amino acids forming the zinc finger and KRAB domains, detailed information about its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures is not provided in the available context. The lack of specific structural data limits the understanding of how these domains are organized within the protein.

## Function
ZNF136 encodes a zinc-finger protein characterized by the presence of a Krüppel-associated Box (KRAB) domain, which is thought to function as a transcriptional repressor (Chick2024Analysis). Zinc-finger proteins, including ZNF136, typically act as transcription factors, binding to specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. This regulation is crucial for various cellular processes, such as cell differentiation and development, by modulating the transcription of target genes (Chick2024Analysis).

The specific functions of ZNF136 in healthy human cells remain largely unexplored, and its role in normal cellular processes is not well characterized (Chick2024Analysis). However, it is known that ZNF136 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell (Chick2024Analysis). Small-scale transcriptomic studies suggest that ZNF136 is downregulated in schizophrenia, indicating a potential role in the disorder, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Chick2024Analysis). Despite its involvement in transcriptional repression, the physiological role of ZNF136 in non-infected cells has not been detailed in the available studies (Liu2013A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZNF136 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In schizophrenia, rare protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in ZNF136 have been identified at exome-wide significance, suggesting a potential role in the genetic liability of the disorder. However, the specific mechanisms by which these mutations contribute to schizophrenia remain unclear (Chick2024Analysis).

ZNF136 has also been implicated in aggressive periodontitis (AgP). A missense variant in ZNF136 was found to have a deleterious effect on protein function, although its direct association with periodontitis is not well established (Taiete2019Novel).

In the context of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), ZNF136 has been associated with diabetic nephropathy. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ZNF136 showed a significant association with nephropathy, indicating its potential role in the pathogenesis of T2DM-related complications (Mansour2023Microvascular).

Additionally, ZNF136 has been identified in studies of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, where differentially methylated regions in its promoter may serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers (Patel2023Plasma).

## Interactions
ZNF136, a KRAB zinc finger protein, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function as a transcriptional repressor. It interacts with the KAP1 protein, a known co-repressor, to mediate gene repression. This interaction is typical for KRAB domain-containing proteins, which recruit KAP1 to form a repressive complex on target genes (Xiao2014MAGE).

The interaction of ZNF136 with MAGE proteins, specifically MAGE-A3, has been studied to understand its role in gene repression. Unlike other KRAB zinc finger proteins such as ZNF382, ZNF136 does not show enhanced ubiquitination or degradation in the presence of MAGE-A3, indicating a selective modulation by MAGE proteins based on the KRAB domain structure (Xiao2014MAGE).

Additionally, ZNF136 has been identified to interact with a cellular host factor homologous to ZNF136, which is a repressor of transcription. This interaction was discovered in the context of the hepatitis C virus, where the truncated nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) of the virus interacts with ZNF136, suggesting a potential role in modulating host cellular processes (Liu2013A). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory roles ZNF136 plays in transcriptional repression and cellular response mechanisms.
