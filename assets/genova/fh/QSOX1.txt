# QSOX1

## Overview
Quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1, a member of the FAD-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase family. This enzyme is integral to the formation of disulfide bonds, which are crucial for protein folding and stability. QSOX1 is characterized by its multi-domain structure, including thioredoxin-like domains and an Erv/ALR FAD-binding domain, which facilitate its role in oxidative protein folding. The protein is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, but it is also secreted into the extracellular space, where it contributes to extracellular matrix assembly and cell adhesion. QSOX1's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating cell communication. Alterations in QSOX1 expression have been linked to various cancers, where it influences tumor growth, invasion, and patient prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Grossman2013An; Sun2021Quiescin; Katchman2011Quiescin).

## Structure
The QSOX1 protein is a multi-domain enzyme characterized by the fusion of thioredoxin (Trx) domains and an Erv/ALR FAD-binding domain. It includes two thioredoxin-like domains (Trx1 and Trx2), a helix-rich region (HRR), and a C-terminal Erv domain, which is involved in the oxidation of thiol groups to disulfides (Soloviev2013Elevated; Katchman2011Quiescin). The Trx domains contain redox-active CXXC motifs, crucial for the enzyme's function in electron transfer (LimorWaisberg2013Diversification). The Erv domain also features a redox-active di-cysteine motif and is responsible for binding the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity (LimorWaisberg2013Diversification).

QSOX1 exists in two major isoforms, QSOX1-L and QSOX1-S, resulting from alternative splicing. The long form, QSOX1-L, includes a transmembrane domain, while the short form lacks this feature (Katchman2011Quiescin; Pernodet2012High). The protein is secreted and found in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and extracellular spaces, indicating its role in protein folding and stability (Pernodet2012High). The enzyme's structure allows for flexibility and conformational changes necessary for its function in oxidative protein folding (Grossman2013An).

## Function
Quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the formation of disulfide bonds, which are essential for protein folding and stability. This enzyme is part of the FAD-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase family and is involved in the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups to form disulfide bonds in proteins, a critical process during protein folding (Soloviev2013Elevated; Katchman2011Quiescin). QSOX1 is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it assists in the folding of nascent proteins, often in collaboration with protein disulfide isomerase (Katchman2013Expression; Katchman2011Quiescin).

In addition to its intracellular roles, QSOX1 is secreted into the extracellular space, where it contributes to the incorporation of laminin into the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is important for cell adhesion and maintaining tissue structure (Ilani2013A; Poillet2014QSOX1). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the proper assembly of ECM components, such as the basement membrane, which is essential for cell adherence and signaling (Grossman2013An). QSOX1's function in ECM assembly and cell adhesion highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating cell communication in healthy human cells (Grossman2013An).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the QSOX1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, affecting tumor growth, invasion, and patient prognosis. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), QSOX1 is involved in intrinsic resistance to gefitinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The study by Wang et al. suggests that QSOX1 expression, regulated by NSUN2-mediated m5C hypermethylation, contributes to treatment resistance, with high levels of QSOX1 associated with poorer overall survival in NSCLC patients (Wang2023Aberrant).

In breast cancer, particularly the luminal B subtype, elevated QSOX1 expression correlates with poor relapse-free and overall survival. This suggests its potential as a prognostic marker, especially in ER+ tumors where its expression is notably higher (Katchman2013Expression).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), QSOX1 expression is lower in tumor tissues compared to peritumoral tissues. High QSOX1 levels are associated with longer overall survival, and its overexpression enhances the efficacy of sorafenib, a cancer treatment drug, by promoting ferroptosis and inhibiting NRF2 activation (Sun2021Quiescin).

QSOX1 is also overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where it promotes tumor cell invasion through the activation of matrix metalloproteinases, suggesting its role in enhancing metastatic potential (Katchman2011Quiescin). In lung cancer, QSOX1 is secreted by cancer cells and may serve as a biomarker for diagnosis due to its elevated levels in patient serum (Sung2018Quiescin).

## Interactions
QSOX1 (quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It plays a significant role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly by interacting with laminin and fibronectin, which are crucial for tumor cell adhesion and penetration (Grossman2013An). QSOX1 also interacts with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP-2 and MMP-9, facilitating their activation, which is essential for tumor invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer cells (Katchman2011Quiescin).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), QSOX1 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, which affects EGFR signaling and NRF2 activation (Sun2021Quiescin). This interaction enhances the sensitivity of HCC cells to oxidative stress and contributes to the therapeutic effects of sorafenib, a drug used in HCC treatment (Sun2021Quiescin).

In plants, QSOX1 interacts with S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels during immune responses. This interaction involves the oxidative inactivation of GSNOR, which modulates ROS generation and affects plant immunity (Chae2021Redox).
