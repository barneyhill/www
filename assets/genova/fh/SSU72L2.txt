# SSU72L2

## Overview
The SSU72L2 gene encodes the protein SSU72 like 2, which is a member of the phosphatase family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription and RNA processing. As a phosphatase, SSU72 like 2 plays a critical role in dephosphorylating specific substrates, which is essential for the modulation of signaling pathways and cellular homeostasis. The precise biological functions and mechanisms of action of SSU72 like 2 are still under investigation, but its involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway suggests a significant role in cellular growth and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and regulation of SSU72 like 2 could provide insights into its potential implications in various diseases and therapeutic applications.
