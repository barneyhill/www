# TPX2

## Overview
The TPX2 gene encodes the TPX2 microtubule nucleation factor, a critical protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and spindle assembly during mitosis. As a microtubule-associated protein, TPX2 plays a pivotal role in the nucleation and stabilization of microtubules, which are essential for accurate chromosome segregation and cell division. The protein is characterized by its alpha-helical structure, which facilitates interactions with other proteins and complexes, such as the γ-tubulin ring complex and Aurora A kinase, thereby influencing spindle morphogenesis and centrosome function (Zhang2017Structural; Neumayer2014TPX2:). TPX2's activity is regulated by the Ran GTPase system, which modulates its release from importin complexes, allowing it to function effectively during mitosis (Neumayer2014TPX2:). Dysregulation of TPX2 expression is associated with various cancers, highlighting its significance in maintaining genomic stability and its potential as a therapeutic target (Matson2021High; Wei2013TPX2).

## Structure
The TPX2 protein, encoded by the TPX2 gene, plays a crucial role in microtubule nucleation and spindle assembly during cell division. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains essential for its function. The C-terminal region of TPX2 is particularly important, comprising alpha-helical tandem repeats that form a flexible solenoid structure, facilitating protein-protein interactions (SanchezPulido2016The).

The secondary structure of TPX2 is predominantly alpha-helical, as confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy (AlfaroAco2017Structural). The C-terminal half of TPX2, which includes domains α3 to α7, is essential for microtubule nucleation. These domains are characterized by significant alpha-helical content and are organized into distinct structural units (AlfaroAco2017Structural).

In terms of tertiary structure, TPX2 features a ridge and wedge motif that allows it to bind to microtubules at specific sites, facilitating microtubule stabilization and nucleation (Zhang2017Structural). The TPX2 α5-α7 region is involved in liquid-liquid phase separation, which is crucial for its function in microtubule nucleation (Guo2023Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in TPX2 and influence its activity and interactions. The protein may also exist in splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity.

## Function
TPX2 (Targeting Protein for Xklp2) is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a critical role in spindle assembly during mitosis in healthy human cells. It is involved in microtubule nucleation and stabilization, essential for proper chromosome segregation. TPX2 is regulated by the Ran GTPase system, which releases it from importin complexes, allowing it to nucleate microtubules when the nuclear envelope breaks down during mitosis (Neumayer2014TPX2:). 

TPX2 activates Aurora A kinase, a crucial step for spindle morphogenesis and centrosome function, by targeting it to the spindle (Zhang2017Structural). It also interacts with kinesins such as Kif11/Eg5 and Kif15/Xklp2, aiding their localization to the spindle (Zhang2017Structural). TPX2's ability to bind microtubules and initiate nucleation is facilitated by its phase separation with tubulin, forming co-condensates that enhance microtubule nucleation efficiency (King2020Phase).

In the nucleus, TPX2 is involved in amplifying the DNA damage response, although its precise functions during interphase are less understood (Neumayer2014TPX2:). Its activity is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and normal cell proliferation, with dysregulation linked to cancer (Neumayer2014TPX2:; King2020Phase).

## Clinical Significance
The TPX2 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell proliferation and spindle assembly. Overexpression of TPX2 is frequently observed in several malignancies, including colon, breast, lung, and ovarian cancers, and is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive disease behavior (Matson2021High; Perez2012Mitotic; Wei2013TPX2). In colon cancer, TPX2 overexpression is linked to clinical staging, vessel invasion, and metastasis, contributing to worse overall and metastasis-free survival (Wei2013TPX2). The gene's overexpression activates the Akt signaling pathway, promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis through modulation of MMP2 activity (Wei2013TPX2).

In breast cancer, high TPX2 expression correlates with high-grade morphology, negative hormone receptor status, and poor survival outcomes (Matson2021High). TPX2 is also associated with chromosomal instability, a hallmark of cancer progression, and its overexpression is linked to genomic alterations, such as amplification of chromosome region 20q11 (Neumayer2014TPX2:; Perez2012Mitotic).

TPX2's role extends to the tumor immune microenvironment, where its expression correlates with immune cell levels and tumor mutational burden, influencing immunotherapy response (Zhu2024Integrative). These findings suggest that TPX2 is a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
TPX2 interacts with several proteins and complexes, playing a crucial role in microtubule nucleation and spindle assembly. It is known to interact with the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), which is essential for branching microtubule nucleation. TPX2 promotes microtubule nucleation through its interaction with γ-TuRC, rather than possessing intrinsic nucleation activity (AlfaroAco2017Structural). TPX2 also forms a co-condensate with tubulin via liquid-liquid phase separation, enhancing microtubule nucleation efficiency. This interaction is regulated by the importin-α/β heterodimer, which inhibits TPX2-tubulin co-condensation and microtubule nucleation (Safari2021Interaction; King2020Phase).

TPX2 interacts with the mitotic kinase Aurora A, activating it during mitosis. This interaction is crucial for proper cell division and is a potential target for anti-cancer drugs (McIntyre2017Characterization). TPX2 also interacts with the augmin complex, which is involved in targeting γ-TuRC to pre-existing microtubules, facilitating branching nucleation (Petry2013Branching). Additionally, TPX2 binds to the tetrameric kinesin Eg5, which promotes microtubule nucleation (King2020Phase). These interactions highlight TPX2's role in coordinating the assembly and function of the mitotic spindle.
