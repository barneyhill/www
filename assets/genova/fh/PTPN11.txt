# PTPN11

## Overview
PTPN11 is a gene that encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 11, commonly known as SHP-2. SHP-2 is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, which plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways by dephosphorylating tyrosine residues on target proteins. This protein is characterized by its two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and a catalytic phosphatase domain, which are essential for its regulatory functions in signal transduction. SHP-2 is involved in the modulation of the Ras-Erk signaling cascade, influencing cell growth, differentiation, and survival (Chan2006PTPN11). It is ubiquitously expressed and is crucial for normal development and hematopoiesis (Chan2006PTPN11). Mutations in PTPN11 are associated with several genetic disorders, including Noonan syndrome and various hematological malignancies, highlighting its clinical significance (BentiresAlj2004Activating; Athota2020Molecular).

## Structure
The PTPN11 gene encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which is a crucial member of the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) family. SHP-2 is a 68 kDa protein composed of 593 amino acids and includes two tandem SH2 domains (N-SH2 and C-SH2), a catalytic PTP domain, and a disordered C-terminal tail containing phosphorylation sites at Tyr542 and Tyr580 (Bajia2023An). The N-SH2 domain acts as a molecular switch, existing in two conformations: the 'A' state, which is phosphopeptide-bound and promotes activation of the phosphatase, and the 'I' state, which is inhibitory (Hof1998Crystal). The PTP domain has a mixed α/β architecture, similar to other phosphatases like PTP1B and Yersinia PTP, and contains nine alpha helices and 14 beta strands, forming a mixed parallel/antiparallel beta sheet (Hof1998Crystal).

In its inactive state, SHP-2 is autoinhibited by interactions between the catalytic surface of the PTP domain and the N-SH2 domain, which suppresses the protein's activity and limits substrate access to its catalytic site (Bajia2023An). The N-SH2 and PTP domains share a broad interaction surface, with the D'J loop and flanking D' and E strands of the N-SH2 domain central to this interaction (Hof1998Crystal). The structure also highlights an intricate intra- and interdomain hydrogen bonding network that stabilizes the enzyme's active site (Hof1998Crystal). The SH2 domains regulate the PTP domain's activity by binding phosphotyrosine residues, and the C-terminal SH2 domain contributes to binding energy and specificity (Hof1998Crystal).

## Function
The PTPN11 gene encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which plays a critical role in various cellular signaling pathways. SHP-2 is involved in the regulation of the Ras-Erk signaling cascade, a pathway essential for cell growth, differentiation, and survival (Chan2006PTPN11). It functions by dephosphorylating specific tyrosine residues on target proteins, modulating their activity and influencing downstream signaling events (Chan2006PTPN11). 

SHP-2 contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and a catalytic phosphatase domain. In its inactive state, the N-SH2 domain blocks the active site of the phosphatase domain. Activation occurs when phosphotyrosine-containing peptides bind to the N-SH2 domain, inducing a conformational change that relieves this inhibition and activates the phosphatase function (Hof1998Crystal; BentiresAlj2004Activating). 

SHP-2 is ubiquitously expressed and is crucial for normal development and hematopoiesis, the process of forming blood cellular components (Chan2006PTPN11). It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, modulating signal transduction from growth factor and cytokine receptors, impacting various physiological processes (Neel2003The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PTPN11 gene, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, are associated with several genetic disorders and malignancies. Germline mutations in PTPN11 are a common cause of Noonan syndrome (NS), a developmental disorder characterized by features such as congenital heart defects, facial dysmorphisms, and short stature. Approximately 50% of NS cases are attributed to gain-of-function mutations in PTPN11, which enhance the activity of SHP-2 and disrupt normal signaling pathways (BentiresAlj2004Activating; Athota2020Molecular). These mutations often occur in exons 3 and 8, with specific hotspots like c.922A > G (p.Asn308Asp) (Athota2020Molecular).

PTPN11 mutations are also linked to Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML), previously known as LEOPARD syndrome, which shares some clinical features with NS but includes multiple lentigines and other distinct symptoms (Pannone2017Structural). Somatic mutations in PTPN11 are implicated in various hematological malignancies, including juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), where they contribute to an adverse prognosis by activating pathways such as RAS/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT (Alfayez2020The; BentiresAlj2004Activating). Additionally, loss-of-function mutations in PTPN11 are associated with metachondromatosis, a rare skeletal disorder (Pannone2017Structural).

## Interactions
PTPN11 encodes the SHP2 protein, a non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in various cellular signaling pathways. SHP2 interacts with multiple proteins, playing a crucial role in signal transduction. It contains two Src Homology 2 (SH2) domains, N-SH2 and C-SH2, which are essential for its interactions with phosphorylated tyrosine residues on other proteins. These interactions are critical for the activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, influencing cell growth and differentiation (Anselmi2023Revealing; Bobone2020Targeting).

SHP2 is involved in the activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway through interactions with growth factor receptors and adaptor proteins like GRB2. It also interacts with signaling molecules such as RAS and ERK, facilitating downstream signaling events (Bobone2020Targeting). The N-SH2 domain of SHP2 has a unique binding preference for certain phosphopeptides, contributing to its high binding affinity and specificity (Bobone2020Targeting).

Mutations in PTPN11 can lead to increased affinity for phosphopeptides, resulting in hyperactivation of signaling pathways. This is particularly relevant in the context of diseases such as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and other leukemias, where SHP2's interactions are dysregulated (Bobone2020Targeting).
