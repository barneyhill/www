# CEP131

## Overview
CEP131 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 131, a crucial component involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to the centrosome and cilia. The protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein and plays a significant role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, by localizing to centriolar satellites and the transition zone, which are essential for regulating traffic into the ciliary compartment (Hall2013Acute). Beyond its role in ciliogenesis, centrosomal protein 131 is implicated in mitochondrial apoptosis regulation, centrosome homeostasis, and genomic stability maintenance (Renaud2023The). The protein's interactions with kinases such as MK2 and Plk4, as well as its involvement in stress-induced cellular responses, underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and proliferation (Kim2019Cep131; Tollenaere2015p38). Dysregulation of CEP131 has been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer progression and ciliopathies, highlighting its clinical significance (Kim2019Cep131; Hall2013Acute).

## Function
CEP131, also known as Azi1, is a centrosomal protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is primarily involved in ciliogenesis, the formation of cilia, by localizing to centriolar satellites and the transition zone, which is crucial for regulating traffic into the ciliary compartment. CEP131 is enriched around the basal body during ciliogenesis, suggesting its involvement in membrane docking, axoneme extension, and cargo delivery to nascent cilia (Hall2013Acute).

In addition to its role in ciliogenesis, CEP131 is implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis. In CEP131 knockout cells, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is delayed, affecting the activation of caspases and reducing cell death in response to mitochondrial stimuli. This indicates that CEP131 is involved in the timely permeabilization of mitochondria and subsequent apoptotic cell death (Renaud2023The).

CEP131 also contributes to centrosome homeostasis, cell proliferation, and the maintenance of genomic stability. It is associated with the clearance of aggresomes and influences microtubule dynamics, which are essential for intracellular transport and organelle distribution (Renaud2023The). These functions highlight CEP131's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating life-and-death decisions in cells.

## Clinical Significance
CEP131 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in centrosome amplification and cilia function. Overexpression of CEP131 is associated with cancer progression, particularly in colon cancer, by promoting centrosome amplification through the stabilization of Plk4, a kinase essential for centrosome duplication. This process is linked to genomic instability and tumorigenesis, as demonstrated in studies where CEP131 overexpression in colon cancer cell lines led to increased tumor growth (Kim2019Cep131).

In liver cancer, CEP131 interacts with ARID3A to regulate genes associated with stem cell-like properties, enhancing cell migration and invasion. This interaction suggests a role for CEP131 in promoting liver cancer malignancy (Shen2022Hepatic).

CEP131 is also involved in mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis. Alterations in its expression can affect mitochondrial membrane potential and respiratory capacity, impacting immune responses and potentially linking it to conditions involving immune dysfunction or mitochondrial disorders (Renaud2023The).

In the context of ciliopathies, CEP131, also known as Azi1, is necessary for cilia formation. Its loss can lead to defects in sperm flagella, resulting in male infertility, although it is not essential for general ciliogenesis in vivo (Hall2013Acute).

## Interactions
CEP131, also known as centrosomal protein 131, participates in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is phosphorylated by the kinase MK2 at serine residues S47 and S78, which facilitates its binding to 14-3-3 proteins. This interaction is essential for the stress-induced remodeling of centriolar satellites, as it sequesters CEP131 in the cytoplasm, preventing the formation of new centriolar satellites (Tollenaere2015p38).

CEP131 also interacts with Plk4, a kinase involved in centrosome duplication. This interaction is mediated by a specific Plk4-binding motif within CEP131, and it is independent of Plk4's kinase activity. The phosphorylation of CEP131 by Plk4 at residues S21 and T205 enhances its binding to STIL, a protein crucial for centriole duplication (Kim2019Cep131).

In the context of ciliogenesis, CEP131 does not directly interact with CEP290 but is connected through CEP162, which acts as a bridge between them. This interaction is important for the localization of these proteins at the basal body and transition zone, facilitating the initiation of ciliogenesis (Wu2024Cep131Cep162).
