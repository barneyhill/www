# ASF1B

## Overview
ASF1B is a gene that encodes the anti-silencing function 1B histone chaperone, a protein integral to chromatin assembly and disassembly processes. This protein is categorized as a histone chaperone, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of DNA replication and repair by facilitating the transfer of histones H3 and H4 to newly synthesized DNA strands. The ASF1B protein is characterized by a conserved N-terminal domain that binds histones and other proteins, and a C-terminal region that undergoes phosphorylation, potentially influencing its activity and interactions (Abascal2013Subfunctionalization). ASF1B is predominantly active in the nucleus and is crucial for cell proliferation, particularly in highly proliferative tissues, while its expression diminishes in terminally differentiated and quiescent cells (Papadopoulos2020Mild). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are significant in various biological processes and have been implicated in the progression of several cancers, making ASF1B a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Ouyang2022ASF1B; Ma2021Comprehensive).

## Structure
ASF1B is a histone chaperone that plays a crucial role in chromatin assembly and disassembly. The protein features a conserved N-terminal domain, which is essential for its function and is characterized by a switched-type immunoglobulin-like fold. This domain is involved in binding histones H3 and H4, as well as other proteins like CAF-1 p60 (Abascal2013Subfunctionalization). The N-terminal domain of ASF1B is highly conserved across eukaryotes, maintaining its interaction with histone dimers (Abascal2013Subfunctionalization).

The structure of ASF1B includes a beta-sheet structure with alpha helices, facilitating its interactions with histones. The protein's C-terminal region is conserved and features a low isoelectric point, which is a substrate for phosphorylation in humans and mice (Abascal2013Subfunctionalization). This post-translational modification may influence ASF1B's activity and interactions. The C-terminal region has evolved to include more Gly and Pro residues, characteristic of disordered regions, which may contribute to its functional divergence from ASF1A (Abascal2013Subfunctionalization).

ASF1B does not have detailed information on specific splice variant isoforms or quaternary structure in the provided context. The evolutionary divergence and genomic context of ASF1B suggest its adaptation to specific functional roles in chromatin dynamics (Abascal2013Subfunctionalization).

## Function
ASF1B (anti-silencing function 1B) is a histone chaperone that plays a crucial role in chromatin assembly and disassembly, which is essential for DNA replication and repair. It facilitates the transfer of histones H3 and H4 to newly synthesized DNA, ensuring proper nucleosome formation and maintaining genome stability (Munakata2000A). ASF1B is predominantly active in the nucleus and is involved in cell proliferation, particularly in human β-cells. It promotes β-cell proliferation by recruiting histone H3.3, which is crucial for its function in inducing cell cycle progression and reducing cell death (Paul2016Histone).

ASF1B's interaction with histone H3.3 is necessary for its role in replication-independent histone deposition, contributing to transcriptional regulation and cellular proliferation (Paul2016Histone). The protein's histone-binding capability is essential for its mitogenic effects, as demonstrated by the ineffectiveness of a histone-binding mutant (V94R) in promoting β-cell proliferation (Paul2016Histone). ASF1B is expressed in highly proliferating tissues and its expression decreases in terminally differentiated and quiescent cells, highlighting its specific role in cell proliferation (Papadopoulos2020Mild).

## Clinical Significance
ASF1B is significantly associated with various cancers, where its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis. High ASF1B expression is observed in cancers such as thyroid cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Ouyang2022ASF1B; Ma2021Comprehensive). In hepatocellular carcinoma, ASF1B expression correlates with shorter overall survival and progression-free survival, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression (Ouyang2022ASF1B). In lung adenocarcinoma, ASF1B overexpression is associated with poor survival outcomes and is involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis regulation (Zhang2021ASF1B).

ASF1B is also linked to immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, affecting immune response and potentially altering tumor progression. Its expression correlates with the infiltration of various immune cells, including B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (Hu2021Comprehensive; Ma2021Comprehensive). ASF1B's role in DNA replication and repair, as well as its involvement in pathways like MTORC1 signaling and E2F targets, further underscores its significance in cancer development and progression (Ma2021Comprehensive; Zhang2021ASF1B). These findings highlight ASF1B as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in various cancers.

## Interactions
ASF1B interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in chromatin assembly and DNA replication. It binds with the transcriptional coactivator HCF-1, which is involved in HSV-1 viral replication. This interaction occurs through the HCF-1 carboxy terminal domain, which contains fibronectin repeats essential for the association of HCF-1's subunits. ASF1B's interaction with these repeats has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Peng2010Transcriptional).

ASF1B also functions as a histone H3/H4 chaperone, linking it to histone H3 through its interaction with HCF-1. This connection is vital for coupling the ASF1B/histone complex to viral replication components, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation experiments (Peng2010Transcriptional).

In addition to its role in viral replication, ASF1B interacts with the CAF-1 complex, specifically binding to the p60 subunit. This interaction is stable and independent of phosphorylation states, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation assays (Mello2002Human). ASF1B also interacts with the B-domain of HIRA, suggesting a role in replication-independent histone deposition (Paul2016Histone). These interactions highlight ASF1B's involvement in both replication-coupled and independent chromatin assembly pathways.
