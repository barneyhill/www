# TMEM44

## Overview
TMEM44 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 44, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and structural integrity, due to its location within the cell membrane. TMEM44 has garnered attention for its role in cancer biology, particularly in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and glioma, where its expression levels have been linked to tumor progression and patient prognosis. The gene's expression is associated with significant clinical outcomes, making it a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic interventions (Bian2021Superenhancerassociated; Tian2023TMEM44).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TMEM44 has been identified as a significant prognostic marker in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Altered expression of TMEM44 is associated with tumor invasion, migration, and immune infiltration in KIRC. High expression levels of TMEM44 correlate with poorer survival outcomes, including overall survival, progression-free survival, and disease-specific survival. This suggests that TMEM44 plays a crucial role in the progression of KIRC and could serve as an independent prognostic factor. The study by Tian et al. highlights the potential of TMEM44 as a biomarker for guiding immunotherapy in KIRC, as its expression is linked to immune cell abundance and immune checkpoint inhibitors (Tian2023TMEM44).

In glioma, the long non-coding RNA TMEM44-AS1, associated with the TMEM44 gene, is significantly upregulated and linked to poor prognosis. TMEM44-AS1 promotes glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, forming a positive feedback loop with the Myc oncogene. This interaction enhances glioma progression through pathways such as p38MAPK and IL-6 signaling. The study by Bian et al. suggests that targeting the TMEM44-AS1/Myc axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy for glioma treatment (Bian2021Superenhancerassociated).
