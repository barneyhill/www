# ACTC1

## Overview
The ACTC1 gene encodes the protein actin alpha cardiac muscle 1, a critical component of the cardiac muscle's contractile machinery. This protein belongs to the actin family, which plays a fundamental role in the structure and function of muscle cells. Actin alpha cardiac muscle 1 is predominantly expressed in cardiac tissue, where it forms part of the sarcomere, the basic unit of muscle contraction. The protein's interaction with myosin and other sarcomeric proteins is essential for muscle contraction and cardiac function. Mutations in the ACTC1 gene can lead to various cardiac conditions, including congenital heart defects and cardiomyopathies, by disrupting these interactions and affecting the structural integrity of the heart muscle (Augière2015A; Angelini2019Cardioprotective). Additionally, ACTC1 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes related to cardiac contractility and stress response, highlighting its importance in maintaining cardiac resilience (Angelini2019Cardioprotective).

## Structure
The ACTC1 gene encodes the alpha cardiac actin 1 protein, a crucial component of the cardiac muscle's contractile apparatus. The primary structure of ACTC1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the actin protein, with specific mutations such as p.(Met84Thr), p.(Glu101Lys), and p.(Met125Val) identified in regions critical for actin-myosin interactions (Augière2015A). These mutations are located in a domain of the actin protein that interacts closely with the myosin heavy chain, affecting cardiac development and function (Augière2015A).

The secondary structure of ACTC1 includes alpha-helices, with the Met84 residue situated in a surface-exposed helix of the globular part of F-Actin (Augière2015A). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, particularly highlighting the interaction with myosin, where specific residues such as 84, 101, and 125 are crucial for maintaining structural integrity necessary for muscle contraction (Augière2015A).

The quaternary structure of ACTC1 involves the assembly of actin monomers into filamentous structures, forming part of the larger actin-myosin complex essential for muscle contraction (Augière2015A). These structural features underscore the protein's role in cardiac muscle function and its involvement in congenital heart defects when mutated.

## Function
The ACTC1 gene encodes α-cardiac actin, a crucial protein for the structure and function of cardiac muscle cells. This protein is a major component of the sarcomere, the fundamental unit of muscle fiber, where it plays a vital role in muscle contraction by interacting with myosin filaments. In healthy human cells, ACTC1 is predominantly expressed in cardiac muscle, where it is the most abundant striated α-actin isoform, essential for maintaining cardiac function and structural integrity (Boutilier2017Variable; Angelini2019Cardioprotective).

ACTC1 is involved in maintaining the cytoarchitecture of cardiac cells, which is crucial for proper heart function. It helps preserve the structural integrity of the heart muscle, particularly under conditions of stress, such as oxidative stress, by maintaining F-actin levels and preventing contractile dysfunction (Angelini2019Cardioprotective). The protein also plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of cardiac genes, particularly those involved in sarcomere contractility and oxidative stress regulation, thereby contributing to the heart's resilience against pathological conditions (Angelini2019Cardioprotective).

In addition to its role in cardiac muscle, ACTC1 is expressed during the development of skeletal muscle, although its expression is down-regulated in adult skeletal muscle (Boutilier2017Variable).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACTC1 gene are associated with a range of cardiac conditions, primarily affecting the heart's structure and function. These mutations can lead to congenital heart defects (CHD) such as atrial septal defects (ASD), ventricular septal defects (VSD), and valvular anomalies including aortic and pulmonary stenosis, and mitral regurgitation (Augière2015A; Matsson2007Alphacardiac). Specific mutations like p.(Met84Thr) and p.(M178L) have been linked to these defects, with the latter also associated with familial ASD (Greenway2014Exome).

ACTC1 mutations are also implicated in cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The p.(Ala21Val) mutation, for instance, is associated with familial HCM and left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) (Frustaci2018Novel). These mutations can disrupt the actin-myosin interaction crucial for muscle contraction, leading to structural heart abnormalities (Augière2015A).

In addition to cardiac issues, ACTC1 mutations may cause midline defects such as cleft lip and pectus excavatum, suggesting a broader impact on developmental processes (Augière2015A). The gene's role in cardiac morphogenesis and its interaction with other sarcomeric proteins underscore its clinical significance in heart disease (Matsson2007Alphacardiac).

## Interactions
The ACTC1 gene encodes alpha-cardiac actin, a protein integral to the sarcomere's thin filament, which is essential for cardiac muscle contraction. ACTC1 interacts with myosin, tropomyosin (Tm), and the troponin complex, forming a multiprotein complex that regulates muscle contraction. These interactions are crucial for the exposure of myosin-binding sites on actin filaments, which is controlled by calcium levels (Despond2018Classifying).

Mutations in ACTC1 can affect these interactions, leading to various cardiomyopathies. For instance, the E99K-ACTC variant is known to increase calcium sensitivity and filament activation, impacting actin-myosin interactions and muscle fiber relaxation (Despond2018Classifying). Other mutations, such as H88Y, R95C, and S271F, also influence actin-myosin interactions, with varying effects on myosin ATPase activity and calcium sensitivity (Despond2018Classifying).

The ACTC1 protein also interacts with alpha-actinin, as demonstrated by competitive binding assays that measure the binding of labeled actin to alpha-actinin in the presence of unlabeled actin (Matsson2007Alphacardiac). These interactions are vital for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of muscle fibers, highlighting the importance of ACTC1 in cardiac function.
