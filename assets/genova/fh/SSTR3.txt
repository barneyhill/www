# SSTR3

## Overview
The SSTR3 gene encodes the somatostatin receptor 3, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including the modulation of neurotransmission, hormone secretion, and immune function. SSTR3 is primarily expressed in the brain and pancreatic islets, where it plays a crucial role in inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity, thereby reducing cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels and influencing intracellular signaling pathways (Yamada1992Somatostatin). The receptor is also implicated in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, as well as endothelial functions, through its interactions with various signaling molecules (Florio2003Somatostatin; Benali2000Somatostatin). SSTR3's ability to form homodimers and heterodimers with other GPCRs further modulates its signaling properties, highlighting its complex role in cellular communication and homeostasis (Günther2018International).

## Structure
The human somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a common feature of this receptor family (Yamada1992Somatostatin). The receptor consists of 418 amino acids and includes two potential N-glycosylation sites in its extracellular NH2-terminal domain, which may regulate its activity (Yamada1992Somatostatin). The carboxyl-terminal tail of SSTR3 is notably long, comprising 102 amino acids, and lacks a potential palmitoylation site, distinguishing it from other somatostatin receptor subtypes (Günther2018International).

SSTR3 undergoes phosphorylation at specific carboxyl-terminal hydroxyl amino acids, including S337, T341, T348, and S361, upon agonist exposure. This phosphorylation is crucial for the recruitment of b-arrestins, facilitating receptor internalization (Günther2018International). The receptor is coupled to Gi/o proteins, leading to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and modulation of intracellular signaling pathways (Günther2018International).

SSTR3 can form homodimers and heterodimers with other GPCRs, which can affect its activity and signaling properties (Günther2018International). The receptor's structure includes conserved motifs such as the Asp-Arg-Tyr (DRY) motif, which is typical of GPCRs and important for G protein coupling (Yasuda1992Cloning).

## Function
Somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in modulating various cellular and physiological processes. In healthy human cells, SSTR3 is involved in the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which leads to a decrease in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. This action is crucial for modulating intracellular signaling pathways, particularly in the brain and pancreatic islets, where SSTR3 mRNA is prominently expressed (Yamada1992Somatostatin).

SSTR3 is also implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. It has been associated with the induction of apoptosis through the activation of p53 and Bax, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Benali2000Somatostatin). Additionally, SSTR3 is involved in the regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and mitogen-activated protein kinase activities, which are essential for controlling angiogenesis and cell growth (Florio2003Somatostatin).

In the immune system, SSTR3 enhances T-cell adhesion to extracellular matrix components, which is vital for immune response and cellular interactions (Talme2001Somatostatin). These diverse roles highlight the importance of SSTR3 in various biological processes, including neurotransmission, hormone secretion, and immune function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SSTR3 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient pheochromocytomas (PCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs), increased expression of SSTR3 has been observed. This heightened expression is more pronounced in SDH-deficient tumors compared to SDH-sufficient ones, suggesting a potential role for somatostatin analogues in treating these tumors (Elston2015Increased). The study by Elston et al. indicates that SSTR3 expression could inform treatment strategies for these neuroendocrine tumors, particularly with novel somatostatin analogues like pasireotide (Elston2015Increased).

In the context of gastric mucosa, SSTR3 expression is influenced by environmental factors such as cigarette smoking and Helicobacter pylori infection. Both factors independently decrease SSTR3 mRNA levels, which may be linked to an increased risk of gastric cancer, as SSTR3 expression is often diminished or lost in stomach tumors (StecMichalska2010Influence).

In somatotropinomas, a type of pituitary adenoma, SSTR3 mRNA levels have shown a negative correlation with tumor volume reduction during treatment with octreotide LAR, a somatostatin analogue. This finding suggests that SSTR3 may play a complex role in tumor response to therapy (Taboada2008Quantitative).

## Interactions
Somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and cellular localization. SSTR3 interacts with the BBSome, a multiprotein complex crucial for the ciliary targeting of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This interaction is mediated through specific motifs in the intracellular and carboxyl-terminal regions of SSTR3, such as the APSCQ motif in IC3 and the FK and LLxP motifs in CT. These interactions are essential for the retrieval of activated GPCRs from the ciliary tip to the base (Barbeito2021HTR6).

SSTR3 also interacts with the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) through PDZ domain-mediated interactions. These interactions, although transient, are significant for the organization of signaling complexes and have been confirmed in vitro (Møller2013PDZ).

Additionally, SSTR3 forms constitutive homodimers and can heterodimerize with SSTR2, which reduces its activity. This dimerization affects the receptor's signaling properties and functional outcomes (Günther2018International). SSTR3 also interacts with multiple PDZ-domain protein 1 (MUPP1), targeting it to tight junctions in epithelial cells, which influences trans-epithelial permeability (Günther2018International).
