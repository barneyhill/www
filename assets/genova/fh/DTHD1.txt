# DTHD1

## Overview
DTHD1 is a gene that encodes the protein death domain containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of a death domain, a motif commonly associated with proteins that participate in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways. Although the precise biological functions of the DTHD1 protein are not fully understood, it is implicated in several critical cellular mechanisms, including those related to cell death and survival. Research has highlighted its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of diseases such as Alzheimer's and familial sarcoidosis, as well as its role as a candidate diagnostic marker for acute myocardial infarction (Lamisa2023A; Pacheco2021Autophagy; Zhang2023Integration).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DTHD1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of rare disorders in the Middle East, DTHD1 has been identified as a putative candidate gene underlying novel recessive disorders, although specific clinical significance is not detailed (El2023The). In familial sarcoidosis, DTHD1 was identified among genes with heterozygous variants, suggesting a potential role in autosomal dominant transmission of the disease (Pacheco2021Autophagy). 

In Alzheimer's disease, DTHD1 is significantly upregulated, indicating its potential involvement in the disease's pathogenesis. The gene was identified as one of the differentially expressed genes in Alzheimer's patients, suggesting its role in the biological pathways associated with the disease (Lamisa2023A). 

In the context of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), DTHD1 was identified as a candidate diagnostic gene, with its expression level being relevant for distinguishing between AMI and control groups. However, the specific clinical significance of DTHD1 in AMI remains to be fully elucidated (Zhang2023Integration).
