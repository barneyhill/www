# ACR

## Overview
The ACR gene encodes acrosin, a serine protease enzyme predominantly located in the acrosome of sperm cells. Acrosin is synthesized as an inactive precursor, proacrosin, which is activated during the acrosome reaction, a critical event in fertilization. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in sperm-egg interaction by facilitating the penetration of sperm through the zona pellucida, a glycoprotein layer surrounding the oocyte. Acrosin's proteolytic activity is essential for the hydrolysis of zona pellucida glycoproteins, aiding in sperm penetration and potentially activating other acrosomal proteases. Despite its significant role, acrosin is not indispensable for fertilization, as evidenced by the fertility of acrosin-deficient mice, indicating that other proteases may compensate for its function (Raterman2008The; Baba1994Sperm).

## Structure
The human gene ACR encodes the enzyme acrosin, a serine protease primarily found in the acrosome of sperm cells. Acrosin is synthesized as an inactive precursor, proacrosin, which undergoes limited proteolysis to become active. The primary structure of human proacrosin includes a 19-amino-acid signal peptide, a 23-residue light chain, and a 379-residue heavy chain containing the catalytic site of the mature protease (Baba1989Primary). The catalytic triad essential for its proteolytic activity consists of histidine, aspartic acid, and serine, located at residues 69, 123, and 221, respectively (Baba1989Primary).

The secondary structure of acrosin includes alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a compact globular shape in its tertiary structure. The quaternary structure involves its active form as a zymogen, proacrosin, which is converted to mature acrosin by cleavage at specific peptide bonds (Baba1989Activation). Acrosin is a two-chain protein with the light and heavy chains linked by disulfide bridges (Baba1989Primary). Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which contributes to the enzyme's molecular mass and stability (ADHAM1989Molecular). The structure of acrosin is crucial for its role in sperm-egg recognition and binding, facilitated by its ability to interact with zona pellucida glycoproteins (Baba1989Activation).

## Function
Acrosin, encoded by the ACR gene, is a serine protease enzyme primarily active in the acrosome of sperm cells. It plays a significant role in fertilization by facilitating the penetration of sperm through the zona pellucida, a glycoprotein layer surrounding the oocyte. Acrosin is initially synthesized as an inactive zymogen, proacrosin, which is activated during the acrosome reaction (Zahn2002Evaluation; Mao2013Modes).

The enzyme is involved in the hydrolysis of zona pellucida glycoproteins, which is crucial for sperm penetration during fertilization (Moreno1998The). Acrosin's proteolytic activity aids in the dispersal of the acrosomal matrix and may activate other acrosome proteases, contributing to the acrosome reaction and sperm-egg interaction (Mao2013Modes). The polysulphate binding domain (PSBD) of proacrosin/acrosin is believed to function as a secondary binding receptor, facilitating the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida and playing a role in enzyme activation (Moreno1998The).

Despite its proposed importance, studies have shown that acrosin is not essential for fertilization, as acrosin-deficient mice remain fertile, suggesting that other proteases might compensate for its function (Raterman2008The; Baba1994Sperm).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
Acrosin (ACR) is a serine protease enzyme that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in fertilization. It is stored in its inactive form, proacrosin, within the acrosome of sperm cells and becomes active during the acrosomal reaction. Acrosin interacts with zona pellucida (ZP) glycoproteins, which are essential for sperm binding and penetration of the egg. The interaction with ZP glycoproteins involves mannose and fucose residues, which are crucial for binding. Recombinant human proacrosin/acrosin has been shown to bind specifically to recombinant human ZPA, ZPB, and ZPC glycoproteins, with ZPA exhibiting the highest binding activity (Furlong2005Bindinga).

Acrosin also forms stable complexes with protein C inhibitor (PCI), a serine protease inhibitor, which inhibits its amidolytic activity. This interaction is significant as it may protect spermatozoa and surrounding tissues from proteolytic damage caused by premature or excessive release of acrosomal enzymes (Zheng1994Inhibition). Additionally, acrosin has DNA binding capacity, which can be inhibited by negatively charged macromolecules like heparin and fucoidan, suggesting a potential physiological role in sperm function (Eberspaecher1991Activation).
