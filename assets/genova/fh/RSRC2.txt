# RSRC2

## Overview
The RSRC2 gene encodes the arginine and serine-rich coiled-coil 2 protein, which is integral to the process of RNA splicing, a critical step in gene expression. This protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it contributes to the assembly of spliceosomes, thereby influencing mRNA maturation and regulation (Zhao2023RSRC2). As a multifunctional protein, RSRC2 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and the cell cycle, and it may also act as a transcription factor by binding to diverse DNA regions (Zhao2023RSRC2). The RSRC2 protein is categorized as a tumor suppressor, with its expression levels inversely correlated with cancer progression, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Zhao2023RSRC2). Its regulatory role over genes such as SCIN, which is involved in cytoskeletal regulation, underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing malignancy (Zhao2023RSRC2).

## Structure


## Function
The RSRC2 gene, also known as arginine/serine-rich coiled coil 2, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in RNA splicing, a fundamental process in gene expression. The RSRC2 protein is active in the nucleus, where it participates in the assembly of spliceosomes, influencing mRNA maturation and regulation. This involvement in RNA splicing is essential for normal cellular processes and organismal development (Zhao2023RSRC2).

In healthy human cells, RSRC2 is expressed at higher levels compared to cancerous tissues, indicating its role in maintaining normal cell function and preventing malignant progression. The gene is involved in multiple cellular functions, including cell adhesion, migration, cell cycle, and DNA replication processes (Zhao2023RSRC2). RSRC2 may also function as a transcription factor, as it binds to various DNA regions such as promoter-TSS, intergenic, intron, 3' UTR, and exon regions, and interacts with different transcription factors (Zhao2023RSRC2).

The proper function of RSRC2 is critical for the regulation of cellular signaling pathways, as evidenced by its regulatory role over the SCIN gene, which is involved in cytoskeleton regulation (Zhao2023RSRC2).

## Clinical Significance
The RSRC2 gene has been implicated in various cancers, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where its expression is significantly reduced. Low RSRC2 expression in TNBC is associated with poorer overall survival and increased drug resistance, particularly to paclitaxel (Zhao2023RSRC2). RSRC2 functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating SCIN expression, which affects cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. Its downregulation leads to enhanced malignant behaviors and poorer prognosis in breast cancer (Zhao2023RSRC2).

In addition to breast cancer, RSRC2 expression is altered in other cancers. It is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, suggesting a role in the altered splicing machinery observed in this cancer type (Wang2017Splice). RSRC2 has also been identified as a potential candidate gene in neurological conditions, although specific diseases were not detailed (Charng2016Exome).

RSRC2 is involved in gene fusions in prostate cancer, such as the MIER2-RSRC2 fusion, which may contribute to cancer cell viability and growth (Pflueger2010Discovery). These findings suggest that RSRC2 plays a significant role in cancer progression and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
RSRC2, a tumor suppressor gene, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence cellular functions. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), RSRC2 has been shown to interact with the SCIN gene, a member of the gelsolin superfamily involved in cytoskeletal regulation. RSRC2 regulates SCIN expression by binding to its promoter, thereby affecting SCIN's activity and influencing TNBC progression (Zhao2023RSRC2).

ChIP-seq analysis has identified RSRC2 binding to multiple genomic regions, including intergenic, intron, promoter-TSS, 3' UTR, and exon regions. This analysis revealed that RSRC2 could bind to motifs recognized by transcription factors such as CENPB, IRF4, ZNF354C, and GRHL2, suggesting its role as a transcriptional regulator (Zhao2023RSRC2). RSRC2's interaction with these transcription factors indicates its involvement in transcriptional regulation pathways, potentially affecting genes related to cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion (Zhao2023RSRC2).

STRING analysis suggests that SCIN is a downstream target of RSRC2, playing a role in the signaling pathway regulated by RSRC2. This interaction network highlights RSRC2's potential influence on TNBC progression through its regulatory effects on SCIN and other associated genes (Zhao2023RSRC2).
