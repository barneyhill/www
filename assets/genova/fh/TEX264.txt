# TEX264

## Overview
TEX264 is a gene that encodes the protein testis expressed 264, which functions as an ER-phagy receptor. This protein is a single-pass transmembrane receptor located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a crucial role in the selective degradation of ER components through autophagy, a process known as ER-phagy. The protein is characterized by a central GyrI-like domain and a C-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which facilitates its interaction with ATG8 family proteins, such as LC3B and GABARAP, during autophagy (An2019TEX264; Chino2019Intrinsically). TEX264 is also involved in DNA repair, where it collaborates with the VCP/p97 ATPase and SPRTN metalloprotease to resolve topoisomerase 1-DNA adducts, thereby maintaining genome stability (Fielden2020TEX264). The protein's function is regulated by phosphorylation, which enhances its binding affinity to autophagic proteins and is essential for its role in cellular stress responses and homeostasis (Chino2022Phosphorylation).

## Structure
TEX264 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein characterized by several structural features that facilitate its role in ER-phagy. It contains an N-terminal transmembrane segment that anchors it to the ER membrane, with a luminal N-terminal sequence and a cytosolic C-terminal domain (An2019TEX264). The protein includes a central GyrI-like domain, which is related to bacterial gyrase inhibitors and is crucial for its interaction with topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) and SUMOylated TOP1, playing a role in DNA repair (Fielden2020TEX264).

TEX264 also features a C-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which is essential for its interaction with ATG8 family proteins, such as LC3B and GABARAP, during autophagy (An2019TEX264; Chino2019Intrinsically). The LIR motif's interaction with GABARAP is enhanced by phosphorylation at serine residues upstream of the core LIR, which increases binding affinity through hydrogen bond formation (Chino2022Phosphorylation).

The protein also contains an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) near the LIR motif, which is important for bridging the ER and autophagosomal membranes, facilitating its function as an ER-phagy receptor (Chino2019Intrinsically). The IDR's length is critical for its function, allowing flexibility and dynamic interactions necessary for ER-phagy (Chino2019Intrinsically).

## Function
TEX264 is a single-pass transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in autophagy, specifically in the process known as ER-phagy, where portions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are selectively degraded. It functions as a major ER-phagy receptor, interacting with LC3 and GABARAP family proteins to mediate the autophagic degradation of ER membrane and lumenal proteins. This interaction is facilitated by a C-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which is crucial for its role in ER-phagy (Chino2019Intrinsically).

TEX264 is involved in maintaining ER homeostasis by facilitating the turnover of ER proteins during nutrient stress, such as amino acid withdrawal or MTOR inhibition. It is responsible for approximately 50% of the total ER-phagy flux during starvation in certain cell types, highlighting its importance in cellular stress responses (An2019TEX264; Fielden2021TEX264).

In addition to its role in autophagy, TEX264 is implicated in DNA repair processes. It coordinates with the VCP/p97 ATPase and SPRTN metalloprotease to resolve topoisomerase 1-DNA adducts, thereby maintaining genome stability and supporting DNA replication (Fielden2020TEX264; Fielden2021TEX264).

## Interactions
TEX264 is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its roles in DNA repair and autophagy. It interacts with topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) and the p97 protein, forming a complex that facilitates the repair of topoisomerase 1-DNA adducts (TOP1ccs). TEX264 acts as a bridge between p97 and TOP1, and its interaction with p97 is independent of the nucleotide-bound status of p97 (Fielden2020TEX264). TEX264 also recruits p97-SPRTN sub-complexes to TOP1, promoting SPRTN-dependent TOP1cc repair (Fielden2020TEX264).

In the context of autophagy, TEX264 interacts with LC3-family proteins through a C-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which is crucial for its role in reticulophagy. This interaction is regulated by phosphorylation of serine residues Ser271 and Ser272 by casein kinase 2 (CK2), enhancing TEX264's binding affinity to ATG8 proteins such as LC3B and GABARAP (Chino2022Phosphorylation). TEX264's phosphorylation is essential for its localization to autophagosomes and its function as an ER-phagy receptor (Chino2022Phosphorylation). These interactions highlight TEX264's multifaceted role in cellular processes, linking DNA repair and autophagy pathways.
