# CLC

## Overview
The CLC gene encodes the Charcot-Leyden crystal protein, also known as galectin-10, which is a member of the galectin family of proteins. This protein is primarily expressed in eosinophils, a type of white blood cell involved in immune responses and inflammation. Charcot-Leyden crystal galectin is characterized by its carbohydrate-binding properties and is involved in lipid metabolism and immune regulation. Structurally, it forms a beta-sandwich with a carbohydrate-recognition domain, and it typically exists as a homo-dimer. Functionally, it plays a crucial role in eosinophil granulogenesis and degranulation, interacting with cationic ribonucleases to facilitate granule formation. The protein's expression and function are linked to various inflammatory and allergic conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Leonidas1995Crystal; Grozdanovic2020CharcotLeyden; Weller2020The).

## Structure
The Charcot-Leyden crystal galectin (CLC) protein is a member of the galectin family, characterized by its carbohydrate-binding properties. The primary structure of CLC includes a sequence of amino acids that form a compact molecule with dimensions of approximately 43 Å x 35 Å x 31 Å (Leonidas1995Crystal). The secondary structure features a 'jelly-roll' motif, consisting of a five-stranded and a six-stranded beta-sheet, along with two short 3_10 helices (Leonidas1995Crystal). 

The tertiary structure of CLC is a beta-sandwich formed by two anti-parallel beta-sheets, which is a common feature in the galectin family (Itoh2020Structures). The protein's carbohydrate-recognition domain is structurally similar to those found in galectins -1 and -2, although it exhibits weak affinity for simple saccharides like N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and lactose (Leonidas1995Crystal). 

CLC forms a homo-dimer in a face-to-face orientation, which is significant for its quaternary structure (Itoh2020Structures). The protein's structure is rigid, except for certain disordered regions, including the C-terminal residue and several side chains (Leonidas1995Crystal). The CLC protein does not undergo significant post-translational modifications or have known splice variant isoforms mentioned in the context.

## Function
The Charcot-Leyden crystal protein (CLC), also known as galectin-10, is primarily expressed in eosinophils and plays a significant role in their function and development. In healthy human cells, CLC is involved in lipid metabolism and immune response regulation. It exhibits lysophospholipase activity, hydrolyzing lysophospholipids to release fatty acids, which is crucial for modulating lipid metabolism and membrane dynamics in eosinophils (Weller2020The). CLC is predominantly located in the peripheral cytoplasm of eosinophils, particularly beneath the plasma membrane, where it forms microdomains that may facilitate its rapid release and crystallization during eosinophil activation (Melo2020Galectin10).

CLC is essential for eosinophil granulogenesis, interacting with cationic ribonucleases such as eosinophil-derived neurotoxin and eosinophil cationic protein, which are crucial for granule formation and function (Grozdanovic2020CharcotLeyden). The protein's interaction with these ribonucleases aids in their sequestration and vesicular transport, impacting eosinophil differentiation and degranulation processes (Grozdanovic2020CharcotLeyden). CLC's role in these molecular processes contributes to the regulation of immune responses, particularly in conditions involving eosinophilic inflammation (Grozdanovic2020CharcotLeyden).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CLC gene, which encodes Charcot-Leyden crystal protein/galectin-10 (CLC/Gal-10), have been implicated in various inflammatory and allergic conditions. Elevated levels of CLC/Gal-10 are associated with eosinophilic inflammation in asthma, particularly aspirin-induced asthma, where increased mRNA levels correlate with eosinophil percentages in sputum and can predict responses to inhaled corticosteroids (Grozdanovic2020CharcotLeyden). In allergic rhinitis, genetic variations in CLC/Gal-10 are linked to increased protein levels in nasal lavage fluid during allergy seasons (Grozdanovic2020CharcotLeyden). 

In celiac disease, higher CLC/Gal-10 levels correlate with tissue damage, while in eosinophilic esophagitis, elevated mRNA levels distinguish affected children from controls (Grozdanovic2020CharcotLeyden). CLC/Gal-10 also plays a role in immune regulation, being necessary for the immunosuppressive functions of regulatory T cells and involved in a novel subset of eosinophils that suppress T cells (Grozdanovic2020CharcotLeyden). 

Deficiency in CLC/Gal-10 affects eosinophil granulogenesis, leading to impaired differentiation and altered granule formation, which may contribute to conditions characterized by eosinophil dysregulation (Grozdanovic2020CharcotLeyden). These findings suggest that CLC/Gal-10 is a potential target for therapeutic interventions in related diseases.
