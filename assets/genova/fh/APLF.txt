# APLF

## Overview
The APLF gene encodes the aprataxin and PNKP like factor, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage response, particularly in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. This pathway is crucial for repairing DNA double-strand breaks, thereby maintaining genomic stability. The APLF protein is characterized by its forkhead-associated (FHA) domain and tandem poly(ADP-ribose)-binding zinc finger (PBZ) domains, which facilitate interactions with other DNA repair proteins and poly(ADP-ribose) molecules. These interactions are essential for the recruitment and stabilization of repair complexes at DNA damage sites. APLF functions as a scaffold protein, enhancing the efficiency of DNA repair by promoting the assembly of key NHEJ components such as XRCC4, DNA ligase IV, and the Ku heterodimer. Its role in DNA repair underscores its importance in preventing genetic aberrations that could lead to diseases such as cancer (Macrae2008APLF; Grundy2012APLF; Iles2007APLF).

## Structure
The APLF protein is a 511-amino acid product encoded by the C2orf13 gene. It features a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain at its amino terminus, which is involved in phosphothreonine-dependent interactions with DNA repair proteins such as XRCC1 and XRCC4 (Macrae2008APLF; Iles2007APLF). The protein also contains two tandem poly(ADP-ribose)-binding zinc finger (PBZ) domains in its C-terminal region, which are crucial for recognizing ADP-ribose and poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) and play a significant role in the DNA damage response (Eustermann2010Solution; Li2010Structure). These PBZ domains are structurally distinct from other zinc finger motifs and are connected by a flexible linker (Li2010Structure).

APLF is largely intrinsically disordered, with structured regions near the FHA, Ku binding, and PBZ domains (Hammel2016An). The protein's flexibility is essential for its function as a scaffold in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, linking components such as Ku, DNA-PKcs, and XRCC4-DNA ligase IV (Hammel2016An). APLF undergoes post-translational modifications, including ATM-dependent hyperphosphorylation following DNA damage (Macrae2008APLF). The protein's acidic C-terminal tail contributes to its slower migration during SDS-PAGE (Iles2007APLF).

## Function
The APLF (aprataxin and PNKP like factor) protein is a crucial component of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is essential for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human cells. APLF functions as a scaffold protein, promoting the assembly and activity of NHEJ protein complexes by facilitating the recruitment and retention of key proteins such as XRCC4-Lig4 and XLF at sites of DNA damage (Grundy2012APLF). It interacts with the Ku heterodimer, particularly Ku80, which is involved in the initial recognition and binding of DNA ends, enhancing the efficiency of DNA ligation and repair (Macrae2008APLF; Grundy2012APLF).

APLF contains an FHA domain and unique zinc fingers, which allow it to interact with core NHEJ components and participate in DNA repair processes (Macrae2008APLF). It also possesses endonuclease and exonuclease activities, which may be required for processing specific types of DSBs before ligation (Macrae2008APLF). APLF is active in the nucleus and is involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, contributing to genomic stability and cell survival following DNA damage (Iles2007APLF; Fenton2013The). Its role in maintaining genomic integrity is crucial for preventing genetic aberrations that could lead to cell death or cancer (Fenton2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the APLF gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. In bladder cancer, high levels of the transcription factor E2F1 lead to the suppression of APLF through the upregulation of miR-888-5p, an oncomiR that targets APLF. This suppression results in impaired DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, contributing to increased cancer invasiveness and poor patient outcomes (Richter2019Rewiring). The imbalance between APLF and other non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) factors due to high E2F1 levels is associated with dysfunctional DSB repair, promoting cancer progression (Richter2019Rewiring).

APLF is also crucial for maintaining genomic stability, and its depletion can lead to increased genetic instability, which is a hallmark of cancer and other diseases related to DNA repair deficiencies (Iles2007APLF). In neuroblastoma cells, reduced APLF levels result in slower DNA repair following ionizing radiation, highlighting its role in the cellular response to DNA damage (Iles2007APLF). The interaction of APLF with key NHEJ components is essential for efficient DNA repair, and disruptions in these interactions can lead to increased susceptibility to DNA damage and related conditions (Grundy2012APLF).

## Interactions
APLF (aprataxin and PNKP like factor) is involved in DNA repair processes, particularly through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). It interacts with several key proteins in this pathway. APLF binds to the Ku heterodimer, which is essential for the initial detection of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). This interaction is facilitated by a Ku-binding motif located between the FHA and tandem PBZ domains of APLF, with specific residues such as Arg-184 and Trp-189 being crucial for binding (Shirodkar2013Identification; Hammel2016An).

APLF also interacts with the XRCC4-DNA ligase IV complex, which is vital for the final ligation step in NHEJ. This interaction is mediated through APLF's FHA domain, which binds phosphorylated XRCC4, and is crucial for the assembly of APLF at DNA damage sites (Shirodkar2013Identification; Hammel2016An).

In addition, APLF forms complexes with DNA-PKcs, a component of the NHEJ pathway, in a DNA-dependent manner. The presence of DNA is necessary for APLF's interaction with DNA-PKcs, while its interaction with Ku is independent of DNA (Hammel2016An).

APLF's interactions are not limited to proteins; it also binds to poly(ADP-ribose) through its PBZ domains, which aids in its recruitment to DNA damage sites (Hammel2016An). These interactions collectively facilitate the repair of DNA DSBs by stabilizing and assembling the necessary protein complexes at the site of damage.
