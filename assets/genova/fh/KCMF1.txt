# KCMF1

## Overview
KCMF1, or potassium channel modulatory factor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of potassium channels and various cellular processes. The protein encoded by KCMF1 is categorized as a modulatory factor, playing a critical role in maintaining cellular ion balance and electrical signaling, which are essential for physiological functions such as nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction. Beyond its role in ion channel modulation, KCMF1 is implicated in protein ubiquitination, influencing protein degradation and turnover, and thereby affecting cellular homeostasis. The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and potentially gene expression regulation. KCMF1's involvement in these fundamental processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and organismal homeostasis (Kreppel2005Suppression).

## Function
KCMF1, or potassium channel modulatory factor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes. In healthy human cells, KCMF1 plays a role in modulating potassium channels, which are essential for maintaining cellular ion balance and electrical signaling. This modulation is crucial for various physiological processes, including nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction. KCMF1 is also implicated in protein ubiquitination, a process that influences protein degradation and turnover, thereby affecting protein homeostasis within the cell.

The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it impacts cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. By participating in these processes, KCMF1 contributes to the regulation of cell growth and survival. Its activity in the nucleus suggests a role in gene expression regulation, potentially influencing cellular responses to environmental signals. Although the specific functions of KCMF1 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed in the available context, its involvement in these fundamental cellular processes indicates its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and organismal homeostasis (Kreppel2005Suppression).

## Clinical Significance
KCMF1 has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions playing significant roles in tumor progression. In Ewing's sarcoma family tumors (ESFT), KCMF1 acts as a putative metastasis suppressor gene. Its expression is upregulated when CD99 is silenced, reducing the migratory ability of ESFT cells, which is crucial for tumor dissemination and metastasis (Kreppel2005Suppression). In contrast, KCMF1 is overexpressed in epithelial cancers, particularly pancreatic cancer, where it enhances proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Morales2014Differential).

In colon cancer stem cells, the interaction between KCMF1 and the 14-3-3σ protein suppresses proliferation and colony formation, indicating a potential tumor suppressor role (Zou2013Interaction). KCMF1 is also part of a ubiquitin ligase complex essential for the survival of certain epithelial tumors, highlighting its involvement in cancer cell viability (Cervia2022A).

Additionally, KCMF1 is downregulated in preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related condition, suggesting its involvement in the pathophysiology of this disorder (Jairajpuri2021Analysis). These findings underscore the diverse roles of KCMF1 in different pathological contexts.

## Interactions
KCMF1, also known as potassium channel modulatory factor 1, is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It forms part of the UBR4-KCMF1 complex, which is crucial for the degradation of orphan proteins. This complex includes UBR4, KCMF1, UBE2A, and calmodulin (CALM), collectively known as the SIFI complex. KCMF1 interacts with UBR4 through a bi-partite interaction involving its N-terminal and C-terminal domains. The C-terminal domain, containing a conserved helix, is essential for the degradation of orphan proteins like CCT4-GFP (Roas2024Convergence).

KCMF1 also interacts with the 14-3-3σ protein in human colon cancer stem cells. This interaction has been shown to suppress cell proliferation and colony formation, indicating a potential role in cancer biology. The interaction was confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation assays (Zou2013Interaction).

Additionally, KCMF1 is implicated in the regulation of potassium channels and is involved in cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and invasion. Its interaction with 14-3-3σ suggests a functional role in regulating these processes (Zou2013Interaction).
