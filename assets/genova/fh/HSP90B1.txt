# HSP90B1

## Overview
HSP90B1 is a gene that encodes the protein heat shock protein 90 beta family member 1, commonly referred to as GRP94 or endoplasmin. This protein is a molecular chaperone predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a vital role in the folding and assembly of secretory and membrane proteins. As a member of the heat shock protein 90 family, GRP94 is characterized by its involvement in maintaining protein homeostasis and facilitating cellular stress responses. It is integral to the quality control mechanisms within the endoplasmic reticulum, ensuring proper protein folding and assisting in the degradation of misfolded proteins. GRP94 is also involved in various cellular processes, including immune responses and calcium homeostasis, and is implicated in the regulation of metabolic pathways. Its interactions with numerous client proteins and involvement in signaling pathways underscore its significance in cellular function and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases such as cancer and polycystic ovary syndrome (RodríguezVicente2015MicroRNA223; Cawthorn2012Proteomic; Hoter2018The).

## Structure
HSP90B1, also known as GRP94, is a molecular chaperone primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum. The protein is part of the heat shock protein 90 family and is characterized by its distinct structural domains. It comprises an N-terminal ATP-binding domain, a middle domain crucial for client protein interaction, and a C-terminal dimerization domain (Hoter2018The). The C-terminal domain contains a Met-Glu-Glu-Val-Asp (MEEVD) motif, which is important for co-chaperone interaction (Schopf2017The).

GRP94's structure includes a shorter charged linker region compared to other HSP90 family members and features calcium-binding sites, which are unique to its function in the endoplasmic reticulum (Hoter2018The). The C-terminal domain also has an additional 55 amino acids with a KDEL retention signal, which is crucial for its localization within the endoplasmic reticulum (Hoter2018The).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in GRP94, influencing its chaperone function and stability (Hoter2018The). These modifications are essential for its role in protein folding and maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions.

## Function
HSP90B1, also known as GRP94, is a molecular chaperone primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells. It plays a critical role in the folding and assembly of secretory and membrane proteins, ensuring their proper function and stability (Hoter2018The). GRP94 is involved in the quality control of the ER, assisting in the refolding or disposal of misfolded and aggregated proteins, which is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular stress responses (Hoter2018The).

GRP94 is essential for the efficient trafficking and cell surface expression of Toll-like receptors and integrins, which are important for immune responses (Hoter2018The). It also contributes to calcium homeostasis within the ER, although its absence does not significantly affect calcium levels in skeletal muscle cells (Hoter2018The). GRP94's role extends to the unfolded protein response (UPR), where it enhances the ER's folding capacity, suppresses apoptosis, and alleviates metabolic stresses (Hoter2018The).

The protein is also implicated in the regulation and development of pancreatic β-cells, highlighting its importance in metabolic processes (Hoter2018The). GRP94's activity is modulated by posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation, which influence its function and interactions within the ER (Hoter2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HSP90B1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a polymorphism in the 3′ untranslated region of HSP90B1 disrupts the binding site for microRNA-223, leading to overexpression of HSP90B1. This overexpression is associated with a shorter time to first therapy and is considered an independent risk factor for disease progression (RodríguezVicente2015MicroRNA223). In breast cancer, high levels of HSP90B1 are linked to distant metastasis and decreased overall survival. The gene's expression is a significant prognostic factor, particularly in predicting metastasis and survival outcomes across various breast cancer subtypes (Cawthorn2012Proteomic).

In PCOS, HSP90B1 is significantly upregulated in ovarian tissues, promoting cell proliferation and survival while inhibiting apoptosis. This suggests a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS by contributing to increased ovarian cell survival and decreased apoptosis (Li2016The). These findings indicate that HSP90B1 plays a critical role in the progression of these diseases and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
HSP90B1, also known as endoplasmin or GRP94, is a molecular chaperone that participates in various protein interactions crucial for cellular functions. It interacts with a range of client proteins, including mutated p53, B-RAF, BCR-ABL, v-Src, ErbB-2, AKT, RAF-1, CDK4, VEGF, and PIK3, which are important for maintaining cellular processes such as cytoarchitecture, differentiation, and cytoprotection (Cawthorn2012Proteomic). HSP90B1 is also involved in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is significant in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and survival, particularly in the context of cancer (She2018Identification).

In breast cancer, HSP90B1 interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor and the AKT signaling pathways, contributing to increased glucose metabolism, cell proliferation, and decreased apoptosis (Cawthorn2012Proteomic). It also forms part of a complex network with C-reactive protein (CRP) in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is implicated in the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (She2018Identification).

HSP90B1's interactions extend to its role in stabilizing and refolding denatured proteins under stress conditions, which is vital for cell survival in tumor microenvironments (Cawthorn2012Proteomic). These interactions highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
