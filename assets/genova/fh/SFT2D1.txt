# SFT2D1

## Overview
SFT2D1 is a gene that encodes the protein SFT2 domain containing 1, which is involved in intracellular transport processes. The SFT2 domain containing 1 protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a crucial role in vesicular trafficking within the cell. It is implicated in the regulation of membrane fusion events, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating communication between different cellular compartments. The protein's function is critical for various cellular processes, and its dysregulation has been associated with certain pathological conditions, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
