# EPHA1

## Overview
EPHA1 is a gene that encodes the EPH receptor A1, a member of the Eph receptor family, which is the largest subgroup of receptor tyrosine kinases. The EPH receptor A1 is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in cell signaling, particularly in mediating cell-cell communication through interactions with ephrin ligands. This receptor is primarily expressed in epithelial cells and is involved in various biological processes, including cell adhesion, shape, and movement, which are essential for maintaining epithelial integrity and function. EPHA1 is implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, such as tissue patterning, angiogenesis, and neural development, as well as in diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, where its dysregulation can contribute to disease progression (Herath2009Epigenetic; Kou2018Differential; Ma2020EphA1; Kim2021Alzheimer’s).

## Structure
The EPHA1 protein is a member of the Eph receptor family, characterized by a conserved structure comprising three main regions: the extracellular region (ECR), the transmembrane domain (TMD), and the intracellular region (ICR) (Sahoo2021Structural). The primary structure of EPHA1 includes a sequence of amino acids that form these distinct regions. The secondary structure involves the formation of alpha helices, particularly within the TMD, which typically forms a helix connecting the ECR and ICR (Sahoo2021Structural).

The tertiary structure of EPHA1 features a ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain. The TMD of EPHA1 is known to form a right-handed parallel configuration through a 'glycine zipper' motif, which is crucial for its dimerization and function (Sahoo2021Structural). This motif allows the helices to approach closely, forming a stable right-handed conformer in a lipid bilayer (Sahoo2021Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in EPHA1 and play a significant role in its function. These modifications can affect dimerization and biological activity (Sahoo2021Structural). EPHA1 may also have splice variant isoforms that alter its functional properties, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
EPHA1, a member of the Eph receptor family, is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell signaling through interactions with ephrin ligands. It plays a significant role in mediating cell-cell communication, influencing cell adhesion, shape, and movement. EPHA1 is primarily expressed in epithelial cells and is active at the cell membrane, where it interacts with ephrin ligands to initiate bidirectional signaling pathways. These interactions are crucial for cellular organization and tissue patterning, impacting processes such as angiogenesis, neural development, and immune response (Herath2009Epigenetic; Kou2018Differential).

In healthy human cells, EPHA1 is involved in maintaining the structure and function of epithelial tissues. It is expressed in various tissues, including the skin, kidney, liver, and thymus, and is particularly abundant at the top of the colon crypt in normal tissue. The receptor's role in cell adhesion and motility is essential for maintaining epithelial integrity and function (Herath2009Epigenetic; Kou2018Differential). EPHA1's interactions with its ligands, such as ephrin A1, mediate both proadhesive and anti-adhesive signals, which are important for normal cellular processes and tissue homeostasis (Herath2009Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EPHA1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, most notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In Alzheimer's disease, the P460L mutation in the EPHA1 gene is associated with late-onset AD. This mutation leads to constitutive activation of the receptor, resulting in dysregulated Rho-GTPase signaling, which may contribute to synaptic dysfunction and abnormalities in spine morphology observed in AD pathology (Kim2021Alzheimer’s). The P460L mutation enhances receptor auto-activation and increases tyrosine phosphorylation, affecting downstream signaling pathways such as ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which are crucial for cellular processes related to AD (Kim2021Alzheimer’s).

In Parkinson's disease, EPHA1 is highly expressed in the substantia nigra region and is associated with neuroinflammation and damage to dopaminergic neurons. The activation of EPHA1 in PD models promotes neuroinflammation through the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling pathway, leading to increased α-synuclein protein levels and inflammatory responses (Ma2020EphA1). These findings suggest that EPHA1 plays a significant role in the neuropathological changes associated with both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
EPHA1, a member of the Eph receptor family, engages in specific interactions with various proteins through its SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain. Notably, the SAM domain of EPHA1 binds specifically to the SAM domains of SHIP2 and Odin. This interaction is characterized by a unique End-Helix/Mid-Loop binding mode, which is crucial for the specificity of these interactions (Wang2018Specific). The binding of EPHA1 to SHIP2 and Odin is facilitated by critical residues, such as the conserved arginine, which is essential for maintaining the interaction. Mutations in these residues, such as the R966C mutation in EPHA1, can disrupt binding to SHIP2, highlighting the importance of these interactions in cellular signaling (Wang2018Specific).

EPHA1 also interacts with ephrin-A1, its primary ligand, to mediate cell-cell communication. This interaction plays a significant role in regulating cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. In colorectal cancer, EPHA1 expression is often upregulated, but its downregulation in metastatic stages suggests a complex role in cancer progression, potentially involving epigenetic silencing mechanisms (Herath2009Epigenetic). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of EPHA1 in cellular processes and disease contexts.
