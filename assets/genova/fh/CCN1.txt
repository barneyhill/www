# CCN1

## Overview
CCN1, also known as the gene encoding cellular communication network factor 1, is a critical component in the regulation of various cellular processes. The gene encodes a matricellular protein that is involved in cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, playing a pivotal role in angiogenesis and tissue repair. The protein, characterized by its complex structure comprising domains such as the insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) domain, von Willebrand factor type C (vWC) domain, thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSP1) domain, and cysteine knot (CT) domain, interacts with integrins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans to mediate its functions (Monsen2023Structural; Holbourn2009Proteins). CCN1 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including vascular development, cancer progression, and chronic inflammatory diseases, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Krupska2015Eyeing; Emre2014Matricellular).

## Structure
CCN1, also known as cellular communication network factor 1, is a matricellular protein with a complex molecular structure characterized by several distinct domains. The protein consists of an insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) domain, a von Willebrand factor type C (vWC) domain, a thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSP1) domain, and a cysteine knot (CT) domain (Monsen2023Structural; Holbourn2009Proteins). 

The IGFBP domain features a 2-stranded β-sheet and parallel loops stabilized by disulfide bonds, forming a flat palm structure. Unlike traditional IGFBPs, CCN1 lacks a 'thumb' segment, which affects its IGF binding capabilities (Holbourn2009Proteins). The vWC domain has a 'boot-like' shape with two subdomains, SD1 and SD2, stabilized by disulfide bridges. This domain is involved in interactions with integrins and growth factors like TGFβ and BMP4 (Monsen2023Structural; Holbourn2009Proteins). 

The TSP1 domain is characterized by a small 3-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet and is involved in cell attachment and modulation of extracellular matrix proteins (Holbourn2009Proteins). The CT domain contains a cysteine knot motif, which is common in many extracellular matrix proteins and growth factors, and is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Holbourn2009Proteins). 

CCN1 is secreted as an inactive prepropeptide and requires proteolytic processing to release bioactive ligands (Monsen2023Structural). The protein's structure allows for interactions with various ligands and binding partners, contributing to its diverse biological functions (Monsen2023Structural). The presence of a disulfide bond between C229 and C258 in CCN1 connects a short β-hairpin in the C-terminal end of the hinge with the TSP1 domain, influencing its structural stability (Monsen2023Structural). 

CCN1 also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can affect its function. The protein has multiple splice variants, which may alter its structural and functional properties (Planque2003A).

## Function
CCN1, also known as CYR61, is a matricellular protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It supports cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, particularly in endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and monocytes (Schober2002Identification; Emre2014Matricellular). CCN1 acts as a ligand for integrin receptors, facilitating cell adhesion and migration, which are crucial for angiogenesis and tissue repair (Mo2002CYR61; Chen2006Functional). It is involved in angiogenesis by promoting the morphogenesis of endothelial cells and neovascularization, essential for wound healing and tissue regeneration (Chen2006Functional; Estrada2009Secretome).

CCN1 also regulates the expression of genes related to angiogenesis and matrix remodeling, such as VEGF-A and matrix metalloproteinases, contributing to vascular development and integrity (Mo2002CYR61; Chen2006Functional). It interacts with integrins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, influencing signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt and p38, which regulate cell survival and apoptosis (Chen2006Functional; Emre2014Matricellular). CCN1's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating tissue repair.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CCN1 gene, also known as CYR61, are linked to various diseases and conditions. A missense mutation in the CYR61 gene is associated with severe atrial septal defects in humans, while deletion of the gene in mice leads to severe atrioventricular septal defects, both of which are significant causes of congenital heart disease (Krupska2015Eyeing). In adults, CCN1 expression is notably different in obese men with metabolic syndrome and is associated with plasma LDL and HDL cholesterol levels (Krupska2015Eyeing).

CCN1 is also implicated in several cancers. In breast cancer, increased CCN1 expression is linked to tumor progression and metastasis, particularly to the lungs (O’Kelly2008Functional; Yeger2021The). In lung cancer, CCN1 expression is reduced, correlating with poor prognosis, and it may act as a tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Zhu2020The). In prostate cancer, CCN1 is upregulated and enhances cell migration through integrin function alterations (LI2015Emerging).

CCN1 is also involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, with elevated levels found in conditions such as colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis (Krupska2015Eyeing). Its expression is increased in ocular vascular complications like proliferative diabetic retinopathy (Krupska2015Eyeing).

## Interactions
CCN1, also known as CYR61, is a matricellular protein that engages in various physical interactions with other proteins, primarily through integrins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). It directly binds to integrins such as αvβ3, α6β1, and αvβ5, facilitating processes like cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation (Chen2009Functions; Chen2006Functional). CCN1 also interacts with the HSPG syndecan-4, which is crucial for its function in fibroblasts (Chen2009Functions). 

In the context of angiogenesis, CCN1 binds to integrin αvβ3, promoting endothelial cell adhesion and migration (Chen2009Functions). It also modulates the Wnt signaling pathway, where it can both mediate and antagonize signaling, highlighting its dual role in cellular signaling (Chen2009Functions). CCN1's interaction with integrins is essential for the inactivation of the Yes-associated protein (YAP), a process that involves the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and affects YAP's nuclear localization (Lee2019CCN1–YesAssociated). These interactions underscore CCN1's role in regulating various cellular processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
