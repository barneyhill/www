# SKIC2

## Overview
The SKIC2 gene encodes the SKI2 subunit, a critical component of the superkiller (SKI) complex, which is involved in RNA surveillance and degradation. This gene plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by ensuring the quality control of mRNA through exosome-mediated decay processes. The SKI2 subunit, encoded by SKIC2, functions as a cofactor for the cytoplasmic exosome, facilitating the degradation of aberrant mRNA transcripts and thereby regulating gene expression and maintaining RNA integrity. The SKI complex, including SKI2, is essential for preventing the accumulation of faulty RNA, which could otherwise lead to cellular dysfunction and disease. Mutations in SKIC2 are linked to Trichohepatoenteric syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Yang2024Genome‑wide; Alrammal2024Trichohepatoenteric).

## Structure


## Function
The SKIC2 gene encodes a component of the superkiller (SKI) complex, which plays a crucial role in RNA surveillance and degradation processes. This complex is integral to the exosome-mediated decay of aberrant mRNA, ensuring mRNA quality control within the cell. SKIC2 is active in the cytoplasm, where it helps maintain cellular homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of faulty RNA transcripts (Yang2024Genome‑wide).

The SKI complex, which includes SKIC2, functions as a cofactor for the cytoplasmic exosome, a multi-protein complex involved in RNA degradation. Although no direct interaction between SKIC2 and ZCCHC3, another protein associated with the exosome, was detected, SKIC2 is implied to be part of the SKI complex that assists in the degradation of mRNA transcripts (Goodier2023ZCCHC3). This process is essential for the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of RNA integrity, which are vital for normal cellular function and response to stress.

In healthy human cells, the SKI complex, including SKIC2, ensures the proper degradation of defective mRNA, thereby contributing to the overall fidelity of gene expression and protecting the cell from potential damage caused by the accumulation of erroneous RNA molecules (Yang2024Genome‑wide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SKIC2 gene, also known as SKIV2L, are associated with Trichohepatoenteric syndrome (THES), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. THES is characterized by early-onset intractable diarrhea, woolly hair abnormalities, facial dysmorphism, and liver disease, including conditions such as transaminitis, hepatosplenomegaly, and liver fibrosis. SKIC2 mutations account for approximately one-third of THES cases and are often linked to more severe outcomes compared to mutations in the SKIC3 gene (Alrammal2024Trichohepatoenteric). The clinical manifestations of THES include hepatic anomalies, which are more frequently observed in patients with SKIC2 mutations (88%) than in those with SKIC3 mutations (51%) (Alrammal2024Trichohepatoenteric).

Alterations in SKIC2 expression can disrupt normal RNA processing, potentially leading to pathological conditions. The SKIC2 gene is a component of the superkiller complex, which is crucial for RNA surveillance and degradation. Dysregulation of SKIC2 can impact RNA processing, contributing to diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders or cancer (Chowdhury2022Pancancer). The involvement of SKIC2 in these processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing disease.

## Interactions
SKIC2, also known as the SKI2 subunit, is a crucial component of the SKI complex, which plays a significant role in RNA surveillance and degradation. SKIC2 interacts with other proteins such as SKIC3 and SKIC8 to form the SKI complex. This complex is involved in RNA degradation processes, similar to the proteasome's role in protein degradation (Moreno2022Loss). The SKI complex associates with the exosome complex to facilitate RNA processing and degradation, targeting double-stranded viral RNA for degradation as part of a host-directed antiviral mechanism (Moreno2022Loss).

FOCAD is essential for maintaining the proteostatic levels of SKIC2 and SKIC3. The absence of FOCAD leads to significantly reduced levels of SKIC2 protein, indicating that FOCAD is crucial for the stability of SKIC2 (Moreno2022Loss). This interaction is vital for proper RNA degradation processes, and its disruption can contribute to liver pathology (Moreno2022Loss).

In the context of cancer, SKIC2 is mentioned in relation to its interactions with other proteins, such as TTC37 (SKIC3) and WDR61 (SKIC8), although no direct interaction with ZCCHC3 was detected in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Goodier2023ZCCHC3).
