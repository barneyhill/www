# MBD3L2

## Overview
MBD3L2 is a gene that encodes the methyl-CpG binding domain protein 3 like 2, a protein involved in the regulation of DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling. This protein is known to enhance the enzymatic activity of Tet2, a dioxygenase that plays a critical role in the conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, a key step in DNA demethylation (Peng2016MBD3L2). MBD3L2 is also associated with the NuRD complex, where it can replace other components to modulate transcriptional repression, particularly in the context of diseases such as facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (Campbell2018NuRD). The protein's expression is notably specific to germ cells and related tumors, implicating it in germ cell tumorigenesis and potentially other cancers (Peng2016MBD3L2). Despite its significant roles in disease contexts, the precise functions of MBD3L2 in normal cellular processes remain to be fully elucidated.

## Function
MBD3L2 is a protein that enhances the enzymatic activity of Tet2, a dioxygenase involved in the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which is a crucial step in DNA demethylation. MBD3L2 increases the binding affinity of Tet2 to methylated DNA, thereby enhancing Tet2's enzymatic efficiency and promoting the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC (Peng2016MBD3L2). This interaction is specific to Tet2, as MBD3L2 does not enhance the activity of other TET family members like Tet1 or Tet3 (Peng2016MBD3L2).

MBD3L2's role in enhancing Tet2 activity suggests its involvement in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, particularly in processes related to cancer and cellular metabolism (Peng2016MBD3L2). The protein is specifically expressed in germ cells and related tumors, indicating a potential role in germ cell tumorigenesis (Peng2016MBD3L2). However, the exact function of MBD3L2 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, as its role in normal cellular processes is not explicitly detailed in the available studies (Peng2016MBD3L2).

## Clinical Significance
MBD3L2 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in gene expression regulation and chromatin remodeling. In the context of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), MBD3L2 is a direct target of the DUX4 gene, which is aberrantly expressed in FSHD muscle cells. MBD3L2 can replace components of the NuRD complex, antagonizing its transcriptional repression function, leading to increased DUX4 expression. This amplification of DUX4 expression contributes to the pathology of FSHD by facilitating its spread in multinucleated myotubes (Ferreboeuf2013DUX4; Campbell2018NuRD).

In cancer, MBD3L2 enhances the enzymatic activity of Tet2, a protein involved in DNA demethylation. This interaction increases the binding affinity of Tet2 to methylated DNA, leading to the up-regulation of genes associated with cancer development, such as HOXD1 and IRF4. MBD3L2 is specifically expressed in germ cell tumors, suggesting a role in germ cell tumorigenesis and potentially other cancers by modulating Tet2 activity and affecting DNA methylation patterns (Peng2016MBD3L2). These findings indicate that alterations in MBD3L2 expression or its interactions can significantly impact disease progression in both muscular dystrophy and cancer.

## Interactions
MBD3L2 interacts with the Tet2 protein to enhance its enzymatic activity, specifically in the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. This interaction increases Tet2's binding affinity to methylated DNA, thereby enhancing its catalytic efficiency. MBD3L2 does not bind to methylated DNA itself but facilitates Tet2's binding, suggesting a potential alteration in Tet2's configuration (Peng2016MBD3L2). The interaction between MBD3L2 and Tet2 is specific, as MBD3L2 does not affect the activity of other Tet family members like Tet1 or Tet3 (Peng2016MBD3L2).

MBD3L2 is also involved in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with the NuRD complex. It can replace MBD2 or MBD3 in the NuRD complex, lacking the CpG-binding domain, and antagonize NuRD-mediated transcriptional repression. This interaction potentially prevents the NuRD complex from being recruited to its DNA targets, leading to de-repression of certain genomic regions (Campbell2018NuRD). MBD3L2's interaction with the NuRD complex is significant in the context of diseases like facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, where it modulates the expression of the DUX4 gene (Campbell2018NuRD).
