# RGPD2

## Overview
RGPD2 is a gene that encodes the protein RANBP2-like and GRIP domain containing 2, which is associated with the nuclear pore complex. This protein plays a significant role in nucleocytoplasmic transport, a critical process for the exchange of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Yang2021Gene). The RGPD2 protein is part of the RGPD gene family, which is rapidly evolving and exhibits high expression levels in the human brain, suggesting its involvement in higher-order brain functions and potentially in the regulation of genomic regions linked to human-specific traits (Tajeddin2023Novel). While the precise functions of RGPD2 in human cells are not fully elucidated, its role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and potential regulatory functions in gene expression and cell cycle progression underscore its importance in cellular biology (Yang2021Gene; Tajeddin2023Novel).

## Structure


## Function
RGPD2, also known as RANBP2-like GRIP domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein associated with the nuclear pore complex, playing a crucial role in nucleocytoplasmic transport. This process is essential for the movement of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, which is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Yang2021Gene). The RGPD2 protein shares a high degree of sequence identity with mouse RANBP2, a large nuclear pore protein known to act as a tumor suppressor by preventing chromosome segregation errors (Yang2021Gene).

In humans, the RGPD2 gene is part of the rapidly evolving RGPD gene family, which is under positive selection and has high expression levels in the brain. This suggests a potential role in regulating genomic regions linked to human-specific characteristics, such as higher-order brain functions (Tajeddin2023Novel). Although the specific function of RGPD2 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in nucleocytoplasmic transport and potential regulatory roles in gene expression and cell cycle progression highlight its importance in cellular and organismal biology (Yang2021Gene; Tajeddin2023Novel).
