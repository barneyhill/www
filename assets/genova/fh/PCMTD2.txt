# PCMTD2

## Overview
PCMTD2 is a gene that encodes the protein known as protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase domain containing 2. This protein is primarily involved in the repair and maintenance of proteins by catalyzing the methylation of damaged aspartyl and isoaspartyl residues, a process crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular function (GONZÁLEZFERNÁNDEZ2012Changes). Functioning as an adaptor protein, PCMTD2 plays a significant role in immune regulation by interacting with the CUL5 E3 ligase complex in CD8+ T cells, thereby modulating T cell signaling pathways and immune responses (Liao2024The). The protein's involvement in cellular aging, stress responses, and immune function underscores its importance in various biological processes and its potential implications in diseases such as neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer (Tao2024Machine; Zarrei2019A).

## Function
PCMTD2 encodes a protein involved in the repair and maintenance of proteins by catalyzing the methylation of damaged aspartyl and isoaspartyl residues. This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular function, as the accumulation of these damaged residues can impair protein function (GONZÁLEZFERNÁNDEZ2012Changes). The protein is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a role in cellular aging and stress responses (Tao2024Machine).

In the context of immune function, PCMTD2 acts as an adaptor protein for the CUL5 E3 ligase complex in CD8+ T cells. It negatively regulates the differentiation and activation of effector CD8+ T cells by targeting specific proteins for degradation, thereby modulating T cell signaling pathways (Liao2024The). This regulation is crucial for maintaining the balance of immune responses, as evidenced by increased expression of effector molecules like GZMB and IFNg in PCMTD2 knockout cells, similar to the effects observed with CUL5 knockout (Liao2022The).

PCMTD2's role in protein repair and immune regulation highlights its importance in cellular processes and organismal outcomes, such as immune response modulation and protein homeostasis maintenance.

## Clinical Significance
PCMTD2 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, alterations in expression levels, or disruptions in its normal interactions. In neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and schizophrenia (SCZ), PCMTD2 is affected by duplications, suggesting its role in these conditions (Zarrei2019A). The gene is also identified as a novel driver in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), with mutations verified in multiple specimens, indicating its potential role in the disease's pathology (Fang2018The).

In the context of soft tissue sarcomas, PCMTD2 has been identified as a strong prognostic gene for undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), where it serves as a significant predictor for metastasis-free intervals (van2019Machine). Additionally, changes in PCMTD2 expression have been observed in patients undergoing chemotherapy, suggesting its involvement in apoptosis regulation and response to treatment (GONZÁLEZFERNÁNDEZ2012Changes). These findings highlight the gene's clinical significance across various conditions, emphasizing the need for further research to fully understand its role in disease mechanisms.

## Interactions
PCMTD2, also known as protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase domain containing 2, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In CD8+ T cells, PCMTD2 interacts specifically with the CUL5 E3 ligase complex. This interaction is crucial as PCMTD2 acts as a substrate receptor for CUL5, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of proteins involved in TCR and IL2 signaling pathways. This interaction negatively regulates CD8+ T cell differentiation and activation, impacting their effector functions and anti-tumor activity (Liao2022The; Liao2024The).

PCMTD2 is also associated with other proteins such as IL2RB and CD247, which are potential substrates of the CUL5 E3 ligase complex. These proteins are targeted for ubiquitination and degradation through PCMTD2, highlighting its role in modulating T cell signaling pathways (Liao2024The). In the context of chemotherapy, PCMTD2 interacts with genes like PDCD10 and PSMB1, which are involved in apoptosis and protein degradation, respectively. These interactions suggest a role for PCMTD2 in the cellular response to chemotherapy, potentially influencing apoptosis and cell survival (GONZÁLEZFERNÁNDEZ2012Changes).
