# PDCL2

## Overview
PDCL2 is a gene that encodes the protein phosducin-like 2 (PhLP2), which functions as a co-chaperone involved in the folding and assembly of cytoskeletal proteins and cell cycle regulators. PhLP2 interacts with the cytosolic chaperonin CCT (chaperonin containing TCP-1), playing a crucial role in the proper folding of proteins such as actin and tubulin, which are essential for maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and facilitating cell cycle progression (Stirling2007Functional). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in human cells, indicating its fundamental role in cellular homeostasis and signal transduction (Willardson2007Function). PDCL2 is also implicated in spermiogenesis and male fertility, with its expression being critical for the proper folding of actin during sperm development (Li2022PDCL2). Alterations in PDCL2 expression have been associated with various diseases, including cancer and male infertility, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Yang2023Identification; Jamin2021Combined).

## Function
PDCL2, also known as phosducin-like protein 2 (PhLP2), plays a significant role in the folding and assembly of cytoskeletal proteins and cell cycle regulators in human cells. It interacts with the cytosolic chaperonin CCT (chaperonin containing TCP-1), which is crucial for the proper folding of proteins such as actin and tubulin, essential components of the cytoskeleton (Stirling2007Functional). PDCL2 acts as a co-chaperone, modulating the activity of CCT and forming ternary complexes with CCT and actin, which can slow down the folding process (Stirling2007Functional). This interaction is vital for maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and proper cell cycle progression, as disruptions in PDCL2 function can lead to defects in these processes (Stirling2007Functional).

In addition to its role in cytoskeletal protein folding, PDCL2 is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression, particularly the G1/S transition, as evidenced by studies in yeast and other eukaryotic organisms (Stirling2007Functional). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in human cells, indicating its fundamental role in cellular homeostasis and signal transduction (Willardson2007Function).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PDCL2 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and male infertility. In kidney cancer, high expression levels of PDCL2 are linked to decreased survival rates, suggesting its potential role as a negative prognostic marker. This association indicates that PDCL2 might negatively regulate tumor suppressor genes, impacting cancer progression (Jamin2021Combined). In lung adenocarcinoma, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PDCL2 gene have been associated with progression-free survival in never-smoking patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, highlighting its potential impact on treatment outcomes (Chang2017Genetic).

In the realm of male infertility, PDCL2 is significantly downregulated in Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS), a severe form of non-obstructive azoospermia. This downregulation suggests its importance in spermatogenesis and its potential as a non-invasive biomarker for diagnosing SCOS (Yang2023Identification). In mice, the absence of PDCL2 leads to male infertility characterized by malformed and immotile sperm, underscoring its critical role in spermiogenesis and male reproductive health (Li2022PDCL2).

## Interactions
PDCL2 (phosducin-like 2) is involved in protein interactions that are crucial for its role in spermiogenesis and male fertility. It interacts with the CCT (chaperonin containing TCP-1) complex, a group II chaperonin involved in ATP-dependent protein folding. This interaction is significant for the proper folding of actin during spermiogenesis, as PDCL2 is suggested to play a role in actin protein folding (Li2022PDCL2). The interaction between PDCL2 and CCT was confirmed through a GST pull-down assay, indicating a direct physical association (Li2022PDCL2).

PDCL2's function appears to be conserved across species, as mouse PDCL2 can rescue defects in PLP2-deficient yeast, suggesting a similar role in protein folding processes (Li2022PDCL2). The study also speculates on the compensatory role of PDCL3, a paralog of PDCL2, due to their high sequence similarity and interaction with CCT, although PDCL3 is ubiquitously expressed while PDCL2 is germline-specific (Li2022PDCL2). These interactions highlight PDCL2's involvement in the formation of multiprotein complexes essential for cellular processes related to fertility.
