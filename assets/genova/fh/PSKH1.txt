# PSKH1

## Overview
The PSKH1 gene encodes the protein serine kinase H1, a member of the serine/threonine kinase family, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes. This kinase is characterized by its involvement in pre-mRNA splicing and the structural maintenance of the Golgi apparatus, as well as its localization to centrosomes, Golgi, and nuclear compartments (Brede2002PSKH1; Brede2000Characterization). The PSKH1 protein is distinguished by its conserved kinase motifs and post-translational modifications, including myristoylation and palmitoylation, which are essential for its membrane association and function (Brede2000Characterization; Brede2003Mutants). Through its interactions with spliceosome components and its regulatory influence on SR proteins, PSKH1 is integral to RNA splicing regulation and cellular stress responses (Brede2002PSKH1; Brede2003Mutants).

## Structure
The PSKH1 protein is a serine/threonine kinase with a primary structure consisting of 424 amino acids and a molecular mass of 48.1 kDa (Brede2000Characterization). Its sequence includes conserved motifs typical of serine/threonine kinases, such as an ATP-binding motif and specific subdomain sequences (Brede2000Characterization). The protein shares similarity with CaMKI, CaMKII, and CaMKIV, particularly with rat CaMKI, although it lacks an obvious calmodulin-binding domain (Brede2000Characterization).

The secondary structure of PSKH1 likely includes elements that form an amphiphilic α-helix, as suggested by its sequence (Brede2000Characterization). The tertiary structure involves potential nuclear localization and export signals, with a C-terminal region rich in serines and arginines, indicating a role in pre-mRNA processing (Brede2000Characterization). PSKH1 forms homodimers, as evidenced by yeast two-hybrid assays and gel filtration experiments, suggesting a quaternary structure involving dimerization (Brede2000Characterization).

Post-translational modifications of PSKH1 include multiple phosphorylation sites, N-glycosylation sites, and a myristoylation site, which are crucial for its regulatory roles and localization (Brede2000Characterization; Brede2003Mutants). Myristoylation at Glycine 2 and palmitoylation at Cysteine 3 are essential for its Golgi targeting and membrane association (Brede2003Mutants).

## Function
The PSKH1 gene encodes a protein serine kinase involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PSKH1 is primarily localized to the centrosomes, Golgi apparatus, and nucleus, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular functions (Brede2000Characterization). It plays a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing by associating with splice factor compartments (SFCs) within the nucleus. PSKH1 interacts dynamically with spliceosome components, particularly SR proteins, which are essential regulators of pre-mRNA splicing. This interaction suggests that PSKH1 influences the phosphorylation status of SR proteins, thereby modulating their function in splicing (Brede2002PSKH1).

PSKH1 is also involved in the structural and regulatory maintenance of the Golgi apparatus. Its localization to the Golgi is dependent on dual acylation, specifically myristoylation and palmitoylation, which are crucial for its membrane association and function (Brede2003Mutants). The protein's role in the Golgi apparatus is essential for the secretory pathway, as it is involved in the posttranslational modification and transport of proteins (Brede2003Mutants). Additionally, PSKH1's presence in the centrosome suggests a role in cell division and stress response (Brede2000Characterization).

## Interactions
PSKH1, a serine kinase, is involved in various protein interactions, particularly within splice factor compartments (SFCs). It forms homodimers, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid assays and gel filtration experiments, indicating a specific PSKH1-PSKH1 interaction (Brede2000Characterization). PSKH1 does not directly interact with SR proteins such as SC35 and ASF/SF2, as shown by pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays (Brede2002PSKH1). However, it co-localizes with SC35 in nuclear speckles, suggesting an indirect interaction or functional association (Brede2002PSKH1).

PSKH1's interaction with SR proteins is further supported by its ability to reorganize SR proteins into a more diffuse nuclear pattern upon overexpression, although this effect does not depend on its kinase activity (Brede2002PSKH1). The catalytic kinase domain and C-terminal region of PSKH1 are crucial for its association with SFCs, and its overexpression affects the splicing pattern of the E1A minigene, indicating a role in RNA splicing regulation (Brede2002PSKH1). These interactions highlight PSKH1's involvement in the regulation of splicing and its potential role in modulating the intranuclear distribution of splicing factors.
