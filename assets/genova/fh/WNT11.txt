# WNT11

## Overview
WNT11 is a gene that encodes the protein Wnt family member 11, which is part of the Wnt family of secreted signaling proteins. These proteins are integral to various developmental and cellular processes, particularly in non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. Wnt family member 11 is involved in crucial functions such as cardiac differentiation, osteogenic differentiation, and cell migration. It interacts with Frizzled receptors and atypical cadherins, influencing cell adhesion and signaling pathways. The protein's role extends to pathological conditions, where alterations in WNT11 expression are linked to several cancers, including colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Boyan2018Role; Dart2019Wnt11; AbdulGhani2011Wnt11).

## Structure
WNT11 is a member of the Wnt protein family, which are secreted signaling proteins involved in various developmental processes. The primary structure of WNT11 consists of a sequence of amino acids, typically featuring conserved cysteine residues. The secondary structure often includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets. Tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, stabilized by disulfide bonds. WNT11 may form multimeric complexes, indicating a quaternary structure. Post-translational modifications like glycosylation and palmitoylation are common, affecting protein stability and signaling. Splice variants can lead to different isoforms with potentially distinct functions.

## Function
WNT11 is a non-canonical Wnt gene that plays a crucial role in various cellular and developmental processes. In embryonic development, WNT11 is expressed in multiple tissues, including the heart, where it is essential for cardiac differentiation and the organization of myocardial cells. It influences the distribution of N-cadherin and β-catenin, which are vital for cytoskeletal and sarcomeric organization, and may function through the planar cell polarity pathway to control cell movement in the ventricular wall (Uysal‐Onganer2011Wnt11; Nagy2009Wnt11).

WNT11 promotes cardiomyocyte development by engaging caspase-dependent signaling, which suppresses canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathways. This suppression is achieved through the interaction of WNT11 with the Fzd4 receptor, leading to increased caspase activity that targets β-catenin, disrupting its signaling (AbdulGhani2011Wnt11). In adults, WNT11 continues to be expressed in the heart, where it affects the myocardial electrical gradient and may aid in cardiac recovery post-myocardial infarction (Uysal‐Onganer2011Wnt11).

WNT11 also plays a role in osteogenic differentiation, particularly in the context of human mesenchymal stem cells on microstructured titanium surfaces. It influences the expression of osteoblast-related genes and interacts with WNT5a, suggesting a role in bone remodeling and vascularization (Boyan2018Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the WNT11 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer, including colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and prostate cancer. In CRC, WNT11 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues and is associated with increased tumor invasion and metastasis, as well as higher mortality rates (GorroñoEtxebarria2019Wnt11; Nishioka2011Possible). WNT11 operates independently of β-catenin-dependent signaling, suggesting a unique pathway in CRC progression (GorroñoEtxebarria2019Wnt11). 

In PDAC, WNT11 expression is also elevated and correlates with increased invasiveness and poorer survival outcomes. Silencing WNT11 in PDAC cell lines reduces invasiveness, indicating its role in cancer metastasis (Dart2019Wnt11). 

In prostate cancer, WNT11 is expressed in high-grade tumors and bone metastases, where it may promote invasion and progression to androgen independence. It is also necessary for neuroendocrine-like differentiation in prostate cancer cells (UysalOnganer2010Wnt11). 

These findings suggest that WNT11 could serve as a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in these cancers.

## Interactions
WNT11 interacts with various proteins and receptors, playing a significant role in different signaling pathways. It is known to interact with Frizzled receptors, such as Frizzled-7 (Fzd7) and Frizzled-8 (FZD8), which are crucial for its signaling functions. In zebrafish gastrulation, WNT11 controls cell contact persistence by accumulating Fzd7 at the plasma membrane, which recruits Dishevelled (Dsh) and WNT11 itself, enhancing cell contact persistence (Witzel2006Wnt11). In prostate cancer, WNT11 interacts with FZD8, integrating WNT11 and TGF-β signals to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (MurilloGarzón2018Frizzled8).

WNT11 also interacts with atypical cadherins like Flamingo, influencing cell adhesion and migration (Uysal‐Onganer2011Wnt11). It is involved in the endocytosis and recycling of E-cadherin, mediated through Rab5c, which is essential for cell cohesion during zebrafish gastrulation (Ulrich2005Wnt11). Additionally, WNT11 forms homodimers and possibly higher-order oligomers, although it does not form heterodimers with Wnt5a (Cha2008Wnt5a). These interactions highlight WNT11's role in modulating cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation through various signaling pathways.
