# AKAP11

## Overview
AKAP11 is a gene that encodes the protein A-kinase anchoring protein 11, which is a member of the A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) family. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by anchoring protein kinase A (PKA) to specific subcellular locations, thereby facilitating the spatial and temporal regulation of PKA activity. As a scaffolding protein, AKAP11 is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics, neuronal homeostasis, and gene expression regulation. The protein is characterized by its RII-binding domain, which is essential for its interaction with PKA, and may also contain coiled-coil regions that contribute to its structural stability and involvement in multiprotein complexes. AKAP11's interactions with other proteins, such as glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), further underscore its role in organizing signaling complexes and regulating cellular processes related to movement and morphology (Whiting2015Protein; Logue2011AKAP220). The gene's significance extends to clinical implications, as mutations in AKAP11 have been associated with psychiatric disorders, highlighting its importance in neuronal plasticity and cellular signaling pathways (Palmer2021Exome; Farhangdoost2024Transcriptomic).

## Structure
AKAP11, a member of the A-kinase anchoring protein family, is characterized by its ability to bind the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) and localize it to specific cellular compartments. The protein structure of AKAP11 includes a distinct RII-binding domain, which is crucial for its role in anchoring PKA. This domain facilitates the interaction with PKA, ensuring its precise cellular localization and function.

The protein may also contain coiled-coil regions, which contribute to its structural stability. These regions are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in the formation of multiprotein complexes. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are known to regulate the function of AKAP11, potentially affecting its interaction with other proteins and its anchoring capabilities.

AKAP11 is expressed in multiple splice variants, leading to the production of different isoforms. These isoforms may have distinct functions or localizations within the cell, allowing AKAP11 to participate in a variety of cellular processes. The presence of these splice variants highlights the complexity and versatility of AKAP11 in cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
The AKAP11 gene encodes a protein known as A-kinase anchoring protein 11, which plays a crucial role in cellular signaling by anchoring protein kinase A (PKA) to specific subcellular locations. This scaffolding function allows AKAP11 to facilitate the spatial and temporal regulation of PKA activity, impacting various cellular processes. AKAP11 is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, influencing actin polymerization and microtubule organization, which are essential for cell migration and membrane ruffling (Whiting2015Protein; Logue2011AKAP220).

In neuronal cells, AKAP11 regulates PKA signaling by associating with autophagosomes, acting as a scaffold for the PKA holoenzyme, and facilitating its access to specific substrates. This regulation is crucial for maintaining neuronal cell homeostasis and involves the autophagic degradation of the PKA complex (SeguraRoman2024Autophagosomes). AKAP11 also influences gene expression by affecting transcription factor activity and chromatin accessibility, impacting processes such as synaptic plasticity and neuronal function (Farhangdoost2024Transcriptomic).

AKAP11's interactions with other proteins, such as glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), further highlight its role in organizing signaling complexes and regulating cellular processes related to movement and morphology (Whiting2015Protein; Logue2011AKAP220).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AKAP11 gene have been associated with significant clinical implications, particularly in psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. AKAP11 has been identified as a large-effect risk gene for both conditions, with heterozygous loss of function mutations linked to these diseases (Palmer2021Exome; Farhangdoost2024Transcriptomic). The gene's involvement in these disorders is supported by its role in neuronal plasticity and interaction with protein kinase A (PKA) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), the latter being a target of lithium therapy for bipolar disorder (Herzog2023Mouse; Palmer2021Exome).

Research has shown that AKAP11 mutations can lead to dysregulation of enhancer activity, affecting gene expression and contributing to the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This dysregulation involves changes in chromatin state and gene regulatory networks, impacting pathways related to transcription factor activity and cellular signaling (Farhangdoost2024Transcriptomic). Additionally, AKAP11 mutations have been linked to alterations in DNA methylation and histone acetylation, further influencing gene expression and neuronal function (Farhangdoost2024Transcriptomic). These findings underscore the gene's critical role in the molecular mechanisms underlying these psychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
AKAP11, also known as A-kinase anchoring protein 11, is involved in various protein interactions that facilitate its role in cellular signaling. It interacts with the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA) through a conserved amphipathic helix, which is crucial for strong binding and localization of PKA to specific subcellular sites (Omar2020AKAP). AKAP11 forms a complex with the PKA holoenzyme, composed of RIa and Ca subunits, and is involved in autophagic degradation processes (SeguraRoman2024Autophagosomes). This interaction is mediated by a putative LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which is essential for binding to autophagic machinery proteins like LC3B and GABARAP (SeguraRoman2024Autophagosomes).

AKAP11 also interacts with several other proteins, including glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), and IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), forming a signaling network that influences cell motility and cytoskeletal dynamics (Logue2011AKAP220; Omar2020AKAP). These interactions allow AKAP11 to organize signaling complexes within specific cellular compartments, impacting processes such as microtubule polymerization and cell migration (Logue2011AKAP220). AKAP11's role in these interactions highlights its importance in coordinating cellular signaling pathways.
