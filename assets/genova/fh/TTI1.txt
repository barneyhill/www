# TTI1

## Overview
The TTI1 gene encodes the TELO2 interacting protein 1, a critical component of the TELO2-TTI1-TTI2 (TTT) complex. This protein complex is integral to the stabilization and assembly of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs), which are pivotal in the DNA damage response and maintaining genomic stability. TTI1, characterized by HEAT repeats, functions as a molecular scaffold within the TTT complex, facilitating protein-protein interactions essential for the proper folding and maturation of PIKKs. The TTT complex, acting as a co-chaperone with Hsp90, is involved in the biogenesis of PIKKs, impacting cellular stress responses and organismal development. Mutations in TTI1 have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer and neurogenetic disorders, underscoring its significance in cellular and developmental processes (Bhadra2023TTT; Hurov2010A).

## Structure
The TTI1 protein is a component of the TELO2-TTI1-TTI2 (TTT) complex, which plays a crucial role in the stabilization and assembly of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs). Structurally, TTI1 is characterized by the presence of HEAT repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and serve as molecular scaffolds (Hurov2010A). These HEAT repeats contribute to the α-solenoid structure of TTI1, forming a curved scaffold that supports the entire TTT complex (Bhadra2023TTT).

In terms of tertiary structure, TTI1 interacts extensively with the N-terminal domain of Tel2 and binds to Tti2 at its C-terminus, facilitating the formation of a stable heterotrimeric complex in a 1:1:1 molar ratio (Bhadra2023TTT). The TTT complex, including TTI1, interacts with the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ring, part of the R2TP chaperone complex, through its concave inner surface, which wraps around the DII domain of a RUVBL1 subunit (Pal2020Structure).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in the function and interactions of the TTT complex. CK2 phosphorylation of Tel2 is crucial for the interaction of the TTT complex with other proteins, such as the TP complex and Hsp90 (Bhadra2023TTT).

## Function
TTI1 (TELO2 interacting protein 1) is a crucial component of the TTT complex, which also includes TELO2 and TTI2. This complex plays a significant role in the stability and function of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs), such as ATM and ATR, which are essential for the DNA damage response (DDR) and maintaining genomic stability in human cells (Hurov2010A). TTI1 is involved in the stabilization and maturation of PIKKs, interacting with newly synthesized peptides to assist in their proper folding and assembly, which is crucial for their biological function (Bhadra2023TTT).

The TTT complex acts as a co-chaperone with Hsp90, facilitating the biogenesis of PIKKs by promoting their stability and maturation (Bhadra2023TTT). TTI1 is necessary for the interaction of the TTT complex with ATM, a major DDR kinase, and is critical for the proper functioning of DDR signaling pathways (Hurov2010A). The TTT complex is also suggested to aid in the proper folding of newly synthesized PIKKs, releasing them once folded for activation by signal transduction pathways (Hurov2010A). TTI1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting cellular stress responses and organismal development (Bhadra2023TTT).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TTI1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and neurogenetic disorders. In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TTI1 is upregulated and associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Its expression is positively correlated with ALKBH5, an oncogene in HCC, suggesting that TTI1 plays a critical role in cancer progression and could serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Chang2024ALKBH5).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TTI1 functions as an oncogene by regulating mTOR activity, which is crucial for cancer cell growth and metastasis. High TTI1 expression is linked to poor prognosis, larger tumors, and advanced cancer stages, making it a potential biomarker for predicting NSCLC prognosis and recurrence (Zhang2022Role).

Beyond cancer, mutations in TTI1 are associated with neurogenetic disorders characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, and brain malformations. These mutations can destabilize the TTT complex, affecting the protein levels and activities of PIKKs, which may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders (Bhadra2023TTT). The TTT complex's involvement in the mTOR pathway further implicates TTI1 in various conditions, highlighting its potential as a target for cancer chemotherapy (Bhadra2023TTT).

## Interactions
TTI1 (TELO2 interacting protein 1) is a component of the TTT complex, which includes TELO2 and TTI2. This complex is essential for the stability and function of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs) such as ATM, ATR, and mTOR. TTI1 interacts with these kinases, playing a crucial role in their stabilization and function within the DNA damage response (DDR) pathways (Hurov2010A).

TTI1 serves as a platform for the binding of TELO2 and TTI2, facilitating the proper folding and stabilization of newly synthesized PIKKs. Once folded, these kinases are released for activation, although TTI1 interacts less effectively with activated PIKKs and does not localize to DNA damage sites (Hurov2010A). TTI1 also interacts with the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ring within the R2TP chaperone complex, modulating its ATPase activity and affecting the recruitment of mTOR (Pal2020Structure).

The interaction of TTI1 with Hsp90 is crucial for the stabilization of TELO2 and TTI1 itself, as Hsp90 ATPase activity is necessary for these interactions. Inhibition of Hsp90 affects the interactions between TELO2 and other proteins like ATR and mTOR, impacting cell metabolism and DNA repair processes (Lynham2022The).
