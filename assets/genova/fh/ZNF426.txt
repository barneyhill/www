# ZNF426

## Overview
ZNF426 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 426, a member of the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc finger protein family. This protein functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator, characterized by its zinc finger motifs that enable binding to specific DNA sequences. Zinc finger protein 426 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it plays a critical role in modulating gene expression, influencing processes such as cell differentiation and development. It is also involved in immune responses, particularly in the regulation of viral replication, by repressing the transcription of viral genes such as the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) transactivator RTA gene. This repression is crucial for maintaining viral latency and controlling the lytic phase, thereby contributing to immune homeostasis. Additionally, ZNF426 is part of a KRAB-ZNF cluster on chromosome 19, which has been suggested to play a role in local adaptation and disease resistance (Santoni2014Kruppelassociated; Rakhra2021Zinc; Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF426, a member of the zinc finger protein family, functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator in healthy human cells. It is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate its binding to specific DNA sequences, allowing it to modulate the transcription of target genes. This protein is typically active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional machinery, playing a crucial role in cell differentiation and development (Rakhra2021Zinc).

In the context of immune responses, ZNF426 is involved in the regulation of viral replication. It acts as a repressor of the transcription of the KSHV transactivator RTA gene, which is crucial for maintaining the virus in its latent stage. This repression is significant for controlling the lytic phase of the virus, thereby contributing to immune homeostasis (Rakhra2021Zinc).

ZNF426 is also part of the KRAB-ZFP family, which is known for its role in adaptive immunity. These proteins, including ZNF426, interact with cofactors like KAP1 to regulate NFkB transcription factors, which are important for controlling interleukin production and other immune responses (Rakhra2021Zinc).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF426, also known as K-RBP, is a zinc finger protein that participates in the repression of viral gene expression. It is specifically involved in repressing the transcription of the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) transactivator RTA gene, which is crucial for inducing the lytic phase from latency. This suggests that ZNF426 interacts with viral nucleic acids to exert its repressive function (Santoni2014Kruppelassociated; Rakhra2021Zinc).

ZNF426 is part of a KRAB-ZNF cluster on chromosome 19, which is a candidate for positive selection in certain human populations, indicating its potential role in local adaptation and disease resistance. However, specific interactions of ZNF426 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its role in viral repression are not extensively detailed in the available literature (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

In the context of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), ZNF426 expression is significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. While the study highlights its potential as a biomarker, it does not provide specific information on interactions with proteins or nucleic acids in this context (Sobocińska2022Zinc).
