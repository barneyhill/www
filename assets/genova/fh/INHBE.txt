# INHBE

## Overview
The INHBE gene encodes the inhibin subunit beta E, a protein that is part of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. This protein is primarily expressed in the liver and plays a significant role in the regulation of energy storage and fat distribution within the body. As a member of the inhibin and activin protein family, inhibin subunit beta E is involved in various cellular signaling pathways, particularly those influencing metabolic health. It acts as a negative regulator of energy storage in peripheral adipose tissue, thereby affecting body fat distribution and contributing to metabolic processes. The gene's function and its associated protein interactions suggest potential therapeutic implications for metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, due to its influence on fat distribution and metabolic profiles (Akbari2022Multiancestry; Ryanto2023Inactivating).

## Structure


## Function
The INHBE gene encodes the inhibin βE subunit, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, which is primarily expressed in hepatocytes. This protein is involved in the regulation of energy storage and fat distribution in the body. Inhibin βE acts as a negative regulator of energy storage in peripheral adipose tissue, influencing the distribution of body fat and playing a role in metabolic health (Akbari2022Multiancestry). 

Loss-of-function mutations in INHBE are associated with favorable fat distribution, characterized by a lower BMI-adjusted waist-to-hip ratio, larger hip circumference, and a lower visceral-to-gluteofemoral fat ratio. These mutations are also linked to a favorable metabolic profile, including lower levels of HbA1c, apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides, as well as higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Akbari2022Multiancestry). 

The protein's activity is primarily localized to the liver, with no expression detected in visceral or subcutaneous adipose tissues (Akbari2022Multiancestry). The INHBE gene's role in regulating fat distribution and metabolic health suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (Akbari2022Multiancestry).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the INHBE gene, particularly rare predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) variants, have been associated with favorable fat distribution and a protective effect against type 2 diabetes. These genetic variants are linked to a lower BMI-adjusted waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), larger hip circumference, and a lower visceral-to-gluteofemoral fat ratio, indicating a beneficial fat distribution profile. Individuals carrying these variants also exhibit lower odds of developing type 2 diabetes, reduced levels of HbA1c, apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides, alongside higher HDL cholesterol levels, suggesting a favorable metabolic phenotype (Akbari2022Multiancestry).

The INHBE gene encodes a protein that acts as a liver-expressed negative regulator of adipose storage. Its loss of function is associated with protection from liver inflammation, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Higher expression levels of INHBE have been observed in conditions such as insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and inflammation, indicating a maladaptive response to excess caloric intake (Akbari2022Multiancestry). The study suggests that inhibiting INHBE could be a potential therapeutic strategy for metabolic diseases related to improper fat storage (Akbari2022Multiancestry).

## Interactions
INHBE, a member of the inhibin and activin protein family, participates in various interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. As a beta subunit, INHBE can dimerize with other inhibin subunits to form activins, which are involved in the regulation of numerous physiological processes. Activins, including those containing INHBE, interact with type II activin receptors (ActRIIA and ActRIIB), which are serine/threonine kinases. These receptors form complexes with type I receptors such as activin-like kinase 4 (ALK4) or ALK7, leading to the phosphorylation of intracellular Smad proteins, specifically Smad-2 and Smad-3. These phosphorylated Smads then associate with Smad-4 to modulate gene transcription (Ryanto2023Inactivating; Barakat2012Activins).

Inhibins, which can include INHBE as a beta subunit, act as antagonists to activins by binding to the proteoglycan betaglycan. This interaction sequesters type II activin receptors, thereby preventing activin signaling. This mechanism is crucial for the regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion and other physiological processes (VALE2004Activins). Additionally, molecules like follistatin can bind to activins, including those with INHBE, neutralizing them and preventing receptor binding (Ryanto2023Inactivating).
