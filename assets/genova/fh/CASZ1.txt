# CASZ1

## Overview
The CASZ1 gene encodes the castor zinc finger 1 protein, a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including development and disease. This gene is known for its two major isoforms, CASZ1a and CASZ1b, which differ in their zinc finger motifs and functional domains. The protein encoded by CASZ1 is involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, and DNA repair, interacting with complexes such as the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex. CASZ1 is crucial for neural, cardiac, and skeletal muscle development, influencing cell differentiation and proliferation. Clinically, mutations in CASZ1 are associated with congenital heart diseases, cardiomyopathies, and various cancers, where it can function as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene depending on the context (Jian2023CASZ1:; Liu2023Role; Liu2014Essential).

## Structure
The CASZ1 gene encodes a zinc finger transcription factor with two major isoforms, CASZ1a and CASZ1b. CASZ1a is the full-length isoform, consisting of 1759 amino acids and 11 TFIIIA class C2H2 zinc finger motifs, while CASZ1b comprises 1166 amino acids, sharing the first 1166 amino acids with CASZ1a but lacking the last 6 zinc fingers (Liu2006Molecular; Virden2012Characterization). These zinc finger motifs are critical for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, with the ZF1-4 domain being particularly important for CASZ1b's function (Virden2012Characterization).

CASZ1 proteins contain nuclear localization signals (NLS) that facilitate their nuclear import, essential for their role as transcription factors. CASZ1b has two NLSs, with NLS1 being crucial for nuclear localization (Virden2012Characterization). The protein also features a nuclear export signal (NES) that regulates its subcellular localization (Liu2016Identification).

CASZ1b interacts with the NuRD complex and DNA repair proteins, with specific regions such as the N-terminus and zinc fingers being vital for these interactions (Liu2015Zinc). The presence of a poly(ADP-ribose) binding motif between ZF3 and ZF4 is necessary for binding to histone H3 and DNA repair proteins (Liu2015Zinc). These interactions suggest a role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation.

## Function
The CASZ1 gene encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a crucial role in various developmental processes in healthy human cells. It is significantly involved in neural and heart development. In neural development, CASZ1 is expressed in the dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord during neurogenesis, where it influences the differentiation of neural progenitor cells into neurons and glial cells. It is regulated by the transcription factor Prrxl1 and is involved in extending the cell cycle duration, which may aid in neuronal differentiation (Liu2023Role).

In heart development, CASZ1 is essential for cardiomyocyte differentiation and proliferation. It is highly expressed during cardiac morphogenesis and is associated with terminal differentiation. CASZ1 deficiency can lead to reduced cardiomyocyte numbers, abnormal cardiac morphogenesis, and congenital heart defects. It interacts with proteins like CHD5 and TBX20, which are crucial for cardiac morphogenesis and homeostasis (Liu2023Role; Liu2014Essential).

CASZ1 also plays a significant role in skeletal muscle differentiation. It regulates myogenic regulatory factors such as MYOD and MYOG, forming a feed-forward loop essential for muscle differentiation. CASZ1 binds to promoter, enhancer, and super-enhancer regions of muscle genes, increasing chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activation (Liu2020CASZ1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CASZ1 gene are linked to a variety of diseases and conditions. In cardiovascular health, CASZ1 mutations are associated with congenital heart diseases (CHD) and cardiomyopathies. Loss-of-function mutations can lead to structural heart defects, such as ventricular septal defects (VSD) and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), potentially due to impaired cardiomyocyte proliferation (Jian2023CASZ1:; Liu2023Role). Specific mutations, like p.L38P and p.K351X, have been identified in families with VSD and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), respectively (Liu2023Role). CASZ1 is also implicated in left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) (Jian2023CASZ1:).

In cancer, CASZ1 acts as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the context. It is downregulated in neuroblastoma, where its reduced expression is linked to poor prognosis (Jian2023CASZ1:). CASZ1 mutations and expression changes are also observed in rhabdomyosarcoma, where they contribute to impaired muscle differentiation (Liu2020CASZ1). In hepatocellular carcinoma, CASZ1 downregulation is associated with poor outcomes (Jian2023CASZ1:).

CASZ1 is also involved in hypertension and stroke risk, with specific gene variants linked to these conditions (Liu2023Role). Its methylation status is associated with cardiovascular disease mortality and metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes mellitus (Liu2023Role).

## Interactions
CASZ1, particularly the CASZ1b isoform, is involved in multiple protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a transcription factor. CASZ1b interacts with the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex, which includes subunits such as MTA1/2/3, HDAC1/2, CHD4, and MBD3. This interaction is essential for CASZ1b's role in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription regulation (Liu2015Zinc). The N-terminus of CASZ1b is critical for binding with the NuRD complex, and specific amino acids, such as L31, are vital for this interaction (Liu2016Identification).

CASZ1b also binds to histones, including HIST1H4A, HIST1H2AA, and HIST1H2BB, and DNA repair proteins like PARP1, XRCC1, XRCC5, and XRCC6. These interactions are mediated by a poly(ADP-ribose) binding motif located between its zinc finger domains ZF3 and ZF4 (Liu2015Zinc). The interaction with DNA repair proteins suggests a role in linking gene transcription with DNA repair processes (Liu2015Zinc).

CASZ1b acts as a transcriptional corepressor of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) by forming a complex with the Mi-2/NuRD complex, thereby modulating MR-mediated transcriptional activity (Yokota2020CASZ1b). These interactions highlight CASZ1b's multifaceted role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes.
