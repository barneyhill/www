# NOD1

## Overview
NOD1, or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes an intracellular receptor protein involved in the innate immune response. The NOD1 protein is categorized as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and is integral to the detection of bacterial components, particularly peptidoglycan fragments from Gram-negative bacteria. Structurally, NOD1 is characterized by a tripartite domain architecture, including an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD), a central nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NBD), and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which collectively facilitate its role in immune signaling (Majumdar2017Homology; Strober2005Signalling). Upon activation, NOD1 initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial molecules (KussDuerkop2020NOD1). NOD1 is expressed in various cell types, with significant expression in epithelial cells, where it contributes to maintaining gut homeostasis and immune surveillance (KaparakisLiaskos2015The). Its involvement in autophagy and interactions with other proteins underscore its critical role in modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Correa2012Roles; Mukherjee2019NOD1).

## Structure
NOD1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the immune response, characterized by a tripartite domain structure. It consists of an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD), a central nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NBD), and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain (Majumdar2017Homology; Strober2005Signalling). The CARD domain is involved in protein-protein interactions essential for downstream signaling (Majumdar2017Homology). The NBD domain is critical for ATP binding and hydrolysis, facilitating oligomerization and activation of NOD1 (Zurek2011Mutational). The LRR domain is responsible for recognizing bacterial ligands, such as peptidoglycan fragments, and is crucial for the protein's role in detecting bacterial components (Girardin2005Identification).

The NOD1 protein can form a homodimer through the swapping of helices in the CARD domain, which is part of the Death Domain superfamily (Ver2014Crystal). This dimerization is important for its interaction with ubiquitin, which occurs at a unique interface involving several key residues (Ver2014Crystal). NOD1 also has splice variant isoforms that lack certain repeats in the LRR domain, affecting its ability to sense specific muropeptides (Girardin2005Identification).

## Function
NOD1 is an intracellular receptor that plays a critical role in the innate immune response by detecting specific components of bacterial cell walls, particularly peptidoglycan fragments containing meso-diaminopimelic acid, which are prevalent in Gram-negative bacteria (Caruso2014NOD1; KaparakisLiaskos2015The). Upon activation by these bacterial components, NOD1 oligomerizes and recruits the adaptor protein RIPK2, initiating a signaling cascade that activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. This leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial molecules, which are essential for host defense and pathogen clearance (Trindade2020NOD1; KussDuerkop2020NOD1).

NOD1 is ubiquitously expressed in various cell types, with predominant expression in epithelial cells, particularly in the intestinal tract, where it contributes to gut homeostasis and the physiological development of the gastrointestinal system (Bourhis2007Nod1; KaparakisLiaskos2015The). It also plays a role in autophagy, a process crucial for the removal of intracellular pathogens, by interacting with autophagy-related proteins (Correa2012Roles). Through these mechanisms, NOD1 maintains immune surveillance and modulates immune responses, ensuring cellular homeostasis and protection against infections (Mukherjee2019NOD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NOD1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Genetic polymorphisms in NOD1 have been linked to increased susceptibility to bronchial asthma and elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, which are indicative of allergic responses (Hysi2005NOD1; Godkowicz2022NOD1). Specifically, the ND1+32,656 insertion-deletion polymorphism is associated with high IgE levels and asthma (Hysi2005NOD1).

NOD1 is also implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with certain polymorphisms correlating with early-onset forms of the disease (Godkowicz2022NOD1). While some studies suggest a link between NOD1 variants and IBD susceptibility, others do not support this association, indicating a complex role in disease pathogenesis (FernándezGarcía2021NOD1).

Altered NOD1 expression is associated with metabolic dysfunctions, including insulin resistance and obesity, particularly under high-fat diet conditions (FernándezGarcía2021NOD1). NOD1 activation is linked to increased intestinal permeability and systemic inflammation, contributing to type 2 diabetes risk (Trindade2020NOD1).

In cardiovascular diseases, NOD1 activation accelerates atherogenesis and induces vascular inflammation, suggesting its involvement in atherothrombosis (FernándezGarcía2021NOD1). NOD1's role in these conditions highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for managing inflammation-related diseases.

## Interactions
NOD1 interacts with several proteins to mediate immune responses. It recruits receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) through a homotypic CARD-CARD interaction, which is crucial for downstream signaling pathways such as NF-κB activation (Strober2005Signalling; Mukherjee2019NOD1). This interaction leads to the polyubiquitination of RIPK2, facilitating the recruitment of other signaling mediators like TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC) (Mukherjee2019NOD1).

NOD1 also interacts with Rho GTPases, such as Rac1 and CDC42, which are activated by bacterial effector proteins like Salmonella SopE. This interaction is important for the activation of NF-κB and other signaling pathways (Trindade2020NOD1). Additionally, NOD1 can bind to the ryanodine receptor (RyR), influencing calcium signaling in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (KussDuerkop2020NOD1).

NOD1's interactions extend to the actin cytoskeleton, where it is involved in membrane localization and immune signaling. This localization is actin-dependent and involves lipid modifications such as S-palmitoylation (KussDuerkop2020NOD1). These interactions highlight NOD1's role in sensing microbial motifs and modulating immune responses.
