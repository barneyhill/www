# JPH2

## Overview
JPH2 is a gene that encodes the protein junctophilin 2, which is integral to the function of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. Junctophilin 2 is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of junctional membrane complexes, which are essential for efficient calcium signaling and muscle contraction. The protein is characterized by its N-terminal MORN motifs, which facilitate its localization to the plasma membrane, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain that anchors it within intracellular membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum and sarcoplasmic reticulum (Landstrom2014The; Piggott2021Junctophilins:). Junctophilin 2 is crucial for the structural integrity of dyads in cardiac muscle, enabling excitation-contraction coupling through interactions with ion channels like L-type Ca2+ channels and ryanodine receptors (Perni2022The; Parker2023One). Mutations in the JPH2 gene have been associated with various cardiac pathologies, including hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies, underscoring its clinical significance (Landstrom2014The; Parker2023One).

## Structure
Junctophilin 2 (JPH2) is a protein encoded by the JPH2 gene, playing a crucial role in cardiac muscle function. The protein consists of 696 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 74 kDa in humans (Landstrom2014The). JPH2 contains eight N-terminal MORN motifs, which are essential for targeting the protein to the plasma membrane and binding directly to phospholipids (Piggott2021Junctophilins:). These motifs are separated by a joining region and linked to a carboxy-terminal membrane-spanning domain that embeds the protein into intracellular membranes like the ER or SR (Landstrom2014The).

The structure of JPH2 includes a predicted α-helical domain that acts as a flexible linker, allowing the protein to span junctional membrane complexes (Piggott2021Junctophilins:). This α-helical domain may provide mechanical elasticity (Landstrom2014The). The C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain anchors JPH2 in the ER/SR membrane, facilitating its role in tethering ER and PM membranes (Piggott2021Junctophilins:). JPH2 is involved in forming and stabilizing triad junctions and T-tubules in muscle cells, crucial for excitation-contraction coupling (Piggott2021Junctophilins:). The protein's interaction with ion channels is vital for its function in muscle tissues (Piggott2021Junctophilins:).

## Function
Junctophilin 2 (JPH2) is a critical protein in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, where it plays a vital role in the formation and maintenance of junctional membrane complexes. These complexes are essential for the close apposition of the plasma membrane and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), facilitating efficient calcium signaling necessary for muscle contraction (Perni2022The; Landstrom2007Mutations). In cardiac muscle, JPH2 is the sole junctophilin isoform and is crucial for the structural integrity of dyads, which are specialized junctions that enable excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. This process involves the translation of electrical signals into muscle contractions through calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) (Perni2022The; Parker2023One).

JPH2 interacts with L-type Ca2+ channels and ryanodine receptors, ensuring proper calcium handling and myocyte contraction. It is involved in recruiting these channels to dyads and peripheral couplings, which is essential for the assembly of the triad in skeletal muscle and the dyad in cardiac muscle (Perni2022The; Landstrom2007Mutations). The absence or malfunction of JPH2 can lead to disruptions in calcium signaling, resulting in pathological conditions such as cardiomyopathies (Perni2022The; Landstrom2007Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the JPH2 gene are linked to several cardiac diseases, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Reduced expression of JPH2 is associated with disruptions in calcium signaling and cardiac dyad structure, contributing to these conditions (Landstrom2014The). Specific mutations such as S101R, Y141H, and S165F have been identified in individuals with HCM, affecting calcium-induced calcium release and cellular structure (Landstrom2007Mutations). Autosomal recessive variants in JPH2 are linked to early-onset DCM with severe symptoms, while autosomal dominant variants are associated with HCM and arrhythmias (Parker2023One).

The JPH2-p.E641* variant, a novel homozygous mutation, is associated with neonatal DCM and is prevalent in certain ethnic groups, such as those from the Greater Middle East (Jones2019Analysis). This variant results in a loss of function, impairing calcium handling and leading to heart failure (Jones2019Analysis). The clinical significance of JPH2 mutations extends to skeletal muscle myopathy, although the relevance in skeletal muscle remains unclear (Landstrom2014The).

## Interactions
Junctophilin 2 (JPH2) is known to physically interact with several key proteins involved in cardiac muscle function. It directly binds to the type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2), a critical component in calcium signaling for muscle contraction. This interaction is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of junctional membrane complexes (JMCs) and regulating RyR2 activity, preventing diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak (Luo2020Junctophilin2; van2011Disrupted). JPH2's C-terminal domain is particularly important for its binding to RyR2, facilitating peripheral coupling in cardiomyocytes (Luo2020Junctophilin2).

JPH2 also interacts with L-type calcium channels, specifically the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel CaV1.2, suggesting a role in recruiting this channel to dyads and peripheral couplings in cardiac muscle (Perni2022The). This interaction involves a conserved C-terminal sequence in CaV1.2, similar to the interaction site in CaV1.1 (Perni2022The).

In smooth muscle, JPH2 is involved in coupling ryanodine receptors with large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BK channels), which is crucial for generating calcium sparks and maintaining muscle tone (Piggott2021Junctophilins:). These interactions highlight JPH2's role in both structural support and functional regulation of calcium signaling in muscle cells.
