# CHD1

## Overview
The CHD1 gene encodes the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1, a member of the chromatin remodeler family that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. This protein is characterized by its chromodomains, helicase/ATPase domain, and DNA-binding domain, which collectively facilitate its function in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation (Flanagan2007Molecular; Stokes1995DNABinding). CHD1 is involved in maintaining open chromatin states, crucial for high transcriptional activity, particularly in rapidly dividing cells such as embryonic stem cells (Pilarowski2017Missense). It interacts with various components of the transcriptional machinery and is implicated in several biological processes, including neurodevelopment and cancer pathogenesis (Simic2003Chromatin; Li2023CHD1). Mutations in CHD1 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Pilarowski2017Missense; Li2023CHD1).

## Structure
The CHD1 protein is characterized by its unique structure, which includes chromodomains, a helicase/ATPase domain, and a DNA-binding domain. The primary structure of CHD1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming these domains. The chromodomains are located near the N-terminus and are involved in chromatin compaction and gene expression repression (Flanagan2007Molecular; Stokes1995DNABinding). The helicase/ATPase domain is part of a large superfamily involved in DNA replication, recombination, repair, and transcription (Stokes1995DNABinding). This domain is closely related to yeast proteins SWI2/SNF2 and STH1/NPS1, and human proteins such as hSNF2L and BRG1 (Stokes1995DNABinding).

The DNA-binding domain is located in the C-terminal portion and contains motifs similar to those in histone H1 and HMG-I/Y, which are involved in chromatin organization and gene regulation (Stokes1995DNABinding). CHD1 binds preferentially to A+T-rich DNA via minor-groove interactions (Stokes1995DNABinding). The protein undergoes significant conformational changes upon binding to nucleosomes, which is thought to contribute to its auto-inhibited state (Sundaramoorthy2016Structural). The SANT and SLIDE domains within the C-terminal DNA-binding domain are essential for efficient nucleosome repositioning (Sundaramoorthy2016Structural). The CHD1 protein is predominantly monomeric in solution, as indicated by small angle X-ray scattering data (Sundaramoorthy2016Structural).

## Function
The CHD1 gene encodes an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler that plays a critical role in regulating chromatin structure and facilitating gene expression. In healthy human cells, CHD1 is involved in maintaining open chromatin states, which is essential for high transcriptional output, particularly during rapid growth phases such as in embryonic stem cells (Pilarowski2017Missense). CHD1 contributes to the pluripotency of these cells by incorporating histone variants like H3.3 and assisting in nucleosome assembly (Pilarowski2017Missense).

CHD1 is expressed in various tissues, with the highest levels in the cerebellum and basal ganglia of the brain, indicating its importance in neurodevelopment (Pilarowski2017Missense). The protein contains chromodomains that bind to methylated histones, such as H3K4me3 and H3K4me2, which are crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling (Pilarowski2017Missense). CHD1 interacts with transcriptional machinery components, including FACT, SPT4-5, and the Mediator complex, to regulate transcription elongation and ensure proper gene expression (Pilarowski2017Missense). Its activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it influences chromatin organization and gene regulation (Woodage1997Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CHD1 gene are associated with several human diseases, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers. In neurodevelopmental disorders, de novo heterozygous missense variants of CHD1 have been linked to Pilarowski-Bjornsson syndrome, which is characterized by delayed development, intellectual disability, and autistic features. These mutations often involve the loss of arginine residues, suggesting a dominant negative mechanism of disease (Pilarowski2017Missense; Li2023CHD1).

In cancer, CHD1 mutations and deletions are prevalent in several types, including prostate, uterine, melanoma, and colorectal cancers. In prostate cancer, CHD1 deletion is significant, particularly in East Asian and African American men, and often co-occurs with mutations in the SPOP gene, defining a new molecular subtype of prostate cancer. CHD1 deletions are mutually exclusive with PTEN loss or TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in prostate tumors (Li2023CHD1). CHD1 loss in prostate cancer is associated with increased resistance to androgen receptor inhibitors and a shorter clinical response to these therapies in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients (Li2023CHD1). CHD1 is also involved in DNA damage repair, and its loss causes defects in homologous recombination, increasing sensitivity to DNA-damaging therapies (Li2023CHD1).

## Interactions
CHD1 interacts with nucleosomes primarily through DNA contacts, specifically at the SHL-2 location, with limited interactions with histones H3 and H4 (Sundaramoorthy2018Structure). It is part of a multiprotein complex with SSRP1, as demonstrated by copurification and colocalization studies in HeLa and U2OS cells (Kelley1999CHD1). CHD1 also interacts with transcription elongation factors, including Rtf1 from the Paf1 complex, and Spt5 and Pob3 from the Spt4-Spt5 and Spt16-Pob3 complexes, respectively (Simic2003Chromatin). These interactions suggest a role in transcription elongation, as CHD1 localizes to chromatin being transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Simic2003Chromatin).

CHD1 is involved in chromatin remodeling and is a component of the SAGA and SLIK complexes, which are associated with histone acetylation and transcription regulation. It interacts with methylated lysine 4 on histone H3, a mark linked to transcriptional activity, through its chromodomains (PrayGrant2005Chd1). These interactions highlight CHD1's role in maintaining chromatin in a transcriptionally active state and its involvement in nucleosome repositioning and transcription regulation.
