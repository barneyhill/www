# ERVW-1

## Overview
ERVW-1 is a human gene that encodes the protein syncytin-1, a member of the endogenous retrovirus group W. Syncytin-1 is a retroviral envelope protein that has been co-opted by the human genome to perform essential functions in placental development. It is primarily expressed in the placenta, where it facilitates the fusion of cytotrophoblast cells to form the syncytiotrophoblast layer, a critical structure for maternal-fetal nutrient exchange and implantation (Dolei2019Expression; Mi2000Syncytin). The protein is characterized by its fusogenic properties, which are mediated through interactions with the ASCT2 receptor, and it plays a role in immune modulation and cell cycle regulation (Priščáková2023Syncytin1; Lokossou2014Implication). Beyond its physiological roles, syncytin-1 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Wang2018Human; Stricker2023HERVs).

## Structure
The ERVW-1 gene encodes the Syncytin-1 protein, which is derived from an endogenous retrovirus and plays a crucial role in placental development by mediating cell fusion. Syncytin-1 is synthesized as a polyprotein and undergoes cleavage into two functional subunits: the surface unit (SU) and the transmembrane (TM) subunit. The SU is responsible for receptor recognition, while the TM subunit anchors the protein to the membrane and facilitates membrane fusion (Lokossou2014Implication).

Syncytin-1 retains the general structure of retroviral glycoproteins and requires trimer formation for proper fusion activity. The protein includes a fusion peptide, an immunosuppressive domain, and a transmembrane domain within the TM subunit. The presence of an immunosuppressive domain suggests a role in fetomaternal tolerance during pregnancy (Lokossou2014Implication). Syncytin-1 is also involved in the formation and function of extracellular microvesicles, such as exosomes, which are important for intercellular communication and modulation of gene expression (Lokossou2014Implication).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including cleavage by the cellular furin protease, which is essential for its functional activity (Lokossou2014Implication). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of Syncytin-1 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ERVW-1 gene encodes the protein syncytin-1, which plays a critical role in human placental development. Syncytin-1 is a retroviral envelope protein that has been integrated into the human genome and is primarily active in the placenta. It is involved in the fusion of cytotrophoblast cells to form the syncytiotrophoblast layer, a multinucleated structure essential for maternal-fetal nutrient exchange and implantation of the embryo (Dolei2019Expression; Mi2000Syncytin). This cell fusion process is crucial for the formation of the placenta, facilitating the exchange of nutrients and gases between the mother and the developing fetus (Mi2000Syncytin).

Syncytin-1 is expressed robustly in placental syncytiotrophoblasts and weakly in the testis, with no significant expression detected in other human tissues (Mi2000Syncytin). The protein comprises two functional domains: the cell surface domain (SU) and the transmembrane domain (TM), which are responsible for binding with host cell receptors and promoting cell-cell fusion, respectively (Wang2018Human). This fusogenic activity is essential for the development of the placenta and the establishment of maternal-fetal tolerance during pregnancy (Mi2000Syncytin).

## Clinical Significance
The ERVW-1 gene, encoding the protein syncytin-1, is implicated in several neuropsychological and oncological conditions due to its role in inflammatory processes and cell fusion. In neuropsychological diseases, syncytin-1 is associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) and schizophrenia. Elevated levels of syncytin-1 have been observed in the glial cells of MS patients, contributing to neuroinflammation and demyelination, which are characteristic of the disease (Wang2018Human). In schizophrenia, increased expression of syncytin-1 has been noted, suggesting its involvement in the disease's development through inflammatory pathways (Wang2018Human).

In cancer, ERVW-1 is linked to various malignancies. In hepatocellular carcinoma, its expression promotes cell proliferation and metastasis via the MEK/ERK pathway (Stricker2023HERVs). In urothelial carcinoma, mutations in the HERV-W LTR increase ERVW-1 expression, correlating with aggressive cancer forms (Stricker2023HERVs). Syncytin-1 is also implicated in choriocarcinoma and endometrial cancer, where its expression may drive cell fusion and hyperproliferation (Stricker2023HERVs). These findings highlight the gene's potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in both neuropsychological and oncological diseases.

## Interactions
The ERVW-1 gene encodes the syncytin-1 protein, which is involved in several physical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. Syncytin-1 interacts with the ASCT2 receptor, a sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter, to mediate cell fusion processes essential for placental development (Priščáková2023Syncytin1; Lokossou2014Implication). This interaction is crucial for the fusion of trophoblast cells into the syncytiotrophoblast layer, contributing to placental structure and function (Lokossou2014Implication).

Syncytin-1 is also involved in immune modulation. It is present on the surface of placental exosomes, which can interact with immune cells, potentially altering their function and activation state (Lokossou2014Implication). This interaction may contribute to immunosuppression, affecting T-cells, NK cells, and CD8+ T-cells, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully understood (Lokossou2014Implication).

Additionally, syncytin-1 is implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle and cell proliferation, particularly in the G1/S transition, where its overexpression promotes these processes (Priščáková2023Syncytin1). The protein's interactions with various cellular pathways suggest its involvement in broader physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer and multiple sclerosis (Priščáková2023Syncytin1).
