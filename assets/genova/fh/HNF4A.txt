# HNF4A

## Overview
HNF4A, or hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha, is a gene that encodes a nuclear receptor transcription factor critical for regulating gene expression in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and pancreas. The protein product of HNF4A, also known as hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha, is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and functions primarily as a transcriptional activator. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular differentiation and identity, particularly in hepatocytes, enterocytes, and renal proximal tubular cells. HNF4A is involved in the regulation of genes associated with metabolic processes such as lipid, amino acid, and glucose metabolism, as well as the expression of apolipoproteins and blood coagulation factors. The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with various transcriptional cofactors, which influence its stability, localization, and DNA binding capabilities (Dubois2020Control; Hayhurst2001Hepatocyte).

## Structure
The HNF4A protein is a nuclear receptor with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It features a DNA-binding domain (DBD) with two zinc finger motifs, crucial for recognizing and binding specific DNA sequences (Rastinejad2023The; Lu2008Crystallization). The ligand-binding domain (LBD) is composed of approximately twelve helices and several short beta strands, which facilitate the binding of fatty acids, contributing to the protein's structural stability (Rastinejad2023The).

HNF4A functions as a homodimer, with its dimerization ability encoded in the LBD. The DBD can also form a DNA-dependent dimerization interface, allowing the protein to bind to direct-repeat DNA elements (Rastinejad2023The). The quaternary structure of HNF4A has been elucidated through X-ray crystallography, revealing an asymmetrical homodimeric complex on DNA (Rastinejad2023The).

Post-translational modifications, such as methylation and phosphorylation, play significant roles in regulating HNF4A's activity. For instance, Arg-91 methylation enhances DNA binding, while Ser-78 phosphorylation weakens it (Rastinejad2023The). The protein also exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing and promoter usage, which contribute to its functional diversity (Guo2018Novel; Harries2008The).

## Function
HNF4A (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha) is a nuclear receptor transcription factor that plays a critical role in regulating gene expression in the liver, kidney, and pancreas. It is essential for maintaining cellular differentiation and identity, particularly in hepatocytes, enterocytes, and renal proximal tubular cells (Dubois2020Control). HNF4A functions primarily as a transcriptional activator, promoting the expression of genes involved in metabolic processes such as lipid, amino acid, and glucose metabolism, as well as apolipoproteins and blood coagulation factors (Rastinejad2023The; Hayhurst2001Hepatocyte).

In the liver, HNF4A is a core transcription factor in superenhancer-associated networks, regulating genes responsible for cholesterol, drug, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism, as well as gluconeogenesis and glycolysis (Rastinejad2023The). It is crucial for lipid homeostasis, influencing the expression of genes necessary for very-low-density lipoprotein secretion and bile acid transport (Hayhurst2001Hepatocyte). HNF4A also plays a significant role in pancreatic beta cells, where it regulates genes critical for insulin secretion and beta cell function, impacting glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity (Ng2024HNF4A).

HNF4A's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with transcriptional cofactors, affecting its stability, localization, and DNA binding (Dubois2020Control). It is expressed in multiple isoforms with varying transcriptional regulatory potentials, generated by alternative splicing and the use of two promoters, P1 and P2 (Dubois2020Control). These isoforms can act as activators or repressors depending on the cellular context, highlighting HNF4A's complex regulatory functions in maintaining cell identity and function (Dubois2020Control).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HNF4A gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY1), a form of diabetes characterized by early onset and autosomal-dominant inheritance. These mutations can lead to a diabetic phenotype moderated by the expression of HNF4A isoforms during fetal development. The age of diabetes onset varies depending on the specific mutation, with some mutations leading to an earlier onset than others (Harries2008The).

HNF4A mutations are also linked to increased birth weight and macrosomia, a condition where infants are born significantly larger than average. This is due to increased insulin secretion in utero, which later transitions to decreased insulin secretion and diabetes in life (Pearson2007Macrosomia). Additionally, these mutations can cause hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia in neonates, characterized by excessive insulin levels leading to low blood sugar (Pearson2007Macrosomia).

Some HNF4A mutations are associated with extra-pancreatic features, such as liver disease and renal Fanconi syndrome, which can manifest as hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, and renal dysfunction (Tung2018Clinical; Clemente2017Hyperinsulinaemic). The p.(Arg85Trp) variant of HNF4A is linked to glycogen storage disease, liver cirrhosis, and impaired mitochondrial function (Grassi2023Expanding).

## Interactions
HNF4A interacts with various proteins and plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. It interacts with the CREB-binding protein (CBP), which is essential for transcriptional activation. This interaction involves the AF-1 and AF-2 domains of HNF4A, with the AF-2 domain being critical for CBP-mediated transcriptional enhancement (Dell1999CREBbinding). HNF4A also interacts with Smad3 and Smad4 proteins, which are important for the transactivation of the apoC-III promoter. The interaction is mediated through the MH1 domain of Smads and specific regions of HNF4A, including the C-terminal domain F and the 1-128 region (Chou2003Mechanism).

HNF4A forms a complex with the TAF4-TAF12 heterodimer via its ligand-binding domain, which is crucial for its function in hepatocytes (Alpern2014TAF4). It also interacts with the transcription factor TFIIB, which stabilizes HNF4A DNA binding activity and is recruited to the HNF4A-DNA complex (Malik1996TFIIBDirected). Additionally, HNF4A interacts with the pancreatic islet transcription factor Isl1, enhancing transcriptional synergy on certain promoters (Eeckhoute2006Hepatocyte). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of HNF4A in regulating gene expression through various protein partnerships.
