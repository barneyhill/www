# TTI2

## Overview
The TTI2 gene encodes the TELO2-interacting protein 2, a critical component of the TELO2-TTI1-TTI2 (TTT) complex, which is integral to the stabilization and function of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs). These kinases are pivotal in cellular processes such as the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation. The TTI2 protein, characterized by its α-solenoid structure formed by HEAT repeats, interacts with other proteins within the TTT complex to maintain the structural integrity and functional capacity of PIKKs (Bhadra2023TTT; Pal2020Structure). Through its interactions with molecular chaperones and the R2TP complex, TTI2 plays a significant role in modulating the stability and activity of PIKKs, thereby contributing to genomic stability and cellular homeostasis (Wang2019Novel; Hurov2010A). Mutations in TTI2 have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its importance in normal brain development and function (Wang2019Novel; PicherMartel2020Wholeexome).

## Structure
The TTI2 protein is a component of the TELO2-TTI1-TTI2 (TTT) complex, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs). The TTT complex is characterized by α-solenoid structures formed by HEAT repeats, with TTI2 predicted to form a majority of these repeats (Bhadra2023TTT; Pal2020Structure). The TTI2 protein interacts with TTI1, binding at its N-terminus to the C-terminus of TTI1, which is essential for the structural integrity of the TTT complex (Pal2020Structure). 

The TTT complex, including TTI2, interacts with the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ring within the R2TP complex, affecting its ATPase activity. This interaction is mediated by the DII domains of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, with TTI2 playing a role in modulating these interactions (Bhadra2023TTT; Pal2020Structure). 

While specific details about the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of TTI2 are not provided, its role within the TTT complex and its interactions with other proteins are crucial for its function. The TTT complex's structure is predominantly composed of α-solenoids, which are not easily targeted by small molecule inhibitors (Bhadra2023TTT).

## Function
The TTI2 gene encodes the TELO2-interacting protein 2, a crucial component of the Triple T complex, which also includes TTI1 and TELO2. This complex is evolutionarily conserved and plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the DNA damage response (DDR) and the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs) such as ATM and ATR (Wang2019Novel; Hurov2010A). The Triple T complex interacts with molecular chaperones like Hsp90 and the R2TP complex to form a supercomplex that regulates the abundance and stability of PIKKs, which are essential for maintaining genomic stability and responding to DNA damage (Wang2019Novel; Ziegler2019Confirmation).

TTI2 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating its involvement in multiple cellular pathways, including nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and telomerase assembly (Wang2019Novel). The protein's role in stabilizing PIKKs is critical for the establishment of intra-S and G2/M checkpoints, protecting cells from spontaneous DNA damage (Hurov2010A). Mutations in TTI2 can lead to syndromic intellectual disability, highlighting its importance in normal brain development and cellular homeostasis (Wang2019Novel; PicherMartel2020Wholeexome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TTI2 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily syndromic intellectual disability (ID) and primary microcephaly. In a Chinese family, compound heterozygous mutations in TTI2 were linked to syndromic ID, characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disability, and physical abnormalities. These mutations resulted in decreased levels of TTI2, TTI1, and TELO2 proteins, suggesting a loss-of-function effect (Wang2019Novel). Similarly, a homozygous mutation in TTI2 was identified in a French Canadian child with primary microcephaly, highlighting the gene's role in brain development (PicherMartel2020Wholeexome).

TTI2 mutations also contribute to autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ARID), with affected individuals exhibiting severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, scoliosis, and sleep disorders (Ziegler2019Confirmation). In rats, Tti2 has been identified as a pleiotropic quantitative trait gene affecting both neurogenesis and glucose metabolism, suggesting its broader impact on metabolic and neurological processes (Senko2022Systems). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TTI2 mutations and alterations in its expression, which can disrupt protein interactions and stability, contributing to disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
TTI2, as part of the TTT complex with TELO2 and TTI1, engages in several critical protein interactions. This complex is essential for the stability and function of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs), including ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs, SMG1, and mTOR, which are pivotal in DNA damage response and other cellular processes (Senko2022Systems; Hurov2010A). TTI2 interacts directly with TTI1 and TELO2, forming a stable complex that is crucial for maintaining the abundance and stability of these kinases (Wang2019Novel; Hurov2010A).

The TTT complex also interacts with molecular chaperones such as Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hsp40, as well as the R2TP/prefoldin-like complex, which includes RUVBL1 and RUVBL2. These interactions modulate the ATPase activity of the R2TP components and facilitate the recruitment of PIKK proteins to the R2TP chaperone complex (Pal2020Structure; Senko2022Systems). TTI2, through the TTT complex, binds to the DII domains of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, affecting their ATPase activity and contributing to the stability and function of the R2TP-TTT complex (Pal2020Structure). These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of the DNA damage response and other PIKK-regulated pathways (Hurov2010A).
