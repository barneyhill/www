# CCNG1

## Overview
Cyclin G1 (CCNG1) is a gene that encodes the cyclin G1 protein, a member of the cyclin family known for its role in regulating the cell cycle and DNA damage response. Cyclin G1 is primarily involved in modulating the activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53, forming part of a feedback loop that influences p53 stability and function. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its interactions with various cell cycle-related proteins, including Mdm2 and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis (AlShihabi2018Exploiting; Ohno2016Comprehensive). Cyclin G1 is minimally expressed in normal cells but can be upregulated in response to cellular stress, highlighting its role in stress response pathways (Taguchi2022Cyclin). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions have significant implications in cancer biology, where alterations in CCNG1 expression are associated with various cancer types and treatment responses (Quandt2020Atypical; Seo2005Cyclin).

## Function
Cyclin G1 (CCNG1) is a member of the cyclin family that plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response. It is a transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor p53 and is involved in the DNA damage response by recruiting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to its targets through interaction with the PP2A_B'γ subunit (Ohno2016Comprehensive). Cyclin G1 regulates the stability of the p53 protein by dephosphorylating MDM2, the ubiquitin ligase for p53, forming a negative feedback loop that modulates p53 activity (Ohno2016Comprehensive). This interaction suggests that Cyclin G1's primary role is to mediate or regulate p53 function in the nucleolus.

Cyclin G1 is also involved in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. It cannot independently induce apoptosis but can make cells more susceptible to apoptosis when triggered by other signals, such as serum starvation (Setiwalidi2022Differential). In healthy cells, Cyclin G1 is minimally expressed but can be upregulated in response to stress conditions, indicating its role in cellular stress responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Taguchi2022Cyclin). Cyclin G1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences cellular proliferation and stability.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCNG1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. High expression of CCNG1 is associated with decreased overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma and is linked to a worse prognosis due to its role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3b/Snail-dependent pathway (Quandt2020Atypical). In ovarian cancer, CCNG1 upregulation is associated with poor prognosis in patients treated with taxanes and platinum compounds (Quandt2020Atypical). Conversely, in human endometrial carcinoma cells, CCNG1 overexpression suppresses cell proliferation, suggesting a complex role in different cancer types (Quandt2020Atypical).

In lung cancer, CCNG1 overexpression increases sensitivity to radiation by regulating cyclin B1 levels, enhancing cell death and DNA damage susceptibility (Seo2005Cyclin). This suggests that CCNG1 could be a target for enhancing the effectiveness of radiotherapy (Seo2005Cyclin).

In diabetic nephropathy, CCNG1 expression is upregulated under high glucose conditions, correlating with increased apoptosis and decreased cell viability. Silencing CCNG1 in kidney cells can protect against high glucose-induced damage, indicating its potential role in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy (Chen2020Silencing).

## Interactions
Cyclin G1 (CCNG1) is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins that influence cell cycle regulation and cancer biology. CCNG1 forms a complex with the Mdm2 oncoprotein, which in turn interacts with the tumor suppressor p53. This interaction inhibits p53 function and promotes its degradation, forming part of the Cyclin G1/Mdm2/p53 axis (AlShihabi2018Exploiting). CCNG1 also binds to the serine/threonine protein phosphatase subunit 2A (PP2A), which targets Mdm2 for dephosphorylation, further regulating p53 activity (Quandt2019Atypical; Ohno2016Comprehensive).

In addition to its interactions with Mdm2 and p53, CCNG1 activates CDK2 and CDK5, which target and activate the c-Myc oncoprotein, a key player in cell cycle progression and proliferation (AlShihabi2018Exploiting). CCNG1 also co-localizes with the replication-associated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at DNA replication foci, interacting with the CDKN1A/p21 Waf1/CIP1 tumor suppressor to regulate genomic stability and cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage (M.2021CCNG1). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of CCNG1 in modulating cell cycle dynamics and its potential as a target for cancer therapy.
