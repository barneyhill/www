# IGSF9

## Overview
IGSF9 is a gene that encodes the protein immunoglobulin superfamily member 9, which is a part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is characterized by its involvement in cell adhesion and signaling, particularly within the nervous system. The IGSF9 protein features an extracellular region with multiple immunoglobulin-like domains and fibronectin type III domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail, which collectively facilitate its role in cellular interactions and signal transduction (Doudney2002Cloning). It is implicated in synaptic organization and plasticity, influencing learning and memory functions, and is expressed in various tissues during embryonic development (Doudney2002Cloning). The gene's expression and structural attributes suggest its critical involvement in neural development and cellular signaling pathways. Additionally, alterations in IGSF9 expression have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Shi2018RNAseq; Huang2020Identified).

## Structure
The IGSF9 protein is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is characterized by its complex domain structure. It contains an extracellular region with five immunoglobulin-like domains and two fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains, which are indicative of its role in cell adhesion and signaling (Doudney2002Cloning). The protein also features a predicted N-terminal signal peptide, suggesting membrane localization, and a single transmembrane domain, which anchors it to the cell membrane (Doudney2002Cloning). The cytoplasmic region of IGSF9 includes several putative phosphorylation sites, which may be involved in signal transduction (Doudney2002Cloning).

IGSF9 shares structural similarities with the Drosophila protein Turtle, particularly in the extracellular domain, although the intracellular domain shows limited similarity (Doudney2002Cloning). The protein also contains an RGD cell attachment sequence within the fifth Ig domain, which is recognized by integrin heterodimers and is important for cell attachment (Doudney2002Cloning). The IGSF9 gene is highly conserved between mouse and human, with the human ortholog located at 1q22-q23 (Doudney2002Cloning). The protein's structure places it in the NCAM subfamily of immunoglobulin proteins, although it has only 26% identity to NCAM, indicating differences at the primary sequence level (Doudney2002Cloning).

## Function
The IGSF9 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, specifically related to the neural cell-adhesion molecule (NCAM) subfamily. The IGSF9 protein is involved in cell adhesion and signaling processes, playing a crucial role in the developing nervous system. It is expressed in various tissues during embryonic development, including the dorsal root ganglia, trigeminal ganglia, and olfactory epithelium, with less intense expression in the neuroepithelium, retina, and hindgut (Doudney2002Cloning).

Structurally, the IGSF9 protein includes an extracellular region with five immunoglobulin domains and two fibronectin type III repeats, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. This configuration suggests its involvement in cell adhesion and signal transduction across the cell membrane (Doudney2002Cloning). The protein contains an RGD cell attachment sequence, which is recognized by integrin heterodimers, indicating a role in cellular interactions similar to other IgCAMs (Doudney2002Cloning).

IGSF9 is also implicated in synaptic organization and plasticity, influencing learning and memory functions, although specific details about its function in healthy human cells are not extensively detailed in the provided context. The protein's expression pattern and structural features suggest its involvement in neural development and cellular signaling (Doudney2002Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IGSF9 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In endometrial cancer, IGSF9 is significantly overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, with a six-fold increase in expression. This overexpression is associated with poor survival outcomes and is particularly noted in cases with myometrial invasion, suggesting its potential role as a marker of cancer aggressiveness (Shi2018RNAseq). IGSF9 is also overexpressed in several other cancer types, including thymoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, and brain lower grade glioma, where it is linked to poor prognosis (Shi2018RNAseq).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), IGSF9 has been identified as a prognostic hub gene. Its expression correlates with hypoxia-related tumor behavior, and down-regulation of IGSF9 has been shown to reduce NPC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This suggests that IGSF9 could serve as a novel prognostic indicator for NPC, particularly in relation to hypoxia (Huang2020Identified).

In colorectal cancer, IGSF9 is part of a multi-gene model associated with survival prognosis, indicating its potential clinical significance in predicting patient outcomes (Lu2022Multigene).

## Interactions
IGSF9, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is involved in various protein interactions that influence synaptic organization and neuronal communication. It contains an RGD cell attachment sequence, a motif recognized by integrin heterodimers, which is important for cell attachment and mediates protein interactions (Doudney2002Cloning). IGSF9 interacts with membrane-associated guanylate kinase-2 (MAGI2), affecting the colocalization of neuroligin 2 (NLGN2) and IGSF9b at synapses, which is proposed to induce inhibitory synapse formation (Cameron2018ImmunoglobulinLike).

IGSF9b, a related protein, forms a complex with neuroligin 2 via the adaptor protein S-SCAM, facilitating the development and stabilization of inhibitory synapses. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization and function of these proteins at synapses (Woo2013The). IGSF9b also interacts with S-SCAM and neuroligin 2 to promote inhibitory synapse development, forming a ternary complex that involves specific protein-protein interactions (Woo2013The). The PDZ4-5 domains of S-SCAM are sufficient for IGSF9b binding, while the WW-PDZ1 domain interacts with neuroligin 2 (Woo2013The). These interactions highlight the role of IGSF9 and IGSF9b in synaptic adhesion and transmission, particularly at inhibitory synapses.
