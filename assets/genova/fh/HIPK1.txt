# HIPK1

## Overview
HIPK1 (homeodomain interacting protein kinase 1) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in a variety of cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and stress response. The protein product of HIPK1, also referred to as homeodomain interacting protein kinase 1, is characterized by its kinase domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity and interaction with other proteins. This kinase is known to modulate the activity of several transcription factors, such as c-Myb and p53, thereby influencing processes like hematopoiesis and genomic stability (Matre2009HIPK1; Kondo2003Characterization). HIPK1 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, participating in signaling pathways that are crucial for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Matre2009HIPK1). Alterations in HIPK1 expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2019miR‑770‑5p; Isono2006Overlapping).

## Structure
HIPK1 (homeodomain interacting protein kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes. The primary structure of HIPK1 includes a kinase domain that is essential for its enzymatic activity, sharing about 90% identical amino acids in the kinase domains with HIPK2 and HIPK3 (van2015Effect). The secondary structure likely consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of kinases, although specific details are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a functional kinase domain, which includes a conserved sumoylation site, a homeobox interaction domain, an autoinhibitory domain, and a PEST region (van2015Effect). HIPK1 also contains a C-terminal tyrosine/histidine-rich domain, which may contribute to its ability to phosphorylate tyrosines in exogenous substrates (van2015Effect).

HIPK1 may form complexes, indicating a quaternary structure, although specific details are not provided. Post-translational modifications such as tyrosine autophosphorylation are crucial for its catalytic activity and subcellular localization (van2015Effect). HIPK1 can undergo autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues, which is essential for its full catalytic activity (van2015Effect). The context does not provide specific information on splice variant isoforms of HIPK1.

## Function
HIPK1 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and stress response. In healthy human cells, HIPK1 plays a significant role in modulating the activity of transcription factors and signaling pathways. It interacts with the transcription factor c-Myb, phosphorylating it in its negative regulatory domain, which represses c-Myb's ability to activate certain target genes in hematopoietic cells, thereby influencing hematopoiesis (Matre2009HIPK1).

HIPK1 is also involved in the regulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. It can form a stable intracellular complex with p53, influencing its transcriptional activity and modulating the expression of p53 target genes such as Mdm2. This interaction is crucial for regulating apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage, thereby maintaining genomic stability and normal organ development (Kondo2003Characterization).

HIPK1 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it participates in various signaling pathways, including the ASK1-MEK-JNK pathway, which is involved in stress response and apoptosis (Matre2009HIPK1). Its activity in these pathways underscores its role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, impacting organismal development and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the HIPK1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer, miR-770-5p has been shown to modulate resistance to methotrexate (MTX) by downregulating HIPK1 expression. This downregulation decreases the sensitivity of colorectal adenocarcinoma cells to MTX, suggesting that HIPK1 plays a role in drug resistance mechanisms in cancer treatment (Zhang2019miR‑770‑5p).

HIPK1 is also associated with developmental abnormalities. Mutations in HIPK1, along with HIPK2, can lead to neural tube defects (NTDs) and other developmental issues in mice, such as exencephaly and impaired neural tube closure. These defects are linked to the gene's role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis during embryogenesis (Isono2006Overlapping).

Additionally, rare genetic variants in HIPK1 have been identified in patients with nonsyndromic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), a congenital heart defect. These findings suggest a potential role for HIPK1 in the genetic etiology of PDA (Gao2022Rare).

## Interactions
HIPK1 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. HIPK1 interacts with the protein Daxx, a transcriptional regulator, leading to the relocalization of Daxx from promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PODs) to chromatin. This interaction enhances Daxx's association with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), facilitating its function as a transcriptional repressor (Ecsedy2003HomeodomainInteracting). The interaction between HIPK1 and Daxx is dependent on HIPK1's active kinase domain, as demonstrated by the preferential binding of Daxx to HIPK1 over a kinase-inactive mutant (Ecsedy2003HomeodomainInteracting).

HIPK1 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction involves specific regions of both proteins and is crucial for HIPK1's role in modulating p53's transcriptional activity and phosphorylation status (Kondo2003Characterization). HIPK1 can phosphorylate itself but not p53 directly in vitro, although it influences p53 phosphorylation in vivo (Kondo2003Characterization).

Additionally, HIPK1 interacts with c-Myb, a transcription factor, modulating its activity through phosphorylation. This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by in vitro assays (Matre2009HIPK1). HIPK1's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in transcriptional regulation and cellular stress responses.
