# HECW1

## Overview
HECW1 is a gene that encodes the protein HECT, C2 and WW domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, also known as NEDL1. This protein is a member of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase family, characterized by its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation and regulation within cells. NEDL1 contains several functional domains, including a C2 domain, two WW domains, and a HECT catalytic domain, which facilitate its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Haouari2023Study; Lorenz2017Structural). The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in neurons, where it plays a role in neuronal development and function (Haouari2023Study). Beyond its involvement in protein homeostasis, HECW1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, and has been associated with several diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancers (Haouari2023Study; Wang2021Integrating).

## Structure
The HECW1 gene encodes the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDL1, which is a member of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase family. The protein consists of 1606 amino acid residues and includes several functional domains: a C2 domain, two WW domains, and a HECT catalytic domain (Haouari2023Study). The C2 domain is involved in calcium-dependent localization to the plasma membrane, while the WW domains interact with proline-rich motifs (Lorenz2017Structural). The HECT domain is crucial for the protein's catalytic activity, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 enzymes to target proteins (Lorenz2017Structural).

The HECT domain is composed of two lobes connected by a flexible linker, allowing for necessary rearrangements during catalysis. The C-lobe contains a catalytic cysteine residue and interacts with ubiquitin, while the N-lobe associates with E2 enzymes (Lorenz2017Structural). The Arg1442Cys variant, located within the HECT domain, is significant for maintaining the structural integrity of the catalytic region, interacting with methionine 1443 and asparagine 1384 (Haouari2023Study).

HECW1 is expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in neurons, and is enriched in the soma and neurites (Haouari2023Study). The protein's function in apoptosis is independent of its HECT catalytic domain, suggesting diverse roles in cellular processes (Haouari2023Study).

## Function
HECW1 encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and regulation in cells. This system is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis by tagging proteins for degradation, thus regulating various cellular processes (Haouari2023Study). HECW1 is part of the NEDD4 subfamily and contains several functional domains, including a C2 domain, two WW domains, and a HECT catalytic domain, which are important for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Haouari2023Study).

In healthy human cells, HECW1 is involved in regulating protein stability and cellular dynamics. It targets specific proteins for degradation, such as the thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1), by promoting its polyubiquitination, which is crucial for processes like lung epithelial cell migration and proliferation (Liu2019The). HECW1 also plays a role in neuronal development and function, with specific localization patterns in neurons, where it is primarily cytoplasmic and enriched in the soma and neurites (Haouari2023Study). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm and nucleus influences processes such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, contributing to cellular signaling and protein turnover.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HECW1 gene, which encodes the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDL1, have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. In the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the HECW1 gene is of significant interest due to its role in the ubiquitin pathway. Variants such as p.Arg1442Cys have been identified in ALS patients and are predicted to be pathogenic, potentially affecting the protein's structure and function. These variants may contribute to ALS pathogenesis by influencing the mislocalization of TDP-43, a protein commonly found in aggregates in ALS patients (Haouari2023Study).

In cancer, HECW1 expression levels have been associated with disease progression and prognosis. For instance, in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), decreased HECW1 expression correlates with advanced tumor stages and resistance to targeted therapies, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Wang2021Integrating). Additionally, HECW1 mutations have been observed in esophageal adenocarcinoma, where they may play a role in cancer progression (Dulak2013Exome). These findings highlight the clinical significance of HECW1 in both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.

## Interactions
HECW1, also known as NEDL1, is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that participates in various protein interactions, influencing several cellular processes. HECW1 interacts with the polarity protein Scribble in endometrial epithelial cells, promoting its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction is crucial for the estrogen-induced degradation of Scribble, which affects cell polarity and is implicated in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis (Jin2019Estrogen).

HECW1 also targets the thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1/NKX2.1) for degradation. This interaction is mediated through site-specific ubiquitination at lysine 151, leading to reduced TTF1 protein stability without affecting its mRNA levels. This process is enhanced by phorbol esters, which induce TTF1 ubiquitination and degradation (Liu2019The).

In glioma cells, HECW1 regulates ferroptosis by interacting with ZNF350, a transcriptional suppressor. HECW1 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of ZNF350, which in turn influences the transcriptional activity of NCOA4, a driver of ferroptosis. This interaction forms part of the HECW1/ZNF350/NCOA4 axis, which is significant for understanding ferroptosis regulation in gliomas (Lin2023HECW1).

HECW1 has also been shown to interact with mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) in the context of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, forming a complex that contributes to motor neuron death (Miyazaki2004NEDL1).
