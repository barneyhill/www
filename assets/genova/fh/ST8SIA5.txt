# ST8SIA5

## Overview
ST8SIA5 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 5, which is a member of the sialyltransferase family. This enzyme is categorized as a glycosyltransferase and is primarily involved in the biosynthesis of polysialic acid, a critical carbohydrate polymer that modifies glycoproteins and glycolipids. The enzyme facilitates the transfer of sialic acid residues to form α-2,8 linkages, which are vital for various cellular processes, including neural development, cell-cell interactions, and immune responses (Wickramasinghe2011Primer). The ST8SIA5 gene exhibits a highly restricted expression pattern, predominantly in the fetal and adult brain, indicating its significant role in brain development and function (Anne2010Comprehensive). Despite its crucial biological functions, comprehensive functional analyses of ST8SIA5 in healthy human cells remain limited (Anne2010Comprehensive).

## Function
The ST8SIA5 gene encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of polysialic acid, a carbohydrate polymer that modifies glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme is involved in the transfer of sialic acid residues to form α-2,8 linkages, which are essential for various cellular processes, including cell-cell interactions, neural development, and immune responses (Wickramasinghe2011Primer). The ST8SIA5 enzyme is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid from its activated sugar precursor, CMP-Sia, to an acceptor carbohydrate (Wickramasinghe2011Primer).

In terms of expression, the ST8SIA5 gene shows a very restricted profile, being expressed almost exclusively in the fetal and adult brain. This suggests its significant role in brain development and function (Anne2010Comprehensive). Despite its importance, detailed functional analysis of ST8SIA5 in healthy human cells remains limited, with no further transcriptional studies published to date (Anne2010Comprehensive). The gene's expression pattern and the presence of unique promoter regions indicate a tightly regulated expression, potentially linked to specific developmental stages and cell types (Anne2010Comprehensive).
