# XPNPEP2

## Overview
The XPNPEP2 gene encodes the enzyme X-prolyl aminopeptidase 2, a metalloprotease involved in the hydrolysis of N-terminal Xaa-Pro bonds. This enzyme, also known as aminopeptidase P (APP), exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with the membrane-bound form being a glycosylated, GPI-anchored protein. X-prolyl aminopeptidase 2 plays a crucial role in the metabolism of the vasodilator bradykinin, particularly in the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, where it becomes the primary enzyme responsible for bradykinin degradation. Genetic variations in XPNPEP2 can influence the enzyme's function, impacting cardiovascular and inflammatory processes and contributing to conditions such as ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. Additionally, alterations in XPNPEP2 expression have been implicated in prostate cancer progression, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease severity (Li2019XPNPEP2; Adam2002Aminopeptidase; Cilia2011A).

## Structure
The XPNPEP2 gene encodes the Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase, a metalloprotease that hydrolyzes N-terminal Xaa-Pro bonds. This enzyme exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. The membrane-bound form is a heavily glycosylated GPI-anchored protein consisting of 673 amino acids (Prueitt2000Physical). The primary structure of XPNPEP2 includes specific amino acid sequences that facilitate its enzymatic function. The secondary structure likely comprises alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure forms a three-dimensional conformation, which includes a catalytic domain essential for its enzymatic activity. The quaternary structure may involve dimerization or oligomerization, although specific details are not provided in the context.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are significant for the membrane-bound form, affecting its localization and function. The enzyme's physiological substrate is the vasodilator bradykinin, which is inactivated in the lung by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) together with Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase (Prueitt2000Physical). The cytoplasmic form of the enzyme is likely encoded by the related XPNPEPL gene, which maps to human chromosome 10, indicating potential splice variant isoforms that may alter the protein's function or localization (Prueitt2000Physical).

## Function
The XPNPEP2 gene encodes the membrane-bound isoform of aminopeptidase P (APP), an enzyme crucial for the metabolism of bradykinin and its metabolite des-Arg9-bradykinin. In healthy human cells, APP is responsible for approximately 30% of the circulatory degradation of bradykinin, with the remaining 70% being accounted for by angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) (Cilia2011A). APP is expressed on the surface of endothelial and epithelial cells in various tissues, including the kidney, liver, small intestine, heart, and lung. A soluble form of APP is also present in blood plasma, likely arising from the cleavage of its membrane anchor (Cilia2011A).

In the presence of ACE inhibitors, APP becomes the major enzyme responsible for metabolizing both bradykinin and des-Arg9-bradykinin, highlighting its critical role in maintaining normal bradykinin metabolism and preventing excessive proinflammatory effects (Duan2005A). Genetic variations in XPNPEP2 can affect the enzyme's function, potentially leading to impaired bradykinin metabolism and associated health risks, such as an increased risk of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema (Cilia2011A). The enzyme's activity is a significant factor in regulating blood pressure and inflammatory responses, underscoring its importance in cardiovascular and inflammatory processes (Adam2002Aminopeptidase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the XPNPEP2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly angioedema induced by angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi). This condition is characterized by swelling due to impaired metabolism of bradykinin, a peptide normally degraded by aminopeptidase P (APP), which is encoded by XPNPEP2. Variants in the XPNPEP2 gene, such as the C-2399A polymorphism, have been associated with reduced plasma APP activity, increasing the risk of ACEi-induced angioedema (Duan2005A; WoodardGrice2010Sexdependent; Cilia2011A). 

The C-2399A SNP affects transcription factor binding, potentially altering gene expression and contributing to the condition (Duan2005A). The ATG haplotype, which includes this SNP, has been shown to significantly increase the risk of angioedema, with an odds ratio of 4.87 in affected individuals (Cilia2011A). 

In prostate cancer, XPNPEP2 expression is lower in cancerous tissues but higher in cases with local invasion and lymph node metastasis, suggesting a role in cancer progression. Elevated serum XPNPEP2 levels in patients with lymph node metastasis indicate its potential as a biomarker for disease severity (Li2019XPNPEP2).
