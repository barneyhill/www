# NDUFS8

## Overview
The NDUFS8 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S8, a critical component of mitochondrial complex I, which is the first enzyme of the electron transport chain. This protein is integral to the process of oxidative phosphorylation, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, thereby contributing to ATP production. As a part of the iron-sulfur (FeS) fragment of complex I, NDUFS8 contains essential tetranuclear iron-sulfur clusters that are vital for electron transfer. The protein is predominantly expressed in tissues with high energy demands, such as the heart and skeletal muscle, and plays a significant role in cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. NDUFS8 is also involved in the early assembly of complex I and influences cell growth and metabolism by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ATP levels. Its interactions within the complex and involvement in pathways like Akt-mTOR underscore its importance in processes such as angiogenesis and cellular proliferation (Wang2022Emerging; Fiedorczuk2018Mammalian; Xiong2024The).

## Structure
The NDUFS8 protein, a subunit of the mitochondrial complex I, is characterized by its N-terminal end, which consists of two connected amphipathic α-helices located on the matrix side of the internal mitochondrial membrane. These α-helices are thought to stabilize the position of the protein relative to the lipid bilayer and may play a role in regulating movements within the complex (Fiedorczuk2018Mammalian). The protein also contains iron-sulfur clusters essential for electron transfer, with specific mutations potentially destabilizing these clusters. For instance, mutations such as Arg102His and Arg138His are likely to affect the stability of Fe-S clusters, as these residues are in direct contact with loops binding cluster N5 (Fiedorczuk2018Mammalian).

NDUFS8 interacts with other subunits within complex I, including NDUFA13, ND1, NDUFA3, and NDUFA7, as well as a cardiolipin molecule, indicating its role in the quaternary structure of the complex (Fiedorczuk2018Mammalian). The protein is part of the peripheral matrix arm of complex I, adjacent to subunits like NDUFS2, NDUFS3, and NDUFS7, which suggests its involvement in the early assembly of the complex (Mckenzie2010Assembly).

## Function
The NDUFS8 gene encodes a core subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is essential for the electron transport chain in mitochondria. This protein facilitates the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a critical step in oxidative phosphorylation that leads to ATP production. NDUFS8 is part of the iron-sulfur (FeS) fragment of complex I and contains tetranuclear iron-sulfur clusters, specifically N6a and N6b, which are crucial for electron transfer processes (Wang2022Emerging).

In healthy human cells, NDUFS8 is active in the mitochondrial inner membrane, playing a vital role in cellular energy metabolism. It is particularly expressed in tissues with high energy demands, such as the heart and skeletal muscle (Wang2022Emerging). The protein is involved in the early stages of complex I assembly, highlighting its importance in mitochondrial function (Wang2022Emerging). NDUFS8 also regulates cell growth and metabolism by altering intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ATP levels (Wang2022Emerging).

In endothelial cells, NDUFS8 is crucial for mitochondrial function, affecting oxygen consumption, ATP production, and the regulation of oxidative stress. It supports angiogenesis by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and capillary tube formation, processes vital for the formation of new blood vessels (Xiong2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NDUFS8 gene are linked to several diseases, primarily due to its role in mitochondrial complex I. In Leigh syndrome, a severe neurodegenerative disorder, pathogenic variants of NDUFS8 disrupt the assembly and function of complex I, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. These mutations often result in misfolding of the protein and impaired interactions with other subunits, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Wang2022Emerging).

In cancer, NDUFS8 expression levels vary across different types. It is upregulated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it is associated with poor prognosis and survival outcomes. Conversely, it is downregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), affecting mitochondrial respiration and tumor characteristics (Wang2022Emerging).

In diabetes mellitus, NDUFS8 expression is linked to insulin sensitivity and resistance. Higher serum concentrations correlate with better insulin sensitivity in type 1 diabetes, while upregulation in skeletal muscle is associated with insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes (Wang2022Emerging). These findings suggest NDUFS8 as a potential therapeutic target in various diseases, though further research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance (Wang2022Emerging).

## Interactions
NDUFS8, a core subunit of mitochondrial complex I, is involved in several critical interactions within the electron transport chain. It is part of the hydrogenase module of complex I, where it plays a role in guiding electrons to the electron acceptor ubiquinone (Vogel2007Human). NDUFS8 interacts with other core subunits such as NDUFS1, NDUFS2, NDUFS3, NDUFS7, and NDUFA12, which are essential for the proper assembly and function of complex I (Wang2022Emerging). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and electron transfer capabilities of complex I.

Mutations in NDUFS8 can disrupt its interactions with these subunits, leading to complex I dysfunction and associated diseases like Leigh syndrome (Wang2022Emerging). NDUFS8 also forms an extensive interface with NDUFA9, another subunit of complex I, which is important for the structural organization and function of the complex (Padavannil2022The).

In addition to its role in complex I, NDUFS8 is involved in activating the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in endothelial cells, which is crucial for angiogenesis. This interaction is significant for cell proliferation, migration, and capillary tube formation (Xiong2024The).
