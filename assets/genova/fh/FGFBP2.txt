# FGFBP2

## Overview
FGFBP2, or fibroblast growth factor binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), which are critical for various cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and angiogenesis. The FGFBP2 protein functions primarily as a binding protein, enhancing the stability and bioavailability of FGFs by facilitating their release from the extracellular matrix, thereby promoting FGF-mediated signaling pathways (Felício2013Polymorphisms). This protein is predominantly expressed in immune cells with cytotoxic potential, including Th1-type CD4+ T cells, effector CD8+ T cells, γ/δ T cells, and CD16+ NK cells, and is associated with improved survival outcomes in cancer patients (Chen2023Diagnostic). FGFBP2 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and congenital heart disease, where its expression levels and genetic alterations may serve as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers (Elgaaen2010POLD2; McKean2016Loss).

## Function
FGFBP2, also known as fibroblast growth factor binding protein 2, is involved in modulating the activity of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), which are essential for various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and angiogenesis. FGFBP2 enhances the stability and bioavailability of FGFs by binding to them, thereby facilitating FGF signaling pathways. This protein is primarily active in the extracellular matrix, where it plays a significant role in tissue repair and development (Felício2013Polymorphisms).

In healthy human cells, FGFBP2 is specifically expressed by Th1-type CD4+ T cells, effector CD8+ T cells, γ/δ T cells, and CD16+ NK cells, all of which have cytotoxic potential. FGFBP2+ NK cells express high levels of cytotoxic effectors such as GZMA, GZMB, GNLY, and PRF1, while exhibiting low levels of inhibitory markers like PDCD1, TIGIT, and CTLA4. This expression pattern is associated with cytotoxic activity and has been linked to improved patient survival in cancer studies (Chen2023Diagnostic).

The gene's expression is notably lower in the peripheral blood of patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis compared to healthy controls, suggesting its involvement in immune function and potential implications in disease pathogenesis (Chen2023Diagnostic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FGFBP2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In congenital heart disease (CHD), FGFBP2 is identified as a candidate gene due to its altered expression levels. The gene exhibits allele-specific expression (ASE) and biallelic loss of expression (LOE), which are associated with CHD. Specifically, FGFBP2 is involved in the FGF signaling axis, crucial for heart development, and its disrupted expression has been linked to outflow tract defects in CHD patients (McKean2016Loss).

In ovarian carcinomas, FGFBP2, also known as KSP37, shows distinct expression patterns. It is upregulated in early-stage clear cell carcinoma, correlating with favorable prognostic factors such as localized disease and longer survival. This suggests a potential role for FGFBP2 as a prognostic marker in ovarian cancer (Elgaaen2010POLD2).

In pancreatic cancer, FGFBP2 has been identified with potential pathogenic mutations in pancreatic stellate cells, although these mutations are not common driver mutations in pancreatic cancer. The role of FGFBP2 in the tumor microenvironment and its genetic alterations may contribute to tumor aggressiveness (Böker2022Analysis).

## Interactions
FGFBP2, or fibroblast growth factor binding protein 2, is known to interact with fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), enhancing their activity by facilitating their release from the extracellular matrix. This interaction plays a significant role in modulating cellular processes such as cell growth and differentiation. FGFBP2 acts as a binding protein for FGFs, which enhances FGF-mediated biological events and contributes to tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in colorectal cancer (Wang2024PDL1). In the context of colorectal cancer, FGFBP2(+) memory T cells secrete FGFBP2, which binds to FGFs and induces neutrophil extracellular trap formation, promoting liver metastasis (Wang2024PDL1). 

In ovarian carcinomas, FGFBP2, also known as KSP37, is expressed in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, suggesting a role in cytotoxic potential (Elgaaen2010POLD2). The gene is associated with favorable prognostic factors in clear cell carcinoma, indicating its involvement in tumor progression and potential as a prognostic marker (Elgaaen2010POLD2). 

In Ankylosing Spondylitis, FGFBP2 is expressed by Th1-type CD4+ T cells, effector CD8+ T cells, γ/δ T cells, and CD16+ NK cells, with a role in immune cell function and potential as a diagnostic marker (Chen2023Diagnostic).
