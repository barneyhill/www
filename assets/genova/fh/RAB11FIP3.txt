# RAB11FIP3

## Overview
RAB11FIP3 is a gene that encodes the RAB11 family interacting protein 3, a crucial component in the regulation of intracellular trafficking, particularly in the recycling of endosomes. The protein, also known as FIP3 or Arfophilin-1, is characterized by its ability to interact with the Rab11 GTPase, facilitating the recycling of internalized plasma membrane receptors and playing a significant role in processes such as cytokinesis and ciliogenesis. FIP3 contains distinct domains for binding Rab11 and ADP ribosylation factors (ARF), enabling it to coordinate the delivery of endosomal vesicles during cell division and other cellular processes (Eathiraj2006Structural; Shiba2006Structural). The protein's interactions and functions are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and have implications in various diseases, including cancer and ciliopathies, due to its involvement in membrane trafficking and signal regulation (Walia2019Akt; Liu2018Eps15).

## Structure
RAB11FIP3, also known as FIP3, is a protein that interacts with the RAB11 GTPase, playing a crucial role in endosomal recycling. The protein contains a Rab11-binding domain (RBD) located at its C-terminus, which is essential for its interaction with Rab11. This domain spans residues 733-756 and forms a parallel coiled-coil homodimer, facilitating the binding of two Rab11 molecules in a quaternary complex (Shiba2006Structural). The RBD overlaps with a coiled-coil region and extends through a C-terminal hook, contributing to the unique interaction mode with Rab11 (Eathiraj2006Structural).

The interaction between FIP3 and Rab11 involves specific residues in the switch I, switch II, and interswitch regions of Rab11, with the switch II region undergoing significant conformational changes to accommodate FIP3 (Eathiraj2006Structural). The FIP3 protein can form homo-oligomers, which are important for its function in cells (Eathiraj2006Structural).

FIP3 also contains an ARF-binding domain (ABD) within residues 607-712, allowing it to interact with ARF proteins, suggesting a dual role in tethering Rab11-positive vesicles to ARF5/ARF6-positive compartments (Shiba2006Structural). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. Splice variants of RAB11FIP3 can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its cellular roles.

## Function
RAB11FIP3, also known as Rab11 family interacting protein 3, plays a critical role in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the recycling of endosomes. It interacts with the Rab11 GTPase to regulate the recycling of internalized plasma membrane receptors, which is essential for processes such as cytokinesis and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Eathiraj2006Structural). RAB11FIP3 is crucial for the normal completion of cytokinesis by facilitating the delivery of recycling endosomes to the cleavage furrow, a process necessary for cell division (Eathiraj2006Structural).

In healthy human cells, RAB11FIP3 localizes to recycling endosomes and is involved in membrane trafficking during cytokinesis. It forms a complex with Rab11, which is necessary for its recruitment to recycling endosomes (Eathiraj2006Structural). The protein also interacts with ASAP1, a GTPase-activating protein, to regulate the pericentrosomal localization of transferrin receptor-positive recycling endosomes, which are crucial for the trafficking of proteins and lipids within cells (Inoue2008Arf).

RAB11FIP3 is also involved in the regulation of ciliogenesis through its interaction with Rab11 and other effectors, forming complexes that are essential for the transport of proteins to specific cellular locations (Walia2019Akt).

## Clinical Significance
RAB11FIP3 is implicated in various diseases due to its role in endosomal recycling and membrane trafficking. In papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), RAB11FIP3 is overexpressed, although its expression does not correlate with specific clinicopathological features. It is suggested to promote tumorigenesis by regulating the recycling of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), potentially extending signal duration and contributing to cancer progression (Liu2018Eps15). 

RAB11FIP3 also plays a critical role in ciliogenesis, a process essential for the formation of cilia. Alterations in its interaction with Rab11 and other effectors can impact ciliogenesis, potentially leading to ciliopathies. The interaction between RAB11FIP3 and Akt is crucial for the regulation of preciliary trafficking, and disruptions in this pathway may be linked to diseases involving ciliary dysfunction (Walia2019Akt).

In the context of membrane trafficking, RAB11FIP3 interacts with ASAP1, influencing the localization of recycling endosomes. This interaction is important for the trafficking of adhesion molecules, which is vital for cell migration and invasion. Alterations in this pathway could contribute to cancer metastasis (Inoue2008Arf).

## Interactions
RAB11FIP3, also known as FIP3 or Arfophilin-1, is involved in several key protein interactions that regulate intracellular trafficking. It interacts with Rab11, a small GTPase, through its Rab11-binding domain (RBD), forming a parallel coiled-coil homodimer that binds two Rab11 molecules. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of FIP3 to recycling endosomes and is characterized by specific contacts involving the switch I, interswitch, and switch II regions of Rab11 (Eathiraj2006Structural; Shiba2006Structural).

FIP3 also interacts with ADP ribosylation factors (ARF) 5 and 6 in a GTP-dependent manner. These interactions are important for the delivery of endosomal vesicles during cytokinesis, allowing FIP3 to function coordinately with other binding partners (Shiba2006Structural). The interaction with ARFs is facilitated by a distinct ARF-binding domain (ABD) that does not overlap with the RBD, enabling simultaneous binding of Rab11 and ARF5/ARF6 (Shiba2006Structural).

Mutational analyses have identified critical residues in FIP3, such as Tyr-737, Asp-739, and Glu-747, which are essential for its binding to Rab11. These residues form hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with Rab11, and mutations in these residues can disrupt the interaction (Shiba2006Structural).
