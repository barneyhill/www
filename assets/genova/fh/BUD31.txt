# BUD31

## Overview
BUD31 is a gene that encodes the BUD31 homolog protein, a critical component of the spliceosome complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing. This protein is highly conserved across eukaryotic species and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression through alternative splicing mechanisms. The BUD31 protein is characterized by a unique Zn3Cys9 cluster, which is integral to its structural stability and function, although it does not conform to traditional zinc finger motifs. Functionally, BUD31 is essential for maintaining splicing efficiency and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and spermatogenesis. Its expression is notably high in tissues such as the testis, ovary, and spleen, where it localizes to the nucleus. Clinically, alterations in BUD31 expression have been linked to several cancers, where it influences tumor progression and patient prognosis (van2015113Cd; Choudhry2023Downregulation; Qin2022Bud31mediated).

## Structure
The BUD31 protein is a 157-residue protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing and is highly conserved across eukaryotes, including humans. Its molecular structure was elucidated using 113Cd NMR spectroscopy, revealing a unique Zn3Cys9 cluster. This cluster is formed by three zinc ions coordinated by nine conserved cysteine residues, without the involvement of histidine residues, which are sometimes found in zinc-binding motifs (van2015113Cd). The protein's structure includes an N-terminal four-helix bundle connected to a C-terminal domain containing the conserved cysteines (van2015113Cd). Despite its zinc-binding properties, BUD31 does not share homology with known zinc finger motifs (van2015113Cd).

BUD31 interacts with the Androgen Receptor (AR) through an FxxFY motif, which is crucial for binding to the AR Ligand Binding Domain (LBD). This interaction is significant for the structural dynamics of the AR-BUD31 complex, particularly in the context of mutations that affect binding affinity and protein conformation (Song2020New). The protein is a monomer in solution, as confirmed by mass spectrometry and gel filtration (van2015113Cd).

## Function
The BUD31 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts, a process essential for proper RNA processing and gene regulation (Qin2022Bud31mediated). In healthy cells, BUD31 is involved in alternative splicing, which is crucial for the regulation of gene expression and cellular function. This protein predominantly binds to intron regions of pre-mRNAs and is enriched in exon-intron regions around splicing sites, indicating its role in maintaining splicing efficiency (Qin2022Bud31mediated).

BUD31 is highly expressed in tissues such as the testis, ovary, and spleen, and is primarily localized in the nuclei of cells, suggesting its involvement in regulating cell cycle transitions (Qin2022Bud31mediated). The protein's activity is temporally coordinated with alternative splicing events, which are essential for processes like spermatogenesis. BUD31-mediated splicing is necessary for the self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells, highlighting its importance in maintaining the balance between stem cell maintenance and differentiation (Qin2022Bud31mediated). The disruption of BUD31 function can lead to impaired splicing and reduced expression of critical genes, affecting cellular and organismal development (Qin2022Bud31mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BUD31 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In serous ovarian cancer (SOC), elevated BUD31 expression is associated with poor prognosis, correlating with decreased overall survival and progression-free survival. Knockdown of BUD31 in ovarian cancer cells induces apoptosis, suggesting its role in promoting cell survival and tumor growth (Wang2022Splicing).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), high BUD31 expression is linked to worse clinical outcomes, including advanced tumor stages and higher tumor grades. It is identified as an independent predictor of poor prognosis and is associated with increased genomic instability, including higher tumor mutation burden and microsatellite instability. BUD31 also influences the tumor immune microenvironment, promoting immune evasion (Wu2024The).

In prostate cancer, downregulation of BUD31 is associated with more aggressive stages, such as castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Low BUD31 expression correlates with increased cell proliferation and migration, linked to hyperactivation of the AKT pathway and decreased p53 expression. This downregulation enhances cancer cell invasiveness through increased expression of vimentin, a marker of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Choudhry2023Downregulation).

## Interactions
The BUD31 protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a homolog of the human BUD31 gene, is involved in pre-mRNA splicing and interacts with various components of the spliceosome. It is associated with the NineTeen complex (NTC) and interacts with U5 and U6 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), indicating its role in spliceosome progression (Saha2012Saccharomyces). BUD31 is part of a complex with proteins such as Prp8, Prp19, Prp22, and Snu114, which are involved in RNA processing (Masciadri2004Characterization). It also interacts with SF3b, a splicing factor complex, and is associated with Cus1-TAP, suggesting a stable interaction within the SF3b complex (Wang2005Interactions).

BUD31 does not directly bind to pre-mRNA but influences the interaction of a 25-kDa protein with the exonic 5' splice site, which is crucial for efficient splicing (Saha2012Saccharomyces). The protein's interactions are salt-stable, highlighting its role in stabilizing protein-pre-mRNA interactions during splicing (Saha2012Saccharomyces).
