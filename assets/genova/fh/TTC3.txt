# TTC3

## Overview
TTC3 (tetratricopeptide repeat domain 3) is a gene that encodes a protein functioning primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for protein degradation. The TTC3 protein plays a significant role in maintaining protein homeostasis by facilitating the degradation of misfolded proteins and preventing their aggregation, which is crucial for neuronal survival and function (Zhou2021TTC3Mediated). It also acts as a cochaperone, interacting with heat shock proteins such as Hsp70 to assist in protein folding (Zhou2021TTC3Mediated). TTC3 is involved in various cellular processes, including neuronal differentiation and proliferation, through its interactions with signaling pathways like Rho and Akt (Zhou2021TTC3Mediated). Additionally, it regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and myofibroblast differentiation by modulating TGF-β signaling (Kim2019TTC3). The gene's expression and function have clinical implications in fibrotic diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in both cellular and systemic contexts (Kim2019TTC3; LepagnolBestel2022AUTS2).

## Structure


## Function
The TTC3 gene encodes a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) for protein degradation in healthy human cells (Zhou2021TTC3Mediated). This protein is involved in maintaining protein homeostasis by facilitating the degradation of misfolded proteins, thereby preventing protein aggregation and supporting neuronal survival (Zhou2021TTC3Mediated). TTC3 also acts as a cochaperone, assisting in the correct folding of proteins and interacting with heat shock proteins like Hsp70 (Zhou2021TTC3Mediated).

TTC3 is involved in neuronal differentiation and proliferation, primarily through the Rho and Akt signaling pathways. It inhibits neurite extension by interacting with RhoA and Citron kinase, affecting neuronal growth and development (Zhou2021TTC3Mediated). In the Akt signaling pathway, TTC3 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Akt, leading to its degradation and impacting cell cycle progression and cell survival (Zhou2021TTC3Mediated).

Additionally, TTC3 is implicated in the regulation of TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and myofibroblast differentiation by promoting the degradation of SMURF2, a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling (Kim2019TTC3). This activity highlights its role in modulating cellular processes like EMT and differentiation (Kim2019TTC3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TTC3 gene have been implicated in several fibrotic diseases. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), TTC3 expression is upregulated in response to TGF-β1, leading to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and myofibroblast differentiation. This process is characterized by a decrease in epithelial markers and an increase in mesenchymal markers, contributing to the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases (Kim2019TTC3). TTC3 mediates these effects through the ubiquitylation and degradation of SMURF2, a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling, thereby enhancing TGF-β signaling pathways (Kim2019TTC3).

In liver fibrosis, TTC3 interacts with the KIF18A gene to regulate the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. TTC3 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of phosphorylated AKT, influencing cell survival and apoptosis. Alterations in TTC3 expression can impact the progression of liver fibrosis by modulating this pathway (Zhang2024KIF18A).

TTC3 also plays a role in synaptic functions through its interaction with the AUTS2 gene. This interaction affects the AKT/mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for synaptic function. Dysregulation of this pathway due to altered TTC3 activity has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (LepagnolBestel2022AUTS2).

## Interactions
The TTC3 protein is involved in several interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. TTC3 acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase, interacting with the AKT protein to regulate its degradation. This interaction is significant in the context of Down syndrome, where TTC3 overexpression leads to decreased phosphorylated AKT levels, promoting apoptosis and affecting cell cycle progression (Zhou2021TTC3Mediated). TTC3 also interacts with the SMURF2 protein, another ubiquitin E3 ligase, promoting its ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. This interaction plays a crucial role in TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and myofibroblast differentiation, processes relevant to fibrotic diseases (Kim2019TTC3).

In the nervous system, TTC3 is implicated in protein quality control, interacting with heat shock proteins like Hsp70, which are involved in proteasomal degradation. This interaction suggests a role for TTC3 in maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing pathological protein aggregation (Zhou2021TTC3Mediated). Additionally, TTC3 is involved in mitochondrial function through its interaction with POLG, a critical enzyme for mitochondrial DNA replication and repair, highlighting its role in cognitive health (Zhou2021TTC3Mediated). These interactions underscore TTC3's involvement in various signaling pathways and cellular responses.
