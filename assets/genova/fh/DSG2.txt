# DSG2

## Overview
Desmoglein 2 (DSG2) is a gene that encodes the protein desmoglein 2, a transmembrane cadherin involved in cell-cell adhesion, particularly within desmosomes. Desmoglein 2 is integral to the structural integrity of epithelial tissues, including the heart, skin, and intestinal epithelium, where it facilitates strong intercellular connections. The protein's extracellular domain contains multiple cadherin repeats that mediate calcium-dependent adhesion, while its intracellular domain anchors to the cytoskeleton, contributing to the mechanical stability of tissues (Schlegel2010Desmoglein; Debus2019In). DSG2 is crucial for maintaining cardiac tissue integrity, and mutations in this gene are linked to cardiomyopathies such as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) (Myasnikov2021The; Syrris2006Desmoglein2). Additionally, DSG2 plays a role in regulating signaling pathways that influence cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis, underscoring its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Giusti2013Desmoglein2Integrin; Ebert2016A).

## Structure
Desmoglein 2 (DSG2) is a desmosomal cadherin involved in cell-cell adhesion, particularly in epithelial tissues. The molecular structure of DSG2 includes several key features. The primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein chain. The extracellular region of DSG2 contains five cadherin domains, which are crucial for its adhesive functions (Debus2019In). These domains are involved in calcium-dependent interactions, essential for maintaining the integrity of desmosomal junctions (Vite2019Desmoglein2).

The tertiary structure of DSG2 involves the folding of these cadherin domains, which is critical for its function. X-ray diffraction studies have detailed the molecular structure of DSG2's extracellular domains, revealing five N-glycosylation sites and three O-mannosylation sites, which are conserved across vertebrates, indicating their functional importance (Debus2019In). These glycosylation sites are involved in post-translational modifications that affect the protein's stability and interactions (Debus2019In).

DSG2 also contains a transmembrane region and an intracellular anchor domain, which help integrate the protein into the cell membrane and connect it to the cytoskeleton. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of DSG2 into desmosomes, where it interacts with other desmosomal proteins to maintain tissue integrity (Schlegel2010Desmoglein).

## Function
Desmoglein 2 (DSG2) is a critical component of desmosomes, which are structures that facilitate cell-cell adhesion in various tissues, including the heart, skin, and intestinal epithelium. In cardiomyocytes, DSG2 is essential for maintaining cell cohesion and function, particularly within the intercalated disc, which provides mechanical strength and electrical communication between adjacent cells. Mutations in DSG2 can lead to arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, highlighting its importance in cardiac tissue integrity (Schlipp2014Desmoglein2).

In the intestinal epithelium, DSG2 plays a crucial role in maintaining barrier integrity by mediating adhesion between enterocytes. It regulates the expression of tight junction proteins such as Claudin2 by sequestering PI-3-kinase, thereby modulating the PI-3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway. This regulation is vital for maintaining tight junction integrity and preventing increased intestinal permeability (Schlegel2010Desmoglein; Burkard2021Desmoglein2).

In endothelial cells, DSG2 is involved in neoangiogenesis by influencing cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. It regulates cell-cell adhesion and maintains the structural integrity of cell junctions, which is essential for healthy angiogenesis and vascular integrity (Ebert2016A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DSG2 gene are associated with several cardiomyopathies, most notably arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC). ARVC is characterized by ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death, often involving the replacement of cardiomyocytes with fibrous or fatty tissue, predominantly in the right ventricle (Debus2019In; Syrris2006Desmoglein2). DSG2 mutations, such as frameshift, nonsense, and missense mutations, disrupt the protein's role in cell-cell adhesion, contributing to the pathogenesis of ARVC (Debus2019In; Hawthorne2021Altered).

In LVNC, DSG2 mutations like the nonsense mutation DSG2-p.S363X lead to a loss-of-function mechanism, affecting the protein's localization and function, which is crucial for maintaining cardiomyocyte cohesion (Myasnikov2021The). These mutations can also impact calcium handling and force transduction in cardiomyocytes, further contributing to disease pathology (Myasnikov2021The).

Alterations in DSG2 expression levels have been observed in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), where reduced DSG2 signals are linked to weakened cardiomyocyte adhesion and increased fibrosis, exacerbating the disease (Kessler2017Disturbed). These findings underscore the critical role of DSG2 in maintaining cardiac structural integrity and function.

## Interactions
Desmoglein 2 (DSG2) is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cell adhesion and signaling. DSG2 is a key component of desmosomes, where it interacts with other desmosomal proteins such as plakoglobin, plakophilins, and desmoplakin, forming a complex that links to intermediate filaments and provides mechanical strength to tissues (Schlipp2014Desmoglein2).

DSG2 also interacts with integrin beta-8 (ITGB8) in endothelial cells, influencing actin assembly and angiogenesis. This interaction is crucial for signaling pathways involving Rac, FAK, SMAD1/5, and MAP-kinases, which promote angiogenesis. Silencing DSG2 or ITGB8 disrupts actin assembly and inhibits angiogenesis, highlighting their functional relationship (Giusti2013Desmoglein2Integrin).

In cardiomyocytes, DSG2 interacts with N-cadherin and gap junctions, forming part of the area composita, which is essential for mechanical and electrical coupling between cells. Mutations in DSG2 can lead to arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, affecting cell cohesion and heart function (Schlipp2014Desmoglein2).

DSG2 also interacts with adenovirus fiber knobs, particularly from adenovirus type 3 (Ad3), which bind to DSG2 and can open epithelial junctions. This interaction has implications for enhancing chemotherapy efficacy in cancer models (Wang2013Structural).
