# SLC12A4

## Overview
The SLC12A4 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 12 member 4, also known as potassium chloride cotransporter 1 (KCC1), which is a member of the K+-Cl- cotransporter family. This protein is integral to the transport of potassium and chloride ions across cell membranes, functioning as a transmembrane transporter with 12 transmembrane domains (Hebert2004Molecular). KCC1 plays a vital role in maintaining cellular ion homeostasis and is involved in processes such as cell volume regulation and intracellular chloride concentration modulation (BazúaValenti2016Physiological). The activity of KCC1 is modulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which are critical for its function in response to cellular volume changes (Hebert2004Molecular). The gene exhibits genetic variability, which may result in different isoforms with distinct functional properties (Schaller2019The). KCC1 is expressed in various tissues, including erythrocytes and specific brain regions, where it contributes to physiological processes such as osmoregulation and neuronal excitability (Hebert2004Molecular; Zhou2004Human).

## Structure
The SLC12A4 gene encodes the KCC1 protein, a member of the K+-Cl- cotransporter family, which is involved in ion transport across cell membranes. KCC1 is a 1085 amino acid protein with a high sequence identity to KCC3, sharing 75% similarity (Hebert2004Molecular). The protein is characterized by a topology featuring 12 transmembrane domains, which are flanked by hydrophilic NH2 and COOH-terminal domains (Hebert2004Molecular). These structural features are typical of the solute carrier family, facilitating its role in transporting ions.

KCC1's activity is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, with dephosphorylation activating the transporter (BazúaValenti2016Physiological). This post-translational modification is crucial for its function, as it is activated by cell swelling and inhibited by phosphatase inhibition (Hebert2004Molecular). The protein's transport activity is not detected under isotonic conditions, indicating a specific regulatory mechanism linked to cellular volume changes.

The SLC12A4 gene also exhibits genetic variability, with numerous variants potentially affecting the protein's function (Schaller2019The). These variants may lead to different isoforms with distinct functional properties, although specific details on splice variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
The SLC12A4 gene encodes the potassium chloride cotransporter 1 (KCC1), which is a member of the K-Cl cotransporters family. KCC1 is involved in the electroneutral transport of potassium and chloride ions across the cell membrane, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular ion balance (Hebert2004Molecular; BazúaValenti2016Physiological). This transporter is widely expressed in various tissues, suggesting a housekeeping role in cell volume regulation and intracellular chloride concentration modulation (Hebert2004Molecular; BazúaValenti2016Physiological).

KCC1 is particularly significant in erythrocytes, where it contributes to the dehydration of sickle erythrocytes, a factor in sickle cell disease (Zhou2004Human). The activity of KCC1 is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycles, with dephosphorylation activating the transporter (BazúaValenti2016Physiological). This regulation is crucial for processes such as osmoregulation and signal transduction, impacting cell volume and neuronal excitability (Hebert2004Molecular).

In the brain, KCC1 is expressed at low levels in adult rats, with higher expression in the choroid plexus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum, indicating its role in specific brain regions during development (Hebert2004Molecular).
