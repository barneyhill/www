# GARIN6

## Overview
GARIN6 is a gene that encodes the protein golgi associated RAB2 interactor family member 6, which is involved in intracellular transport processes. This protein is categorized as a member of the RAB2 interactor family, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of vesicular trafficking within the Golgi apparatus. The precise function of GARIN6 and its encoded protein is still under investigation, but it is believed to be integral to maintaining Golgi structure and function, potentially influencing various cellular processes such as protein sorting and secretion. Understanding the role of GARIN6 could provide insights into its involvement in cellular homeostasis and its implications in disease states.
