# KDM3B

## Overview
KDM3B is a gene located on human chromosome 5 (5q31) that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 3B, a member of the JMJD1 subfamily of histone lysine demethylases. This protein is characterized by its JmjC domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity in demethylating histone H3K9-me1/2, thereby playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin remodeling (Kim2012KDM3B; Sui2021Crucial). KDM3B is involved in various biological processes, including spermatogenesis, somatic growth, and hematopoiesis, and it influences cellular homeostasis through the regulation of autophagy-related genes (Jung2020Histone; Yoo2024Epigenetic). The protein interacts with several other proteins, such as CBP and SCAI, to modulate transcriptional activity and chromatin structure (Kim2012KDM3B; Brauchle2013Protein). KDM3B's role in cancer is complex, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene depending on the cellular context, which underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Sui2021Crucial; Yoo2024Epigenetic).

## Structure
The KDM3B protein is encoded by the KDM3B gene located on human chromosome 5 (5q31) and is a member of the JMJD1 subfamily of histone lysine demethylases. It contains a JmjC domain, which is crucial for its demethylase activity, specifically targeting histone H3K9-me1/2. This domain is located near the carboxy terminus of the protein (Kim2012KDM3B; Sui2021Crucial). KDM3B also features a zinc finger (ZF)-like domain at its amino terminus, which is important for its function (Kim2012KDM3B).

The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing. Isoform 2 is 1,417 amino acids long, missing the N-terminal amino acids 1 to 344, while isoform 3 is 759 amino acids long, missing the N-terminal amino acids 1 to 1002 (Kim2012KDM3B). These isoforms may influence the protein's interactions and functions.

KDM3B shares about 50% amino acid identity with other JMJD1 proteins and has a conserved LXXLL motif, which is a protein-protein interaction motif (Sui2021Crucial). The protein structure of KDM3B has been experimentally determined, with the Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 4C8D providing insights into its molecular configuration (Yoo2024Epigenetic).

## Function
KDM3B, a histone lysine demethylase, plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression by demethylating H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 histone marks, which are associated with transcriptional activation. In healthy human cells, KDM3B is involved in several critical biological processes. It is essential for spermatogenesis and male sexual behaviors, as evidenced by subfertility in Kdm3b-knockout male mice. Female knockout mice exhibit irregular estrous cycles and infertility, indicating its role in reproductive health (Yoo2024Epigenetic).

KDM3B also influences postnatal somatic growth by regulating the expression of insulin growth factor binding protein-3, which is crucial for growth and development. In hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, KDM3B is vital for their survival, differentiation, and development, with knockout mice showing defects in hematopoiesis (Yoo2024Epigenetic).

In cellular processes, KDM3B is active in the nucleus, where it modulates transcriptional activity by altering chromatin structure. It regulates autophagy by activating the transcription of autophagy-related genes, such as ATG5 and ATG7, through the demethylation of H3K9me2 on their promoters, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis and response to stress (Jung2020Histone).

## Clinical Significance
KDM3B, also known as lysine demethylase 3B, plays a significant role in various cancers, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene depending on the context. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), KDM3B is often underexpressed, particularly in cases with the 5q31 chromosomal deletion, and its low expression is associated with poor prognosis. Overexpression of KDM3B in AML cells has been shown to reduce clonogenic efficiency, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Xu2017KDM3B; Sui2021Crucial). Conversely, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), KDM3B is overexpressed and acts as a transcriptional coactivator, promoting the expression of the leukemic oncogene LMO2, indicating an oncogenic role (Kim2012KDM3B).

In prostate cancer, KDM3B is crucial for the proliferation and survival of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells, acting through metabolic changes rather than the androgen receptor pathway (Saraç2019Systematic). In breast cancer, KDM3B has a dual role, acting as a tumor suppressor in some contexts while promoting invasion and metastasis when fused with ETF1 (Yoo2024Epigenetic). These findings highlight the complex and context-dependent roles of KDM3B in cancer, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
KDM3B, a histone demethylase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. It interacts with the histone acetyltransferase CBP (CREB-binding protein) to form a coactivator complex, enhancing the transcriptional activation of the lmo2 gene in leukemia (Kim2012KDM3B). This interaction is specific, as KDM3B does not interact with PCAF, another histone acetyltransferase (Kim2012KDM3B).

KDM3B also interacts with SCAI, a transcriptional repressor involved in cancer cell invasion suppression. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments and sub-cellular co-localization studies, indicating that SCAI may act as a transcriptional coregulator with KDM3B (Brauchle2013Protein).

In the context of fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma, KDM3B is essential for the survival of cancer cells, and its interaction with the compound PFI-90 has been shown to disrupt oncogenic activity, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Kim2022KDM3B).

In mouse embryonic stem cells, KDM3B interacts with components of the RNA processing machinery, including spliceosomal components and RNA helicases, suggesting a role in mRNA processing and splicing regulation (Dillingham2023KDM3A).
