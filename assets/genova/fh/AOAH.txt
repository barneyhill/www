# AOAH

## Overview
The AOAH gene encodes the enzyme acyloxyacyl hydrolase, a crucial component in the immune system's regulation of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). This enzyme is categorized as a lipase and functions by deacylating LPS, thereby reducing its ability to trigger immune responses. The AOAH enzyme is a heterodimer composed of a large catalytic subunit and a smaller saposin-like subunit, both of which are glycosylated and linked by disulfide bonds. The large subunit contains a lipase consensus sequence responsible for its enzymatic activity, while the small subunit aids in LPS recognition. AOAH is predominantly expressed in immune cells such as neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells, where it plays a vital role in modulating immune responses and maintaining homeostasis by preventing excessive immune activation. This function is particularly important in mitigating the effects of Gram-negative bacterial infections and conditions like septic shock and endotoxemia (Hagen1991Expression; Munford2020Biochemical).

## Structure
The human acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH) enzyme is a heterodimer composed of two glycosylated subunits linked by disulfide bonds. The large subunit, approximately 50 kDa, contains a lipase consensus sequence (G-X-S-X-G) and is responsible for the enzyme's catalytic activity (Hagen1991Expression; Staab1999Distinctive). The small subunit, ranging from 14 to 20 kDa, shows sequence similarity to saposins, which are cofactors for sphingolipid hydrolases, and is involved in the recognition of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (Hagen1991Expression; Staab1994A).

AOAH undergoes several post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and proteolytic processing. The large subunit contains four potential N-glycosylation sites, while the small subunit has one (Hagen1991Expression). The enzyme is synthesized as a precursor polypeptide that undergoes internal disulfide linkage before being processed into its mature form (Staab1994A).

The tertiary structure of AOAH includes a catalytic domain with a five-stranded parallel β-sheet core surrounded by 11 helices, typical of the GDSL esterases/lipases family. It also features a saposin domain composed of four α-helices stabilized by disulfide bonds, which interacts with the catalytic domain through a hydrophobic interface (Gorelik2018Crystal). The enzyme's structure is stabilized by calcium ions, which are crucial for maintaining enzymatic activity (Gorelik2018Crystal). AOAH may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, as indicated by the absence of certain nucleotides in an alternatively spliced form of AOAH mRNA (Hagen1991Expression).

## Function
The human gene AOAH encodes the enzyme acyloxyacyl hydrolase, which plays a critical role in modulating immune responses by deacylating bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). AOAH specifically removes secondary acyl chains from the lipid A moiety of LPS, transforming it into a less potent immune stimulant. This deacylation process reduces the stimulatory potency of LPS by as much as 50- to 100-fold, thereby inhibiting the formation of the LPS-MD-2-TLR4 complexes necessary for activating immune signaling (Munford2020Biochemical). AOAH is primarily active in immune cells such as neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells, where it functions within endosomal compartments to inactivate LPS before it can enter the bloodstream (Munford2020Biochemical).

The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis by preventing excessive immune activation and reducing host injury from bacterial infections. AOAH's deacylation of LPS helps limit B cell proliferation and antibody production, thus playing a regulatory role in controlling the immune response to Gram-negative bacterial infections (Lu2005Lipopolysaccharide). This function is essential for reducing the pathological consequences of conditions such as septic shock and endotoxemia (Munford2020Biochemical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the AOAH gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly those involving bladder dysfunction and pelvic pain. AOAH-deficient mice exhibit bladder dysfunction characterized by enlarged bladders, decreased voiding frequency, and increased void volumes, which are indicative of potential voiding dysfunctions similar to interstitial cystitis (IC) (Aguiniga2020Acyloxyacyl). The gene's deficiency is also associated with increased bladder afferent activity and bladder permeability, suggesting a role in bladder inflammation and IC (Aguiniga2020Acyloxyacyl).

AOAH is implicated in the regulation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) expression, with its deficiency leading to increased CRF levels and decreased voiding frequency, which could contribute to conditions like overactive bladder (OAB) (Aguiniga2020Acyloxyacyl). The AOAH-CRF pathway is considered a potential therapeutic target for bladder dysfunctions (Aguiniga2020Acyloxyacyl).

In the context of pelvic pain, AOAH deficiency is linked to increased pelvic allodynia and bladder hypersensitivity, conditions often associated with IC and chronic pelvic pain syndromes (Yang2018Acyloxyacyl). AOAH's role in lipid metabolism, particularly arachidonic acid (AA) homeostasis, further implicates it in chronic inflammatory conditions and pain modulation (Yang2020AOAH).
