# ANGPTL1

## Overview
ANGPTL1, or angiopoietin-like 1, is a gene that encodes a secreted protein belonging to the angiopoietin-like family, which is involved in various physiological processes, including angiogenesis, lipid metabolism, and inflammation regulation. The protein angiopoietin-like 1 is characterized by its structural domains, such as the N-terminal signal peptide, coiled-coil domains, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain, which facilitate its function as an orphan ligand distinct from typical angiopoietin receptors (Kubota2005Cooperative; Yang2021Emerging). ANGPTL1 is known for its anti-angiogenic properties, playing a crucial role in maintaining vascular stability and integrity by inhibiting endothelial cell activities (Ishida2021Influence). Additionally, it has significant implications in bone remodeling and adipogenesis, highlighting its broad physiological relevance (Ishida2021Influence). The protein's interaction with integrin α1β1 is pivotal in its tumor-suppressive functions, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it modulates key signaling pathways to inhibit cancer progression (Yan2017ANGPTL1).

## Structure
ANGPTL1 is a protein characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function. It possesses an N-terminal signal peptide domain, which is crucial for protein sorting and secretion (Yang2021Emerging). The protein also includes one or two coiled-coil domains (CCD), which facilitate protein-protein interactions and oligomerization. This oligomerization is important for its biological activities, such as attenuating lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in lipid metabolism (Yang2021Emerging). The C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain (FLD) is another significant feature of ANGPTL1, mediating its activity as a ligand (Yang2021Emerging).

ANGPTL1 is known to be an orphan ligand, meaning it does not bind to the typical angiopoietin receptors Tie1 or Tie2, which distinguishes it from other members of the angiopoietin family (Kubota2005Cooperative). The protein's structure is shared among the angiopoietin-like family, with the fibrinogen-like domain being highly homologous across different ANGPTLs (Yang2021Emerging). ANGPTL1 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may influence its function and stability. The protein may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
ANGPTL1 (angiopoietin-like 1) is a protein involved in several critical molecular processes, including angiogenesis, lipid metabolism, and inflammation regulation. It is part of the angiopoietin-like family, which plays significant roles in vascular development and homeostasis. ANGPTL1 is known for its anti-angiogenic properties, as it inhibits endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion, contributing to the stability and integrity of blood vessels (Ishida2021Influence).

In the context of bone remodeling, ANGPTL1 plays a dual role by suppressing osteoclast formation and promoting osteoblastic differentiation. It significantly inhibits the formation of osteoclasts and the expression of osteoclast-related genes, such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and cathepsin K, in response to receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL). Concurrently, ANGPTL1 enhances osteoblastic differentiation, as evidenced by increased Osterix mRNA levels, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineralization in certain cell types (Ishida2021Influence).

ANGPTL1 also reduces adipogenic differentiation by decreasing mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and adipocyte protein-2, as well as lipid droplet formation, indicating its broader impact on cell differentiation processes (Ishida2021Influence). The protein is widely expressed in tissues such as the liver and cardiovascular system, highlighting its broad physiological relevance (Ishida2021Influence).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ANGPTL1 (angiopoietin-like 1) is known to interact with integrin α1β1, a receptor that plays a significant role in cell adhesion and signaling. This interaction is crucial for ANGPTL1's ability to suppress angiogenesis and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. The binding of ANGPTL1 to integrin α1β1 has been confirmed through immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies, highlighting its role in modulating downstream signaling pathways such as FAK/ERK/AKT, which are important in cancer cell behavior (Yan2017ANGPTL1).

ANGPTL1 also influences the expression of various proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival, including c-Jun, Cyclin D1, c-Myc, Pim2, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL, by inhibiting their expression through its interaction with integrin α1β1 (Yan2017ANGPTL1). This interaction is essential for ANGPTL1's tumor-suppressive functions, as blocking integrin α1β1 with an inhibitor like obtustatin can negate ANGPTL1's effects, underscoring the importance of this signaling axis in HCC suppression (Yan2017ANGPTL1). Additionally, ANGPTL1's interaction with integrin α1β1 is implicated in inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by downregulating transcription factors SNAIL and SLUG, thereby reducing cell motility and metastasis (Yan2017ANGPTL1).
