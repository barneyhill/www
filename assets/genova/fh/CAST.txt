# CAST

## Overview
The CAST gene encodes calpastatin, a protein that functions as an endogenous inhibitor of calpain, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease. Calpastatin is categorized as an inhibitor protein and is characterized by its intrinsically disordered structure, which allows it to effectively bind and inhibit calpain, thereby regulating its proteolytic activity (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin). This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, cell migration, and apoptosis (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin). The CAST gene's expression and the activity of calpastatin have significant implications in several diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Rao2008Marked; Yang2022CAST).

## Structure
The calpastatin protein, encoded by the human CAST gene, is an endogenous inhibitor of calpain, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease. Calpastatin is characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature, lacking a well-defined three-dimensional structure but containing local preformed transient structural elements crucial for calpain recognition (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin). The primary structure of calpastatin includes four repetitive homologous C-terminal domains (d1-d4) and two unique N-terminal domains (dXL and dL) (Zhang2010Cloning). Each of these domains contains subdomains A, B, and C, which are essential for its inhibitory function (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin).

The secondary structure of calpastatin is predicted to include 33 α-helices and eight β-sheets (Zhang2010Cloning). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to effectively inhibit calpain by blocking its active site and preventing substrate access (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin). Calpastatin can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing and promoter usage, with molecular masses ranging from 17.5 to 84 kDa (GOLL2003The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are also present and can influence the protein's activity (Zhang2010Cloning).

## Function
The CAST gene encodes calpastatin, a specific inhibitor of calpain, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease. In healthy human cells, calpastatin plays a crucial role in regulating calpain activity, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Calpastatin inhibits calpain by binding to its catalytic domain, preventing excessive proteolysis that could lead to cellular damage (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin).

Calpastatin is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, cell migration, and apoptosis. It ensures proper cell cycle progression by regulating calpain activity, which is necessary for cells to pass through different phases of the cell cycle (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin). In terms of cell migration, calpastatin affects the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for cell motility (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin). Calpastatin also plays a role in apoptosis by preventing excessive calpain activity, which could otherwise lead to aberrant cellular processes (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin).

Calpastatin is active in various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences processes like signal transduction and cellular structure maintenance (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin). Its regulation of calpain activity is vital for preventing diseases such as cancer (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAST gene, which encodes calpastatin, have been implicated in several diseases. In gastric cancer, CAST is identified as a potential oncogene. High expression levels of CAST are associated with poorer survival outcomes in gastric cancer patients, suggesting its role in cancer progression and prognosis (Yang2022CAST). The gene's interaction with the WNT signaling pathway and its association with tumor-associated macrophages further highlight its significance in gastric cancer (Yang2022CAST).

In Alzheimer's disease, CAST depletion is linked to increased calpain activity, leading to cytoskeletal disruption and neurodegeneration. This depletion is associated with the activation of proteolytic systems, including caspases and calpains, which contribute to the disease's pathology. Overexpression of CAST has been shown to provide neuroprotection by inhibiting calpain activity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Rao2008Marked).

In spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CAST gene, such as rs1559085, are associated with a later age of onset, indicating a potential role in modifying the disease phenotype (Martins2021Variants).

## Interactions
Calpastatin (CAST) is an endogenous inhibitor of calpain, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease. It interacts with calpain to regulate its activity, preventing excessive proteolysis. CAST binds to the calpain catalytic domain, inhibiting its function. This interaction is crucial for cellular processes like cytoskeletal remodeling, signal transduction, and apoptosis.

Calpastatin interacts with calpain in a calcium-dependent manner, binding to at least two sites on the calpain molecule. This interaction involves specific cysteine residues, particularly Cys-497 in m-calpain, which is not present in p-calpain (Croall1994Domain). Calpastatin consists of several domains, each containing conserved subdomains (A, B, and C) responsible for calpain inhibition. Subdomain B binds to the active site of calpain, while subdomains A and C enhance the inhibitory effect by anchoring the inhibitor to the PEF domains of calpain's large and small subunits (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin).

The interaction between calpastatin and calpain is competitive, as demonstrated by the synthetic peptide TIPPEYRin, which mimics calpastatin's function and competitively inhibits calpain activity (Croall1994Domain). This peptide binds within the site occupied by calpastatin, indicating a conserved mechanism of inhibition across species (Croall1994Domain).
