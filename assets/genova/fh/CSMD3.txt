# CSMD3

## Overview
CSMD3, or CUB and Sushi multiple domains 3, is a gene that encodes a large transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in the brain. This protein is characterized by its single-pass transmembrane nature, featuring a substantial extracellular domain and a short cytoplasmic domain. It belongs to the CSMD family, which includes CSMD1 and CSMD2, and is distinguished by multiple CUB and Sushi domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions. The CSMD3 protein plays a crucial role in neuronal development, particularly in dendrite growth and synapse formation, and is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Xi2023CSMD3Deficiency; Mizukami2016CUB). Additionally, alterations in the CSMD3 gene have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its significance in both neurological and oncological research (Zhang2014Loss; Ermis2022The).

## Structure
The CSMD3 protein is a large transmembrane protein characterized by its single-pass transmembrane nature, with a significant extracellular domain and a short cytoplasmic domain (Mizukami2016CUB). It consists of 3707 amino acid residues in mice, although alternative splicing in the adult mouse brain results in a full-length protein of 3637 amino acids (Mizukami2016CUB). The protein includes a signal peptide, a transmembrane region, and multiple domains, specifically 14 CUB domains and 26-28 Sushi domains, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions (Xi2023CSMD3Deficiency; Mizukami2016CUB).

The CUB domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for neuronal migration, dendrite growth, and synapse formation (Mizukami2016CUB). The Sushi domains often form oligomers, contributing to the protein's quaternary structure, as CSMD3 is known to form homophilic oligomeric complexes (Mizukami2016CUB). The extracellular region of CSMD3 is essential for its role in dendrite development, while the intracellular region is not necessary for this function (Mizukami2016CUB). The protein's expression and localization have been studied using tagged expression vectors and immunocytochemistry (Mizukami2016CUB).

## Function
The CSMD3 gene encodes a large transmembrane protein that is primarily expressed in the brain, both during fetal development and in adulthood. It is part of the CSMD family, which includes CSMD1 and CSMD2, and is characterized by multiple CUB and Sushi domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Xi2023CSMD3Deficiency; Mizukami2016CUB). CSMD3 is involved in the regulation of dendrite development in neurons, playing a critical role in dendritic branching and morphology. This function is primarily mediated by its extracellular region, suggesting that CSMD3 may act as a co-receptor for an unidentified membrane protein (Mizukami2016CUB).

In the brain, CSMD3 is highly expressed in the subplate during embryonic stages and ubiquitously in the postnatal cerebral cortex. It is also present in the cerebellum, particularly in the Purkinje cell layer, molecular layer, and granular layer (Xi2023CSMD3Deficiency). The protein is implicated in processes such as neuronal migration, dendrite growth, and synapse formation, and its dysfunction has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Xi2023CSMD3Deficiency; Floris2008Two).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CSMD3 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers. In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, CSMD3 is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability. Studies have identified heterozygous de novo and inherited missense variants in CSMD3 that correlate with these conditions. A mouse model with a homozygous frameshift mutation in Csmd3 exhibited increased deep cortical layer neurons, defects in dendrite arborization, and reduced synapse density, leading to growth retardation and abnormal behavior, suggesting a role in cortical development (Werren2024Biallelic).

In cancer, CSMD3 mutations are linked to increased tumor mutation burden and poor prognosis in ovarian cancer. Common mutations in CSMD3 have also been found in pulmonary carcinosarcomas and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), indicating its potential role in tumorigenesis (Ermis2022The). In colorectal cancer, reduced expression of CSMD3 is associated with tumor differentiation and lymphatic invasion, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Zhang2014Loss). These findings highlight the gene's significance in both neurodevelopmental and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
CSMD3 is a single-pass transmembrane protein characterized by a large extracellular domain and a short cytoplasmic domain. It contains CUB and Sushi domains, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. Studies have shown that CSMD3 can form homophilic oligomeric complexes, indicating that it can physically interact with itself. This was demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments where tagged versions of the protein, CSMD3WT-Myc and CSMD3WT-Venus, were expressed in COS-7 cells. The results showed that CSMD3WT-Myc co-precipitated with CSMD3WT-Venus, suggesting self-interaction (Mizukami2016CUB).

While CSMD3 is suggested to act as a coreceptor for unknown extracellular or transmembrane proteins, specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies (Xi2023CSMD3Deficiency; Mizukami2016CUB). The protein's role in dendrite development and its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders imply that it may participate in complex signaling pathways, but the exact nature of these interactions remains to be elucidated (Xi2023CSMD3Deficiency; Mizukami2016CUB).
