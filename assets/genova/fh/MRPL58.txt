# MRPL58

## Overview
MRPL58 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L58, a critical component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a vital role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins necessary for oxidative phosphorylation, a key process in cellular ATP production (Cheong2020Expression; Wang2015Retracted:). As a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, MRPL58 is involved in the assembly and stability of the mitochondrial ribosome and participates in RNA processing and ribosome rescue mechanisms (Xavier2021RNA; Fang2022Mammalian; Koc2013Identification). The protein is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, underscoring its essential role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Cheong2020Expression). Alterations in MRPL58 expression have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential involvement in tumorigenesis (Wang2014Ribosomal).

## Function
MRPL58, also known as mitochondrial ribosomal protein L58, is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. It plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a process critical for ATP production in cells (Cheong2020Expression; Wang2015Retracted:). MRPL58 is active within the mitochondria, contributing significantly to cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular function (Cheong2020Expression).

The protein is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues and developmental stages, indicating its indispensable role in mitochondrial function (Cheong2020Expression). Knockout studies in mice have shown that many mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, including MRPL58, are essential for early embryonic development, with their absence often resulting in embryonic lethality (Cheong2020Expression). This highlights the non-redundant and critical nature of MRPL58 in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function.

MRPL58 is also involved in the termination of translation within the mitochondria, functioning as a peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunits. It acts as a codon-independent translation release factor, aiding in the hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNAs that have been prematurely terminated and in the recycling of stalled mitochondrial ribosomes (Wang2015Retracted:).

## Clinical Significance
MRPL58, also known as ICT1, is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and cell viability. Alterations in the expression of MRPL58 have been observed in various cancers, including gliomas, breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, and osteosarcoma, suggesting its potential role in tumorigenesis (Wang2014Ribosomal). Knockdown of MRPL58 has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, decrease mitochondrial membrane potential and mass, and reduce cytochrome c oxidase activity, indicating its critical role in cell growth and mitochondrial function (Wang2014Ribosomal).

In developmental contexts, MRPL58 is crucial for early development, as knockout studies have shown that its absence results in preweaning lethality, highlighting its essential role during embryogenesis (Cheong2020Expression). Despite its importance, specific diseases directly linked to MRPL58 gene mutations or expression alterations are not detailed in the available literature. However, the gene's involvement in mitochondrial function suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to mitochondrial disorders or conditions characterized by impaired energy metabolism (Cheong2020Expression). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise clinical implications of MRPL58 mutations or expression changes.

## Interactions
MRPL58, also known as ICT1, is a component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (39S) and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It is consistently present in mitochondrial ribosomes under various conditions, indicating its stable association with the ribosomal complex (Koc2013Identification). MRPL58 is involved in the assembly and stability of the mitochondrial ribosome, as its levels are affected by the silencing of proteins like MPV17L2 and C7orf30, which are essential for ribosome assembly (Dalla2014MPV17L2).

MRPL58 also participates in interactions related to mitochondrial RNA processing. It is part of the RNA processing module within mitochondrial RNA granules (MRGs), suggesting a role in RNA processing and maturation (Xavier2021RNA). Additionally, MRPL58 has been implicated in ribosome rescue mechanisms, potentially recognizing vacant A sites in ribosomes translating truncated mRNA, which may help in rescuing stalled ribosomes (Fang2022Mammalian).

These interactions highlight MRPL58's multifaceted role in maintaining mitochondrial function, particularly in protein synthesis and RNA processing, which are essential for mitochondrial energy production and overall cellular function.
