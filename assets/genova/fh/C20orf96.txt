# C20orf96

## Overview
C20orf96 is a gene located on chromosome 20 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 20 open reading frame 96. While the precise biological function of this protein remains to be fully elucidated, emerging research suggests its involvement in various cellular processes. Notably, C20orf96 has been implicated in stress response mechanisms, particularly in muscle tissue, where it interacts with TNNT3 under heat stress conditions (Videla2024Robust). Additionally, potential interactions with Aprataxin, a protein associated with DNA repair, hint at a role in genomic maintenance (Videla2024Robust). The gene has also been identified as significantly downregulated in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), suggesting a possible involvement in the disease's pathology (Adeyanju2024Exploring). Further research is necessary to clarify the functional roles and clinical significance of C20orf96 and its encoded protein.

## Interactions
C20orf96, a gene located on chromosome 20, encodes a protein whose interactions are not extensively characterized. However, some studies have begun to elucidate its potential interactions. In chickens, C20orf96 has been identified to interact with TNNT3, a gene involved in muscle contraction, under conditions of heat stress. This interaction was identified using Bayesian networks, which suggest a role in maintaining cellular function during stress, although C20orf96 does not interact with heat shock proteins in this context (Videla2024Robust).

The STRING database, a comprehensive resource for protein-protein interactions, indicates a potential interaction between C20orf96 and Aprataxin (APTX), a protein involved in DNA repair. This suggests that C20orf96 may have a role in genomic maintenance or response to DNA damage, although the specific nature of this interaction remains to be fully explored (Videla2024Robust).

In the context of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), C20orf96 was identified as one of the top downregulated genes in a meta-analysis of RNA-seq data. However, specific interactions of C20orf96 in this disease context were not detailed, indicating a need for further research to understand its role and interactions in COPD pathology (Adeyanju2024Exploring).
