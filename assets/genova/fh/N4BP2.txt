# N4BP2

## Overview
N4BP2 (NEDD4 binding protein 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including mRNA quality control and DNA repair. The protein, NEDD4 binding protein 2, functions as an endonuclease within the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway, playing a vital role in the degradation of stalled mRNAs to maintain cellular homeostasis (NicholsonShaw2022The; Wolin2019Cellular). Additionally, N4BP2 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-1, suggesting its involvement in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation pathways (Huang2019The). This protein is active in the cytoplasm and contributes to cellular stress responses and protein turnover. Furthermore, N4BP2 is implicated in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks, underscoring its importance in genomic stability (AtteneRamos2010Comparative). The gene has been associated with various clinical conditions, including nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, highlighting its potential role in disease etiology (Bei2012Familial; Leslie2017Association).

## Structure


## Function
N4BP2 (NEDD4 binding protein 2) plays a significant role in the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway in human cells, which is crucial for maintaining mRNA quality during translation. It acts as an endonuclease, similar to Cue2/NONU-1 in other species, and is involved in the degradation of mRNAs that are stalled during translation. This function is essential for the proper turnover of defective mRNAs, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (NicholsonShaw2022The; Wolin2019Cellular).

N4BP2 is also implicated in the ubiquitination process, interacting with NEDD4-1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This interaction suggests that N4BP2 undergoes proteasomal degradation, as its levels increase with proteasome inhibition (Huang2019The). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and may influence cellular responses to stress and protein turnover, contributing to the regulation of cell growth and signaling pathways (Huang2019The).

In addition to its role in mRNA quality control, N4BP2 is involved in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks, which is critical for maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutations (AtteneRamos2010Comparative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the N4BP2 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P), low-frequency coding variants in N4BP2 have been identified as significantly associated with an increased risk of this condition, particularly in the Latin American population. These variants were found at higher frequencies in affected individuals compared to controls, suggesting a potential role in the genetic etiology of NSCL/P (Leslie2017Association).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), specific rare haplotypes of N4BP2 have shown significant differences between case and control groups in southern Chinese populations, indicating that certain mutations in N4BP2 may influence the risk of developing NPC (Bei2012Familial).

N4BP2 is also involved in protein ubiquitination processes, interacting with the Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase. It undergoes polyubiquitylation, which suggests its potential role in protein degradation pathways. Although the clinical significance of these interactions is not fully established, they may have implications for diseases related to protein degradation (Murillas2002Identification). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of N4BP2 mutations and interactions.
