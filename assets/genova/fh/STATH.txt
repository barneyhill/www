# STATH

## Overview
The STATH gene encodes the protein statherin, a small, multifunctional salivary protein that plays a critical role in oral health. Statherin is categorized as a salivary protein and is primarily involved in the regulation of mineral homeostasis within the oral cavity. It is characterized by a unique structure that includes a high concentration of negatively charged amino acids, which facilitate its binding to hydroxyapatite surfaces, thereby inhibiting the precipitation and growth of calcium phosphate crystals (Schlesinger1977Complete; Raj1992Salivary). This function is essential for preventing unwanted mineralization on dental surfaces. Additionally, statherin is a key component of the acquired enamel pellicle, where it interacts with other salivary proteins to form a protective barrier on teeth (Messana2023The). Through its interactions and structural properties, statherin contributes significantly to maintaining the integrity and health of the oral environment (Helmerhorst2010Mass).

## Structure
Statherin is a salivary protein encoded by the STATH gene, consisting of 43 amino acid residues. Its primary structure is characterized by a high concentration of negatively charged amino acids, such as aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and phosphoserine, predominantly located in the N-terminal region. The C-terminal region is more hydrophobic, containing residues like glutamine, proline, and tyrosine (Schlesinger1977Complete; Raj1992Salivary).

The secondary structure of statherin includes an ordered helical conformation, particularly in the N-terminal region, which is stabilized by electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. This helical structure is crucial for its function in inhibiting mineralization and binding to hydroxyapatite (HAP) surfaces (Raj1992Salivary).

Statherin does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. It undergoes post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation at serine residues, which is essential for its biological activity (Inzitari2006Detection; Raj1992Salivary). Different isoforms of statherin, such as SV1, SV2, and SV3, have been identified, resulting from alternative splicing and post-translational modifications (Messana2023The).

## Interactions
Statherin (STATH) is known to participate in several interactions within the oral cavity, contributing to its role in maintaining oral health. It interacts with calcium phosphate minerals, inhibiting their precipitation and crystal growth, which is crucial for dental health (Schwartz1992Inhibition; Schlesinger1977Complete). Statherin also forms part of the acquired enamel pellicle, a protective protein layer on teeth, where it interacts with other salivary proteins such as acidic-proline-rich proteins and mucins. These interactions are facilitated by the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2), which catalyzes cross-linking reactions involving statherin, contributing to the structural integrity of the pellicle (Messana2023The).

Statherin is also involved in protein-protein interactions within the salivary protein network. It has been identified as a first shell interactor of histatin 1, indicating its involvement in complex protein networks in saliva (Crosara2018Merging). These interactions are essential for the formation and function of the protective pellicle, as well as for the regulation of mineral homeostasis and bacterial colonization in the oral cavity (Messana2023The; Helmerhorst2010Mass).
