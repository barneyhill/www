# FOXRED2

## Overview
FOXRED2 is a gene that encodes the protein FAD-dependent oxidoreductase domain containing 2, which is categorized as an oxidoreductase. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a significant role in cellular redox reactions and protein homeostasis. It is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it contributes to the regulation of proteasome activity and the degradation of misfolded proteins. FOXRED2 is also implicated in the reductive activation of hypoxia-targeting prodrugs, particularly in tumor cells, highlighting its potential role in cancer therapy. The gene's expression levels have been associated with various clinical outcomes, particularly in cancer, where it may influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Sun2021Identification; Shim2010Amyloid; Hunter2014The).

## Function
FOXRED2 is a protein that contains a FAD-dependent oxidoreductase domain, which is crucial for its role in cellular redox reactions. This domain is located at the N-terminus of the protein and is involved in inhibiting proteasome activity, leading to the accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugates. This suggests that FOXRED2 plays a role in regulating protein degradation and maintaining protein homeostasis within cells (Shim2010Amyloid).

FOXRED2 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein that participates in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is responsible for the elimination of misfolded proteins. It affects proteasome assembly by relocalizing proteasome subunits, thereby modulating proteasome activity in the microsomal fraction of cells (Shim2010Amyloid). This modulation is particularly significant in the context of stress responses, such as those induced by amyloid β, where FOXRED2 expression is upregulated, leading to proteasome inhibition and ER stress (Shim2010Amyloid).

In addition to its role in protein degradation, FOXRED2 is involved in the reductive activation of hypoxia-targeting prodrugs, such as nitro-chloromethylbenzindolines, under hypoxic conditions. This activity is significant in tumor cells, where FOXRED2 expression is associated with the activation of these prodrugs, contributing to their cytotoxic effects (Hunter2014The).

## Clinical Significance
FOXRED2 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In cervical cancer, FOXRED2 is one of the two genes identified with significant expression differences between cancerous and normal tissues. Its expression is lower in normal tissues compared to cancerous ones, and low expression of FOXRED2 is associated with poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients (Sun2021Identification). The study also found correlations between FOXRED2 expression and immune cell infiltration, although no strong correlation was established (Sun2021Identification).

In the context of genetic studies in mice, FOXRED2 was considered a potential candidate gene influencing myeloid-derived cell subpopulations. However, no significant differential expression was observed, suggesting it may not play a major role in the phenotypic differences studied (Krayem2022Genetic).

Additionally, FOXRED2 has been linked to the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in various cancers. Impairment of the FOXRED2 gene showed a strong correlation with the knockout of SUZ12, a core subunit of PRC2, indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression through interactions with PRC2 components (Erokhin2021Clinical).

## Interactions
FOXRED2, also known as ERFAD, is involved in several interactions within the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It interacts with ERAD luminal factors such as OS-9 and ERdj5, as well as the ER membrane protein SEL1L, which are crucial for the substrate recognition step in ERAD (Patel2020Oxidoreductases). These interactions facilitate the association of FOXRED2 with misfolded proteins, playing a role in their processing and degradation.

FOXRED2 is also implicated in the inhibition of proteasome activity, which is linked to its role in mediating amyloid β-induced neuronal cell death. Although specific physical interactions with proteasome components are not detailed, FOXRED2's overexpression is known to interfere with proteasome assembly and activity, particularly in the microsomal fraction of cells (Shim2010Amyloid). This suggests indirect interactions with proteasome subunits, affecting their localization and function.

In the context of hypoxia-targeting prodrugs, FOXRED2 has been identified as a nitro-chloromethylbenzindoline (nitroCBI) activating flavoprotein. It is capable of reducing exogenous substrates, indicating its potential role in tumor cell adaptation to hypoxia through interactions with these prodrugs (Hunter2014The). However, specific protein or nucleic acid interaction partners in this context are not explicitly mentioned.
