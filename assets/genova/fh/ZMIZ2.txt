# ZMIZ2

## Overview
ZMIZ2, or zinc finger MIZ-type containing 2, is a gene that encodes a transcriptional coactivator protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways, most notably the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The ZMIZ2 protein, also referred to as ZIMP7, is characterized by its zinc finger MIZ-type domain, which facilitates its role as a transcriptional coactivator. It enhances the transcriptional activity of nuclear hormone receptors and other transcription factors by interacting with key proteins such as β-catenin and TCF transcription factors. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of genes involved in cell growth and proliferation, such as cyclin D1 and Axin2. ZMIZ2's activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it modulates transcriptional processes essential for cellular function and development. Despite its significant role in cellular signaling, the deletion of ZMIZ2 in model organisms like mice does not result in major developmental defects, indicating potential compensatory mechanisms by other proteins (Lee2013Identification).

## Function
ZMIZ2, also known as ZIMP7, is a transcriptional coactivator that plays a significant role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It enhances β-catenin-mediated transcription by interacting with β-catenin and TCF transcription factors, such as TCF1 and TCF4, leading to increased transcriptional activity of downstream target genes like cyclin D1, Axin2, CD44, and c-Jun (Lee2013Identification). ZMIZ2 contains a strong intrinsic transactivation domain that boosts the transcriptional activity of nuclear hormone receptors and other transcription factors (Lee2013Identification).

In cellular biology, ZMIZ2 is involved in promoting cell growth and proliferation. It is active in the nucleus, where it modulates transcriptional activity, impacting cellular functions and contributing to organismal development and homeostasis (Lee2013Identification). The protein's interaction with β-catenin is particularly pronounced with β-catenin containing full armadillo repeats, indicating a specific mechanism by which ZMIZ2 enhances the expression of β-catenin target genes (Lee2013Identification). Despite its significant role, deletion of ZMIZ2 in mice does not result in major developmental defects, suggesting compensatory mechanisms by other coregulators (Lee2013Identification).

## Clinical Significance
ZMIZ2 is implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZMIZ2 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes cancer progression by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway through interaction with LEF1. High ZMIZ2 expression correlates with increased TP53 mutation rates, further worsening patient outcomes (Ding2024ZMIZ2).

In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ZMIZ2 acts as an oncoprotein, enhancing the activity of NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1). This interaction influences the Wnt and Hippo signaling pathways, promoting tumor growth and metastasis. ZMIZ2 is highly expressed in NSCLC tissues, correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor survival (Gan2024Identification).

ZMIZ2 is also upregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where it negatively correlates with androgen receptor expression. Its high expression is linked to poor prognosis, and its knockdown inhibits cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. ZMIZ2's involvement in immune-related pathways and DNA replication suggests its role in TNBC progression (Zou2022ZMIZ2).

In cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC), ZMIZ2 is identified as a proto-oncogene, with mutations or amplifications present in a significant portion of cuSCC genomes. These alterations may cooperate with mutations in chromatin-remodeling genes, contributing to tumor progression (Aiderus2019Transposon).

## Interactions
ZMIZ2, also known as zinc finger MIZ-type containing 2, is a transcriptional coactivator that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in several signaling pathways. It interacts with β-catenin, a key regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, enhancing β-catenin-mediated transcription and cell growth. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and protein pulldown assays, and ZMIZ2 is recruited to the promoter region of β-catenin downstream targets like the Axin 2 gene (Lee2013Identification).

ZMIZ2 also interacts with SIRT1, a deacetylase, enhancing its activity. This interaction is crucial for the deacetylation of β-catenin and YAP, components of the Wnt and Hippo signaling pathways, respectively. The interaction between ZMIZ2 and SIRT1 facilitates the formation of β-catenin-TCF4 and YAP-TEAD complexes, promoting transcriptional activity and contributing to cancer progression (Han2023Identification).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, ZMIZ2 interacts with LEF1, a transcription factor, activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. This interaction is validated through immunoprecipitation assays and is associated with poor clinical outcomes (Ding2024ZMIZ2). ZMIZ2 also interacts with USP7, a deubiquitinating enzyme, to stabilize β-catenin in colorectal cancer, enhancing its oncogenic activity (Zhu2019LINC00265).
