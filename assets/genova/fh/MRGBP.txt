# MRGBP

## Overview
MRGBP (MORF4-related gene-binding protein) is a gene that encodes the MRG domain binding protein, a crucial component of several chromatin-modifying complexes, including the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex. This protein plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, impacting processes such as DNA repair and gene expression. MRG domain binding protein is involved in the regulation of DNA double-strand break repair, favoring non-homologous end joining over homologous recombination, and is a part of the TINTIN complex, which influences transcription elongation and mRNA processing. The protein's interactions with other components, such as BRD8 and TIP60, underscore its importance in cellular proliferation and cancer progression. Alterations in MRGBP expression have been linked to various cancers, where it serves as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target due to its role in tumor growth and immune evasion (Devoucoux2021MRG; Chai2021Prognostic; Rivero2021MRGBP).

## Function
MRGBP (MRG domain binding protein) is a component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, which plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation in healthy human cells. This protein is involved in the regulation of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway choice, favoring non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) over homologous recombination (HR) by inhibiting DNA-end resection, a process essential for HR (Rivero2021MRGBP). MRGBP acts as a general suppressor of DSB repair, with its depletion leading to increased recruitment of DNA repair proteins such as 53BP1 and BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage (Rivero2021MRGBP).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, MRGBP is part of the TINTIN complex, which is involved in transcription regulation by modulating the expression of specific genes. This complex operates independently of the NuA4/TIP60 complex and is implicated in transcription elongation and mRNA processing (Devoucoux2021MRG). MRGBP's involvement in these complexes highlights its significant role in chromatin-based nuclear processes, influencing gene expression and maintaining genomic stability (Devoucoux2021MRG).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MORF4-related gene-binding protein (MRGBP) have been implicated in various cancers. High MRGBP expression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including adrenocortical carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma, among others (Chai2021Prognostic). In colorectal cancer, MRGBP is frequently upregulated, promoting cancer cell proliferation by regulating the cell cycle. Its knockdown reduces cancer cell viability, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yamaguchi2010C20orf20).

MRGBP is also linked to immune evasion in tumors. Its expression is generally negatively associated with immune-related genes across multiple tumor types, indicating a potential interaction with immune checkpoints (Chai2021Prognostic). High MRGBP expression correlates with increased tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, suggesting a role in DNA repair processes and potential responsiveness to immunotherapy (Chai2021Prognostic).

In lower grade glioma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma, high MRGBP levels are associated with poor survival outcomes and altered immune cell infiltration, further highlighting its role in cancer progression and immune interaction (Chai2021Prognostic). These findings underscore MRGBP's significance as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in oncology.

## Interactions
MRGBP, also known as MRG domain binding protein, is involved in various protein interactions and complexes. It is a subunit of the TRRAP/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex and interacts with BRD8, a bromodomain-containing protein. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization and accumulation of BRD8, which is important for cell proliferation in colorectal cancer (Yamaguchi2010C20orf20). MRGBP interacts with BRD8 through its C-terminal region, and this interaction has been confirmed in both COS7 and SW480 cells (Yamaguchi2010C20orf20).

MRGBP is also a component of the NuA4 complex, where it plays a role in DNA double-strand break repair. It interacts with TIP60, a histone acetyltransferase, and is involved in modulating the activity of the NuA4 complex, influencing DNA repair pathway choices (Rivero2021MRGBP). In prostate cancer cells, MRGBP facilitates the recruitment of the TIP60 complex to androgen receptor (AR) target genes, promoting histone acetylation and enhancing AR-mediated transcription (Ito2018MRGBP). These interactions highlight MRGBP's role in transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling.
