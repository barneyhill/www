# CCDC74B

## Overview
CCDC74B is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 74B protein, which is primarily involved in the organization and stabilization of spindle microtubules during mitosis. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for microtubule binding and spindle assembly. CCDC74B plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of mitotic spindles, particularly K-fibers, which are crucial for accurate chromosomal alignment and segregation during cell division (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). The protein's ability to form homodimers is vital for its function in microtubule bundling and stabilization. Beyond its structural role, CCDC74B is implicated in various cellular processes, including protein degradation and modification pathways, and has been associated with clinical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and breast cancer, where it serves as a potential prognostic marker (Xu2022Immune; Banaganapalli2022Integrative).

## Structure
The CCDC74B protein is characterized by coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. These domains typically form alpha-helical structures, facilitating the protein's role in microtubule binding and spindle assembly (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). CCDC74B contains two distinct microtubule-binding regions located at amino acid positions 79-98 and 260-314, which are crucial for its interaction with microtubules (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). These regions are rich in positively charged amino acids that interact with the negatively charged C-terminal tail of tubulin dimers (Zhou2019CCDC74AB).

The protein exhibits self-association activity, forming homodimers that are essential for its function in microtubule bundling and stabilization (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). Specific amino acid sequences, such as VVL, LL, LF, MLAL, IL, and LLL, are involved in this self-association, and mutations in these regions can impair dimerization (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). The self-association is independent of microtubule-binding activity but is necessary for effective microtubule bundling (Zhou2019CCDC74AB).

While the protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, detailed information on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as specific domains beyond the coiled-coil, prominent folds, or splice variant isoforms, is not provided in the available context (Rashka2020Analysis; Huttlin2015The).

## Function
CCDC74B is a protein that plays a critical role in spindle microtubule organization during mitosis in human cells. It is involved in the stabilization and integrity of mitotic spindles, particularly K-fibers, which are essential for accurate chromosomal alignment and segregation during cell division (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). CCDC74B binds to microtubules through two distinct regions, facilitating microtubule bundling and stabilization. This activity is crucial for maintaining spindle integrity and ensuring proper chromosome alignment (Zhou2019CCDC74AB).

The protein's ability to bundle microtubules is dependent on its self-association, which allows it to form oligomers or dimers, providing multiple microtubule-binding sites (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). CCDC74B is localized to spindles and central spindles during mitosis, and its depletion leads to defects such as shorter spindles, decreased microtubule fluorescence intensity, and increased spindle misorientation (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). These defects can be rescued by the introduction of siRNA-resistant CCDC74B, highlighting its essential role in spindle architecture and chromosomal alignment (Zhou2019CCDC74AB).

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC74B gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in protein degradation and modification processes. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), CCDC74B is part of a gene cluster enriched in the proteasome pathway, which is crucial for degrading unneeded proteins. Impairment of this pathway, such as through cigarette smoke exposure, can lead to reduced antigen presentation and prolonged lung infections, contributing to COPD pathogenesis (Banaganapalli2022Integrative). The gene is also associated with lung function traits and lung cancer, as COPD is a significant risk factor for lung cancer, and both conditions share common pathways like immune dysfunction (Banaganapalli2022Integrative).

In breast cancer, CCDC74B has been identified as a prognostic marker. It is involved in maintaining spindle integrity during cell division, which is crucial for proper chromosome alignment. Alterations in its expression are associated with the prognosis of breast cancer patients, indicating its potential as an independent prognostic factor (Xu2022Immune).

Additionally, CCDC74B has been noted in the context of non-obstructive azoospermia, where it is up-regulated in affected cases, suggesting a role in the regulatory networks of this condition (Karoii2024Whole).

## Interactions
CCDC74B is primarily known for its role in microtubule stabilization and spindle assembly during cell division. It exhibits self-association activity, forming homodimers that are crucial for its function in microtubule bundling and stabilization, particularly in the context of K-fibers, which are essential for chromosomal alignment (Zhou2019CCDC74AB). The protein binds to microtubules through two specific regions, facilitating its role in maintaining spindle integrity (Zhou2019CCDC74AB).

While CCDC74B's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not explicitly detailed, it has been suggested to cluster with the proteasome complex in the BioPlex network, indicating potential, yet unspecified, interactions with proteasome-related proteins (Huttlin2015The). Additionally, CCDC74B is associated with protein deubiquitination pathways, suggesting a role in protein modification processes, although specific physical interactions in these pathways are not described (Banaganapalli2022Integrative).

Overall, CCDC74B's primary interactions involve its self-association and binding to microtubules, with potential indirect associations with other protein complexes suggested by network analyses.
