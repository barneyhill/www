# SEPTIN11

## Overview
SEPTIN11 is a gene that encodes the protein septin 11, a member of the septin family of cytoskeletal GTP-binding proteins. Septins are involved in various cellular processes, including cell division, cytoskeletal organization, and membrane dynamics. The SEPTIN11 gene is characterized by a conserved GTPase domain, which is essential for the protein's role in filament formation and cellular processes (Dolat2013Septin). Septin 11 interacts with other septins, such as SEPT2 and SEPT9, to form heteromeric complexes that contribute to the structural organization within cells (Nagata2004Biochemical). This protein is particularly significant in adipocytes, where it plays a role in lipid metabolism and insulin signaling (MorenoCastellanos2016The). Additionally, SEPTIN11 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health (MorenoCastellanos2016The; Gozal2011Aberrant).

## Structure
SEPTIN11 is a member of the septin family of cytoskeletal GTP-binding proteins. The primary structure of SEPTIN11 includes a conserved GTPase domain, which is characteristic of septins and essential for their function in filament formation and cellular processes (Dolat2013Septin). SEPTIN11 consists of three main domains: the N-terminal extension (NTE), the GTP-binding domain, and the coiled-coil domain (CCD) (Fu2023Septin11). The GTP-binding domain is crucial for the protein's role in cytoskeletal reorganization and cell motility, as it facilitates interactions with other proteins and signaling pathways (Fu2023Septin11).

In terms of secondary and tertiary structure, SEPTIN11 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which fold into a three-dimensional shape typical of GTP-binding proteins. The coiled-coil domain is important for septin-septin interactions and the formation of higher-order structures (Gozal2011Aberrant). SEPTIN11 forms heteromeric complexes with other septins, such as SEPT2 and SEPT9, which can assemble into filamentous structures (MorenoCastellanos2016The).

Common post-translational modifications of SEPTIN11 include phosphorylation, which can regulate its interactions and functions within the cell (Fu2023Septin11).

## Function
SEPTIN11 is a member of the septin family of cytoskeletal proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism, insulin signaling, and cytoskeletal organization. In adipocytes, SEPTIN11 is primarily expressed and plays a significant role in lipid storage and metabolism. It is associated with caveolae, structures involved in cellular signaling, and interacts with caveolin-1 (CAV1) and fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5), which are crucial for lipid droplet surface association during lipid loading (MorenoCastellanos2016The). SEPTIN11 is also involved in insulin signaling, as its silencing impairs insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, indicating its role in maintaining normal insulin signaling pathways (MorenoCastellanos2016The).

SEPTIN11 forms complexes with other septins, such as SEPT2 and SEPT9, which are important for its function in structural organization within cells (Nagata2004Biochemical). These complexes are involved in the formation of filamentous structures that contribute to the maintenance of cell shape and membrane dynamics (Nagata2004Biochemical). SEPTIN11's role in these processes is essential for healthy cellular function and organismal development, as evidenced by its critical involvement in embryogenesis (Dolat2013Septin).

## Clinical Significance
SEPTIN11 has been implicated in several neurodegenerative and metabolic conditions due to its altered expression and interactions. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, SEPTIN11 is associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U). Studies have shown that SEPTIN11 is significantly enriched in FTLD-U cases, with a consistent increase in its expression compared to controls. This enrichment is specific to FTLD-U and not observed in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a distinct role in FTLD-U pathology (Gozal2011Aberrant). SEPTIN11 forms fibrillar thread-like structures in the frontal cortex of FTLD-U patients, which are hypothesized to disrupt cytoskeletal functions and contribute to cellular toxicity (Marttinen2015Synaptic). These structures are absent in control cases, indicating a disease-specific signature (Gozal2011Aberrant).

In metabolic conditions, SEPTIN11 is associated with obesity. It is expressed at higher levels in the adipose tissue of obese individuals compared to lean individuals. SEPTIN11 is involved in adipocyte lipid storage and metabolism, and its expression is regulated by metabolic stimuli such as insulin. Alterations in SEPTIN11 expression may impact insulin signaling and lipid accumulation, potentially linking it to obesity-related metabolic conditions (MorenoCastellanos2016The).

## Interactions
SEPTIN11 is known to interact with various proteins, forming complexes that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with other septins, such as SEPT7 and SEPT9b, forming complexes both in vivo and in vitro. These interactions are crucial for the structural dynamics of septin filaments, with SEPT11 affecting filament length and structure when co-expressed with SEPT7 and SEPT9b (Nagata2004Biochemical). SEPTIN11 also interacts with cytoskeletal components, such as actin filaments and microtubules, and is involved in maintaining cytoskeletal integrity (Gozal2011Aberrant).

In the context of neurodegenerative disorders, SEPTIN11 is implicated in forming multi-septin complexes that may contribute to disease pathology by disrupting cytoskeletal function (Gozal2011Aberrant). In adipocytes, SEPTIN11 interacts with SEPT2 and SEPT9, forming heteroligomeric complexes that influence its structural conformation and function. It also interacts with caveolin-1 (CAV1) and fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5), playing a role in insulin signaling and lipid storage (MorenoCastellanos2016The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, SEPTIN11 interacts with RhoA, a small GTPase, promoting cell motility by activating the RhoA/ROCK1/LIMK/cofilin pathway, which is crucial for actin reorganization and cell migration (Fu2023Septin11).
