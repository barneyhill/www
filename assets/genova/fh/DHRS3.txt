# DHRS3

## Overview
The DHRS3 gene encodes the enzyme dehydrogenase/reductase 3, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of retinoids and steroids, playing a critical role in the reduction of retinaldehyde to retinol, a precursor in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid (Hiyama2022In; Sumei2021Hypermethylation). Dehydrogenase/reductase 3 is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, including the liver, pancreas, heart, kidney, and lung, and is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum (Hiyama2022In). Its functions are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, influencing processes such as cell differentiation and proliferation, and supporting normal physiological functions (Hiyama2022In). Additionally, DHRS3 is implicated in lipid metabolism, contributing to lipid droplet formation and accumulation (Hiyama2022In). Alterations in DHRS3 expression have been associated with several diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker in conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and triple-negative breast cancer (Li2022Identification; Lou2021Inhibition).

## Function
The DHRS3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, which is involved in the oxidation/reduction of a wide range of substrates, including retinoids and steroids (Sumei2021Hypermethylation). In healthy human cells, DHRS3 plays a crucial role in maintaining local retinol storage, which is essential for the production of active vitamin A metabolites. These metabolites are important for regulating gene expression, cell differentiation, and embryonic development (Sumei2021Hypermethylation).

DHRS3 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the liver, pancreas, heart, kidney, and lung, indicating its involvement in multiple physiological processes (Hiyama2022In). The protein is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it participates in the reduction of retinaldehyde to retinol, a key step in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid (Hiyama2022In). This activity is crucial for the regulation of cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (Hiyama2022In).

In addition to its role in retinoid metabolism, DHRS3 is involved in lipid metabolism, as evidenced by its association with lipid droplet formation and accumulation in certain cell types (Hiyama2022In). The protein's function in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting normal physiological functions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DHRS3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In ALS, DHRS3 expression is upregulated in the spinal cord of SOD1 G93A mice, a model for the disease. This upregulation is associated with the progression of ALS and may contribute to the disease by reducing the synthesis of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which is crucial for retinoic acid signaling. Insufficient ATRA synthesis is hypothesized to exacerbate ALS progression, suggesting that DHRS3 could be a potential target for ALS treatment (Li2022Identification).

In TNBC, DHRS3 is targeted by miR-3074-5p, which is induced by a hypo-phosphorylated mutant of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARαS77A). This interaction leads to the inhibition of TNBC cell proliferation. DHRS3 expression is negatively correlated with TNBC patients' overall survival, indicating a potential oncogenic role. The study suggests that DHRS3 may serve as a diagnostic or prognostic marker and a therapeutic target in TNBC (Lou2021Inhibition).

In cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), DHRS3 levels decrease following chronic UVB exposure, which may contribute to reduced retinoic acid synthesis and increased tumor proliferation (Everts2021Retinoids).
