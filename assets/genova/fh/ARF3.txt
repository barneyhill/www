# ARF3

## Overview
ARF3, or ADP ribosylation factor 3, is a gene that encodes a small GTP-binding protein belonging to the ARF family, which plays a pivotal role in cellular membrane trafficking and vesicular transport. The protein product of ARF3 is involved in the regulation of the secretory pathway, particularly within the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the budding and formation of vesicles. As a molecular switch, ARF3 cycles between active and inactive states, which is essential for its function in recruiting adaptor proteins and inducing changes in lipid metabolism necessary for vesicle trafficking. The protein's interactions with other ARF family members and various adaptor proteins underscore its importance in maintaining Golgi structure and function. Mutations in the ARF3 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its critical role in cellular processes and development (Kahn2005Arf; Fasano2022Dominant; Donaldson2011ARF).

## Function
ARF3 (ADP ribosylation factor 3) is a small GTP-binding protein involved in regulating membrane traffic and vesicular transport within cells. It plays a significant role in the secretory pathway, particularly in the Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in the budding and formation of vesicles. ARF3 specifically localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and its localization is dependent on specific amino acids in its N-terminal amphipathic helix (Li2022ADPRibosylation; Donaldson2011ARF). 

ARF3 functions as a molecular switch, cycling between active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) states, which is crucial for its role in membrane recruitment and vesicle formation (Li2022ADPRibosylation). It is involved in recruiting adaptor proteins or complexes to membranes and inducing localized changes in lipid metabolism, which are essential for vesicle trafficking in the endocytic and exocytic pathways (Kahn2005Arf). 

ARF3, in combination with other ARF proteins like ARF1, is required for traffic from the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment to the cis-Golgi and for retrograde traffic from vesicular-tubular clusters (VTCs) back to the ER, indicating its role in maintaining Golgi structure and facilitating specific trafficking pathways (VolpicelliDaley2005Isoformselective).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARF3 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily characterized by microcephaly, a condition where the head size is significantly smaller than normal due to impaired brain development. These disorders are classified under 'Golgipathies,' which are linked to disruptions in Golgi apparatus integrity, crucial for proper cellular function and development (Fasano2022Dominant; Fasano2021Dominantly). Specific ARF3 mutations, such as p.K127E, p.L12V/D67V, and p.D93N, lead to fragmented Golgi structures and are associated with early-onset microcephaly and severe skeletal defects (Fasano2022Dominant).

The mutations affect the protein's ability to bind GTP and GDP, which are essential for its activation. For instance, the p.Asp67Val variant disrupts the interaction with magnesium ions necessary for nucleotide binding, leading to decreased ARF3 activation and potential degradation due to instability (Sakamoto2021De). These structural changes in ARF3 are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, as the gene's normal function is crucial for cellular processes (Sakamoto2021De).

In zebrafish models, these mutations result in developmental abnormalities, including reduced brain volume and defects in the anterior commissure, correlating with the severity of the phenotype in human subjects (Fasano2022Dominant). The findings suggest that ARF3 mutations disrupt neurogenesis by affecting the balance between cell mitosis and cell death, contributing to the observed neurodevelopmental disorders (Fasano2022Dominant).

## Interactions
ARF3, a member of the ADP-ribosylation factor family, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its role in vesicular trafficking and membrane dynamics. ARF3 interacts with the adaptor protein complex AP-4, influencing its localization to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This interaction is regulated by ARF1 and ARF3, with mutations in these proteins leading to the redistribution of AP-4 to the cytosol (Boehm2001Functional). 

ARF3 also interacts with GGA proteins through the GGAH domain, which binds to GTP-bound ARFs, including ARF3. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of GGA proteins to the Golgi membranes, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays (TAKATSU2002GGA). 

In the context of Golgi membrane interactions, ARF3, along with ARF1 and ARF5, associates with rat brain Golgi membranes in a GTP-dependent manner. This interaction is distinct from ARF1 and ARF5, as ARF3 shows a more even distribution among membrane fractions (Tsai1992Differential). 

These interactions highlight ARF3's role in membrane trafficking and its involvement in the regulation of protein transport within the Golgi apparatus.
