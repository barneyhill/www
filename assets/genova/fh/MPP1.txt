# MPP1

## Overview
MPP1, or membrane protein palmitoylated 1, is a gene that encodes the MAGUK p55 scaffold protein 1, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a PDZ domain, an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a guanylate kinase (GuK) domain, which collectively facilitate its role as a scaffolding protein at the plasma membrane (Biernatowska2017MPP1). MAGUK p55 scaffold protein 1 is integral to the organization of multi-protein complexes, particularly in erythroid cells, where it interacts with flotillin proteins to form membrane raft domains essential for membrane stability and signal transduction (Biernatowska2021Molecular). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation, which are crucial for its function in maintaining membrane order and organization (Biernatowska2013The). MPP1's interactions and modifications are vital for various cellular processes, including maintaining cell polarity and participating in signaling pathways, with implications in clinical conditions such as hereditary elliptocytosis and acute myeloid leukemia (Trybus2019MPP1based; Chytła2020Not).

## Structure
MPP1 (MAGUK p55 scaffold protein 1) is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, characterized by a core structural module composed of a PDZ domain, an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a catalytically inactive guanylate kinase (GuK) domain, arranged sequentially into a PDZ-SH3-GuK tandem (Biernatowska2017MPP1). This structure facilitates its role as a scaffolding protein, organizing multi-protein complexes at the plasma membrane (Biernatowska2021Molecular).

The protein also contains a D5 domain, which is crucial for its interaction with flotillins, specifically flotillin 1 and flotillin 2, in erythrocyte membranes. This interaction is essential for the formation of raft domains, which are important for membrane stability and signal transduction (Biernatowska2021Molecular). The D5 domain includes a specific 'flotillin binding motif' that is vital for high-affinity binding to flotillins (Biernatowska2021Molecular).

MPP1 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation, which is important for its role in maintaining membrane order and organization in erythroid cells (Biernatowska2013The). This modification affects the protein's localization and function within the membrane, influencing signal transduction pathways (Biernatowska2013The).

## Function
MPP1 (MAGUK p55 scaffold protein 1) is a crucial component in the organization and function of plasma membranes, particularly in erythroid cells. It plays a significant role in maintaining the structural heterogeneity of the plasma membrane by organizing molecules into complexes. MPP1 interacts with flotillin proteins, which are involved in the formation of membrane raft domains, to modulate the plasma membrane's lateral organization (Biernatowska2017MPP1; Biernatowska2022MPP1). These interactions are essential for the clustering of precursor nano-assemblies into raft domains, which are critical for maintaining the mechanical properties and fluidity of the membrane (Biernatowska2017MPP1).

MPP1 also influences the physicochemical properties of the plasma membrane, affecting raft formation and membrane compartmentalization. It regulates the mobility and confinement of raft-associated molecules, such as sphingomyelin and Thy-1, by forming high-affinity complexes with flotillins, which are crucial for the stability and organization of raft nanodomains (Biernatowska2022MPP1). The palmitoylation of MPP1 is vital for its function, as it enhances the protein's affinity for raft domains, contributing to the proper organization and stability of the membrane (Łach2012Palmitoylation). These molecular processes are essential for various cellular functions, including signaling pathways and maintaining cell polarity (Quinn2009Erythrocyte).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the MPP1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In erythrocytes, MPP1 forms a complex with protein 4.1R and glycophorin C, which is essential for maintaining the mechanical stability of red blood cells. The loss of MPP1 protein is associated with hereditary elliptocytosis and Leach elliptocytosis, conditions characterized by elliptical-shaped red blood cells due to the absence of protein 4.1R and glycophorin C, respectively (Chytła2020Not). 

In the context of hemolytic anemia, the absence of palmitoylated MPP1 due to defects in the DHHC17 protein affects membrane organization, suggesting a link between MPP1 and this condition (Biernatowska2013The). MPP1 is also implicated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it is highly expressed and correlates with the expression of the ABC transporter ABCC4, associated with poor prognosis (Trybus2019MPP1based).

In non-erythroid cells, MPP1 plays a role in regulating neutrophil polarity. The absence of MPP1 leads to impaired chemotaxis and disrupted cell migration, which could compromise immune response effectiveness (Quinn2009Erythrocyte). MPP1's interactions in the retina are crucial for maintaining cell polarity, and disruptions in these interactions are associated with retinal disorders (Gosens2007MPP1).

## Interactions
MPP1 (MAGUK p55 scaffold protein 1) is known for its interactions with various proteins, playing a crucial role in organizing membrane domains and maintaining cell structure. In erythrocyte membranes, MPP1 directly interacts with flotillin 1 and flotillin 2, forming complexes that contribute to the formation of membrane raft domains. These interactions are independent of the protein 4.1-based complexes and are essential for maintaining membrane fluidity and structural heterogeneity (Biernatowska2017MPP1). MPP1 binds more strongly to flotillin 2 than to flotillin 1, suggesting flotillin 2 as the primary partner in these complexes (Biernatowska2017MPP1).

In the retina, MPP1 interacts with MPP5/Pals1 and whirlin, linking the Crumbs polarity complex and the Usher protein network. These interactions are significant for maintaining neuronal distribution and cell polarity, which are crucial for visual function (Gosens2007MPP1). MPP1 binds to MPP5 through their MAGUK modules and interacts with whirlin via a PDZ domain-to-PDZ binding motif mechanism (Gosens2007MPP1).

MPP1 also interacts with the NF2 protein, merlin, a tumor suppressor involved in regulating cell shape and polarity. This interaction is mediated through the FERM domain of merlin and the PDZ domain of MPP1 (Seo2009Identification).
