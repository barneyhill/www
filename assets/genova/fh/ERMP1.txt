# ERMP1

## Overview
ERMP1, or endoplasmic reticulum metallopeptidase 1, is a gene that encodes a multi-pass transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The protein, a member of the M28 family of zinc metallopeptidases, plays a critical role in the processing and maturation of proteins within the ER by cleaving peptide bonds, which is essential for protein quality control and homeostasis (GonzálezEsparragoza2024In; Zimmermann2021Quantitative). This enzymatic activity is vital for maintaining cellular functions such as protein folding, degradation, and lipid metabolism (GonzálezEsparragoza2024In). ERMP1 is also involved in maintaining calcium homeostasis through interactions with calcium-dependent ATPases, contributing to various cellular processes (GonzálezEsparragoza2024In). The protein's function is regulated by mechanisms including transcriptional regulation, ubiquitination, and potential phosphorylation, indicating its complex role in cellular stress responses and overall organismal health (GonzálezEsparragoza2024In).

## Structure


## Function
ERMP1, or endoplasmic reticulum metallopeptidase 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the processing and maturation of proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As a member of the M28 family of zinc metallopeptidases, ERMP1 functions by cleaving peptide bonds in substrate proteins, a process essential for protein quality control and homeostasis (GonzálezEsparragoza2024In). This activity is crucial for maintaining cellular function, as it impacts protein folding and degradation, which are vital for cellular processes such as protein synthesis and lipid metabolism (GonzálezEsparragoza2024In).

ERMP1 is a multi-pass transmembrane protein located in the ER membrane, where it likely interacts with proteins involved in ER membrane insertion and vesicular trafficking (GonzálezEsparragoza2024In; Zimmermann2021Quantitative). It is implicated in maintaining calcium homeostasis by interacting with calcium-dependent ATPases, which is important for various cellular functions (GonzálezEsparragoza2024In). The protein's activity is regulated through mechanisms such as transcriptional regulation, ubiquitination, and palmitoylation, with potential phosphorylation sites suggesting regulation by kinases (GonzálezEsparragoza2024In). These molecular processes contribute to the overall cellular and organismal health by ensuring proper protein processing and stress response management.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ERMP1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In keratoconus (KC), a missense single nucleotide variant (SNV) c.341A>T in the ERMP1 gene was identified in a study involving Chinese patients. This variant was found in one individual out of a larger sample set of 100 KC patients and was absent in a control group of 128 healthy individuals, suggesting a potential association with the disease (Xu2020Exome). The study suggests that ERMP1 may play a role in defending against oxidative stress, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of KC (Xu2020Exome).

In early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EO-FAD), copy number variations (CNVs) involving ERMP1 have been identified. A specific CNV, FAD-CNV1, involves a 124-kb loss segment overlapping the ERMP1 gene, suggesting its potential pathogenicity due to co-segregation with Alzheimer's disease in affected families (Hooli2013Rare). The study highlights the complexity of Alzheimer's disease genetics and the significant contribution of structural variations like CNVs to genetic and phenotypic variation (Hooli2013Rare).

ERMP1 has also been associated with high-risk childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as part of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, indicating its potential role as a biomarker for prognosis (Zhang2019Comprehensive).

## Interactions
ERMP1, a multi-pass membrane protein, has been identified to interact with various proteins, although its interactions with nucleic acids are not specifically addressed. In humans, ERMP1 interacts with 190 proteins, including 8 viral proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and 1 from SARS-CoV, as documented in the BioGRID database. However, it does not interact with major unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway proteins such as IRE1, PERK, ATF6, and GRP78 (GonzálezEsparragoza2024In).

In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, ERMP1, known as Ermp1, is suggested to have physical interactions with proteins such as Amk2 and Gsk3. These interactions are part of a protein-protein interaction network that includes human orthologous proteins PRKAB1 and GSK3B. PRKAB1 is a subunit of the AMPK complex, a negative regulator of the UPR pathway, while GSK3B is associated with apoptosis during ER stress (GonzálezEsparragoza2024In).

ERMP1's potential reliance on the Sec61 complex for membrane insertion has been noted, suggesting a dependency for its proper localization and function within the endoplasmic reticulum (Zimmermann2021Quantitative). Additionally, ERMP1 is involved in calcium homeostasis through interactions with calcium-dependent ATPases like Pmr1 and Pmc1, and it interacts with proteins involved in lipid and peptide metabolism (GonzálezEsparragoza2024In).
