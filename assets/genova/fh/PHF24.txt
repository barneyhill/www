# PHF24

## Overview
PHF24 is a gene that encodes the PHD finger protein 24, a protein involved in the modulation of GABA B receptor signaling pathways. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its interactions with GTP-bound Gαi proteins, which are components of the GABA B receptor complex. PHD finger protein 24 plays a significant role in the central nervous system, particularly in the regulation of synaptic activity and neuronal excitability. It is highly expressed in the hippocampus and is associated with the modulation of high-voltage-activated calcium channels and inwardly rectifying potassium channels. Alterations in the expression of PHF24 have been linked to neurological disorders such as epilepsy, where its dysfunction contributes to increased seizure susceptibility. Additionally, PHF24 has been identified as a potential biomarker in glioblastoma multiforme, highlighting its relevance in both neurological and oncological contexts (Kuramoto2017Identification; Numakura2021PHF24; Vastrad2020Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PHF24 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders, particularly epilepsy. In the Noda epileptic rat (NER) model, an endogenous retrovirus insertion in the Phf24 gene leads to a significant reduction in PHF24 expression, correlating with increased seizure susceptibility and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) (Kuramoto2017Identification; Numakura2021PHF24). PHF24 is involved in the regulation of GABA B receptor-mediated inhibition, and its loss is associated with hyperexcitability in hippocampal neurons due to excessive calcium influx, contributing to seizure pathogenesis (Kuramoto2017Identification).

PHF24-null rats exhibit increased sensitivity to induced seizures, emotional hyper-reactivity, and cognitive deficits, suggesting that PHF24 is crucial for preventing epileptogenesis and regulating emotional and cognitive functions (Serikawa2019Increased). The absence of PHF24 expression in these rats is linked to altered GABAergic signaling, which may lead to functional disorders in inhibitory interneurons, further contributing to epilepsy (Numakura2021PHF24).

In addition to its role in epilepsy, PHF24 has been identified as a downregulated gene in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in this type of cancer (Vastrad2020Identification).

## Interactions
PHF24, also known as Gαi-interacting protein (GINIP), is involved in interactions with the GABA B receptor, a key inhibitory receptor in the mammalian brain. PHF24 specifically interacts with GTP-bound Gαi, a component of the GABA B receptor, playing a role in modulating behaviors related to GABA B receptor signaling (Serikawa2019Increased). This interaction is crucial as the Gαi protein inhibits the production of cAMP, affecting synaptic vesicle recruitment at presynaptic terminals (Numakura2021PHF24).

PHF24 is also associated with the regulation of high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca 2+ channels and inwardly rectifying K+ channels through its interaction with Gαi proteins, which are part of the GABA B receptor complex. This regulation is significant in the hippocampus, where PHF24 is highly expressed and likely influences the GABAergic inhibitory system (Kuramoto2017Identification).

In the central nervous system, PHF24 is expressed in inhibitory interneurons and is co-expressed with GABBR2, a subunit of the GABA B receptor, in the neuropil of the spinal cord. This suggests a potential interaction between PHF24 and the GABA B receptor, which may play a role in the function of inhibitory interneurons (Numakura2021PHF24).
