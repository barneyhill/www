# NECTIN1

## Overview
NECTIN1 is a gene that encodes the nectin cell adhesion molecule 1, a protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is integral to cell-cell adhesion processes, particularly in the formation and maintenance of adherens and tight junctions in epithelial tissues. Nectin cell adhesion molecule 1 is characterized by its three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in cellular signaling pathways (Lopez2001Novel; Di2011Herpes). The protein is involved in various biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and synapse formation, and it plays a critical role in the structural integrity of tissues (Mandai2015Nectins; Irie2004Roles). Additionally, NECTIN1 is implicated in several genetic disorders and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Tampakis2019Nectin1; Miyoshi2007Nectin).

## Structure
NECTIN1, also known as nectin cell adhesion molecule 1, is a protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It features three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail (Lopez2001Novel; Di2011Herpes). The first Ig domain is a V-set Ig domain, which is crucial for its interaction with herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) and for homodimer formation (Zhang2012Binding). The V domain is characterized by a barrel-like fold formed by β-strands, with the C, C', and C'' strands playing a key role in viral interaction (Cocchi2001Chimeric).

NECTIN1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its structural properties and interactions (Di2011Herpes). The protein can form homodimers or heterodimers with other nectins, contributing to its quaternary structure and cell adhesion functions (Zhang2012Binding).

There are multiple isoforms of NECTIN1, including a novel soluble isoform named nectin1γ, which lacks the transmembrane region and is secreted into the culture medium. This isoform can modulate herpes simplex virus infectivity by competing with membrane-bound forms (Lopez2001Novel).

## Function
NECTIN1, also known as nectin cell adhesion molecule 1, is a crucial component in cell-cell adhesion processes. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays a significant role in the formation and maintenance of adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs) in epithelial cells. NECTIN1 forms both homophilic and heterophilic trans-dimers, with heterophilic interactions, such as those with nectin-3, being particularly strong and influential in cell adhesion (Mandai2015Nectins; Miyoshi2007Nectin).

NECTIN1 interacts with afadin, an actin filament-binding protein, linking it to the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is essential for clustering NECTIN1 at cell-cell adhesion sites and recruiting cadherin-catenin complexes, which are vital for the structural integrity of tissues (Mandai2015Nectins; Sun2008The). NECTIN1 also binds to Par-3, a cell polarity protein, which regulates cell polarization and is crucial for the regulation of tight and adherens junctions in epithelial cells (Mandai2015Nectins).

In addition to its role in cell adhesion, NECTIN1 is involved in signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation, differentiation, and movement. It interacts with growth factor receptors, such as the fibroblast growth factor receptor, enhancing neurite elongation and contributing to tissue morphogenesis (Mandai2015Nectins). NECTIN1 is also implicated in synapse formation, particularly in the hippocampus, where it contributes to the structural and functional basis of synapses (Irie2004Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NECTIN1 gene are associated with several genetic disorders. One such condition is Zlotogora-Ogur syndrome, characterized by cleft lip/palate, syndactyly, mental retardation, and ectodermal dysplasia (Miyoshi2007Nectin). This syndrome results from disruptions in the gene's normal function, affecting cell adhesion and signaling pathways. NECTIN1 mutations are also linked to Margarita Island ectodermal dysplasia, which shares similar symptoms, including cleft lip/palate and ectodermal dysplasia (Miyoshi2007Nectin).

Alterations in NECTIN1 expression levels have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer, high NECTIN1 expression is associated with advanced disease stages and lymph node metastasis, indicating a potential role in tumor progression and as a prognostic marker for aggressive tumor phenotypes (Tampakis2019Nectin1). In bladder urothelial carcinoma, NECTIN1 expression correlates with higher histologic grades and recurrence, serving as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and relapse-free survival (Ahn2021FAM83H). These findings suggest that NECTIN1 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could be a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
NECTIN1, also known as nectin cell adhesion molecule 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cell adhesion and viral entry. NECTIN1 interacts with herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) in a 1:1 binding mode, which prevents NECTIN1 dimerization and cell-cell adhesion, facilitating viral entry and spread (Zhang2012Binding). This interaction involves specific amino acids on both gD and NECTIN1, with the binding interface located on the V-set first Ig domain of NECTIN1 (Zhang2012Binding).

In addition to its role in viral entry, NECTIN1 forms complexes with other proteins involved in cell adhesion. It interacts with afadin, a cytoplasmic protein that links NECTIN1 to the actin cytoskeleton, playing a role in the formation of adherens junctions (Takai2008The). NECTIN1 also associates with integrin αvβ3 at cell-cell adhesion sites, which is important for the formation and stability of cell-cell junctions (Takai2008The).

Furthermore, NECTIN1 interacts with the human natural killer cell receptor CD96, although this interaction is of relatively low affinity compared to other nectin interactions. This interaction may influence NK cell activity, particularly in pathological conditions where cell junctions are disrupted (Holmes2019Interaction).
