# CBX6

## Overview
CBX6 is a gene that encodes the chromobox protein homolog 6, a member of the Polycomb group proteins, which are critical for chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. The CBX6 protein is characterized by its chromodomain and Polycomb repressor (PcR) box domain, which facilitate its role in the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) (Santanach2017The; Kaustov2011Recognition). As a chromatin-associated protein, CBX6 is involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in maintaining the balance between pluripotency and differentiation in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Santanach2017The). Unlike some of its homologs, CBX6 does not require the H3K27me3 mark for chromatin recruitment, suggesting a unique function within the Polycomb group (Santanach2017The). Clinically, CBX6 has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, where it acts as an oncogene, promoting tumor growth and serving as a potential prognostic biomarker (Zheng2017CBX6; Ning2018Transcriptional).

## Structure
CBX6 is a member of the Polycomb group proteins, characterized by its chromodomain and Polycomb repressor (PcR) box domain. The chromodomain is located at the N-terminus and functions as a methyl-lysine reader, facilitating the binding of CBX6 to methylated lysines on histone tails, particularly H3K27me3, although with lower affinity compared to other homologs (Milosevich2015Selective; Kaustov2011Recognition). The chromodomain contains an aromatic cage, which is crucial for recognizing trimethyllysine residues, and a unique hydrophobic pocket that contributes to its selectivity (Milosevich2015Selective).

The PcR box domain at the C-terminus mediates interactions with RING1A/B, associating CBX6 with the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) (Santanach2017The). Structurally, CBX6 shares a common fold with other Cbx family members, featuring a surface-groove recognition mode for peptide binding (Kaustov2011Recognition). The protein's hydrophobic clasp, formed by specific residues, influences its binding affinity and selectivity (Kaustov2011Recognition).

CBX6 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions. Splice variants of CBX6 can lead to different isoforms, potentially altering its role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing (Dahiya2019Investigating).

## Function
CBX6 (chromobox 6) is a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the identity of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by balancing pluripotency and differentiation. It is highly expressed in ESCs and is part of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression through chromatin remodeling (van2021Biological; Santanach2017The). CBX6 suppresses pluripotency genes such as SOX2 and NANOG, a process mediated by ubiquitin-specific protease 26 (USP26), which prevents the degradation of CBX6 and CBX4 (van2021Biological).

CBX6 is involved in the regulation of key pluripotency genes, including Rex1, Klf4, Nanog, and Esrrb, and its depletion leads to spontaneous differentiation of ESCs (Santanach2017The). It interacts with both canonical and non-canonical PRC1 components, although its exact role in these complexes is not fully elucidated (Santanach2017The). Unlike CBX7, CBX6 is not required for PRC1 or PRC2 recruitment to chromatin, indicating a PRC1-independent role (Santanach2017The).

CBX6 is primarily localized near transcription start sites of genes involved in developmental processes and signaling pathways, such as the WNT and MAPK pathways, which are critical for maintaining the balance between self-renewal and lineage commitment (Santanach2017The).

## Clinical Significance
CBX6 has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common type of liver cancer. Studies have shown that CBX6 is frequently up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, with its expression significantly associated with larger tumor sizes and the presence of multiple tumors (Zheng2017CBX6; Ning2018Transcriptional). Patients with higher levels of CBX6 expression tend to have shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), making CBX6 an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for HCC (Zheng2017CBX6; Ning2018Transcriptional).

Mechanistic studies have identified that CBX6 promotes HCC cell growth by regulating the S100A9/NF-κB/MAPK pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and tumor progression (Zheng2017CBX6; Ning2018Transcriptional). The overexpression of CBX6 leads to increased expression of S100A9, enhancing HCC cell proliferation and metastasis (Zheng2017CBX6). These findings suggest that CBX6 acts as an oncogene in HCC and could serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for the disease (Zheng2017CBX6). The specific role of CBX6 in other diseases or conditions has not been detailed in the provided context.

## Interactions
CBX6 is a component of the Polycomb group proteins and is involved in forming Polycomb repressive complexes, specifically PRC1. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), CBX6 interacts with several significant proteins, including members of the canonical PRC1.2 complex such as RING1B and PHC1, and members of the non-canonical PRC1.6 complex, including L3MBTL2, MGA, and PCGF6. These interactions were confirmed through mass spectrometry and the use of specific antibodies (Santanach2017The). CBX6 also interacts with PCGF2/MEL18, another member of the cPRC1 complex, but does not interact with CBX7 or RYBP, indicating that CBX6-containing PRC1 complexes are distinct from other PRC1 complexes (Santanach2017The).

CBX6's recruitment to chromatin is independent of the H3K27me3 mark, unlike CBX7, suggesting non-overlapping functions between these proteins (Santanach2017The). The chromodomain of CBX6 does not recognize H3K27me3, and its binding is influenced by a hydrophobic pocket that interacts with a hydrophobic residue at the -2 position of the methyl lysine, indicating that CBX6 might associate with another, unidentified histone modification (Santanach2017The).
