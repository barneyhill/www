# BRD3OS

## Overview
BRD3OS is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) gene that encodes the protein BRD3 opposite strand. This gene is involved in various cellular processes and has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. The BRD3 opposite strand protein is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but it plays a significant role in gene regulation and cellular signaling pathways. Altered expression of BRD3OS has been linked to tumor progression and metastasis in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, as well as treatment resistance in rheumatoid arthritis (Piipponen2022Super; Tsai2024Metformin; Yoosuf2020Molecular). The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential as a therapeutic target and its importance in understanding disease mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
BRD3OS, also known as LINC00094, is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), BRD3OS is significantly upregulated, particularly in metastatic stages, and is associated with promoting tumor invasion and growth by upregulating matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1 and MMP-13 (Piipponen2022Super). Knockdown of BRD3OS in cSCC cells leads to reduced tumor growth and invasion, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Piipponen2022Super).

In melanoma, BRD3OS expression is reduced following metformin treatment, and its knockdown suppresses genes related to mitochondrial functions, inhibiting cell proliferation and invasion (Tsai2024Metformin). This suggests a role in cancer cell metabolism and potential therapeutic implications.

BRD3OS is also associated with rheumatoid arthritis, where higher expression levels are observed in non-responders to anti-TNF therapy, indicating a possible role in treatment resistance (Yoosuf2020Molecular). Additionally, BRD3OS is implicated in testicular embryonal carcinomas, with frequent copy number gains and mutations observed in these tumors (Hoff2020Frequent). These findings underscore the clinical significance of BRD3OS in various diseases.
