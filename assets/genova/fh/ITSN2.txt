# ITSN2

## Overview
Intersectin 2 (ITSN2) is a gene that encodes a multidomain scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes, including endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. The ITSN2 protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes Eps15 homology (EH) domains, Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, and additional domains such as Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) in its long isoform. These domains facilitate ITSN2's role as an adaptor protein, enabling it to mediate protein-protein interactions essential for cellular signaling and structural organization (Tsyba2011Intersectin; McGavin2001The). ITSN2 is ubiquitously expressed and plays a significant role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Cdc42, which is crucial for actin filament network assembly (Hunter2013Emerging; Tsyba2011Intersectin). The gene's involvement in cellular architecture and function underscores its importance in maintaining normal physiological processes and its potential implications in various diseases.

## Structure
The ITSN2 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It contains two NH2-terminal Eps15 homology (EH) domains, a coiled-coil domain, and five Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which are crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions (Tsyba2011Intersectin; McGavin2001The). The long isoform of ITSN2, produced by alternative splicing, also includes a Dbl homology (DH) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a C2 domain. The DH domain functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Cdc42 GTPase, while the PH domain binds phosphoinositides, and the C2 domain is involved in phospholipid binding (Hunter2013Emerging; Tsyba2011Intersectin).

ITSN2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may affect its functional interactions. Notably, the skipping of exons 27 and 28 leads to the deletion of the SH3D domain (Tsyba2011Intersectin). ITSN2 is ubiquitously expressed, with its long isoform playing a significant role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement (Hunter2013Emerging; Tsyba2011Intersectin). The protein's structure facilitates its role as an adaptor or scaffold in assembling multiprotein complexes essential for cellular processes (McGavin2001The).

## Function
ITSN2 (intersectin 2) is a multidomain adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton rearrangements. It is involved in the maturation of clathrin-coated pits during clathrin-mediated endocytosis, working alongside proteins such as epsin and Eps15. ITSN2 regulates the clustering of FCHo proteins, which are essential for the early stages of clathrin-coated pit assembly (Tsyba2011Intersectin). 

ITSN2 also acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Cdc42, facilitating its activation. This activation is critical for actin filament network assembly, which is a key component of endocytosis. ITSN2 interacts with WASP and N-WASP, proteins that are involved in actin polymerization, thereby linking actin dynamics to endocytic processes (Tsyba2011Intersectin; McGavin2001The).

In epithelial morphogenesis, ITSN2 is essential for the correct orientation of the mitotic spindle, which is necessary for proper lumen formation. It localizes to centrosomes and interacts with centrosomal proteins, influencing spindle orientation through the activation of Cdc42 (RodriguezFraticelli2010The). ITSN2's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular architecture and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ITSN2 gene have been implicated in various forms of nephrotic syndrome (NS), a kidney disorder characterized by proteinuria and potential progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Specifically, recessive mutations in ITSN2 are associated with partially treatment-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (pTSNS), a condition that shows partial or complete response to treatments like Cyclosporine A (Ashraf2018Mutations). These mutations disrupt the regulation of Rho-like small GTPases, such as Cdc42, which are crucial for podocyte function in the kidneys (Ashraf2018Mutations). 

ITSN2 mutations have also been linked to a novel phenotype of hereditary renal failure, presenting with thin basement membrane and global glomerulosclerosis, as observed in a 52-year-old woman with a single heterozygous ITSN2 variant (Kondo2023Case). This suggests that altered ITSN2 expression may lead to CKD through dysfunction of CDC42, a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton in glomerular epithelial cells (Kondo2023Case).

ITSN2 is also involved in endocytic membrane trafficking and actin assembly, and its interaction with proteins like WASp and K15 suggests a role in cellular processes beyond the kidneys, potentially impacting conditions related to endocytosis and signal transduction (Lim2007The; McGavin2001The).

## Interactions
ITSN2 (intersectin 2) is a multi-domain scaffold protein involved in various protein-protein interactions crucial for endocytosis and signal transduction. It interacts with proteins through its Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which are essential for binding to proline-rich ligands. ITSN2 shares high identity with ITSN1 in its SH3 domains, allowing it to bind similar ligands, including dynamin, synaptojanin, and SOS1 (Novokhatska2013Adaptor). ITSN2 also interacts with the signaling protein Sema6A and the endocytic adaptor POB1 (Novokhatska2013Adaptor).

ITSN2 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, particularly in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment, enabling interactions with SH2 domain-containing proteins such as kinases Fyn, Fgr, and Abl1, as well as adaptor proteins Grb2 and Crk (Novokhatska2013Adaptor). This phosphorylation is crucial for its role in cell signaling pathways.

ITSN2 interacts with RABEP1, a regulator of Rab5, through its coiled-coil domain, influencing endocytosis and endosome trafficking (Yang2015ITSN2L). It also binds to the K15 protein of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus via its SH3-C domain, affecting endocytic trafficking in infected cells (Lim2007The). Additionally, ITSN2 interacts with Eps8, promoting its degradation through the lysosome pathway, which may regulate actin dynamics and endocytosis (Ding2012Human).
