# PDGFD

## Overview
PDGFD is a gene that encodes the protein platelet-derived growth factor D (PDGF-D), a member of the platelet-derived growth factor family. This protein is characterized as a growth factor, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and survival. PDGF-D is secreted as a latent homodimer, which requires proteolytic activation to exert its biological functions. It primarily interacts with the PDGFR-β receptor, initiating signaling pathways that are vital for angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and wound healing. The protein's structure includes a unique two-domain configuration with a CUB domain and a growth factor domain, which are essential for its function and interaction with other proteins (Reigstad2005Structural; Fredriksson2004The). PDGFD is expressed in various tissues, including the heart and pancreas, and is implicated in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases (Kim2023Molecular; LaRochelle2001PDGFD).

## Structure
The PDGFD gene encodes a protein that is part of the platelet-derived growth factor family, characterized by a unique two-domain structure. The primary structure of PDGF-D includes a signal peptide, an N-terminal CUB domain, and a C-terminal growth factor domain containing the cystine knot motif (Reigstad2005Structural; Fredriksson2004The). The CUB domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and is linked to the growth factor domain by a hinge region (Fredriksson2004The). 

The secondary structure of PDGF-D is defined by the cystine knot motif, which is a common feature in the growth factor domain and is crucial for receptor recruitment (Chen2013Plateletderived). This motif is characterized by a set of anti-parallel β-strands linked by disulfide bridges, providing structural stability and promoting dimer formation (Chen2013Plateletderived).

In terms of tertiary structure, PDGF-D contains additional intramolecular disulfide bridges due to extra cysteines in its sequence, which may play a role in its structural integrity (Chen2013Plateletderived). The quaternary structure involves the formation of homodimers, known as PDGF-DD, which are secreted as latent factors requiring activation by extracellular proteases (Reigstad2005Structural; Fredriksson2004The).

Post-translational modifications include proteolytic cleavage, which is necessary to release the growth factor domain from the CUB domain, preventing premature receptor binding and allowing controlled activation (Fredriksson2004The). Alternative splicing of PDGF-D mRNA has been reported in mice, resulting in variants that affect the growth factor domain and its mitogenic activity (Reigstad2005Structural; Zhuo2003A).

## Function
PDGFD, a member of the platelet-derived growth factor family, plays a significant role in various cellular and molecular processes. It is primarily involved in cell growth, survival, and development by binding to PDGF receptors, particularly PDGFR-β, on cell surfaces. This interaction activates signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and migration, contributing to processes such as angiogenesis, wound healing, and tissue remodeling (LaRochelle2001PDGFD; Bergsten2001PDGFD).

In healthy human cells, PDGFD is expressed in tissues such as the heart, pancreas, and ovary, where it is involved in maintaining normal cellular functions and structure (Fredriksson2004The). It is secreted as a dimer and undergoes proteolytic processing to become active, indicating its role in extracellular signaling (LaRochelle2001PDGFD). PDGFD's activity is crucial for the proliferation and survival of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, influencing vascular development and maintenance (Li2003PDGFD).

PDGFD is also implicated in the development of the human neocortex, where it is essential for radial glia cell function, highlighting its importance in human brain development (Lui2014Radial). Its expression and activity are tightly regulated, ensuring proper cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PDGFD gene have been implicated in several diseases. In dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), a type of skin cancer, PDGFD rearrangements have been identified in cases lacking the typical COL1A1-PDGFB fusion. These rearrangements involve PDGFD fusions with COL6A3 or EMILIN2, leading to oncogenic properties that promote tumor growth and angiogenesis (DadoneMontaudié2018Alternative).

In coronary artery disease (CAD), PDGFD is associated with increased disease risk. The gene promotes the transition of smooth muscle cells to a chondromyocyte phenotype, contributing to vascular calcification and plaque instability. Genetic variations at the PDGFD locus, particularly the rs2019090 allele, have been linked to increased PDGFD expression and CAD risk (Kim2023Molecular).

PDGFD has also been identified as a candidate risk gene for idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Variants in PDGFD, such as deleterious missense mutations, are associated with adult-onset IPAH and other pulmonary or vascular fibrotic diseases. These variants may disrupt protein domains, affecting PDGFD's function in vascular remodeling and fibrosis (Zhu2021Rare).

## Interactions
PDGFD interacts with several proteins, primarily through its binding to the PDGFR-β receptor. This interaction activates various signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt, mTOR, NF-κB, ERK, and MAPK, which are involved in processes such as cell survival, proliferation, and migration (Wang2010Emerging). PDGFD can also form heterodimers with PDGFR-α, suggesting a role in the formation of PDGFR-α/β heterodimers, which may have unique signaling capabilities (LaRochelle2001PDGFD).

PDGFD has a specific interaction with Neuropilin 1 (NRP1), acting as a co-receptor in PDGF-D/PDGFRβ signaling. This interaction is distinct from PDGF-B, which does not bind to NRP1. The PDGF-D/NRP1 complex influences endothelial cell behavior and may play a role in intercellular communication within the vascular wall (Muhl2017Neuropilin). PDGFD also induces the internalization and degradation of NRP1 when complexed with PDGFRβ, affecting downstream signaling pathways (Muhl2017Neuropilin).

In the context of stem cell biology, PDGFD promotes the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into endothelial cells, primarily through the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (Lu2022PDGFD). This highlights its role in vascular development and endothelial cell lineage commitment.
