# SLC10A4

## Overview
SLC10A4 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 10 member 4, which is part of the solute carrier family 10. This protein is categorized as an orphan carrier due to the absence of a defined transport function, despite its structural classification within a family known for bile acid transport (Döring2012The). SLC10A4 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons, as well as in mast cells, where it is implicated in neurotransmitter regulation and immune responses (Pettersson2017SLC10A4; Schmidt2015Expression). The protein is localized in vesicular structures, suggesting a role in vesicular transport and storage rather than direct neurotransmitter transport (Schmidt2015Expression). SLC10A4 is also involved in protein-protein interactions, forming heterodimers with other SLC10 family members, which can modulate the activity of these transporters (Zhang2019Proteinprotein). Its role in mast cell degranulation further indicates its involvement in complex cellular processes, such as allergic responses and neurotransmitter release (Pettersson2017SLC10A4).

## Structure
The SLC10A4 protein is a member of the solute carrier family 10 and consists of 437 amino acids in humans, rats, and mice (Döring2012The; Schmidt2015Expression). While the exact molecular structure of SLC10A4 is not fully detailed, it is known to have a vesicular expression pattern in neurons and neuronal cell lines, suggesting a role in vesicular sorting rather than plasma membrane localization (Schmidt2015Expression). The C-terminus of SLC10A4 contains dominant signals for vesicular sorting, as demonstrated by chimeric constructs with NTCP, another SLC10 family member (Schmidt2015Expression). 

SLC10A4 is capable of forming homodimers, as confirmed by yeast-two-hybrid membrane protein system studies (Noppes2019Homo). It also forms heterodimers with other SLC10 family members, such as NTCP, which affects cellular localization and transport activity (Noppes2019Homo). Despite these interaction capabilities, no transport function has been identified for SLC10A4, leaving it classified as an orphan carrier (Döring2012The). The protein's role in neurotransmitter release or uptake is suggested by its expression in vesicles of cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons (Döring2012The).

## Function
SLC10A4 is a member of the solute carrier family 10, primarily expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons, as well as in mast cells (Schmidt2015Expression). Despite its classification within a family known for bile acid transport, SLC10A4 does not primarily function as a bile acid transporter. Instead, it is implicated in neurotransmitter regulation and storage, potentially influencing synaptic transmission (Schmidt2015Expression).

In neurons, SLC10A4 is localized in vesicular structures, suggesting a role in vesicular transport rather than direct neurotransmitter transport, as it does not demonstrate transport activity for neurotransmitters like dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin in various cell models (Schmidt2015Expression). The protein may be involved in the vesicular storage or release of neurotransmitters, as knockout studies indicate altered neurotransmitter levels and responses to psychostimulants in the absence of SLC10A4 (Schmidt2015Expression).

In mast cells, SLC10A4 is associated with granule-associated ATP and influences the degranulation process, affecting the release of mediators such as histamine during immune responses (Pettersson2017SLC10A4). This suggests a role in regulating mast cell-mediated reactions, which are critical for allergic responses and itch reactions (Pettersson2017SLC10A4).

## Interactions
SLC10A4, a member of the solute carrier family 10, is involved in protein-protein interactions that influence its function. It is known to form heterodimers with other members of the SLC10 family, such as NTCP (SLC10A1) and SOAT (SLC10A6). These interactions have functional consequences, as co-expression of NTCP with SLC10A4 reduces NTCP-mediated taurocholate uptake, indicating that SLC10A4 can modulate the activity of other transporters within the family (Zhang2019Proteinprotein).

In the context of mast cells, SLC10A4 is co-localized with granule-associated proteases, such as mouse mast cell protease 6 (mMCP-6), within secretory granules. Although SLC10A4 does not affect the storage of mMCP-6, its presence is crucial for the regulated release of granule-associated mediators during IgE-mediated degranulation. This suggests that SLC10A4 may interact with components of the degranulation machinery, influencing the release of mediators like ATP and histamine (Pettersson2017SLC10A4).

These interactions highlight the role of SLC10A4 in modulating both transporter activity and mast cell degranulation, suggesting its involvement in complex cellular processes. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms and interactions involving SLC10A4.
