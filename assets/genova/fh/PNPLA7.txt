# PNPLA7

## Overview
PNPLA7 is a gene that encodes the protein patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 7, which is a member of the patatin-like phospholipase family. This protein is characterized by its patatin domain, which confers esterase activity, and is involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. As an integral membrane protein, PNPLA7 is associated with cellular membranes, particularly the endoplasmic reticulum, and plays a crucial role in processes such as mitophagy and the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. It is highly expressed in insulin-responsive tissues, including skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and adipose tissue, where it participates in nutrient and energy status-sensitive pathways. PNPLA7's interactions with other proteins, such as Parkin and apolipoprotein E, underscore its involvement in lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of PNPLA7 has been linked to metabolic disorders, including obesity and insulin resistance, as well as inflammatory conditions (Li2024PNPLA7; Zhao2022The; Lulić2023The).

## Structure
PNPLA7 is a protein consisting of 1317 amino acids and is characterized by a patatin domain located between residues 928-1094, which includes the catalytic dyad Ser961-Asp1081. This domain is crucial for its esterase activity, featuring lipase motifs GTSIG and DGG (Lulić2023The). The protein also contains a C-terminal domain with the active site and a transmembrane domain predicted at residues 31-53, which suggests its association with cellular membranes (Saarela2008The). The N-terminal domain includes a transmembrane segment and a regulator segment with three cyclic nucleotide binding sites located at residues 145-272, 458-563, and 591-696, indicating potential regulation by cAMP or cGMP (Lulić2023The; Wilson2006Characterization).

PNPLA7 is an integral membrane protein, with the N-terminus oriented towards the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and the rest of the enzyme towards the cytosol (Lulić2023The). It is predicted to have tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites, which may play a role in its regulation (Wilson2006Characterization). The protein's structure is further complicated by alternative splicing and the presence of ankyrin repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions (Wilson2006Characterization).

## Function
PNPLA7 is a patatin-like phospholipase that plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis in human cells. It functions primarily as a lysophospholipase, hydrolyzing unsaturated phospholipids into glycerol-3-phosphocholine and free fatty acids, which are crucial for maintaining cellular lipid balance (Lulić2023The). PNPLA7 is highly expressed in tissues responsive to insulin, such as skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and adipose tissue, and its expression is modulated by nutritional status and insulin levels (Miš2023Insulin; Lulić2023The).

In skeletal muscle cells, PNPLA7 is involved in nutrient and energy status-sensitive pathways, including the mTOR and AMPK pathways. Its knockdown affects the phosphorylation of proteins in these pathways, indicating its role in muscle cell energy metabolism (Miš2023Insulin). In adipose tissue, PNPLA7 regulates mitophagy by mediating the recruitment of Parkin to mitochondria, which is essential for mitochondrial degradation. This process is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and is linked to the regulation of browning in white adipose tissue (Li2024PNPLA7). PNPLA7's activity in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria-associated membranes further underscores its role in cellular lipid and energy metabolism (Li2024PNPLA7).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PNPLA7 gene have been linked to several metabolic and inflammatory conditions. PNPLA7 is involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, and its dysregulation can contribute to metabolic disorders such as obesity and insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, PNPLA7 negatively regulates the browning of white adipose tissue by promoting mitophagy through the PINK1/Parkin pathway. Overexpression of PNPLA7 inhibits browning and adaptive thermogenesis, while its deficiency can lead to increased browning and reduced fat mass, suggesting its potential role in obesity and related metabolic disorders (Li2024PNPLA7).

PNPLA7 also plays a role in muscle physiology, with its deficiency in mice leading to myopathic changes, indicating its importance in muscle function and potential involvement in muscle-related conditions (Miš2023Insulin). In macrophages, PNPLA7 regulates inflammatory responses by modulating the SIRT1/NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. Its knockdown promotes proinflammatory characteristics, suggesting a role in inflammatory conditions (Zhao2022The). Additionally, polymorphisms in the PNPLA7 gene have been investigated for their potential influence on menstrual disorders, although findings are not conclusive (Su2015Correlation).

## Interactions
PNPLA7 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In adipose tissue, PNPLA7 is involved in mitophagy by mediating the recruitment of Parkin to mitochondria. This interaction is crucial for the removal of damaged mitochondria and is facilitated by the C-terminal Patatin domain of PNPLA7. The interaction enhances Parkin's activity by increasing the levels of phosphorylated ubiquitin (pSer65-Ub), which is essential for Parkin's recruitment to mitochondria (Li2024PNPLA7). PNPLA7 is also found in mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which are critical for mitochondrial dynamics and function (Li2024PNPLA7).

In macrophages, PNPLA7 modulates classical activation and proinflammatory responses through interactions with the SIRT1/NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways. Overexpression of PNPLA7 stabilizes SIRT1 expression and inhibits the acetylation of the NF-κB p65 subunit, reducing the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines (Zhao2022The). PNPLA7 also interacts with apolipoprotein E at the endoplasmic reticulum, influencing its stability and the secretion of very low-density lipoproteins (Lulić2023The). These interactions highlight PNPLA7's role in lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses.
