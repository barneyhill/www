# PPT2

## Overview
PPT2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 2, which is categorized as a lysosomal enzyme involved in lipid metabolism. The enzyme plays a critical role in the hydrolysis of thioester-linked fatty acyl groups from proteins, exhibiting a specific substrate preference distinct from its homolog, PPT1 (Soyombo1997Molecular; Calero2003The). Unlike PPT1, PPT2 does not act on S-palmitoylated proteins, highlighting its unique functional role in cellular homeostasis and lipid metabolism (Calero2003The). The enzyme is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and certain brain regions, such as the cerebellum and hippocampus, and is transported to lysosomes via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor pathway (Soyombo1997Molecular). Structurally, PPT2 features a catalytic core with an α-β hydrolase fold and a lipid-binding pocket, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Calero2003The). Mutations in the PPT2 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including neurological disorders and ovarian cancer, underscoring its significance in both health and disease (Xu2024Investigating; Gupta2001Disruption).

## Function
Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 2 (PPT2) is a lysosomal enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, specifically in the hydrolysis of thioester-linked fatty acyl groups from proteins. It exhibits thioesterase activity against palmitoyl-CoA, but not against S-palmitoylated proteins, indicating a distinct substrate specificity compared to its homolog, PPT1 (Soyombo1997Molecular; Calero2003The). PPT2 is expressed in various human tissues, with the highest levels in skeletal muscle and specific brain regions, such as the cerebellum and hippocampus (Soyombo1997Molecular; Calero2003The).

The enzyme is localized to lysosomes, where it is taken up by cells through the mannose 6-phosphate receptor pathway, a characteristic of lysosomal enzyme transport (Soyombo1997Molecular). PPT2's structure includes a catalytic core with an α-β hydrolase fold and a lipid-binding pocket, which accommodates hydrophobic substrates (Calero2003The). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper lipid metabolism, as evidenced by its inability to substitute for PPT1 in correcting metabolic defects in certain lysosomal storage disorders (Soyombo1997Molecular). The distinct functional roles of PPT2 and PPT1 are highlighted by their divergent substrate specificities and the structural differences in their lipid-binding grooves (Calero2003The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PPT2 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In the context of ovarian cancer (OC), PPT2 is down-regulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal ovarian tissues. This down-regulation is associated with poorer clinical outcomes, including shorter overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in OC patients. Low PPT2 expression is linked to unfavorable prognosis and is suggested as an independent prognostic biomarker for OS and PFS in OC. The study also indicates that low PPT2 expression correlates with increased immune cell infiltration, suggesting that patients with low PPT2 expression might benefit more from immunotherapy and chemotherapy (Xu2024Investigating).

In neurological health, PPT2 mutations have been studied using knockout mice models. PPT2-deficient mice exhibit neurological abnormalities, such as clasping behavior and spasticity, although these symptoms are less severe compared to those observed in PPT1-deficient mice. The accumulation of autofluorescent storage material in the brain is noted, but the pathology is less severe than in PPT1-deficient models. This suggests that while PPT2 plays a role in neurological function, its deficiency leads to milder forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis compared to PPT1 (Gupta2001Disruption).
