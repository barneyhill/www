# TRAPPC6A

## Overview
TRAPPC6A is a gene that encodes the trafficking protein particle complex subunit 6A, a component of the TRAPP (transport protein particle) complex, which is integral to vesicle-mediated transport within cells. The TRAPPC6A protein is categorized as a subunit of the TRAPP complex, specifically involved in the TRAPP-I sub-complex, and plays a crucial role in the regulation of intracellular trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (Mohamoud2018A; AlShuhaib2021Integrating). The protein is composed of 159 amino acids and forms a heterodimer with TRAPPC3, contributing to the assembly of TRAPP I, II, and III complexes, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein sorting (Mohamoud2018A; Alderi2020A). Mutations in TRAPPC6A have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Mohamoud2018A; Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

## Structure
The TRAPPC6A protein has three isoforms in humans: TRAPPC6A1, TRAPPC6A2, and TRAPPC6B. TRAPPC6A1 and TRAPPC6B are encoded by different genes and share 56% identity and 72% similarity. TRAPPC6A2 contains an additional 14 amino acid stretch compared to TRAPPC6A1 (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). The primary structure of TRAPPC6A includes several non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) that have been identified as deleterious, such as E13G and L18P, which affect the protein's function and stability (AlShuhaib2021Integrating).

The secondary and tertiary structures of TRAPPC6A1 have been elucidated through crystallography, revealing a mixed α/β-fold with four α-helices and four β-strands forming an antiparallel β-sheet. A notable structural feature is the absence of a hydrophobic tunnel in TRAPPC6A1, which is present in its TRAPP binding partner TRAPPC3 (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

In terms of quaternary structure, TRAPPC6A1 forms a heterodimeric complex with TRAPPC3, which is part of the larger TRAPP complex involved in vesicle transport (Mohamoud2018A). Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation at Ser35, which has been observed in extracellular plaques in the brain cortex of Alzheimer's disease patients (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

## Function
TRAPPC6A encodes a subunit of the TRAPP complex, which is crucial for vesicle-mediated transport within cells, particularly between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. This protein is part of the TRAPP-I sub-complex and plays a regulatory role in these transportation routes by binding with TRAPP family receptors (Mohamoud2018A; AlShuhaib2021Integrating). The TRAPP complex is involved in the tethering of vesicles, facilitating their fusion to target membranes, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein sorting and secretion (Alderi2020A).

TRAPPC6A is composed of 159 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 18 kD. It is involved in the assembly of the TRAPP complex, forming a heterodimer with TRAPPC3, and interacts with other subunits to form TRAPP I, II, and III complexes (Mohamoud2018A). These complexes are implicated in intracellular trafficking, with TRAPP II and III being involved in membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi and later stages of the secretory pathway (Alderi2020A). The protein's function is essential for proper cellular transport events, and its deficiency is linked to various disorders, including neurodevelopmental abnormalities (AlShuhaib2021Integrating).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRAPPC6A gene are associated with a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, speech delay, facial dysmorphism, and limb abnormalities, including polydactyly and clinodactyly of the 5th toe (Mohamoud2018A). A specific missense mutation, p.Y107N, leads to the accumulation of the TRAPPC6A protein, potentially disrupting the stoichiometry and assembly of the TRAPP complex, which is crucial for ER-Golgi transport (Mohamoud2018A). This mutation may result in a toxic gain of function or interfere with normal protein degradation processes, as the mutant protein escapes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Mohamoud2018A).

The presence of this mutation in the Greater Middle East Variome database suggests a possible shared ancestry among affected individuals, indicating an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (Mohamoud2018A). The TRAPPC6A gene has also been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, where its isoform, TRAPPC6A1, is found in extracellular plaques in the brains of patients, potentially contributing to disease pathology (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TRAPPC6A mutations in various neurological and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
TRAPPC6A is a subunit of the TRAPP complex, which is involved in vesicle-mediated transport processes. It interacts with other TRAPP complex subunits to facilitate intracellular trafficking. TRAPPC6A forms a heterodimer with TRAPPC3 and interacts with other subunits to form TRAPP I, II, and III complexes (Mohamoud2018A). The protein is involved in interactions with TRAPPC1, TRAPPC2, TRAPPC2L, and TRAPPC3, as indicated by molecular docking studies that show significant changes in binding interactions due to non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) (AlShuhaib2021Integrating).

TRAPPC6A also interacts with TRAPPC2L, a core subunit of the TRAPP II and III complexes. A variant in TRAPPC2L, p.(Ala2Gly), disrupts its interaction with TRAPPC6A, affecting the assembly of TRAPP complexes and delaying membrane trafficking processes (Alderi2020A). This interaction is crucial for the proper function of the TRAPP complex, as TRAPPC2L acts as an adaptor for other TRAPP subunits (Alderi2020A).

The TRAPPC6A protein is also implicated in interactions that affect its stability and degradation. A missense mutation, p.Y107N, in TRAPPC6A leads to the accumulation of the protein, potentially disrupting the stoichiometry and assembly of the TRAPP complex (Mohamoud2018A).
