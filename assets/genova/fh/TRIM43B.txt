# TRIM43B

## Overview
The TRIM43B gene encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 43B, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, which are involved in various cellular processes, including regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TRIM43B, like other TRIM proteins, is implicated in the modulation of immune responses and may play a role in antiviral defense mechanisms. The specific biological functions and interactions of TRIM43B are still under investigation, but its involvement in cellular pathways suggests potential significance in health and disease contexts. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which TRIM43B influences cellular and molecular processes.
