# FNIP2

## Overview
FNIP2, or folliculin interacting protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily functioning as a co-chaperone in the Hsp90 chaperone cycle. The FNIP2 protein plays a critical role in regulating the stability and activity of client proteins, including the tumor suppressor folliculin (FLCN), by interacting with the molecular chaperone Hsp90. This interaction influences the chaperone's ATPase activity and affects the binding of Hsp90 to inhibitors, thereby modulating the chaperone cycle and drug sensitivity (Woodford2016The). Beyond its role in protein folding and stabilization, FNIP2 is implicated in metabolic regulation, with genetic variations in FNIP2 linked to metabolic traits such as fat and muscle mass in humans (Fernández2022Folliculininteracting). The protein's interactions extend to key metabolic regulators like AMPK and components of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, highlighting its involvement in nutrient signaling and cellular metabolism (de2020Nutrient).

## Function
FNIP2 (folliculin interacting protein 2) functions as a co-chaperone in the Hsp90 chaperone cycle, playing a crucial role in regulating the stability and activity of various client proteins, including the tumor suppressor FLCN (folliculin) (Woodford2016The). FNIP2 interacts with the M-domain of Hsp90, inhibiting its ATPase activity, which is essential for the chaperone's function. This interaction decelerates the Hsp90 chaperone cycle, enhancing the binding of Hsp90 to certain inhibitors and facilitating the stabilization of client proteins (Woodford2016The).

FNIP2 also competes with the activating co-chaperone Aha1 for binding to Hsp90, influencing the chaperone cycle and drug sensitivity (Woodford2016The). In addition to its role in the chaperone cycle, FNIP2 is involved in metabolic regulation. A polymorphism in the 3′ untranslated region of FNIP2, rs2291007, affects its expression and is associated with metabolic traits such as fat mass and muscle mass in humans (Fernández2022Folliculininteracting). FNIP2 expression levels can serve as a biomarker for predicting BMI and obesity-related comorbidities (Fernández2022Folliculininteracting).

## Clinical Significance
The FNIP2 gene is associated with various metabolic and obesity-related phenotypes. A specific polymorphism, rs2291007, located in the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of FNIP2, has been linked to increased fat mass, visceral fatness, weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist and hip circumferences, as well as decreased muscle mass in individuals of European origin. The minor allele T of rs2291007 is associated with these phenotypes and is a target for miR-181b-5p binding, which regulates its expression (Fernández2022Folliculininteracting).

The study by Fernández et al. demonstrated that individuals with the TT genotype of rs2291007 showed decreased FNIP2 expression, which was linked to various metabolic parameters, including weight, BMI, and fat mass. This decreased expression suggests that FNIP2 could serve as a marker for metabolic alterations (Fernández2022Folliculininteracting). In mouse models, the T-to-C change in the FNIP2 gene correlated with decreased fat content and altered gene expression related to adipogenesis and fatty acid metabolism, indicating FNIP2's significant role in metabolic regulation and obesity (Fernández2022Folliculininteracting). The findings suggest that FNIP2 expression in blood could be a potential biomarker for predicting BMI and related metabolic traits (Fernández2022Folliculininteracting).

## Interactions
FNIP2 (folliculin interacting protein 2) is involved in several protein interactions, primarily as a co-chaperone in the Hsp90 chaperone cycle. It interacts with the molecular chaperone Hsp90 and its co-chaperones, including p23, HOP, and Cdc37, as well as with Hsp70 and various Hsp90 client proteins such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), B-Raf, Cdk4, and FLCN (folliculin) (Woodford2016The). FNIP2 forms homo- and heterodimers with FNIP1, which also bind to Hsp90 and FLCN (Woodford2016The). 

FNIP2 plays a role in the 'loading' of FLCN and potentially other client proteins onto Hsp90, crucial for FLCN stability (Woodford2016The). It competes with the co-chaperone Aha1 for binding to Hsp90, affecting the chaperone cycle and drug sensitivity (Woodford2016The). FNIP2 also interacts with AMPK, a central metabolic regulator, and this interaction is independent of FLCN (de2020Nutrient). 

FNIP2's interaction with Hsp90 is influenced by posttranslational modifications, similar to other co-chaperones like Aha1 (Woodford2016The). It is involved in nutrient signaling and lysosome positioning through its interaction with Rag and Rab GTPases, which are crucial for mTORC1 signaling (de2020Nutrient).
