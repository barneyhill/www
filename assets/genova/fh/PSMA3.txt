# PSMA3

## Overview
The PSMA3 gene encodes the proteasome 20S subunit alpha 3, a critical component of the 20S core particle within the proteasome complex. This protein is categorized as a proteolytic enzyme subunit, playing a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and cellular regulation. The PSMA3 protein contributes to both ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent proteolysis, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis and influencing various cellular processes such as metabolism, RNA processing, and cytoskeletal dynamics (Fedorova2011Proteomic). Structurally, PSMA3 is integral to the cylindrical architecture of the 20S proteasome, where it regulates substrate entry and interacts with other subunits to form a functional proteolytic core (Steinberger2023Method; Löwe1995Crystal). The gene's expression and function have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where alterations in PSMA3 are linked to drug resistance and poor prognosis (Li2021Integrated; Zhuang2018ExosomeTransmitted).

## Structure
The PSMA3 protein, also known as proteasome 20S subunit alpha 3, is a component of the 20S core particle of the proteasome complex. Its primary structure consists of 255 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 28,400 Da and an isoelectric point of 5.19 (Elenich1999The). The secondary structure of PSMA3 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of proteasome subunits, which contribute to its stability and function (Löwe1995Crystal).

In terms of tertiary structure, PSMA3 forms part of the cylindrical architecture of the 20S proteasome, with its alpha subunits located at the ends of the cylinder, playing a crucial role in substrate entry regulation (Löwe1995Crystal). The quaternary structure involves its assembly into the larger proteasome complex, where it interacts with other proteasome subunits to form a functional proteolytic core (Steinberger2023Method).

PSMA3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including acetylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions within the proteasome complex (Vimer2020Comparative). These modifications and its structural features are essential for its role in protein degradation and cellular regulation.

## Function
The PSMA3 gene encodes the alpha 7 subunit of the 20S proteasome, a core component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for protein degradation. This subunit is involved in both ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent proteolysis, playing a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis within cells (Livinskaya2014Immunoaffinity; Fedorova2011Proteomic). PSMA3 is particularly important in the ubiquitin-independent pathway, where it facilitates the degradation of proteins such as ornithine decarboxylase, p21WAF1/CIP1, and the tumor suppressor pRb (Fedorova2011Proteomic).

PSMA3 interacts with a wide range of proteins involved in various cellular processes, including metabolism, RNA splicing and processing, cytoskeleton structure, DNA repair, transcription, replication, and translation. These interactions suggest that PSMA3 has roles beyond protein degradation, potentially influencing mRNA metabolism and cytoskeletal dynamics (Fedorova2011Proteomic). The PSMA3 subunit is also implicated in the regulation of alternative splicing of the SMN2 gene, which is crucial for neuron apoptosis control (Fedorova2011Proteomic).

The C-terminal region of PSMA3 is essential for the structural and functional integrity of the 26S proteasome, as it interacts with intrinsically disordered proteins and regulates the capping of the 20S core particle by the 19S regulatory particle (Steinberger2023Method).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of PSMA3, the proteasome 20S subunit alpha 3, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In multiple myeloma, PSMA3 is associated with resistance to proteasome inhibitors (PIs) such as bortezomib. Exosome-mediated transfer of PSMA3 and its antisense RNA, PSMA3-AS1, from mesenchymal stem cells to myeloma cells enhances proteasome activity, contributing to drug resistance. High PSMA3 expression in CD138+ myeloma cells correlates with decreased progression-free survival and overall survival, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker in patients undergoing bortezomib therapy (Zhuang2018ExosomeTransmitted).

In thyroid hemiagenesis, recurrent deletions in the PSMA3 gene have been identified, suggesting that these genetic alterations may contribute to the development of the condition. The study highlights the potential role of proteasome-related gene mutations in thyroid development (Budny2017Mutations).

PSMA3 expression is also linked to poor survival outcomes in certain cancers, such as kidney chromophobe (KICH), where it is considered a risky factor. The gene's expression levels are associated with the immune microenvironment, showing negative associations with certain immune cells (Li2021Integrated). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PSMA3 in cancer progression and treatment resistance.

## Interactions
PSMA3, a subunit of the 20S proteasome, interacts with a wide array of proteins involved in various cellular processes. It forms complexes with other proteasome subunits such as PSMA1 and PSMA7, and interacts with regulatory particles like REGĮ/ȕ (PA28Į/ȕ) for proteasomal activation (SánchezLanzas2014Proteins). PSMA3 also binds to proteins involved in RNA metabolism, including splicing factors and RNA helicases like hnRNP A2/B1 and Ddx5, suggesting a link between the proteasome and mRNA metabolism (Fedorova2011Proteomic).

In the cytoplasm, PSMA3 interacts with cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and actin-binding proteins (ACTN2 and ACTN4), as well as translation elongation factors eEF-1alpha and eEF-2 (Fedorova2011Proteomic). It also engages in ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation (UIPD) pathways, interacting with proteins like p21WAF1/CIP1, where it facilitates degradation in conjunction with MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase (SánchezLanzas2014Proteins).

PSMA3's interaction with Cables1 is notable for its role in stabilizing the p21 protein by inhibiting PSMA3-mediated degradation, highlighting its involvement in cell cycle regulation and potential tumor suppressor functions (Shi2014Cables1).
