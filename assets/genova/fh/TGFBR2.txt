# TGFBR2

## Overview
The TGFBR2 gene encodes the transforming growth factor beta receptor 2, a serine/threonine kinase receptor that plays a pivotal role in the TGF-β signaling pathway. This receptor is integral to numerous cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. TGFBR2 is characterized by its ability to bind TGF-β ligands, forming a heteromeric complex with the type I receptor (TGFBR1), which is essential for downstream signaling events. The receptor's kinase activity facilitates the phosphorylation of SMAD proteins, which subsequently translocate to the nucleus to modulate gene expression. TGFBR2 is also involved in noncanonical signaling pathways, influencing cellular functions such as cell polarity and actin dynamics. Mutations in the TGFBR2 gene are associated with various pathological conditions, including connective tissue disorders like Marfan syndrome type 2 and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, as well as certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Heldin2016Signaling; Singh2006TGFBR1andTGFBR2mutations; Wrana1992TGFβ).

## Structure
The TGFBR2 protein is a serine/threonine kinase receptor involved in the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Its primary structure includes a signal peptide, an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain (Tebben2016Crystal). The kinase domain is organized into two subdomains: the N-lobe, primarily composed of beta-strands, and the C-lobe, composed of alpha-helices (Zimmermann2017Molecular). The αC-helix in the N-lobe is a key regulatory component, and the interface between the N- and C-lobes contains a pocket where ATP binds, facilitating phosphorylation (Zimmermann2017Molecular).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, with the kinase domain exhibiting a closed conformation typical of activated kinase structures (Tebben2016Crystal). The quaternary structure may involve dimerization, as TGFBR2 forms a heterotetramer with TGFBR1 upon ligand binding, which is crucial for its signaling function (Tebben2016Crystal). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which is essential for its kinase activity (Zimmermann2017Molecular).

Splice variants of TGFBR2 can lead to different isoforms with distinct functional properties, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context (Zimmermann2017Molecular).

## Function
TGFBR2, or transforming growth factor beta receptor 2, is a critical component of the TGF-β signaling pathway in human cells. It functions as a serine/threonine kinase receptor that binds TGF-β ligands with high affinity, initiating a cascade of molecular events essential for various cellular processes. Upon ligand binding, TGFBR2 forms a heteromeric complex with the type I receptor (TGFBR1), which is necessary for effective signaling. This complex formation is crucial for the phosphorylation and activation of SMAD proteins, which translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression (Heldin2016Signaling; Wrana1992TGFβ).

TGFBR2's kinase activity is essential for signaling, although it is not required for ligand binding or complex formation with TGFBR1. The receptor is involved in regulating cell cycle progression, differentiation, adhesion, migration, and extracellular matrix production, impacting tissue development and repair (Heldin2016Signaling; Wrana1992TGFβ). TGFBR2 also plays a role in maintaining cellular functions such as cell polarity and actin dynamics by phosphorylating substrates like the polarity complex protein Par6, which affects the dynamics of tight junctions and actin filaments (Heldin2016Signaling). These activities underscore TGFBR2's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TGFBR2 gene are associated with several connective tissue disorders and cardiovascular conditions. Notably, TGFBR2 mutations are linked to Marfan syndrome type 2 (MFS2) and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), both of which are characterized by features such as aortic aneurysms, skeletal abnormalities, and craniofacial anomalies (Singh2006TGFBR1andTGFBR2mutations; Loeys2005A). In Loeys-Dietz syndrome, mutations often result in increased TGF-beta signaling, leading to symptoms like hypertelorism, bifid uvula, and arterial tortuosity (Loeys2005A; Loeys2006Aneurysma).

TGFBR2 mutations are also implicated in familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD), where they account for approximately 5% of cases. These mutations typically affect the serine-threonine kinase domain, disrupting normal signaling and leading to progressive aortic enlargement (Pannu2005Mutations).

In addition to connective tissue disorders, TGFBR2 mutations are found in various cancers, including colon and gastric cancers. These mutations often result in truncated, inactive protein products, particularly involving mutations in a polyadenosine tract known as the BatII region (Frederic2008A). The UMD-TGFBR2 database catalogs these mutations to facilitate understanding of their clinical significance (Frederic2008A).

## Interactions
TGFBR2, a key component of the TGF-β signaling pathway, engages in various interactions with other proteins that modulate its signaling capabilities. It forms a receptor complex with TGFBR1, which is essential for the phosphorylation and activation of SMAD proteins, leading to their translocation to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription (Xu2012Post‐translational). TGFBR2 also interacts with TGF-β-receptor-interacting protein 1 (TRIP-1), which binds to the ligand-bound TGFBR2 and is phosphorylated by it, potentially repressing TGF-β-induced transcription (Derynck2003Smad-dependent).

The receptor is involved in endocytic processes, where it is internalized through clathrin-coated pits, a process facilitated by the adaptor protein β2-adaptin, linking it to the AP-2 subunit of clathrin (Xu2012Post‐translational). TGFBR2 also interacts with BUB1, a protein that is phosphorylated at Ser318 by TGFBR2, affecting the assembly and disassembly of the receptor complex and influencing SMAD2 and SMAD3 phosphorylation (Nyati2020TGFBR2).

In the context of noncanonical signaling, TGFBR2 mutations can lead to the activation of alternative pathways, such as the TRAF6/TAK1/p38 MAPK cascade, which bypasses SMAD proteins and is implicated in craniofacial development (Iwata2012Modulation).
