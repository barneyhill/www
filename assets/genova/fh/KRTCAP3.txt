# KRTCAP3

## Overview
KRTCAP3, or keratinocyte-associated protein 3, is a gene that encodes a protein believed to function as an integral membrane protein. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly those related to membrane function and signaling. The KRTCAP3 protein is predominantly expressed in keratinocytes, the main cell type in the epidermis, and is thought to play a crucial role in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, thereby contributing to skin integrity and function (Warrick2017Morphological). Beyond its dermatological implications, KRTCAP3 has been identified in genome-wide association studies as a candidate gene influencing adiposity, with potential effects on food consumption and insulin sensitivity, highlighting its broader physiological significance (Górska2023GenomeWide; Szalanczy2022Keratinocyteassociated). Further research is needed to elucidate its precise functions and mechanisms in both normal physiology and disease contexts.

## Function
KRTCAP3 (keratinocyte-associated protein 3) is a gene that encodes a protein predicted to be an integral membrane protein, suggesting its involvement in cellular processes related to membrane function and signaling. It is highly expressed in various human tissues, including the skin, digestive tract, sex organs, and glands, indicating a broad role in physiological processes (Górska2023GenomeWide; Szalanczy2022Keratinocyteassociated).

In the skin, KRTCAP3 is preferentially expressed in keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis, and is associated with keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. This suggests a role in maintaining skin integrity and function, potentially through involvement in cell adhesion and signaling pathways within the epidermal layer (Warrick2017Morphological).

KRTCAP3 has also been identified as a candidate adiposity gene in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in both humans and rats, indicating its potential involvement in body weight regulation and adiposity. Studies in rats have shown that KRTCAP3 influences food consumption and insulin sensitivity, with notable sex differences in these effects (Górska2023GenomeWide; Szalanczy2022Keratinocyteassociated). However, its precise function in healthy human cells and its role in obesity remain areas for further research.
