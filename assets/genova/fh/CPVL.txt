# CPVL

## Overview
The CPVL gene encodes the carboxypeptidase vitellogenic-like protein, a serine carboxypeptidase primarily expressed in human macrophages. This enzyme is involved in the proteolytic digestion of lysosomal components, playing a crucial role in the immune response by aiding in the breakdown and recycling of proteins within the cell. The CPVL protein is characterized by a 476-amino-acid sequence, including a putative signal peptide, and shares significant sequence similarity with other serine carboxypeptidases, such as the vitellogenic carboxypeptidase from Aedes aegypti (Mahoney2001Cloning). It is primarily cell-associated, with a small portion secreted, and is likely localized in lysosomes (Mahoney2001Cloning). CPVL's interactions with proteins like Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) suggest its involvement in signaling pathways that influence immune and possibly non-immune functions (Yang2021CPVL). The gene's expression in non-immune tissues, such as the heart and kidney, indicates potential roles beyond the immune system, possibly related to cardiovascular homeostasis (Mahoney2001Cloning).

## Structure
The CPVL protein is a novel serine carboxypeptidase identified in human macrophages. It consists of 476 amino acids and includes a 22-amino-acid putative signal peptide, indicating it may be secreted or retained in an organelle, as it lacks transmembrane domains (Mahoney2001Cloning). The protein sequence contains four potential N-linked glycosylation sites, suggesting post-translational modifications that could affect its function or stability (Mahoney2001Cloning).

CPVL shares significant sequence similarity with other serine carboxypeptidases, particularly the vitellogenic carboxypeptidase from Aedes aegypti, with 43% identity at the protein level (Mahoney2001Cloning). The protein includes an intact active site catalytic triad (Ser-204, Asp-388, His-448) within the PROSITE serine carboxypeptidase motif, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Mahoney2001Cloning).

The protein appears as a single polypeptide chain, with a molecular weight of approximately 57 kDa, although it is detected as a 67 kDa band in transfected cells and a 58 kDa band in primary macrophages, possibly due to propeptide removal or different glycosylation patterns (Mahoney2001Cloning). The study does not provide detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of CPVL.

## Function
The CPVL gene encodes a serine carboxypeptidase that is primarily expressed in human macrophages, where it plays a role in several molecular processes. CPVL is involved in the proteolytic digestion of lysosomal components, which is crucial for the breakdown and recycling of proteins within the cell (Mahoney2001Cloning). This activity is important for the immune response, as it aids in the digestion of phagocytosed particles, potentially participating in an inflammatory protease cascade and trimming peptides for antigen presentation (Mahoney2001Cloning).

The CPVL protein is expressed during the maturation of monocytes into macrophages, indicating its specific role in mature macrophages (Mahoney2001Cloning). It is primarily cell-associated, with a small portion secreted, and is likely localized in lysosomes, where it may contribute to the degradation of proteins and other macromolecules (Mahoney2001Cloning). Although its enzymatic activity has not been fully demonstrated, the presence of an intact catalytic triad supports its function as a carboxypeptidase (Mahoney2001Cloning). CPVL's expression in non-immune tissues such as the heart and kidney suggests potential roles outside the immune system, possibly related to cardiovascular homeostasis (Mahoney2001Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
The CPVL gene is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or mutations. In glioma, a type of brain tumor, CPVL is significantly upregulated, correlating with advanced clinical grades and poor prognosis. Its overexpression promotes tumorigenicity and inhibits apoptosis in glioma cells by interacting with the BTK/p300 axis to suppress the STAT1 signaling pathway, which is known for its tumor suppressor functions. Silencing CPVL in glioma cells enhances apoptosis and reduces proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yang2021CPVL).

CPVL is also associated with diabetic retinopathy in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. Genetic variants, particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the CPVL/CHN2 locus, have been linked to an increased risk of this microvascular complication. The SNP rs39059, for instance, shows a significant association with diabetic retinopathy, highlighting a genetic component in the disease's development (Hu2011CPVLCHN2).

Additionally, CPVL is highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues, although its specific role in this cancer type remains unclear (Yang2021CPVL). These findings suggest that CPVL may serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
The CPVL protein is known to physically interact with several other proteins, including Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), TARA, MICA, PQBP1, and VAPA. These interactions were identified through affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis, where lysates of U251 cells expressing FLAG-tagged CPVL were subjected to FLAG affinity purification. The eluates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and silver stained, revealing these interactions. Immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody followed by immunoblotting confirmed that these proteins were efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with CPVL. Further GST pull-down experiments supported the physical association between CPVL and these proteins, particularly highlighting a direct interaction with BTK (Yang2021CPVL).

CPVL's interaction with BTK is significant as it influences BTK's phosphorylation state. While CPVL downregulation does not affect BTK's mRNA or total protein levels, it decreases the phosphorylation level of BTK. This interaction is crucial because BTK is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase involved in the Tec family, and its phosphorylation state is important for its function (Yang2021CPVL). CPVL also interacts with BTK to downregulate STAT1 phosphorylation by promoting p300-mediated STAT1 acetylation, which is a key mechanism in glioma progression (Yang2021CPVL).
