# RTP5

## Overview
RTP5, or receptor transporter protein 5, is a gene that encodes a putative protein involved in the transport and functional expression of certain receptors. The RTP5 protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, which suggests its role in facilitating the movement of molecules across cellular membranes. Although the precise biological functions of RTP5 remain to be fully elucidated, it is hypothesized to play a role in the modulation of receptor activity, potentially influencing various signaling pathways. The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are subjects of ongoing research, with implications for understanding its role in cellular processes and potential links to disease states.
