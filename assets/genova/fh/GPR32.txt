# GPR32

## Overview
GPR32 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 32, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is integral to cellular signaling processes. This receptor is primarily involved in the resolution of inflammation, acting as a key mediator in anti-inflammatory pathways. GPR32 is activated by lipid mediators such as Resolvin D1 (RvD1), which promote a pro-resolution phenotype in macrophages, thereby reducing inflammation and enhancing phagocytosis. The receptor's activation triggers intracellular signaling cascades, including calcium release, which are essential for its function in immune regulation. GPR32 is expressed in various macrophage states and is implicated in several diseases characterized by chronic inflammation, such as atherosclerosis and certain cancers, where it may serve as a potential therapeutic target (Schmid2016Resolvin; Arnardottir2021The; schmid2015role).

## Function
GPR32, a G protein-coupled receptor, plays a significant role in the resolution of inflammation in human cells. It is activated by the lipid mediator Resolvin D1 (RvD1), which induces a pro-resolution phenotype in macrophages. This activation leads to a reduction in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, decreased chemotaxis, and enhanced phagocytosis of microbial particles (Schmid2016Resolvin; schmid2015role). GPR32 is expressed on the surface of resting, M1, and M2 polarized macrophages, and its expression is not significantly altered by classical polarization stimuli, although it is reduced by IL-6 and TGF-β (Schmid2016Resolvin; schmid2015role).

The receptor's activation by RvD1 also triggers intracellular calcium release, which is crucial for its role in inflammation resolution (Schmid2016Resolvin). GPR32's involvement in these processes suggests its potential therapeutic application in diseases characterized by chronic inflammation, such as atherosclerosis, by promoting the re-polarization of macrophages from a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to a M2-like phenotype (Arnardottir2021The; schmid2015role). This receptor is not present in mice, highlighting its unique role in human inflammation resolution (Schmid2016Resolvin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GPR32 gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly those involving chronic inflammation and cardiovascular disorders. In the context of atherosclerosis, GPR32 expression is significantly reduced in human atherosclerotic lesions compared to healthy arteries. This reduction correlates with increased inflammation and atheroprogression, suggesting that dysregulated GPR32 expression contributes to the impaired resolution of inflammation in atherosclerosis (Arnardottir2021The).

The GPR32 receptor is involved in mediating proresolving signaling pathways, which are crucial for reducing inflammation and promoting atheroprotection. Studies using transgenic mouse models expressing human GPR32 have shown that GPR32 signaling can attenuate atherosclerosis by enhancing macrophage phagocytosis and reducing proinflammatory cytokine levels (Arnardottir2021The).

In addition to cardiovascular implications, GPR32 has been implicated in cancer biology. It plays a role in inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung cancer cells, a process associated with cancer metastasis. The action of resolvin D1 (RvD1) through GPR32 helps suppress EMT, indicating a potential therapeutic role in cancer treatment (Lee2013Resolvin).

## Interactions
GPR32, a G protein-coupled receptor, is primarily known for its interaction with the lipid mediator Resolvin D1 (RvD1). This interaction is crucial for mediating anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects in human macrophages. The binding of RvD1 to GPR32 triggers a signaling cascade that includes the release of intracellular calcium, which is essential for the receptor's function in reducing chemotaxis and enhancing phagocytosis of microbial particles (Schmid2016Resolvin). 

GPR32 also interacts with β-arrestin, a protein that plays a role in receptor signaling pathways. This interaction is part of the mechanism by which RvD1 and lipoxin A4 (LXA4) exert their effects, leading to anti-inflammatory outcomes (Zarrough2022Resolvin). 

In the context of periodontal ligament fibroblasts, GPR32 expression is upregulated in response to RvD1 and IL-1β treatments, as confirmed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. This suggests that GPR32 may participate in modulating fibroblast function and inflammation resolution (Zarrough2022Resolvin). 

While specific details on the physical interactions of GPR32 with other proteins or nucleic acids are limited, its role in signaling pathways and interaction with β-arrestin highlight its importance in immune regulation and inflammation resolution.
