# PRORP

## Overview
The PRORP gene encodes the protein-only RNase P catalytic subunit, a crucial component of the human mitochondrial RNase P complex. This protein is primarily involved in the processing of precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA) molecules within mitochondria, a vital step for the maturation of tRNA necessary for mitochondrial protein synthesis. PRORP is characterized by its unique structure, which includes a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) domain and a metallonuclease domain, forming a V-shaped conformation essential for its catalytic function. The protein operates as part of a multi-subunit complex, interacting with TRMT10C and SDR5C1 to enhance its cleavage efficiency. Mutations in the PRORP gene have been linked to Perrault syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in mitochondrial function and cellular health (Hochberg2017A; Gobert2013Structural; Bhatta2021Structural).

## Structure
The PRORP protein, a catalytic subunit of RNase P, is characterized by a distinct molecular structure that includes several key domains. The primary structure of PRORP consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its complex architecture. The secondary structure is predominantly composed of alpha-helices, with a significant portion of the protein adopting this conformation (Gobert2013Structural).

The tertiary structure of PRORP reveals a V-shaped conformation, which is crucial for its function. This structure is formed by the interaction of the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) domain and the metallonuclease domain. The PPR domain is involved in RNA binding, while the metallonuclease domain contains the active site necessary for catalysis (Gobert2013Structural; Karasik2016Nuclear). A zinc-binding motif, involving conserved cysteine and histidine residues, connects these domains and is essential for maintaining structural integrity (Gobert2013Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, PRORP2 is observed as a monomer in solution, despite forming dimers in crystal structures, suggesting that dimerization is not physiologically relevant (Karasik2016Nuclear). The protein's structure is further stabilized by a zinc-binding site, which, while not directly involved in catalysis, is important for the overall structural integrity (Karasik2016Nuclear).

## Function
The PRORP protein, also known as MRPP3, is a catalytic subunit of the human mitochondrial RNase P complex, which is crucial for processing the 5′ ends of precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA) molecules in mitochondria. This processing involves cleaving the 5′ leader sequence from pre-tRNA, a necessary step for the maturation of tRNA molecules, which are essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis and overall cellular function (Hochberg2017A; Bhatta2021Structural). 

PRORP operates as part of a three-subunit complex that includes TRMT10C and SDR5C1. These accessory subunits enhance the cleavage efficiency by interacting with PRORP, inducing conformational changes that optimize the positioning of PRORP's nuclease domain on the tRNA's acceptor stem (Vilardo2023Cleavage). The PRORP protein adopts an open conformation necessary for accommodating the pre-tRNA substrate, stabilized by interactions with the TRMT10C-SDR5C1 complex and the RNA (Bhatta2021Structural). 

The active site of PRORP coordinates two metal ions required for endonucleolytic cleavage, positioning the scissile phosphodiester bond for precise cleavage (Bhatta2021Structural). This function is essential for the proper processing of mitochondrial tRNAs, which is critical for mitochondrial protein synthesis and overall cellular function (Vilardo2023Cleavage).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRORP gene, specifically the p.Ala485Val variant, are associated with Perrault syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and primary ovarian insufficiency. This variant is located in the metallonuclease domain of PRORP and affects its catalytic activity by impairing metal ion coordination, leading to reduced endonucleolytic activity. This results in impaired mitochondrial tRNA processing, contributing to mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiencies and the clinical manifestations of Perrault syndrome (Hochberg2017A).

The presence of PRORP in the organ of Corti, particularly in hair cell synapses and neurons, suggests its role in mitochondrial tRNA processing and translation, which is crucial for hair cell function. The study of PRORP localization in mice indicates its involvement in hearing, supporting the link between PRORP mutations and hearing loss in Perrault syndrome (Hochberg2017A).

Patient fibroblasts with the PRORP mutation show increased levels of mitochondrial precursor transcripts, which can be reduced by transfection with the wild type KIAA0391 sequence, indicating a potential therapeutic approach for addressing the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by PRORP mutations (Hochberg2017A).
