# C21orf140

## Overview
C21orf140 is a gene located on chromosome 21 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 21 open reading frame 140. While the specific biological function of this protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in various cellular processes and responses. The protein does not currently belong to a well-defined category such as kinases or receptors, and its role in cellular pathways is still under investigation. Research has suggested potential involvement in treatment responses, particularly in the context of cancer therapies, although further studies are required to confirm these associations (Chiricosta2019Moringin; Zeng2022Tumor). The gene's consistent copy number across different populations indicates its stability in the human genome, yet its precise clinical significance is still being explored (Chen2024Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the C21orf140 gene is not fully established, but some studies have begun to explore its potential implications. In the context of gastric cancer, mutations in C21orf140 have been associated with resistance to hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Specifically, mutations in this gene were found in patients who did not benefit from HIPEC, suggesting a negative correlation with treatment response. However, due to the small sample size, these findings require further validation before C21orf140 can be considered a definitive predictive marker for HIPEC efficacy (Zeng2022Tumor).

In another study, C21orf140 was expressed in human periodontal ligament stem cells treated with moringin, but not in untreated cells. This suggests a potential role in cellular responses to certain treatments, although its exact function and clinical implications remain unclear (Chiricosta2019Moringin).

Additionally, genome-wide profiling has indicated that C21orf140 maintains a consistent copy number across populations, which suggests it is not a false duplication in the reference genome. However, the clinical significance of this finding has not been directly addressed (Chen2024Genomewide). Further research is needed to elucidate the role of C21orf140 in disease and treatment contexts.
