# RBM5

## Overview
RBM5 (RNA binding motif protein 5) is a gene that encodes a nuclear RNA binding protein involved in the regulation of RNA processing, particularly alternative splicing. The protein, also referred to as RBM5, is characterized by its multi-domain structure, which includes RNA recognition motifs, zinc finger domains, and an OCtamer REpeat (OCRE) domain, among others. These domains facilitate its interactions with RNA and other proteins, playing a crucial role in modulating gene expression and influencing cellular processes such as apoptosis and cell cycle progression. As a tumor suppressor, RBM5 is implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and has been associated with various cancers, notably lung cancer, where its expression is often altered. The protein's ability to influence the splicing of apoptosis-related genes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Sutherland2004RNA; Bechara2013RBM5; Mourão2016Structural).

## Structure
RBM5 is a multi-domain protein involved in RNA processing and regulation, particularly in alternative splicing. The protein contains several distinct domains, including two RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2), two zinc finger domains (ZnF1 and ZnF2), an OCtamer REpeat (OCRE) domain, a glycine-rich domain, and KEKE (lysine/glutamate) repeats (Soni2020Conformational; Mourão2016Structural).

The RRM domains of RBM5 exhibit a canonical fold, characterized by a β1-α1-β2-β3-α2-β4 topology, with two α-helices packed against a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, forming a hydrophobic core (Song2012Solution). The ZnF1 domain belongs to the RanBP2-type zinc finger family, featuring a compact fold with two distorted β-hairpins and a zinc ion coordinated by cysteine residues (Soni2020Conformational; Farina2011Targeting).

The OCRE domain of RBM5 adopts a unique beta-sheet fold, consisting of six β-strands forming a twisted β-sheet, with aromatic side chains exposed on opposite surfaces. This domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly with the proline-rich sequences of SmN/B/B' proteins, influencing splicing regulation (Mourão2016Structural).

RBM5 is known to have several splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity. The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions.

## Function
RBM5 (RNA binding motif protein 5) is a nuclear RNA binding protein that plays a significant role in regulating apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and tumor suppression in healthy human cells. It is involved in RNA splicing, a critical process for gene expression regulation, by influencing the inclusion of cassette-exons in genes such as caspase-2, c-FLIP, and NUMB, which can lead to the production of protein variants with increased toxicity or pro-survival transcripts (Bechara2013RBM5; Jackson2020RNA). 

RBM5 enhances death receptor-mediated apoptosis and is known to modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53, thereby promoting apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (Sutherland2004RNA; Kobayashi2010p53). It is a phosphoprotein with multiple phosphorylation sites, and its phosphorylation status is linked to its function in apoptosis regulation (Shu2006The). 

RBM5 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with RNA to modulate gene expression, impacting cellular growth and differentiation (Sutherland2004RNA). Its role in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Sutherland2004RNA).

## Clinical Significance
RBM5 (RNA binding motif protein 5) is a tumor suppressor gene with significant clinical implications in various cancers, particularly lung cancer. Alterations in RBM5 expression are frequently observed in lung cancer, including both small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These alterations often result from deletions or loss of heterozygosity at the chromosomal region 3p21.3, where RBM5 is located (Xu2018Role; Oh20063p21.3). Reduced expression of RBM5 is associated with increased expression of oncogenes such as EGFR and KRAS, which are linked to tobacco use and advanced tumor stages (Liang2012Differential; Xu2018Role).

RBM5's role in regulating apoptosis and cell cycle arrest is crucial for its tumor suppressor function. Its downregulation is linked to more aggressive cancer phenotypes and metastasis in solid tumors (Bechara2013RBM5; Loiselle2016RBM5). In SCLC, RBM5 expression increases sensitivity to cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug, suggesting its potential as a predictive marker for chemotherapy success (Loiselle2016RBM5).

RBM5 also influences alternative splicing of key apoptotic genes, such as caspase-2, promoting proapoptotic isoforms that contribute to its tumor suppressor activity (Fushimi2008Upregulation). These findings highlight RBM5's potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker for cancer diagnosis and treatment efficacy.

## Interactions
RBM5 (RNA binding motif protein 5) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in RNA splicing regulation. One of its key interactions is with the spliceosomal proteins SmN/B/B', mediated through its OCRE domain. This domain binds to the proline-rich C-terminal tails of these proteins, which are part of the Sm core associated with spliceosomal snRNPs, excluding U6. The interaction is characterized by aromatic-CH interactions, with specific tyrosine residues in the OCRE domain being critical for binding (Mourão2016Structural).

RBM5 also interacts with the U2 snRNP complex, engaging with intron branch sites on chromatin. This interaction is essential for its role as a splicing regulator, particularly in the context of apoptosis-related genes. The protein's involvement in the U2 snRNP complex suggests it may influence branch site selection and act as a splicing silencer (Damianov2023The).

Additionally, RBM5's RRM2 domain exhibits unusual RNA binding characteristics, showing a preference for specific RNA sequences. This domain's interaction with RNA is crucial for its role in RNA processing, particularly in the regulation of alternative splicing events (Song2012Solution).
