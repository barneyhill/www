# SAV1

## Overview
The SAV1 gene encodes the salvador family WW domain containing protein 1, a scaffold protein integral to the Hippo signaling pathway, which is pivotal in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and organ size. As a tumor suppressor, the SAV1 protein facilitates the activation of MST1/2 kinases by interacting with various proteins through its WW and SARAH domains, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Lin2020A; Bae2017SAV1). The protein's structural features, including its WW domain tandem and SARAH domain, enable it to form complexes essential for the Hippo pathway's function, influencing both cytoplasmic and nuclear activities (de2021The; Lin2020A). Dysregulation of SAV1 is implicated in several cancers, underscoring its clinical significance as a target for therapeutic intervention (Kowalczyk2023Impaired; Matsuura2011Downregulation).

## Structure
The SAV1 protein, encoded by the SAV1 gene, is a crucial component of the Hippo signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis. Structurally, SAV1 contains several key domains: an N-terminal flexible region, a middle WW domain tandem, and a C-terminal SARAH domain (de2021The; Lin2020A). The WW domains are small protein-protein interaction modules that bind proline-rich motifs in other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling (de2021The).

The WW12 tandem domain of SAV1 is involved in dimerization, forming a stable domain-swapped dimer essential for the MST/SAV1 complex assembly in the Hippo pathway (Lin2020A). The dimerization is mediated by an extension sequence following the WW2 domain, which includes conserved Pro-rich motifs that may form an autoinhibited structure (Lin2020A). The crystal structure of the SAV1 WW12ex homodimer reveals a V-shaped domain-swapped configuration, with the WW domains adopting an autoinhibited conformation (Lin2020A).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence SAV1's activity. For instance, phosphorylation of the Y273 residue may release autoinhibition, enhancing binding affinity to target proteins (Lin2020A). The SARAH domain of SAV1 forms a long antiparallel coiled coil with the SARAH domain of MST2, facilitating MST1/2 activation (Bae2017SAV1).

## Function
The SAV1 gene encodes a scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in the Hippo signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and organ size in mammals. In healthy human cells, SAV1 functions as a tumor suppressor by facilitating the interaction and activity of kinases within the Hippo pathway. It promotes the activation of the MST1/2 kinases by antagonizing the PP2A phosphatase STRIPAK, thereby preventing the dephosphorylation of MST2 and maintaining its activation (Bae2017SAV1). This activation leads to the phosphorylation of LATS1/2, which in turn phosphorylates the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ, resulting in their retention in the cytoplasm and inhibition of their transcriptional activities (de2021The; Lin2020A).

SAV1 contains several domains, including WW domains and a SARAH domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions critical for the Hippo pathway's function (de2021The; Lin2020A). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it helps control gene expression related to cell cycle and growth, maintaining tissue homeostasis (de2021The).

## Clinical Significance
The SAV1 gene plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of various cancers due to its involvement in the Hippo signaling pathway. In high-grade clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), downregulation of SAV1 is frequently observed, often due to copy number loss at chromosome 14q22.1. This downregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, contributing to the aggressive nature of high-grade ccRCC. The loss of SAV1 function leads to the activation of YAP1, a transcriptional regulator that acts as an oncoprotein, promoting tumorigenesis (Matsuura2011Downregulation).

In colorectal cancer, decreased expression of SAV1 is linked to increased tumor growth. SAV1 knockdown promotes cell growth, and its knockout in mice leads to the development of colonic polyps similar to human lesions (Kowalczyk2023Impaired). In liver cancer, SAV1 deletion is associated with the formation of multifocal liver tumors and increased expression of YAP target genes, correlating with poor prognosis (de2021The). In lung cancer, decreased SAV1 expression is linked to tumor progression through the activation of the Hedgehog/Gli1 signaling pathway (de2021The). These findings highlight the critical tumor suppressor role of SAV1 across various cancer types.

## Interactions
SAV1, also known as WW45, is a scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in the Hippo signaling pathway through its interactions with various proteins. SAV1 interacts with MST1/2 kinases via their SARAH domains, forming a heterodimer that is essential for MST1/2 activation. This interaction is facilitated by the formation of a heterotetramer through the dimerization of SAV1's WW domains (Bae2017SAV1). The N-terminal region of SAV1 is critical for binding to the FERM domain of NF2, which regulates MST2 activation (Bae2017SAV1).

SAV1 also interacts with the STRIPAK complex, specifically inhibiting the PP2A phosphatase, which protects MST2 from dephosphorylation and promotes its activation (Bae2017SAV1). The WW12 tandem of SAV1 forms a stable domain-swapped dimer, essential for the MST/SAV1 complex assembly and Hippo pathway activation (Lin2020A). SAV1's interaction with NPHP1/4 is crucial for ciliogenesis, as it facilitates the interaction between MST1 and NPHP1/4, affecting the localization of ciliary proteins (Kim2014The). These interactions highlight SAV1's role in regulating key signaling pathways and cellular processes.
