# CFAP157

## Overview
CFAP157, or cilia and flagella associated protein 157, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the function and structural organization of motile cilia and flagella. The CFAP157 protein is categorized as a structural protein, primarily localized at the basal body of cilia, where it interacts with tubulins and centrosomal proteins such as CEP350. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the stability and assembly of axonemes, the core structural components of cilia and flagella, which are essential for their motility and function (Weidemann2016CFAP157; Walz2017Role). The gene is expressed in tissues with motile cilia, including the epithelial cells of the fallopian tubes and respiratory tract, and is regulated by the transcription factor FOXJ1 (Ulrich2021Cellular; Weidemann2016CFAP157). Mutations in CFAP157 have been linked to impaired sperm motility and male infertility, highlighting its critical role in reproductive health (Weidemann2016CFAP157). The conservation of CFAP157 across species underscores its fundamental role in ciliary function and structure (Weidemann2016CFAP157).

## Function
CFAP157 is a protein involved in the function of motile cilia and flagella, which are essential for various physiological processes, including cell movement and fluid transport. In healthy human cells, CFAP157 is expressed in tissues with motile cilia, such as the epithelial cells of the fallopian tubes, where it plays a role in the movement of fluids and particles along epithelial surfaces (Ulrich2021Cellular). The protein is localized at the basal body of cilia, interacting with tubulins and the centrosomal protein CEP350, which suggests its involvement in the structural organization of cilia (Weidemann2016CFAP157).

CFAP157 is a downstream effector of the transcription factor FOXJ1, which regulates its expression in ciliated tissues (Weidemann2016CFAP157). The protein's role in ciliary function is crucial for maintaining proper ciliary structure and motility, impacting processes such as respiratory function and reproductive health. In particular, CFAP157 is important for the assembly and stability of axonemes, the core structural component of cilia and flagella, which is vital for their function (Walz2017Role). The conservation of CFAP157 across species suggests a similar function in human cells, potentially affecting ciliary structure and motility (Weidemann2016CFAP157).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP157 gene are associated with impaired sperm motility and male infertility. In mice, Cfap157 is crucial for flagellum morphogenesis and sperm motility, and its absence leads to infertility due to structural abnormalities in sperm, such as axonemal loops and supernumerary axonemal profiles (Weidemann2016CFAP157). These defects result in reduced sperm motility and inefficient attachment to the zona pellucida, contributing to infertility (Weidemann2016CFAP157). The gene's role in human male fertility is suggested by the conservation of CFAP157 protein between mice and humans, implying that mutations could lead to similar phenotypes in humans (Weidemann2016CFAP157).

The CFAP157 gene is also involved in the organization of the midpiece axoneme and the proper localization of the fibrous sheath and mitochondria in sperm. Its absence results in structural defects, such as expanded midpiece structures and fragmented cell membranes, which further contribute to reduced sperm stability and function (Weidemann2016CFAP157). Although the gene is expressed in various motile ciliated tissues, its dysfunction has not been directly linked to broader systemic conditions in the studied mice (Weidemann2016CFAP157).

## Interactions
CFAP157, encoded by the Cfap157 gene, is known to interact with several proteins, particularly those associated with ciliary and flagellar structures. In studies using HEK293T cells, CFAP157 was tagged and purified to identify interacting proteins through liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. This analysis revealed potential interactions with tubulins TUBA4A and TUBB5, as well as centrosomal proteins CEP350 and SSNA1. However, further coimmunoprecipitation assays in CHO cells confirmed interactions of CFAP157 with TUBA4A, TUBB5, and CEP350, but not with basigin and SSNA1 (Weidemann2016CFAP157).

CFAP157's interaction with CEP350 is particularly significant, as CEP350 is involved in microtubule stability and ciliogenesis. This interaction suggests that CFAP157 may play a role in these processes, potentially contributing to the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella (Weidemann2016CFAP157). The localization of CFAP157 at ciliary basal bodies and its co-expression with Cep350 in tissues such as the brain, lung, and testis further supports its involvement in ciliary function (Weidemann2016CFAP157). Despite these findings, specific physical interactions with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies.
