# UBE2A

## Overview
UBE2A is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 A, a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This enzyme is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through ubiquitination, a process that tags proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein homeostasis, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression. UBE2A is categorized as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and is known for its interactions with various proteins, including ubiquitin ligases such as RAD18 and UBR4, which are essential for its function in cellular processes. Mutations in the UBE2A gene are associated with X-linked intellectual disability type Nascimento, highlighting its significance in neurodevelopmental health (Czeschik2013Xlinked; BarnsbyGreer2024UBE2A; Hosseini2019E2).

## Structure
The UBE2A protein, a member of the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme family, consists of 152 amino acids and is involved in the ubiquitination process, which tags proteins for degradation. Its primary structure is highly similar to UBE2B, with a 95% sequence identity, suggesting they may be isoforms (Ramatenki2014Homology; Meghan2022Review).

The secondary structure of UBE2A includes four alpha helices and four beta strands, as identified by the PDBsum server (Ramatenki2014Homology). The tertiary structure was modeled using homology techniques due to the absence of experimental structures, with a high-quality model confirmed by a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.23 Å from its template protein (Ramatenki2014Homology). The model's quality was validated with 95.4% of residues in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and a 100% compatibility score in the Verify_3D plot (Ramatenki2014Homology).

UBE2A interacts with its natural substrate, ubiquitin ligase RAD18, through specific residues, including Ser25, Glu44, Gly45, and Asp50, which are crucial for its function (Ramatenki2014Homology). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in the ubiquitin proteasomal degradation pathway, a target for cancer therapy (Ramatenki2014Homology).

## Function
UBE2A, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for protein homeostasis, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulation in healthy human cells. It facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin from E1 activating enzymes to target proteins, often through E3 ubiquitin ligases, marking them for degradation by the proteasome (Ramatenki2014Homology; Alpi2016Mechanism). UBE2A is involved in the monoubiquitination of histone H2B, a process important for transcriptional regulation and DNA repair, particularly through its interaction with cyclin-dependent kinase-9 (CDK9), which phosphorylates UBE2A to enhance its activity (Shchebet2012Phosphorylation).

UBE2A is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, impacting various cellular functions. It interacts with the ubiquitin ligase RAD18 to facilitate polyubiquitination, a process vital for regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Ramatenki2014Homology; Hosseini2019E2). This enzyme is also associated with maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression, preventing tumor formation (Hosseini2019E2). UBE2A's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UBE2A gene are linked to a condition known as X-linked intellectual disability type Nascimento, or UBE2A deficiency syndrome. This disorder is characterized by a range of clinical features including moderate to severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, seizures, dysmorphic facial features, skin anomalies, and urogenital malformations (Czeschik2013Xlinked; Cordeddu2020Refinement). The syndrome is associated with various mutations in the UBE2A gene, such as missense mutations, nonsense mutations, and deletions, which can lead to a truncated or dysfunctional enzyme (Nascimento2006UBE2A; Budny2010Novel).

The phenotypic spectrum of UBE2A deficiency syndrome can vary significantly, with some individuals exhibiting additional features like congenital heart defects, pineal gland tumors, and hypogammaglobulinemia (Cordeddu2020Refinement). Carrier females are typically unaffected due to skewed X inactivation, although random X inactivation could potentially result in a clinical phenotype (Czeschik2013Xlinked). The condition is considered underdiagnosed, and advancements in genetic screening may reveal more cases and mutations (Czeschik2013Xlinked). UBE2A mutations are also implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting the gene's critical role in neuronal health and development (Nascimento2006UBE2A).

## Interactions
UBE2A, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination process. It is known to form a complex with the atypical E3 ligase module UBR4. This interaction is mediated by a hemiRING E2-binding module within UBR4, with specific UBE2A residues such as Arg7, Arg8, Arg11, Arg95, and Ser97 being critical for this engagement. Mutations in these residues can impair UBE2A's interaction with UBR4, affecting substrate ubiquitination and are linked to intellectual disability (BarnsbyGreer2024UBE2A).

UBE2A also interacts with the ubiquitin ligase RAD18, which is involved in DNA repair processes. This interaction is significant for polyubiquitination and cell cycle progression, highlighting UBE2A's role in cancer-related pathways (Ramatenki2014Homology). The protein's interaction with RAD18 involves specific binding residues such as Ser25, Glu44, Gly45, and Asp50, which are crucial for its activity (Ramatenki2014Homology).

The structural analysis of UBE2A in complex with UBR4 reveals that UBR4's atypical zinc finger domain, resembling SP-RING domains, facilitates interactions with UBE2A. This interaction enhances E2~Ub transfer activity through allosteric mechanisms, despite the absence of a linchpin residue (BarnsbyGreer2024UBE2A).
