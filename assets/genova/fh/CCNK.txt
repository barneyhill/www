# CCNK

## Overview
Cyclin K (CCNK) is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin K, a member of the cyclin family known for its role in regulating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Cyclin K is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation and maintaining genomic stability, functioning as a regulatory partner to CDK12 and CDK13. These interactions are crucial for the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, which is essential for transcriptional elongation and the expression of genes involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) (Blazek2011The). Cyclin K is characterized by its unique structural features, including two N-terminal cyclin box domains and a C-terminal proline-rich region, which facilitate its interactions with CDKs and other proteins (Cheng2012Interaction). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with neurodevelopmental disorders and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer, where alterations in CCNK expression can impact cell viability and proliferation (Colas2020Cyclindependent; Dieter2021Degradation).

## Structure
Cyclin K (CCNK) is a protein encoded by the CCNK gene, characterized by a 580-amino-acid sequence. It includes two N-terminal cyclin box domains and a C-terminal proline-rich region, which is conserved in metazoans and absent in the cyclin K2 isoform (Xiao2023Coming; Cheng2012Interaction). This proline-rich region may facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for regulating the function of CDK12/cyclin K1 complexes (Cheng2012Interaction).

Cyclin K exists in multiple isoforms, with cyclin K1 being the predominant form expressed in humans. Cyclin K1 and K2 share the first seven exons but differ in their splicing patterns, leading to distinct amino acid sequences (Cheng2012Interaction). Cyclin K1 predominantly interacts with CDK12 and CDK13, rather than CDK9, which was previously assumed to be its primary partner (Cheng2012Interaction).

The structural analysis of cyclin K indicates that its surface on the CDK9 binding interface differs significantly from cyclin T1, suggesting different affinities and biological roles (Cheng2012Interaction). Cyclin K's interaction with CDK12 involves an extensive interface, mediated by interactions between the CDK12 N-terminal lobe and the N-terminal region of cyclin K (Wood2018Structural).

## Function
Cyclin K (CCNK) is a crucial regulatory protein involved in transcriptional regulation and maintaining genomic stability in human cells. It primarily functions as a partner to cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), particularly CDK12 and CDK13, forming complexes that are essential for the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. This phosphorylation is vital for transcriptional elongation and the expression of genes involved in the DNA damage response (DDR), such as BRCA1, ATR, FANCI, and FANCD2 (Blazek2011The).

Cyclin K is predominantly associated with CDK12, and this interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of specific serine residues on the RNA polymerase II CTD, which affects gene expression and alternative splicing (Cheng2012Interaction). The CycK/CDK12 complex plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by regulating the expression of DDR genes, and its depletion leads to increased sensitivity to DNA damage and spontaneous DNA damage signaling (Blazek2011The).

Cyclin K is active in the nucleus, where it stabilizes CDK12 and CDK13, ensuring proper transcriptional regulation and cellular response to DNA damage (Blazek2011The). Its essential role is underscored by the fact that genetic inactivation of cyclin K in mice results in early embryonic lethality (Blazek2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCNK gene, which encodes cyclin K, are associated with a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by facial dysmorphism and impaired intellectual, motor, and language skills. This disorder is linked to de novo heterozygous changes in CCNK, including specific deletions in the 14q32.3 region and a missense mutation (K111E) that affects the interaction interfaces with CDK13 and CDK12. These mutations likely destabilize the complexes and inhibit both kinases, suggesting haploinsufficiency as the pathogenic mechanism (Colas2020Cyclindependent).

Alterations in CCNK expression are also implicated in cancer. In colorectal cancer, the degradation of the CCNK/CDK12 complex is considered a druggable vulnerability. The compound NCT02 targets CCNK, leading to the degradation of CDK12, which is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of DNA damage repair genes. This degradation results in decreased viability of certain colorectal cancer cell lines, particularly those with TP53 mutations and CMS4 classification, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Dieter2021Degradation).

In prostate cancer, cyclin K depletion results in apoptosis and inhibits proliferation, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Żuryń2021The).

## Interactions
Cyclin K (CCNK) is known to interact with several cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), forming distinct complexes that play crucial roles in transcription regulation and genomic stability. Cyclin K primarily associates with CDK12 and CDK13, forming the CycK/CDK12 and CycK/CDK13 complexes. These complexes are essential for the expression of DNA damage response (DDR) genes and the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, which is vital for transcription elongation and proper splicing of long genes (Blazek2011The; Cheng2012Interaction).

Cyclin K does not interact with CDK9, distinguishing it from other cyclins like CycT1, which do associate with CDK9 (Blazek2011The; Cheng2012Interaction). The interaction with CDK12 is particularly significant, as it modulates gene expression through RNA Pol II activity and maintains genomic stability by regulating DDR gene expression (Blazek2011The; Cheng2012Interaction).

Cyclin K also interacts with the large subunit of RNA polymerase II in certain cell types, as evidenced by its association with phosphorylated forms of RNAP II (Edwards1998Human). These interactions highlight Cyclin K's role in transcription regulation and its potential implications in cancer therapy (Xiao2023Coming).
