# INTS10

## Overview
INTS10 is a gene that encodes the protein integrator complex subunit 10, which is a crucial component of the integrator complex in eukaryotic cells. This complex is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression and RNA processing, particularly in the 3'-end processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) associated with RNA polymerase II (Xu2024Comprehensive). The INTS10 protein is categorized as a helical protein and forms a stable subcomplex with INTS13 and INTS14, contributing to the structural and functional integrity of the integrator complex (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14). While the specific biological roles of INTS10 are still being elucidated, it is known to participate in transcription termination and RNA processing, with implications in various diseases, including hepatitis B virus infection and cancer (Federico2017PanCancer; Li2016Genomewide).

## Structure
The INTS10 protein is a component of the Integrator complex, which plays a crucial role in RNA processing. Structurally, INTS10 is described as a helical protein that interacts with other subunits within the Integrator complex. It runs along the N-terminal HEAT repeats of INTS4 and contacts the C-terminal domain 2 (CTD2) of INTS9 and INTS11 in the cleavage module (Fianu2024Structural). The C-terminal region of INTS10, between helices α30 and α35, binds to the N-terminal vWA domain of INTS1 (Fianu2024Structural).

INTS10 forms part of a stable subcomplex with INTS13 and INTS14, which is involved in the processing of 3′-ends of spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and transcription regulation (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14). The INTS13-INTS14 heterodimer is strongly entwined, suggesting structural homology to the Ku70-Ku80 DNA repair complex, indicating a potential affinity for nucleic acids, particularly RNA hairpins (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14).

The INTS14 VWA domain is identified as the primary interaction surface for INTS10, with the deletion of this domain completely abrogating the INTS10 interaction (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of INTS10 itself are not provided in the available excerpts.

## Function
INTS10 is a component of the integrator complex, a crucial protein assembly in eukaryotic cells involved in the regulation of gene expression and RNA processing. The integrator complex is primarily associated with RNA polymerase II and plays a significant role in the 3'-end processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), which are essential for RNA splicing and the stability of snRNAs (Xu2024Comprehensive). INTS10, along with other subunits like INTS13 and INTS14, forms a submodule within the integrator complex, contributing to its structural and functional integrity (Mascibroda2022INTS13).

While the specific role of INTS10 in healthy human cells is not fully elucidated, it is known to be part of the integrator complex's broader functions, including transcription termination and RNA processing. The integrator complex is involved in the termination of transcription at various gene targets, ensuring proper gene expression regulation (Skaar2015The). Although INTS10's depletion does not significantly impact UsnRNA processing compared to other subunits, it is still considered an integral part of the complex's overall function (Albrecht2018Integrator). The precise biological role of INTS10 in hepatocellular carcinoma and other diseases remains an area of ongoing research (Xu2024Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
INTS10 has been implicated in the persistence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. A genome-wide association study identified a susceptibility locus at 8p21.3, with the SNP rs7000921 significantly associated with persistent HBV infection. This SNP affects INTS10 expression, suggesting that altered levels of INTS10 may contribute to the persistence of HBV infection (Li2016Genomewide). INTS10 suppresses HBV replication through an IRF3-dependent mechanism, leading to the activation of type III interferons, which are crucial for antiviral responses. Insufficient INTS10 expression is linked to higher HBV DNA loads, indicating its role in the innate immune response against HBV (Li2016Genomewide).

Beyond HBV, INTS10 has been suggested as a nicotine-dependent genetic susceptibility gene and a germline susceptibility locus in childhood precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, although detailed mechanisms remain unclear (Xu2024Comprehensive). In cancer, INTS10 is often downregulated across various tumor types, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis, although specific mutations or conditions directly linked to INTS10 have not been extensively documented (Federico2017PanCancer). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of INTS10 dysregulation.

## Interactions
INTS10 is a component of the Integrator complex, where it forms a stable trimeric module with INTS13 and INTS14. This module is involved in protein-protein interactions and nucleic acid binding. INTS10 directly interacts with INTS14, primarily through the VWA domain of INTS14, which serves as the main interaction surface. The deletion of the INTS14 VWA domain disrupts the interaction with INTS10, highlighting the importance of this domain (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14).

The INTS10-INTS13-INTS14 complex binds nucleic acids, with a preference for stem-loop RNAs, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. This binding is largely charge-mediated, and the presence of INTS10 increases the affinity for nucleic acids compared to the INTS13-INTS14 dimer alone (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14).

The trimeric complex also interacts with the cleavage module of the Integrator complex, which includes INTS4, INTS9, and INTS11. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal motif of INTS13, which is crucial for efficient UsnRNA 3′-end processing (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14). The INTS10-INTS13-INTS14 complex plays a role in RNAPII transcription termination and UsnRNA processing (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14).
