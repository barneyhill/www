# RAB3A

## Overview
RAB3A is a gene that encodes a member of the RAS oncogene family, specifically a small GTPase protein known as RAB3A. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of vesicle trafficking, with a significant role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. As a small GTPase, RAB3A functions by cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states, a mechanism crucial for its role in neurotransmitter release at presynaptic terminals. The protein's interactions with various effector proteins, such as Rabphilin-3A and synaptotagmin I, facilitate its function in vesicle docking and fusion, processes essential for synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions (Schlüter2004A; van2007The). Beyond its neurological roles, RAB3A is also involved in hormone and insulin secretion, indicating its broader significance in cellular exocytosis (Regazzi1996Expression; Holz1994Evidence).

## Structure
The RAB3A protein is a small GTPase involved in vesicle trafficking, particularly in the exocytosis and endocytotic recycling of synaptic vesicles. Its primary structure includes conserved sequence motifs typical of the Rab family, which are crucial for its function in GTP binding and hydrolysis (Baumert1993Structure). The secondary structure of RAB3A likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, as is common in GTP-binding proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure of RAB3A involves a GTP-binding domain, which undergoes conformational changes between GDP- and GTP-bound states. These changes are important for interactions with downstream effectors and regulatory proteins (McKiernan1993The). The protein is post-translationally modified by geranylgeranylation, which facilitates its attachment to synaptic vesicle membranes (Baumert1993Structure).

RAB3A interacts with other proteins, such as Rabphilin-3A, in a GTP-dependent manner, indicating a quaternary structure involving protein-protein interactions (McKiernan1993The). The protein also interacts with the globular tail domains of myosin Vc and myosin Va, but not myosin Vb, suggesting selective recognition and functional overlap in vesicle trafficking (Dolce2020Unveiling).

## Function
RAB3A is a small GTPase protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of vesicle trafficking, particularly in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. It is predominantly active in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, where it modulates neurotransmitter release, influencing synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions (Schlüter2004A). RAB3A cycles between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state, a process essential for its function in vesicle docking and secretion (van2007The). This cycling is crucial for the protein's ability to regulate the docking of secretory vesicles, a key step in the exocytosis process (McKiernan1996Role).

In addition to its role in neurons, RAB3A is involved in calcium-dependent exocytosis in adrenal chromaffin cells, where it regulates the secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters (Holz1994Evidence). The protein is also expressed in insulin-secreting cells, where it associates with insulin-containing granules, suggesting a role in insulin release (Regazzi1996Expression). RAB3A's interaction with effector proteins like rabphilin-3A facilitates vesicle docking at target membranes, further underscoring its importance in maintaining normal cellular function (MartinezArroyo2021Small).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RAB3A gene are associated with several neurological and developmental disorders. Mutations in genes regulating Rab3A, such as Rab GDIa, are linked to X-linked mental retardation, highlighting the gene's role in neurodevelopmental processes (Seabra2002Rab; Gissen2007Cargos). Defects in Rab3GAP, which regulates the conversion of Rab3-GTP to Rab3-GDP, lead to Warburg Micro syndrome and Martsolf syndrome. These conditions are characterized by developmental defects, including ocular and neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and are associated with the accumulation of GTP-bound Rab3A, which disrupts neurotransmitter release (Corbeel2008Rab; Gissen2007Cargos).

Rab3A is also implicated in various neurological and psychiatric conditions, including Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and major depressive disorder, due to its role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neural transmission (Banworth2017Consequences). In the context of kidney disease, Rab3A dysfunction is linked to proteinuria and structural changes in podocytes, suggesting a role in renal damage (MartinezArroyo2021Small). These findings underscore the clinical significance of Rab3A in both neurological and systemic diseases.

## Interactions
Rab3A, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in regulated secretion and interacts with several proteins that play crucial roles in vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release. One of its primary interactions is with Rabphilin-3A, a putative target protein that preferentially binds to the GTP-bound form of Rab3A. Rabphilin-3A contains an N-terminal Rab3A-binding domain and a C-terminal C2 domain that interacts with Ca2+ and phospholipids. This interaction is essential for maintaining Rab3A in its active state during its function (Kishida1993Rab3A).

Rab3A also interacts with synaptotagmin I, specifically its C2 domains, as demonstrated through GST pull-down assays. This interaction is significant for understanding Rab3A's role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Tang2016Gene). Additionally, Rab3A binds to the molecular motor myosin Vc (MyoVc), with docking analyses suggesting that Rab3A GTP binds to the convex region of MyoVc-GTD. This interaction is relevant to the trafficking and exocytosis of secretory granules (Dolce2020Unveiling).

Rab3A's interactions with these proteins highlight its critical role in vesicle docking and fusion, essential processes for neurotransmitter release at synapses.
