# TDRD3

## Overview
TDRD3 is a gene that encodes the tudor domain containing 3 protein, which is a multifunctional scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes. The TDRD3 protein is characterized by its modular structure, including a Tudor domain, ubiquitin-associated domain, and an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold, which facilitate its interactions with methylated proteins and nucleic acids. It plays a critical role in regulating R-loop metabolism, transcriptional coactivation, and stress response mechanisms. TDRD3 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, where it associates with stress granules, and in the nucleus, where it interacts with methylated histones to modulate gene expression. The protein's involvement in maintaining genomic stability and its interactions with proteins like TOP3B and DHX9 underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and response to environmental changes (Goulet2008TDRD3; Yang2010TDRD3; Yuan2021TDRD3).

## Structure
The TDRD3 protein is a modular protein composed of 744 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of 82.7 kDa (Goulet2008TDRD3). It features several distinct structural domains, including a Tudor domain, a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, and an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold. The Tudor domain, located at amino acids 647-710, is known for recognizing arginine-methylated motifs and is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly with methylated proteins such as histones and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (Goulet2008TDRD3; Yuan2021TDRD3). The UBA domain, spanning amino acids 286-328, is involved in interactions with ubiquitin chains, with leucine 324 being essential for this interaction (Yuan2021TDRD3). The OB-fold, located at amino acids 94-169, is associated with nucleic acid recognition and is involved in interactions with proteins like TOP3B (Yuan2021TDRD3).

The Tudor domain of TDRD3 is characterized by a barrel-like structure composed of beta-sheets forming a hydrophobic pocket, which facilitates interactions with methylated arginines (Goulet2008TDRD3). TDRD3 does not possess enzymatic activity but functions as a scaffolding molecule, facilitating interactions between arginine-methylated cistromes and gene promoters (Yang2010TDRD3). The protein localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm and is associated with stress granules, where it interacts with other proteins involved in RNA processing (Goulet2008TDRD3).

## Function
The TDRD3 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in regulating R-loop metabolism in human cells. R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures that can form during transcription and, if unresolved, can lead to genomic instability. TDRD3 acts as a scaffold, assembling a protein complex with DNA topoisomerase 3B (TOP3B) and DExH-box helicase 9 (DHX9) to resolve R-loops at gene promoters, thereby maintaining genomic stability and proper gene expression (Yuan2021TDRD3).

In the nucleus, TDRD3 functions as a transcriptional coactivator by interacting with methylated arginine residues on histones, facilitating chromatin interactions crucial for transcriptional regulation (Yang2010TDRD3). It is recruited to promoter regions of actively transcribed genes, enhancing transcription in conjunction with coactivators like CARM1 and PRMT1 (Yang2010TDRD3).

In the cytoplasm, TDRD3 is involved in stress response mechanisms, localizing to stress granules (SGs) under cellular stress conditions. It interacts with proteins such as the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), suggesting a role in translational regulation and mRNA handling (Goulet2008TDRD3; Linder2008Tdrd3). TDRD3's presence in both the nucleus and cytoplasm highlights its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and response to environmental changes (Yang2010TDRD3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the TDRD3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer. Overexpression of TDRD3 is associated with poor prognosis in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Narayanan2017Arginine; Goulet2008TDRD3). TDRD3 interacts with USP9X, a ubiquitin-specific protease, and this interaction is crucial for the stability and localization of proteins involved in apoptosis, such as MCL-1. Disruption of this interaction can sensitize breast cancer cells to apoptosis, indicating potential therapeutic targets (Narayanan2017Arginine).

TDRD3 also plays a role in maintaining genomic stability by regulating TOP3B cleavage complexes. Its absence leads to increased R-loop formation and genomic damage, which can contribute to disease states characterized by genomic instability (Saha2023The; Yuan2021TDRD3). Additionally, TDRD3 is involved in antiviral responses, promoting interferon signaling and stress granule formation, which are crucial for innate immune responses. Alterations in TDRD3 expression or interactions can impact viral replication and host immune responses, highlighting its significance in viral infections (Deater2022TDRD3). These findings underscore the clinical importance of TDRD3 in cancer and other diseases.

## Interactions
TDRD3 is a protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and transcription regulation. It localizes to cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) and interacts with proteins such as TIA-1, G3BP, and FMRP, with its Tudor domain being crucial for this localization (Goulet2008TDRD3; Linder2008Tdrd3). TDRD3 interacts with arginine-methylated polypeptides, including methylated G3BP1, which is essential for SG assembly (Qin2024PRMT1). 

TDRD3 also forms complexes with proteins like TOP3β and DHX9, facilitating transcription activation and R-loop regulation. It acts as a scaffold to assemble these complexes, with the OB-fold domain binding TOP3β and the Tudor domain interacting with DHX9 (Yuan2021TDRD3). The interaction between TDRD3 and FMRP is significant, as it is involved in translational regulation and is disrupted by specific mutations associated with Fragile X syndrome (Linder2008Tdrd3).

TDRD3 binds to asymmetric dimethylarginine marks on histone tails, such as H3R17me2a and H4R3me2a, deposited by coactivators CARM1 and PRMT1, which is crucial for its role as a transcriptional coactivator (Yang2010TDRD3).
