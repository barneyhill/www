# TP53BP2

## Overview
The TP53BP2 gene encodes the tumor protein p53 binding protein 2, commonly referred to as ASPP2, which is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SH3 domain-containing protein family. ASPP2 is a pro-apoptotic protein that plays a significant role in tumor suppression by enhancing the apoptotic function of the tumor suppressor protein p53. It is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and maintenance of cell polarity. The protein structure of ASPP2 includes ankyrin repeats, a Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a polyproline domain, which facilitate its interactions with key proteins such as p53, Bcl-2, and NF-kappaB. These interactions are crucial for its function in promoting apoptosis and regulating the cell cycle. ASPP2 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm and is implicated in mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, acting as a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor. Alterations in the TP53BP2 gene have been associated with various diseases, including cancer and 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Van2012TP53BP2; Naumovski1996The; SamuelsLev2001ASPP).

## Structure
The TP53BP2 gene encodes the protein ASPP2, which is involved in apoptosis and tumor suppression. ASPP2 is a pro-apoptotic protein with a predicted size of approximately 135 kDa and is part of the ASPP family, which includes ASPP1 and iASPP (Van2012TP53BP2). The protein structure of ASPP2 includes four ankyrin repeats, a Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a polyproline domain in the C-terminus, while the N-terminus contains a putative Ras-association domain and a ubiquitin-like fold (Van2012TP53BP2; IosubAmir2014Protein–protein). The ankyrin repeats and SH3 domain are crucial for its interactions with proteins such as p53, Bcl-2, and NF-kappaB (IosubAmir2014Protein–protein). ASPP2's structure includes an intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction between the ankyrin-SH3 and proline-rich domains, which regulates its intermolecular interactions (IosubAmir2014Protein–protein). The protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two transcript variants: TP53BPL (long) and TP53BPS (short) (Van2012TP53BP2). ASPP2 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm, despite having a nuclear localization signal (Van2012TP53BP2). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, cell polarity, and senescence (Van2012TP53BP2).

## Function
The TP53BP2 gene encodes the ASPP2 protein, which plays a crucial role in promoting apoptosis, regulating the cell cycle, and maintaining cell polarity in healthy human cells. ASPP2 is a pro-apoptotic protein that enhances the apoptotic function of the tumor suppressor protein p53 by increasing its ability to bind to and transactivate pro-apoptotic gene promoters (SamuelsLev2001ASPP). This interaction is specific and is enhanced in response to DNA damage, such as UV irradiation (SamuelsLev2001ASPP).

ASPP2 is also involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the G2/M phase and the G0/G1 checkpoint, and is associated with maintaining cell polarity by interacting with tight junction proteins (Van2012TP53BP2). It binds to Par-3, a component of the Par complex, which is essential for tight junction assembly and cell polarity, indicating its role in maintaining the integrity of cell junctions (Sottocornola2010ASPP2).

In addition to its role in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, ASPP2 is implicated in mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and acts as a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor, with low expression levels correlating with poor clinical outcomes in various cancers (Van2012TP53BP2). ASPP2's functions in healthy cells contribute to its role as a tumor suppressor by promoting apoptosis, regulating the cell cycle, and maintaining cell polarity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TP53BP2 gene, also known as ASPP2, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. TP53BP2 is associated with 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome, which is characterized by dysmorphic features, intellectual disability, and brain morphological abnormalities. Deletions in this gene are linked to central nervous system defects, including neural tube defects and ventricular dilation, as observed in both human patients and mouse models (Zak2016ASPP2).

In cancer, TP53BP2 acts as a tumor suppressor by interacting with the p53 protein to enhance apoptosis. Alterations in TP53BP2 expression or mutations can disrupt this interaction, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis. For instance, downregulation of TP53BP2 expression has been observed in breast cancer, and specific polymorphisms in the gene are associated with increased susceptibility to gastric cancer (Ju2005TP53BP2; Snezhkina2018Exome).

Additionally, TP53BP2 has been identified as a candidate gene for primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). A variant in TP53BP2 was found to segregate with the disease in a family study, suggesting its role in the pathogenesis of POAG (Micheal2017Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TP53BP2 in various genetic and acquired conditions.

## Interactions
TP53BP2, also known as 53BP2 or ASPP2, is a protein that interacts with several key proteins involved in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. It binds to the tumor suppressor protein p53, enhancing its transcriptional activation and apoptotic functions. This interaction is specific to the wild-type form of p53 and involves the SH3 domain and ankyrin repeats of TP53BP2 (Naumovski1996The; Lopez2000Proapoptotic; Iwabuchi1998Stimulation).

TP53BP2 also interacts with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2. The binding to Bcl2 is competitive with p53, as TP53BP2 can bind to either Bcl2 or p53, but not both simultaneously. This suggests a regulatory role in apoptosis, where TP53BP2 may modulate the balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals (Naumovski1996The).

In addition to these interactions, TP53BP2 binds to protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), acting as a modulator of its activity. This interaction is highly specific and involves a different region of TP53BP2 than that used for p53 binding, indicating distinct functional roles for these interactions (Unknownauthors1995Proteinphosphatase1interactswithp53BP2).
