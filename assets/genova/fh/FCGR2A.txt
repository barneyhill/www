# FCGR2A

## Overview
The FCGR2A gene encodes the Fc gamma receptor IIa (FcγRIIa), a transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating interactions with the Fc region of IgG antibodies. This receptor is predominantly expressed on immune cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and platelets, where it facilitates key immune processes including phagocytosis, cytokine release, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Patel2021Platelet; Anania2019The). FcγRIIa is characterized by its low affinity for IgG and contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) that is crucial for initiating downstream signaling pathways (Tada2012Genetic; Anania2019The). The receptor's function is modulated by genetic polymorphisms, which can influence its binding affinity and impact immune responses (Bruhns2009Specificity). Additionally, FcγRIIa is involved in platelet activation and aggregation, contributing to hemostasis and thrombosis (Patel2021Platelet). The gene's polymorphisms have clinical significance, being associated with various autoimmune diseases and influencing responses to certain cancer therapies (Wang2019Expression; Nagelkerke2019Genetic).

## Structure
The FCGR2A gene encodes the Fc gamma receptor IIa, a protein integral to the immune response. This receptor is characterized by its low affinity for the Fc region of IgG antibodies. Structurally, the protein comprises extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, which are crucial for its interaction with antibodies. These domains are followed by a transmembrane region that anchors the receptor in the cell membrane, and a cytoplasmic tail that is involved in signal transduction.

Post-translational modifications play a significant role in the function and interaction of Fc gamma receptor IIa. Glycosylation, a common modification, affects the receptor's stability and ligand binding. Phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail is another critical modification, influencing downstream signaling pathways. These modifications are essential for the receptor's role in modulating immune responses.

The protein's structure and modifications enable it to participate in various immune processes, including phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The specific arrangement of its domains and the presence of these modifications underscore its functional versatility in the immune system. The receptor's ability to undergo these modifications highlights its dynamic nature and adaptability in response to immune challenges.

## Function
The FCGR2A gene encodes the Fc gamma receptor IIa (FcγRIIa), a protein that plays a significant role in the immune system by binding to the Fc region of IgG antibodies. This receptor is expressed on various immune cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and platelets, and is involved in several key immune processes (Patel2021Platelet; Anania2019The). FcγRIIa is an activating receptor that facilitates immune responses through its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), which is crucial for signaling pathways leading to phagocytosis, cytokine release, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Tada2012Genetic; Anania2019The).

In healthy human cells, FcγRIIa is involved in the clearance of pathogens and immune complexes by promoting phagocytosis and the release of inflammatory mediators (Patel2021Platelet; Anania2019The). The receptor's interaction with IgG immune complexes triggers a signaling cascade that includes the activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2), leading to increased cytosolic calcium levels and subsequent cellular responses (Patel2021Platelet). FcγRIIa also plays a role in platelet activation and aggregation, contributing to hemostasis and thrombosis (Patel2021Platelet). The receptor's function is modulated by genetic polymorphisms, which can affect its binding affinity and influence immune responses (Bruhns2009Specificity).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the FCGR2A gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. A well-characterized polymorphism, resulting in the substitution of arginine by histidine at position 131 (FCGR2A-H131), affects the receptor's binding to IgG subclasses and is linked to increased susceptibility to Kawasaki disease and Myasthenia gravis (Wang2019Expression). The FCGR2A-R131 variant is associated with a lower clearance of IgG immune complexes, predisposing individuals to autoimmune disorders and recurrent bacterial infections (Wang2019Expression).

Another polymorphism, FCGR2A-p.His166Arg, shows that individuals with the p.166Arg variant have increased susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and potentially lupus nephritis, while the p.166His variant is associated with ulcerative colitis, Kawasaki disease, and childhood immune thrombocytopenia (Nagelkerke2019Genetic). The p.166His variant may lead to a more active immune response, contributing to these conditions (Nagelkerke2019Genetic).

In the context of cancer treatment, the FCGR2A-p.166His/His genotype is linked to better responses to trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer and longer progression-free survival after cetuximab treatment in colorectal carcinoma (Nagelkerke2019Genetic). These genetic variations highlight the potential for personalized medicine approaches based on FCGR2A genotyping.

## Interactions
The FCGR2A gene encodes the FcγRIIA protein, which is involved in various interactions crucial for immune response and thrombosis. FcγRIIA interacts with IgG immune complexes through its Ig-like extracellular domains, facilitating receptor crosslinking and activation. This crosslinking allows the docking of Src family kinases (SFKs), leading to the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) domain. This phosphorylation recruits and activates spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), which is essential for downstream signaling pathways (Patel2021Platelet; Anania2019The).

FcγRIIA also interacts with αIIbβ3 integrin, enhancing outside-in signaling and platelet activity. This interaction is independent of IgG but involves residues in FcγRIIA's ligand-binding domains, as it can be blocked by the monoclonal antibody IV.3 targeting these domains (Patel2021Platelet). Additionally, FcγRIIA is involved in the externalization of phosphatidylserine on platelets, particularly when stimulated alongside Gq-coupled receptors like PAR1 or PAR4, which is crucial for hemostatic coagulation (Patel2021Platelet).

The protein undergoes alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation, which affect its function and interactions (Patel2021Platelet). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of FcγRIIA in immune and thrombotic processes.
