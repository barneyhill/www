# TPPP2

## Overview
TPPP2, or tubulin polymerization-promoting protein family member 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis and sperm motility. The protein belongs to the tubulin polymerization-promoting protein family and is characterized by the presence of the p25alpha domain, which is integral to its structure and function (Orosz2012A). Unlike its paralogs, TPPP1 and TPPP3, TPPP2 does not associate with microtubules, indicating a unique role in cellular processes, particularly in male reproductive biology (Orosz2024The). TPPP2 is predominantly expressed in the testis and sperm, where it plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, essential for sperm motility and fertility (Orosz2024The). The protein's interactions and functions are modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its role in reproductive processes (Orosz2024The).

## Structure
TPPP2 is a member of the tubulin polymerization-promoting protein family, characterized by the presence of the p25alpha domain, which constitutes nearly the entire sequence of TPPP2 (Orosz2012A). The protein is classified as a long-type TPPP, containing a complete p25alpha domain, and is prevalent in vertebrates due to genome duplication events (Orosz2012A). 

The secondary structure of human TPPP2 includes five alpha-helices and two beta-sheets, located in the more ordered middle region of the protein. This structured region corresponds to the first two coding exons, while the C-terminal region, which is disordered, corresponds to the third exon (Orosz2012A). The disordered nature of the C-terminal region is a common feature among long-type TPPPs and is suggested to play a role in microtubule binding (Orosz2012A).

TPPP2 does not share the microtubule-associated protein-like features of TPPP1, indicating a weaker affinity for tubulin and microtubules. It is distributed homogeneously within the cytosol of transfected HeLa cells (Orosz2024The). The protein's function and interactions may be influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which affect its interactions with other proteins (Orosz2024The).

## Function
TPPP2 (tubulin polymerization-promoting protein 2) plays a significant role in spermatogenesis, particularly in the development and function of sperm. It is highly expressed in sperm, especially in elongating spermatids during critical stages of spermiogenesis, and is localized in the middle piece of the sperm tail. This localization is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, which are essential for sperm motility (Orosz2024The). TPPP2's role in energy production is highlighted by its impact on mitochondrial membrane potential and the expression of electron transfer chain components, with knockout mice showing reduced sperm motility and ATP content due to mitochondrial dysfunctions (Orosz2024The).

Unlike its paralogs TPPP1 and TPPP3, TPPP2 does not align along microtubules, indicating a distinct function in cellular processes (Orosz2024The). It is involved in processes like capacitation and the acrosome reaction, which are crucial for sperm function and fertility (Orosz2024The). TPPP2's expression is primarily in the testis and sperm, with a weaker presence in the epididymis, suggesting its specific role in male reproductive biology (Orosz2024The). The protein's phosphorylation status affects its interactions and functions, similar to TPPP1, which is involved in brain-specific processes (Orosz2024The).

## Clinical Significance
TPPP2 has been implicated in various reproductive and fertility issues. It is notably up-regulated in patients with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), where its expression is approximately 10-fold higher compared to individuals with normal spermatogenesis. This suggests a potential role in the pathology of NOA, a condition characterized by a lack of sperm in the ejaculate due to impaired spermatogenesis (Orosz2024The). In animal models, TPPP2 knockout mice exhibit reduced sperm motility and count, which are attributed to mitochondrial dysfunctions, including lower mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content. These defects are linked to increased apoptosis in sperm, indicating that TPPP2 is crucial for maintaining normal sperm function and energy metabolism (Orosz2024The).

In the context of spinal muscular atrophy, a study on a low SMN expressing mouse model showed that TPPP2 expression is significantly reduced in the testes, particularly affecting spermatid- or spermatozoa-specific genes. This reduction occurs after the first wave of spermatogenesis, suggesting a link between TPPP2 expression and the presence of these cell types, which are generally lacking in the affected testes (Ottesen2016Severe). These findings highlight the importance of TPPP2 in reproductive health and its potential as a biomarker for fertility-related conditions.

## Interactions
TPPP2, or tubulin polymerization-promoting protein 2, is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in spermatogenesis and sperm motility. TPPP2 interacts with several proteins, including GAPDHS, SSMEM1, TEX33, TSSK4, and TRIM42, which are crucial for sperm motility and other reproductive processes (Orosz2024The). The phosphorylation status of TPPP2 influences its interactions, similar to its brain-specific paralog TPPP1, which interacts with GAPDH-1 (Orosz2024The).

In the context of its role in sperm motility, TPPP2 was found to be the fifth most abundant mRNA in sperm, indicating its significant influence on sperm characteristics and fertility. Inhibition of TPPP2 has been shown to hinder sperm motility, reduce ATP content, and lower in vitro fertilization rates (Orosz2024The). TPPP2's interactions are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function, as evidenced by studies on Tppp2 knockout mice, which exhibited decreased sperm count and motility due to mitochondrial dysfunctions (Orosz2024The).

These interactions highlight TPPP2's essential role in regulating sperm motility and fertility, making it a critical component in reproductive biology.
