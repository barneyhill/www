# BCAT1

## Overview
The BCAT1 gene encodes the enzyme branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent aminotransferase that plays a critical role in the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine. This enzyme is primarily cytosolic and functions as a homodimer, facilitating the reversible transamination of BCAAs, which is essential for energy production and metabolic regulation (Papathanassiu2017BCAT1; Nong2022The). BCAT1 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, kidney, and macrophages, where it influences metabolic pathways and cellular processes such as glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Papathanassiu2017BCAT1; Nong2022The). The enzyme's activity is implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer progression, metabolic disorders, and inflammatory responses, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Nong2022The).

## Structure
The BCAT1 protein is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, classified as a fold type IV aminotransferase. It typically functions as a homodimer, with each subunit binding to the PLP cofactor, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Nong2022The). The primary structure of BCAT1 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the BCAT1 gene, and its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the formation of its active site (Nong2022The).

The tertiary structure of BCAT1 forms a functional enzyme with a specific active site for catalysis, where the PLP cofactor is bound. This binding is crucial for the enzyme's function in the transamination process, which is involved in replenishing the glutamate pool in the brain (Nong2022The). BCAT1 is expressed in specific tissues such as the brain, kidney, and ovarian tissues, and it plays a role in the release and synthesis of glutamate (Nong2022The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may affect the activity and stability of BCAT1, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context (Nong2022The). The enzyme's structure and function are significant in various physiological processes and have implications in cancer research due to its overexpression in certain cancers (Nong2022The).

## Function
The BCAT1 gene encodes a cytosolic enzyme involved in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible transamination of BCAAs, a process crucial for the formation of branched-chain alpha-keto acids and subsequent derivatives of coenzyme A, which are important for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (Papathanassiu2017BCAT1). In healthy human cells, BCAT1 plays a significant role in regulating the levels of these amino acids, which are essential for various metabolic processes. Leucine, in particular, is known to activate the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is important for cell growth and metabolism (Papathanassiu2017BCAT1).

BCAT1 is predominantly expressed in human macrophages, where it influences metabolic reprogramming, especially under inflammatory conditions. It regulates glycolysis and oxygen consumption during early activation by lipopolysaccharides (LPS), linked to the production of itaconate, a metabolite with antimicrobial properties and potential roles in macrophage polarization (Papathanassiu2017BCAT1). The gene's expression is associated with metabolic pathways crucial for macrophage function, including the production of fatty acids and the regulation of the TCA cycle (Papathanassiu2017BCAT1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BCAT1 gene are linked to various diseases, particularly cancers. In several types of cancer, including breast cancer, glioblastoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, BCAT1 is overexpressed, promoting tumor growth and metastasis through pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Wnt/b-catenin (Zhou2013Overexpression; Nong2022The). In glioblastoma, BCAT1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and contributes to drug resistance (Nong2022The). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, BCAT1 overexpression is driven by gene amplification and the transcription factor c-Myc, leading to increased cell proliferation and invasion (Zhou2013Overexpression).

In leukemia, BCAT1 is implicated in the progression of chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia by promoting cell proliferation and maintaining leukemia stem cells (Nong2022The). BCAT1 also plays a role in metabolic reprogramming in tumors, affecting processes like glycolysis and mitochondrial function (Nong2022The).

Beyond cancer, BCAT1 is involved in metabolic and inflammatory diseases. In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, BCAT1 overexpression leads to metabolic imbalances, while in inflammatory diseases, it regulates macrophage activation (Nong2022The). In neurodegenerative diseases, altered BCAT1 expression is linked to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, affecting neuronal metabolism and mitochondrial function (Nong2022The).

## Interactions
BCAT1, or branched chain amino acid transaminase 1, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. In leukemia, BCAT1 interacts with musashi RNA binding protein 2 (MSI2) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which regulates BCAT1 translation and activates the mTORC1 pathway, affecting the growth of CML cells (Nong2022The). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), BCAT1 stabilizes proteins necessary for leukemia stem cell maintenance by regulating intracellular alpha-ketoglutarate levels, impacting the activity of enzymes like EGLN1 and Tet2 (Nong2022The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), BCAT1 is co-expressed with phosphoserine aminotransferase and predicted to interact with 13 proteins, directly interacting with six proteins involved in metabolic pathways, amino acid biosynthesis and degradation, the myc pathway, and the p53 signaling pathway (Zou2019Data). BCAT1 also interacts with TP53I3, a gene involved in p53-mediated apoptosis, and is predicted to interact with genes such as AADAT, TOP2A, and DTYMK, which are involved in amino acid metabolism, DNA topology regulation, and pyrimidine metabolism, respectively (Zou2019Data).

In B-cell activation, BCAT1 supports mTOR hyperactivation and is involved in the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids, localizing to lysosomes and interacting with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) (Guo2024Multiomic).
