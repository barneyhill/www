# TMEM202

## Overview
The TMEM202 gene encodes the transmembrane protein 202, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to span the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling and transport. TMEM202 is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis and may be involved in specific signaling pathways, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. The protein's structure suggests it may participate in interactions with other membrane proteins or cellular components, potentially influencing cellular responses to environmental changes. Further research is needed to understand the full spectrum of TMEM202's functions and its potential implications in health and disease.
