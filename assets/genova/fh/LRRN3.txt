# LRRN3

## Overview
LRRN3 (leucine rich repeat neuronal 3) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein characterized by leucine-rich repeats, which are integral to its role in facilitating protein-protein interactions. This protein is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, particularly within neurons and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, where it is implicated in synaptic plasticity and the regulation of synaptic connections (Hutcheson2004Examination; Guo2023Identification). Beyond its neural functions, LRRN3 is involved in cellular metabolic processes, including cellular respiration and the respiratory electron transport chain, and plays a role in immune response regulation (Guo2023Identification). The gene's expression and function are linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, Parkinson's disease, and Tourette syndrome (Clarke2012Pathogenetic; Guo2023Identification; Sousa2010Polymorphisms).

## Function
LRRN3 (leucine rich repeat neuronal 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular and molecular processes, primarily within the nervous system. The protein is characterized by leucine-rich repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in neuronal development and maintenance (Hutcheson2004Examination). LRRN3 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, suggesting its role in synaptic plasticity and the regulation of synaptic connections (Guo2023Identification).

In healthy human cells, LRRN3 is associated with cellular metabolic functions, including cellular respiration and the respiratory electron transport chain, indicating its involvement in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Guo2023Identification). The gene also plays a role in immune response regulation, as higher expression levels are linked to a relative suppression of immune responses (Guo2023Identification). Additionally, LRRN3 is involved in the activation of MAPK activity and endocytosis, processes that are essential for cellular signaling and the internalization of molecules (Passtoors2012Transcriptional). These functions highlight the gene's importance in both neural and systemic physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
The LRRN3 gene has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders due to alterations in its expression levels or genetic polymorphisms. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), significant associations have been found between LRRN3 polymorphisms and increased susceptibility, particularly in populations of European ancestry. The marker rs10261004 within LRRN3 has been identified as strongly associated with ASD risk, with the G allele being protective against the disorder (Sousa2010Polymorphisms).

In Parkinson's disease (PD), LRRN3 expression is notably downregulated in both blood and substantia nigra tissue samples from patients. This downregulation is associated with immune response suppression and may serve as a potential biomarker for early PD diagnosis. The expression of LRRN3 is lower in PD patients compared to controls, and its decreased expression correlates with unfavorable immune cell infiltration, which may affect neuronal protection (Shulskaya2024Analysis; Guo2023Identification).

LRRN3 is also involved in Tourette syndrome (TS), where its expression is regulated in developing ganglia and motor neurons. Alterations in LRRN3 expression or its interactions are suggested to be relevant to TS, potentially due to its role in synaptic organization and function (Clarke2012Pathogenetic).
