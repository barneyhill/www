# PPM1M

## Overview
PPM1M is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1M, also known as PP2Cη. This protein is a member of the metal-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase family, specifically categorized under the PPM1H subfamily. It primarily localizes in the nucleus and requires manganese ions for its enzymatic activity. PPM1M is involved in the dephosphorylation of various substrates, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in modulating inflammatory responses by inhibiting the IL-1-NF-κB signaling pathway. Additionally, it participates in the regulation of Rab protein signaling, although its activity is less potent compared to other phosphatases like PPM1H. Despite its low expression in most tissues, PPM1M is notably expressed in neutrophils, suggesting a specialized function in these immune cells. The protein is also implicated in the replication of Herpes simplex virus type 1, highlighting its potential significance in viral infections (Kamada2020Metaldependent; Berndsen2019PPM1H).

## Function
PPM1M, also known as PP2Cη, is a metal-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase that primarily localizes in the nucleus and requires Mn2+ ions for optimal catalytic activity (Kamada2020Metaldependent). It is involved in the dephosphorylation of specific substrates, such as the casein protein, and plays a significant role in regulating inflammatory responses by inhibiting the IL-1-NF-κB signaling pathway through the dephosphorylation of IKKβ (Kamada2020Metaldependent). PPM1M also suppresses TAK1-induced activation of NF-κB, indicating its involvement in modulating immune responses (Kamada2020Metaldependent).

In addition to its role in inflammation, PPM1M is capable of dephosphorylating LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab10, although its activity is weaker compared to PPM1H (Berndsen2019PPM1H). This suggests a potential role in maintaining the phosphorylation state of Rab proteins, which are important for cellular functions such as vesicle trafficking and signal transduction (Berndsen2019PPM1H). Despite its low expression in most tissues, PPM1M is expressed at higher levels in neutrophils, indicating a possible specialized function in these cells (Berndsen2019PPM1H). The precise role of PPM1M in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, particularly regarding its activity towards other Rab proteins.

## Interactions
PPM1M, also known as PP2Cη, is a protein phosphatase that primarily localizes in the nucleus and exhibits a preference for Mn2+ ions for its catalytic activity. It is involved in the dephosphorylation of specific proteins, playing a role in various cellular signaling pathways. PPM1M is known to dephosphorylate IKKβ, thereby inhibiting the IL-1-NF-κB signaling pathway. This action also suppresses TAK1-induced activation of NF-κB, indicating its role in modulating inflammatory responses (Kamada2020Metaldependent).

PPM1M is part of the PPM1H subfamily of phosphatases and has been shown to dephosphorylate Rab proteins, specifically Rab10 and Rab8A, although its activity is weaker compared to PPM1H. PPM1M's interaction with these Rab proteins suggests its involvement in regulating processes associated with Rab protein signaling (Berndsen2019PPM1H). Despite its low expression in most tissues, PPM1M is expressed at higher levels in neutrophils, which may indicate a specialized function in these cells (Berndsen2019PPM1H).

PPM1M is also implicated in the replication of Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), as reduced levels of PPM1M significantly inhibit HSV-1 infection in rhesus astrocytes, suggesting that PPM1M is necessary for the virus's replication process (Kamada2020Metaldependent).
