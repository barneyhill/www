# RASAL1

## Overview
RASAL1 is a gene that encodes the RAS protein activator like 1, a Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) involved in the regulation of Ras signaling pathways. The protein plays a critical role in cellular homeostasis by enhancing the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras proteins, thereby inactivating them and preventing excessive cell growth and proliferation (CHEN2011In). Structurally, RASAL1 is characterized by a central RasGAP domain, flanked by membrane-interacting motifs, including two N-terminal C2 domains and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which facilitate its calcium-dependent membrane association and activation (Scheffzek2018Ras-Specific; Deurloo2024Rasal1). Functionally, RASAL1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including neuronal development and T-cell signaling, through its interactions with proteins such as CaMKII and ZAP-70 (Deurloo2024Rasal1; Thaker2019GTPaseactivating). Clinically, alterations in RASAL1 expression have been associated with several cancers, including gastric cancer, where it acts as a tumor suppressor by inactivating the RAS/ERK signaling pathway (Chen2015RASAL1; Seto2011Reduced).

## Structure
RASAL1 is a Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) characterized by a modular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein contains a central RasGAP domain, which is crucial for its role in inactivating Ras by enhancing its intrinsic GTPase activity (Deurloo2024Rasal1; Thaker2019GTPaseactivating). Flanking this domain are two membrane-interacting motifs, which include two N-terminal C2 domains. These C2 domains are similar to the Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding domains found in other proteins like synaptotagmin and protein kinase C. The C2A domain interacts with phosphatidylserine, while the C2B domain binds to phosphoinositides, facilitating a calcium-dependent membrane association mechanism that activates RasGAP activity (Scheffzek2018Ras-Specific; Deurloo2024Rasal1).

The C-terminal region of RASAL1 includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which acts as a membrane-binding module in conjunction with the C2 domains (Deurloo2024Rasal1). This structural arrangement allows RASAL1 to respond to intracellular calcium oscillations, which are important for various cellular processes. The protein also contains a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) motif, although its specific role in RASAL1's function is less clear (Thaker2019GTPaseactivating). The protein's activity and interactions can be modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Scheffzek2018Ras-Specific).

## Function
RASAL1 is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RAS proteins, playing a crucial role in regulating the RAS signaling pathways. This regulation is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by inactivating RAS proteins, thus preventing excessive cell growth and proliferation (CHEN2011In). RASAL1 enhances the intrinsic Ras-GTPase activity by hydrolyzing GTP into GDP, effectively switching off Ras signaling pathways. This process is vital for cell differentiation, generation, and apoptosis, and is expressed in almost all normal tissues, including the heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, lung, prostate, and bone marrow (CHEN2011In).

In neuronal development, RASAL1 is involved in calcium-dependent processes, particularly in the hippocampus. It translocates to the plasma membrane in response to elevated calcium levels, which is crucial for its Ras GTPase activity. This translocation is reversible and repeatable, indicating its sensitivity to intracellular calcium changes (Deurloo2024Rasal1). RASAL1 also plays a role in synaptic maturation and microtubule dynamics, promoting NMDA receptor activation and increasing CaMKII activity, which enhances synaptic maturation and function (Deurloo2024Rasal1). These activities contribute to learning and memory processes and are implicated in neurological disorders (Deurloo2024Rasal1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RASAL1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly gastric cancer. RASAL1 functions as a tumor suppressor by inactivating the RAS/ERK signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival. In gastric cancer, RASAL1 expression is often reduced, leading to enhanced RAS signaling activity despite the rarity of RAS gene mutations in this cancer type (Chen2015RASAL1; Seto2011Reduced). This downregulation is associated with increased tumor size, poor differentiation, deeper invasion, and lymph node metastasis (CHEN2011In).

The reduction in RASAL1 expression in gastric cancer is primarily due to epigenetic silencing, such as CpG methylation and histone deacetylation, which contribute to the silencing of the gene (Seto2011Reduced). These epigenetic changes lead to the activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways, promoting cancer progression (Chen2015RASAL1).

In addition to gastric cancer, RASAL1 downregulation has been observed in squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue, where it correlates with the overexpression of phosphorylated ERK1/2, indicating activation of the RAS/ERK pathway (Kawamura2020Activation). RASAL1 mutations have also been identified in hereditary breast cancer, suggesting a potential role in cancer predisposition (Isidori2020RASAL1).

## Interactions
RASAL1, a GTPase-activating protein, participates in several key interactions with other proteins, influencing both neuronal development and T-cell signaling. In neurons, RASAL1 interacts with proteins such as CaMKII, PKC, and tubulin. These interactions suggest its involvement in microtubule dynamics and synaptic development, as RASAL1 modulates neurite outgrowth and synaptic maturation by stabilizing microtubules through posttranslational modification of tubulin (Deurloo2024Rasal1). RASAL1's interaction with CaMKII is particularly significant, as it may regulate RASAL1's RasGAP activity, although the exact functionality of this interaction is not fully explored (Deurloo2024Rasal1).

In T cells, RASAL1 associates with the TCR-CD3 complex and ZAP-70, a kinase involved in T-cell signaling. This interaction inhibits the kinase activity of ZAP-70, reducing the phosphorylation of LAT, a downstream signaling molecule, and negatively regulating T-cell activation and tumor immunity (Thaker2019GTPaseactivating). RASAL1's binding to the kinase domain of ZAP-70 is a unique mechanism that distinguishes it from other negative regulators, such as SHP-1/2 phosphatases and E3 ubiquitin ligases (Thaker2019GTPaseactivating). These interactions highlight RASAL1's role in modulating cellular processes through its regulatory effects on signaling pathways.
