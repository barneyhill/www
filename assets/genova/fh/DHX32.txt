# DHX32

## Overview
DHX32 is a gene that encodes the DEAH-box helicase 32, a putative member of the DEAH-box helicase family, which is involved in various RNA-associated biological processes. The protein is characterized by its unique structural features, including two RecA-like helicase domains essential for nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) binding, hydrolysis, and RNA substrate binding. Despite certain amino acid substitutions in its helicase domain motifs, DHX32 is likely ATPase active, although its helicase activity may be compromised. The protein is localized in the nucleus and mitochondria, suggesting a role in regulating mRNA transcription, splicing, and mitochondrial gene expression. DHX32 is implicated in several cancers, where its expression levels serve as potential biomarkers for prognosis and treatment strategies, highlighting its clinical significance (Wei2021Structure; Wang2016DHX32).

## Structure
DHX32 is a member of the DEAH-box helicase family, characterized by its unique structural features. The protein consists of 743 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 84 kDa. It includes two RecA-like helicase domains, RecA1 and RecA2, which are crucial for NTP binding, hydrolysis, and RNA substrate binding (Wei2021Structure). The primary structure of DHX32 is defined by its amino acid sequence, while the secondary structure involves the formation of helices and sheets typical of helicase domains (Wei2021Structure).

DHX32 has a distinct helicase domain sequence with amino acid substitutions in all eight motifs, particularly in motifs I and II, which are ATP-binding sites. Despite these substitutions, DHX32 is likely ATPase active. However, the serine-alanine-threonine (SAT) domain in motif III is replaced by a serine-serine-proline (SSP) domain, affecting ATP hydrolysis and RNA unwinding (Wei2021Structure). The QRxGRxGR sequence of motif VI, crucial for nucleic acid substrate binding, is not conserved, suggesting it may not display helicase activity (Wei2021Structure).

DHX32 also has a splice variant, DHX32∆5, resulting from alternative splicing, which lacks 81 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 75 kDa (Wei2021Structure). The protein is localized in the nucleus and mitochondria, indicating diverse functions (Wei2021Structure).

## Function
DHX32 is a member of the DEAH-box helicase family, which is involved in various RNA-associated biological processes, including ribosome biosynthesis, transcription, mRNA splicing, and translation. These processes are crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Wei2021Structure). DHX32 is characterized by specific conserved motifs that contribute to its function, including NTP binding, RNA substrate binding, and promoting NTP-dependent RNA unwinding (Wei2021Structure).

In healthy human cells, DHX32 is widely distributed across various tissues, including the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, rectum, and breast. It is localized in the nucleus and mitochondria, suggesting its involvement in regulating mRNA transcription, splicing, and mitochondrial gene expression (Wei2021Structure). This localization indicates a role in the redistribution of mitochondrial-associated proteins, influencing gene expression in both the nucleus and mitochondria (Wei2021Structure).

DHX32 expression is associated with lymphocyte activation and differentiation, with higher expression levels observed in activated and differentiated lymphocytes. This expression pattern is positively correlated with lymphocyte proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, highlighting its role in cell proliferation and differentiation processes (Wei2021Structure).

## Clinical Significance
DHX32 is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels serving as potential biomarkers for prognosis and treatment strategies. In breast cancer, DHX32 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. This overexpression is associated with advanced clinical stages, higher histological grades, positive lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis, including decreased overall survival and disease-free survival. DHX32 expression is considered an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer outcomes (Wei2021Structure; Wang2016DHX32).

In colorectal cancer, DHX32 is also upregulated and linked to tumor progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis. It promotes cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, potentially through the Wnt signaling pathway. DHX32 overexpression in colorectal cancer cells is associated with resistance to the chemotherapy agent 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), suggesting a role in chemoresistance (Lin2015Overexpression; Huang2009Upregulation).

In hematological malignancies, DHX32 expression varies. It is downregulated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, where its deletion is linked to chemotherapy resistance in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia. Missense mutations in DHX32 are associated with poor prognosis in myeloid and lymphocytic leukemia (Wei2021Structure).
