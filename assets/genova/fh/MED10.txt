# MED10

## Overview
MED10 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 10, a critical component of the Mediator complex involved in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The Mediator complex serves as a bridge, facilitating communication between transcription factors and RNA polymerase II, thereby playing a pivotal role in the transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic genes. MED10, as part of the Middle module of the Mediator complex, is integral to the structural and functional integrity of this complex, interacting with other subunits such as Med7 and Med21 to form a network essential for transcriptional activation (Tsai2014Subunit; Napoli2012Unraveling). The protein is highly conserved across species, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular processes. Beyond its transcriptional functions, MED10 has been implicated in specific cellular processes, including the regulation of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, and is associated with clinical outcomes in certain cancers, such as bladder urothelial carcinoma (Wu2022MED10; Napoli2012Unraveling).

## Structure
The MED10 protein is a subunit of the Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. Structurally, MED10 is suggested to be homologous to the N-terminal region of the head module subunit Med8, which has a known structure. This homology implies that MED10 may form three helices (a1, a2, and a3) that correspond to helices in Med8. These helices are part of the arm and spine in the head module structure, interacting with other subunits such as Med11N/Med22N (Larivière2013Model).

MED10 interacts with the Med7C/Med21 heterodimer, and Med22 can be a structural homolog of either Med7 or Med21. This suggests that MED10 may use its helix a2 to interact with either Med7 or Med21, leading to potential models for a Med10-Med7C/Med21 trimeric subcomplex. However, only one model, obtained by superimposing Med7C with Med22, aligns with observed cross-links, contributing to a reliable representation of the core region of the middle module (Larivière2013Model).

The protein sequence of MED10 is highly conserved across species, indicating a conserved function. However, specific details about post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of MED10 are not provided in the available context (Lin2007Depletion).

## Function
MED10 is a component of the Mediator complex, a crucial transcriptional coactivator that facilitates the interaction between RNA polymerase II and transcription factors, playing a significant role in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. In healthy human cells, MED10 is part of the Middle module of the Mediator complex, which is involved in regulatory signal transfer and transcriptional activation (Tsai2014Subunit; Napoli2012Unraveling). The Middle module, including MED10, interacts with other subunits to form a network crucial for the Mediator's role in transcription (Tsai2014Subunit).

MED10 is implicated in facilitating transcriptional activation by enhancing the association of the Mediator complex with RNA polymerase II, as evidenced by its enriched levels in Mediator preparations that support higher transcriptional activity (Paoletti2006Quantitative). This suggests that MED10 may play a role in gene-specific transcriptional activation, potentially influencing the transcription of different subsets of genes depending on the specific Mediator complex it is part of (Napoli2012Unraveling).

In addition to its role in transcriptional activation, MED10 has been noted to have an inhibitory role in the regulation of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, indicating its involvement in specific cellular processes (Napoli2012Unraveling).

## Clinical Significance
MED10, a component of the mediator complex, plays a significant role in the progression of bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA). Alterations in MED10 expression are linked to oncogenicity, metastasis, and recurrence of this cancer type. Overexpression of MED10 is associated with higher tumor stages, poor prognosis, and a 3.53-fold increased hazard ratio for disease progression, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Wu2022MED10). MED10 expression is positively correlated with immune suppression, characterized by low levels of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and high levels of immune suppressors like regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and therapy resistance (Wu2022MED10).

MED10 is also co-expressed with oncogenic microRNA hsa-miR-590, which is inversely associated with tumor-suppressor microRNAs. This interaction enhances cancer stemness and metastatic potential, suggesting that targeting MED10 could downregulate hsa-miR-590-5p expression and attenuate these aggressive cancer phenotypes (Wu2022MED10). While the study does not specifically mention diseases caused by MED10 mutations, its dysregulation is clearly implicated in the adverse clinical outcomes of bladder cancer (Wu2022MED10).

## Interactions
MED10, a component of the yeast Mediator complex, is involved in various protein-protein interactions crucial for transcription regulation. It interacts strongly with Med7 and Med21, forming part of a network within the Mediator complex. These interactions are essential for the structural integrity and function of the complex (Hallberg2006Functional). MED10 also interacts with Med31, as demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and two-hybrid assays, indicating its role as a middle module subunit (Guglielmi2004A).

The interaction between MED10 and Med21 is particularly significant, with amino acids 1-80 of MED10 being sufficient for this interaction. The interaction is reduced when amino acids 2-8 of Med21 are deleted, highlighting the importance of these residues (Hallberg2006Functional). MED10 is also known to interact with Med4, although this interaction is weaker compared to its interactions with Med7 and Med21 (Hallberg2006Functional).

Structural modeling suggests that MED10 forms part of a trimeric subcomplex with Med7 and Med21, with its helix a2 potentially interacting with Med7 or Med21 (Larivière2013Model). These interactions underscore MED10's role in maintaining the functional architecture of the Mediator complex.
