# KRT6B

## Overview
KRT6B is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 6B, a type II intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues. Keratin 6B plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells, particularly in the skin, by forming a cytoskeletal network that supports cellular architecture. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including keratinocyte migration, wound healing, and mitochondrial function, highlighting its importance in tissue repair and homeostasis. Mutations in the KRT6B gene are linked to pachyonychia congenita, type 2 (PC-2), a genetic disorder characterized by nail dystrophy and skin abnormalities (Zieman2019Pathophysiology; Coulombe2017The). The study of KRT6B and its interactions with other proteins, such as myosin IIA and desmoplakin, provides insights into its role in cell adhesion and migration, which are essential for effective wound healing and epithelial tissue maintenance (Wang2018Keratin).

## Structure
KRT6B (keratin 6B) is a type II cytokeratin, part of the intermediate filament proteins that form a cytoskeletal network within epithelial cells. The primary structure of KRT6B consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein's backbone. The secondary structure is characterized by conserved α-helical coiled-coil sequences, which are typical of keratin proteins (Ho2022Update). These α-helices are organized in a heptad repeat pattern, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers (Ho2022Update).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a stable coiled-coil configuration, contributing to the protein's structural integrity and function. In terms of quaternary structure, KRT6B forms heterodimeric complexes with type I keratins, which then assemble into antiparallel tetramers. These tetramers are the building blocks for higher-order intermediate filament assemblies (Ho2022Update).

KRT6B is involved in the formation of intermediate filaments through a 'knob-pocket tetramerization mechanism' on type II keratins, which is crucial for tetramer formation (Ho2022Update). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect the function and interactions of KRT6B, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
Keratin 6B (KRT6B) is a type II intermediate filament protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells, particularly in the skin. It is involved in several cellular processes, including keratinocyte migration, wound healing, and mitochondrial function.

KRT6B is essential for regulating keratinocyte migration by influencing cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. It interacts with myosin IIA, a motor protein, to stabilize cell adhesion structures, which is critical for effective wound healing. The absence of KRT6B leads to enhanced keratinocyte migration due to altered adhesion dynamics and increased Src kinase activity, which affects the speed and directionality of cell movement (Wang2018Keratin).

In addition to its role in cell migration, KRT6B supports mitochondrial organization and function. It helps maintain mitochondrial structure, dynamics, and respiration, which are vital for cellular energy production and redox homeostasis. Keratin-null cells exhibit impaired mitochondrial function, including reduced respiration and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, highlighting the importance of KRT6B in cellular homeostasis (Steen2020A).

Overall, KRT6B is integral to maintaining epithelial tissue integrity and facilitating repair processes in response to injury.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT6B gene are associated with pachyonychia congenita, type 2 (PC-2), a rare genetic disorder affecting ectoderm-derived epithelial appendages. This condition is characterized by nail dystrophy, severe palmoplantar keratoderma, oral leukoplakia, natal teeth, pili torti (twisted hair), and steatocystic skin lesions (steatocystoma multiplex) (Coulombe2017The). The inheritance pattern for pachyonychia congenita is autosomal dominant, meaning a single copy of the mutated gene can cause the disorder (Coulombe2017The).

The pathophysiology of pachyonychia congenita-associated palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) involves epidermal thickening and hyperkeratosis, but does not show keratinocyte fragility. The condition significantly impacts quality of life due to severe plantar pain from PPK lesions, although it does not affect lifespan (Zieman2019Pathophysiology). Current treatments are palliative, focusing on callus removal and moisturizers, as the underlying pathophysiology is not fully understood (Zieman2019Pathophysiology).

Alterations in KRT6B expression levels have been noted in PC-based PPK, where increased expression is significant (Zieman2019Pathophysiology). These alterations may disrupt filament formation or interactions with other intracellular proteins, potentially affecting keratin protein function (Ho2022Update).

## Interactions
Keratin 6B (KRT6B) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. KRT6B interacts with myosin IIA, a motor protein essential for cell adhesion and migration. This interaction stabilizes myosin IIA protein levels, which is important for maintaining proper cell-cell adhesion and migration dynamics in keratinocytes (Wang2018Keratin). The absence of KRT6B leads to reduced levels of myosin IIA, affecting cell adhesion and migration (Wang2018Keratin).

KRT6B also interacts with desmoplakin, a protein that links intermediate filaments to desmosomes, which are structures that facilitate cell-cell adhesion. In KRT6B-null keratinocytes, desmoplakin is mislocalized, leading to weakened cell-cell adhesion and increased keratinocyte migration (Wang2018Keratin). This interaction is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells during processes such as wound healing (Wang2018Keratin).

Additionally, KRT6B is involved in interactions with integrins, particularly β4 integrin, which affects cell-matrix adhesion. This interaction is important for keratinocyte migration on different extracellular matrix components (Wang2018Keratin). These interactions highlight the role of KRT6B in regulating both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, influencing keratinocyte behavior and function.
