# VPS25

## Overview
VPS25 is a gene that encodes the vacuolar protein sorting 25 homolog, a crucial component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport II (ESCRT-II). This protein is integral to the endosomal-lysosomal pathway, facilitating the sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) for degradation. Structurally, VPS25 is characterized by two winged helix (WH) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions within the ESCRT-II complex, as well as RNA binding, suggesting a role in mRNA regulation (Wernimont2004Crystal; Emerman2018The). The protein's interactions with other ESCRT components, such as Vps22 and Vps36, are essential for the assembly and function of the ESCRT-II complex, highlighting its role in cellular processes like membrane trafficking, cytokinesis, and receptor downregulation (Wernimont2004Crystal). VPS25's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in pathological conditions, such as glioma, where its expression is altered (Zhu2021YTHDC1mediated).

## Structure
The VPS25 protein is a component of the ESCRT-II complex, which plays a crucial role in endosomal trafficking. Structurally, VPS25 is characterized by two winged helix (WH) domains arranged in tandem, with an H1/b1/H2/H3/b2/b3 topology. These domains are compact alpha/beta structures, although VPS25 deviates slightly from the canonical fold, lacking some typical elements such as helix 2 and wing W2, which are replaced by a disordered loop and a twisted anti-parallel beta-sheet (Wernimont2004Crystal; Im2008Integrated).

The N-terminal domain of VPS25 is involved in interactions with other ESCRT-II components, such as Vps22 and Vps36, and contains additional helices that facilitate these interactions (Wernimont2004Crystal). The protein forms a dimeric structure through hydrophobic interactions, although this dimerization is not observed in vitro (Wernimont2004Crystal).

In terms of quaternary structure, VPS25 is part of a trilobal ESCRT-II complex, consisting of two molecules of VPS25, one molecule of VPS22, and one molecule of VPS36. The VPS25 subunits form two of the lobes, while the third lobe consists of VPS36 and VPS22 (Im2008Integrated). The interactions between VPS25 and other ESCRT components are crucial for the assembly and function of the ESCRT-II complex (Hierro2004Structure).

## Function
VPS25 is a component of the ESCRT-II complex, which plays a critical role in the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. This complex is essential for the sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) for degradation. VPS25, along with other ESCRT components like Vps36 and SNF8, is involved in recognizing monoubiquitylated cargo through the ubiquitin-binding NZF zinc finger motif in Vps36, facilitating protein sorting at the endosomal membrane (Wernimont2004Crystal).

In healthy human cells, VPS25 is active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, cytokinesis, and receptor downregulation. It is involved in the formation of MVBs, which are important for the downregulation of plasma membrane receptors and the regulation of signal transduction pathways (Wernimont2004Crystal). VPS25 also plays a role in transcription regulation and is implicated in stress and pheromone response pathways, potentially linking it to the sorting of sucrose receptors via the endosomal pathway (Wernimont2004Crystal).

The ESCRT-II complex, including VPS25, may transiently associate with endosomal membranes, possibly inducing nuclear localization to regulate gene expression, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis (Wernimont2004Crystal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VPS25 gene have been implicated in the progression of glioma, a type of brain tumor. VPS25 is upregulated in glioma tissues compared to normal brain tissues, and its higher expression levels are associated with advanced tumor stages and shorter survival times in glioma patients. This upregulation is particularly noted in IDH-mutated gliomas. Functional studies have shown that VPS25 promotes glioma cell proliferation, and its knockdown leads to cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis, suggesting its crucial role in glioma development and progression (Zhu2021YTHDC1mediated).

VPS25 is also involved in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is important for cancer cell cycles. Alterations in VPS25 expression can significantly impact glioma progression through modulation of this pathway, as VPS25 knockdown results in decreased phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT1, leading to cell cycle arrest (Zhu2021YTHDC1mediated).

In Drosophila, mutations in the vps25 gene, which is homologous to human VPS25, lead to defects in endocytic trafficking and result in nonautonomous tissue overgrowth due to ectopic Notch activity. This suggests that similar mechanisms could contribute to tumorigenesis in humans (Vaccari2005The).

## Interactions
VPS25, a component of the ESCRT-II complex, participates in several key interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a trilobal structure with other ESCRT-II subunits, Vps22 and Vps36, through head-to-tail interactions, with its N-terminal region and Arg83 playing crucial roles in these interactions (Wernimont2004Crystal). VPS25 also interacts with components of the ESCRT-I and ESCRT-III complexes, specifically Vps28 and Vps20, respectively, facilitated by a negatively charged surface on its domain 2 (Wernimont2004Crystal).

In addition to protein interactions, VPS25 has been shown to bind RNA. In Xenopus laevis, VPS25 interacts with RNA through its winged-helix domains, recognizing GA-rich sequences. This RNA-binding property is conserved and suggests a role in mRNA regulation (Emerman2018The). The interaction with RNA is largely unaffected by membrane binding, distinguishing it from other ESCRT-II subunits like Vps36 and Vps22, which show competitive interactions with membranes (Emerman2018The).

VPS25 also interacts with CHMP6, a component of the ESCRT-III complex, which is essential for endosomal protein sorting and cell division (Zhu2021YTHDC1mediated). These interactions highlight VPS25's multifaceted role in cellular processes.
