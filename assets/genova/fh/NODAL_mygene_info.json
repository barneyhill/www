encodes a secreted ligand of the TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta) superfamily of proteins. Ligands of this family bind various TGF-beta receptors leading to recruitment and activation of SMAD family transcription factors that regulate gene expression. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protein, which regulates early embryonic development. This protein is required for maintenance of human embryonic stem cell pluripotency and may play a role in human placental development. Mutations in this gene are associated with heterotaxy, a condition characterized by random orientation of visceral organs with respect to the left-right axis.
