# CASQ2

## Overview
The CASQ2 gene encodes calsequestrin 2, a crucial calcium-binding protein predominantly expressed in cardiac muscle tissue. Calsequestrin 2 is integral to the regulation of calcium ion storage and release within the sarcoplasmic reticulum, playing a vital role in cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation. As a high-capacity, low-affinity calcium-binding protein, calsequestrin 2 facilitates the rapid release of calcium ions necessary for excitation-contraction coupling in heart muscle cells. The protein's function is modulated by its ability to undergo reversible polymerization in response to calcium concentration changes, which enhances its calcium-binding capacity. Calsequestrin 2 interacts with other sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins, such as triadin and junctin, to regulate the activity of ryanodine receptors, thereby maintaining calcium homeostasis and proper cardiac function (Wang2020Calsequestrin.; Rossi2020Calsequestrin). Mutations in the CASQ2 gene are associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), a condition that can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias (Song2007Calsequestrin; ELDAR2002A).

## Structure
Calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) is a calcium-binding protein primarily found in cardiac muscle. Its molecular structure is characterized by three thioredoxin-like domains, which are similar to ER luminal oxidoreductases (Wang2020Phylogenetic). The primary structure of CASQ2 includes a sequence rich in aspartic and glutamic acids, contributing to its low isoelectric point (Marabelli2023The). The secondary structure of CASQ2 involves a four-strand β-sheet sandwiched by three alpha helices, forming a thioredoxin fold (Wang2020Calsequestrin.).

The tertiary structure of CASQ2 is crucial for its function, as it undergoes conformational changes upon binding with Ca2+, increasing α-helix content at lower Ca2+ concentrations and β-sheet content at higher concentrations (Wang2020Calsequestrin.). The quaternary structure involves the polymerization of CASQ2 into linear filaments, enhancing its Ca2+ binding capacity (Wang2020Calsequestrin.).

CASQ2 contains a flexible and unstructured C-tail domain, which is longer than that of CASQ1 and acts as a major low-affinity Ca2+ binding domain (Wang2020Calsequestrin.). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination can affect CASQ2's function and interactions (Wang2020Calsequestrin.). CASQ2 is encoded by the casq2 gene located on chromosome 1p23 and is expressed predominantly in the heart (Wang2020Calsequestrin.).

## Function
Calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) is a major calcium-binding protein located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of cardiac muscle cells, where it plays a crucial role in calcium ion storage and release, essential for muscle contraction and relaxation (Wang2020Calsequestrin.). CASQ2 binds calcium ions with high capacity but low affinity, allowing it to store large amounts of calcium and release it rapidly during excitation-contraction coupling, a process vital for converting electrical signals into mechanical force in muscle cells (Wang2020Calsequestrin.; wang2020insights).

CASQ2 undergoes reversible polymerization in response to changes in calcium concentration, enhancing its calcium-binding capacity and helping regulate calcium release channels, such as the ryanodine receptor (RyR) (Wang2020Calsequestrin.). It interacts with other proteins in the SR, such as triadin and junctin, to modulate RyR activity, contributing to its regulatory role in calcium signaling (Wang2020Calsequestrin.; Rossi2020Calsequestrin). This interaction is crucial for maintaining calcium homeostasis and proper cardiac muscle function, impacting heart rhythm and performance (Rossi2020Calsequestrin; Song2007Calsequestrin). CASQ2's function is also influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, which affect its calcium-binding capacity and polymerization (Marabelli2023The; Lewis2016Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CASQ2 gene are linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), a condition characterized by adrenergic-induced ventricular arrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death. CASQ2 mutations can manifest in both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant forms of CPVT. The autosomal recessive form is often associated with early onset and high penetrance by age 10, with a high mortality rate if untreated. This form is linked to mutations such as the D307H missense mutation, which disrupts calcium binding in cardiac myocytes (Song2007Calsequestrin; ELDAR2002A).

The autosomal dominant form of CPVT has been associated with heterozygous missense variants like Lys180Arg, which alter the protein's binding affinity and may function through a dominant negative mechanism (Ng2020An; Gray2016A). These mutations lead to altered calcium handling, increased expression of calreticulin and ryanodine receptors, and spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release, contributing to arrhythmogenic conditions (Song2007Calsequestrin; Knollmann2006Casq2).

CASQ2 mutations can also result in compensatory mechanisms, such as increased sarcoplasmic reticulum volume and altered expression of associated proteins, which may maintain some cardiac function but exacerbate arrhythmias (Knollmann2006Casq2).

## Interactions
Calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) is a key calcium-binding protein in cardiac muscle, interacting with several proteins to regulate calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). CASQ2 forms a complex with triadin and junctin, which is essential for the regulation of the ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) calcium release channels. These interactions are crucial for maintaining calcium homeostasis and proper cardiac muscle contraction (Wang2020Calsequestrin.).

CASQ2 interacts directly with RyR2 in a calcium-dependent manner, binding to the first SR luminal loop of RyR2. This interaction is modulated by calcium concentration, with CASQ2 activating RyR2 at high calcium levels and inhibiting it at low levels (Wang2020Calsequestrin.). The presence of CASQ2 is crucial for maintaining RyR2 sensitivity to SR luminal calcium, and its removal reduces the open probability of RyR2 (Wang2020Calsequestrin.).

CASQ2 also interacts with the unfolded protein response stress sensor IRE1α, preventing its activation by binding to its ER luminal domain. This interaction is distinct from those with RyR, triadin, or junctin (Wang2020Calsequestrin.). These interactions highlight the regulatory role of CASQ2 in muscle excitation-contraction coupling and its importance in maintaining calcium homeostasis.
