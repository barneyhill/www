# GTPBP10

## Overview
GTPBP10 is a gene that encodes the GTP binding protein 10, a mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in the biogenesis and maturation of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU). As a member of the Obg family of GTPases, the protein is characterized by a C-terminal GTP binding domain and an N-terminal glycine-rich domain known as the Obg fold (Maiti2018Human; Jerry2019GTP). GTP binding protein 10 is involved in the late stages of mtLSU assembly, ensuring the stability and proper function of the mitoribosome, which is essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis and cellular energy production (Lavdovskaia2018The; Nguyen2023Structural). The protein's interactions with various ribosomal proteins and assembly factors highlight its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and its potential implications in mitochondrial diseases and cancer (Lavdovskaia2018The; Hu2022Pancancer).

## Structure
GTPBP10 is a mitochondrial matrix protein involved in mitoribosome maturation. It is a member of the Obg family, characterized by a C-terminal GTP binding domain and an N-terminal glycine-rich domain known as the Obg fold (Maiti2018Human; Jerry2019GTP). The primary structure of GTPBP10 includes 383 amino acids, with the coding region containing 1149 base pairs (Jerry2019GTP). The protein has two isoforms: isoform 1, which is 387 amino acids long, and isoform 2, which is 308 amino acids long due to the absence of exons 3 and 4 (Maiti2018Human).

The secondary structure of GTPBP10 includes an alpha-helical element (R52-R66) that interacts with the 23S rRNA helix H89 (Nguyen2023Structural). The tertiary structure involves the Obg domain interacting with helix H89 in a lifted conformation, and the GTPase domain positioned between the L7/12 stalk base and the sarcin-ricin loop (Nguyen2023Structural). GTPBP10's quaternary structure is not detailed in the available sources.

GTPBP10 contains conserved G-motifs and glycine residues in the N-terminal domain, with the G2 and G3 domains being part of the 'Switch 1' and 'Switch 2' domains, respectively (Jerry2019GTP). The protein lacks the C-terminal TGS domain found in many other Obg proteins (Jerry2019GTP). The existence of two isoforms may relate to tissue-specific requirements or protein-protein interactions (Maiti2018Human).

## Function
GTPBP10 is a mitochondrial protein involved in the biogenesis of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU) in human cells. It is a member of the Obg GTPase family and plays a crucial role in the maturation of the mtLSU, which is essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. GTPBP10 specifically associates with the mtLSU at a late maturation stage, facilitating the assembly and stability of the mitoribosome, particularly impacting the stability of certain mitoribosomal proteins and the biogenesis factor NGRN (Lavdovskaia2018The; Maiti2018Human).

The protein is peripherally associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane and interacts with several known ribosome biogenesis factors, including GTPBP7, NGRN, and MALSU1. It is enriched in complexes containing mtLSU assembly factors and mtRNA granule proteins, indicating its significant role in mtLSU biogenesis (Lavdovskaia2018The). GTPBP10's function is critical for the proper assembly of the mitoribosome, ensuring that only correctly assembled particles proceed to translation, which is vital for mitochondrial gene expression and cellular energy production (Maiti2018Human; Nguyen2023Structural). The absence of GTPBP10 leads to defects in mitoribosome stability or biogenesis, resulting in impaired mitochondrial translation and reduced cell growth (Lavdovskaia2018The; Maiti2018Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the GTPBP10 gene can lead to significant clinical consequences, particularly affecting mitochondrial function. GTPBP10 is crucial for the maturation of mitoribosomes, which are essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis and energy production. Deficiency in GTPBP10 results in impaired mitoribosome assembly, leading to reduced mitochondrial protein synthesis and decreased cell growth (Lavdovskaia2018The; Maiti2018Human). This impairment can cause mitochondrial translation deficiencies, impacting cellular energy production and potentially contributing to mitochondrial diseases (Maiti2018Human).

The absence of GTPBP10 affects the stability of mitoribosomal RNA and proteins, leading to a decrease in the formation of the 55S monosome, which is essential for mitochondrial gene expression (Lavdovskaia2018The). This instability can result in a significant reduction in the synthesis of mtDNA-encoded proteins, further affecting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) function (Lavdovskaia2018The).

In the context of cancer, the GTPBP10 gene, as part of the GTPBP family, has been implicated in cancer progression and prognosis. Alterations in its expression levels are associated with differential expression patterns in various cancers, suggesting a potential role in cancer biology and as a prognostic marker (Hu2022Pancancer).

## Interactions
GTPBP10 is involved in the maturation of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU) and interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids during this process. It directly binds to the 16S rRNA and mtLSU proteins, including uL13, and assembly factors such as MTG1 and MALSU1 (Maiti2018Human). GTPBP10 forms complexes with mitoribosomal proteins, as evidenced by mass spectrometry identifying multiple mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) in association with it (Maiti2018Human). 

GTPBP10 also interacts with GTPBP7, a biogenesis factor, and this interaction is characterized by high shape complementarity and hydrophobic contacts. GTPBP10's Obg domain stacks onto GTPBP7, facilitating its role in mitoribosome maturation (Nguyen2023Structural). The protein is part of a complex with other mtLSU biogenesis factors, including mitochondrial RNA granule components and late mtLSU assembly factors such as SMCR7L, MTERF4, and NSUN4 (Lavdovskaia2018The).

Mutations in GTPBP10's Obg and GTPase domains impair its ability to bind to the mtLSU, which is crucial for mitochondrial translation and the stability of mtDNA-encoded proteins (Lavdovskaia2018The). These interactions highlight GTPBP10's essential role in mitoribosome biogenesis and mitochondrial function.
