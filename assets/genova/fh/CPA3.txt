# CPA3

## Overview
Carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3) is a gene that encodes a zinc-containing metalloproteinase, which is predominantly expressed in mast cells. The protein product, carboxypeptidase A3, is involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of the tissue microenvironment, innate immunity, and extracellular matrix remodeling. As a member of the carboxypeptidase family, CPA3 functions by cleaving C-terminal amino acids from peptides, particularly targeting aromatic and aliphatic residues. This enzymatic activity is crucial for processing bioactive peptides and proteins that play roles in immune responses and inflammation. CPA3 is stored in an active form within mast cell granules, allowing for rapid enzymatic activity upon secretion. Its interactions with glycosaminoglycans, such as heparin, and other proteases like tryptase and chymase, are essential for its function and localization within mast cells. CPA3's involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including its role in diseases such as severe COVID-19 and asthma, highlights its significance as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase; Budnevskiy2024Certain; Siddhuraj2021Lung).

## Structure
Carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3) is a zinc-containing metalloproteinase with a globular three-layer α/β structure. Its molecular architecture includes a central eight-stranded β sheet flanked by layers of α helices, resembling the structure of porcine pancreatic carboxypeptidase B (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase). The active site of CPA3 is located at the C-terminal end of the parallel β sheet structure, which is characteristic of the carboxypeptidase family (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase).

CPA3 is characterized by a high content of positively charged amino acids, such as arginine, lysine, and histidine. This feature is significant for its interaction with polyanions in mast cell secretory granules, including proteoglycans like serglycin, heparin, and chondroitin sulfate (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase). These interactions are crucial for CPA3's localization and storage within mast cell granules.

The biogenesis of CPA3 involves post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may influence its enzymatic activity and stability (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase). The enzyme is stored in an active form within mast cells, allowing for rapid enzymatic activity upon secretion (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase).

## Function
Carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3) is a zinc-containing metalloproteinase primarily expressed in mast cells, where it plays a significant role in various physiological processes. CPA3 is involved in the regulation of the tissue microenvironment, impacting innate immunity, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase). It functions by cleaving C-terminal amino acids from peptides, particularly aromatic and aliphatic residues, which is crucial for processing bioactive peptides and proteins involved in immune responses and inflammation (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase).

In mast cells, CPA3 is stored in secretory granules in an active form, allowing for rapid deployment through various secretion methods, including degranulation and exocytosis (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase). Its interaction with heparin protects it from endogenous inhibitors, facilitating its role in the extracellular matrix (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase). CPA3 is also associated with the selective sorting and accumulation of secretome components within granules, indicating its involvement in the maturation process of these granules (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase).

The enzyme's activity is linked to the degradation of substrates and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, influencing fibroblast activity and collagen formation (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase). CPA3's role in cleaving peptides like neurotensin and angiotensin I affects their biological activity, contributing to its function in vasodilation and bronchodilation (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase).

## Clinical Significance
Carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3) is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. CPA3 is significantly involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, where increased CPA3-positive mast cells correlate with inflammatory responses and lung fibrosis, suggesting its role in the systemic activation of mast cells and cytokine storms (Budnevskiy2024Certain). In cardiovascular diseases, CPA3 deficiency in blood plasma is considered a risk factor, highlighting its protective role against vasoconstrictor peptides like endothelin 1 (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase).

CPA3 expression is also linked to respiratory conditions such as eosinophilic type 2 asthma, where its mRNA levels are notably high in lung mast cells, indicating a potential role in asthma pathophysiology (Siddhuraj2021Lung). In the context of inflammatory diseases, CPA3 is involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, influencing conditions like fibrosis and chronic inflammation (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase). The enzyme's interactions with other proteases and its secretion mechanisms are crucial in maintaining tissue homeostasis, and disruptions in these processes can contribute to pathological states (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase). CPA3's role in these conditions underscores its potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3) is known to interact with several proteins within mast cells, forming complexes that are crucial for its function. CPA3 forms macromolecular complexes with glycosaminoglycans in mast cell granules, where it closely interacts with tryptase and chymase. These interactions are variable and depend on the microenvironment within the granules (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase). CPA3 has a high affinity for heparin, and its interaction with heparin is distinct from that of chymase and tryptase, which influences its storage and function within mast cells (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase).

CPA3 also forms a complex with chymase, enhancing substrate degradation and participating in the enzymatic cleavage of angiotensin II. This complex plays a role in the biogenesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix by affecting fibroblast activity and collagen fibril formation (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase). CPA3's interactions with negatively charged serglycin proteoglycans are mediated by its positively charged amino acid residues, which are essential for its localization and function within mast cell granules (Atiakshin2022Carboxypeptidase). These interactions highlight CPA3's role in various physiological processes, including immune response and tissue remodeling.
