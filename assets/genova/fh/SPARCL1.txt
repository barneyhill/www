# SPARCL1

## Overview
SPARCL1, or SPARC-like 1, is a gene that encodes a matricellular protein involved in various biological processes, including tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and synaptic function. The SPARCL1 protein is part of the SPARC family and is characterized by its anti-adhesive and anti-proliferative properties, functioning primarily as an angiocrine tumor suppressor. It is expressed in multiple tissues, with significant roles in the central nervous system where it facilitates synapse formation and function. SPARCL1 interacts with several molecular pathways, influencing inflammatory responses and cancer progression. Its expression is often downregulated in various cancers, where it acts as a tumor suppressor, making it a potential biomarker for prognosis and therapeutic targeting (Klingler2020Species; Li2011Down‐regulated; Chen2020Regulation).

## Structure
SPARCL1, also known as SPARC-like 1, is a protein encoded by the SPARCL1 gene and is part of the SPARC family of matricellular proteins. The primary structure of SPARCL1 includes a signal peptide, a follistatin-like (FS) domain, and an extracellular calcium (EC) binding domain, which contains two EF-hand motifs crucial for calcium binding and proper protein folding (Taketomi2022Autismassociated). The secondary structure of SPARCL1 involves alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its compact, globular tertiary structure stabilized by disulfide bonds. The EC domain, particularly the EF-hand motifs, plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and proper trafficking of the protein (Taketomi2022Autismassociated).

SPARCL1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are essential for its function and stability. The protein may also form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure. Splice variants of SPARCL1 can result in different isoforms, each with distinct functions, potentially affecting its role in various biological processes (Kondo2024Efficient). These structural features are critical for SPARCL1's involvement in synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and its potential implications in disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (Taketomi2022Autismassociated).

## Function
SPARCL1, also known as Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteines Like 1, is a matricellular protein that plays a significant role in various molecular processes and cell biology. It is part of the SPARC protein family and is known for its anti-adhesive, anti-proliferative, and anti-tumorigenic functions. SPARCL1 acts as an angiocrine tumor suppressor, secreted by tumor vessel endothelial cells, where it inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth (Klingler2020Species). In healthy human cells, SPARCL1 is expressed in all organs, with the highest levels in the stomach, large intestine, and lung. It is associated with endothelial and mural cells, contributing to vessel homeostasis by inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and sprouting, thus reducing angiogenesis (Klingler2020Species).

In the central nervous system, SPARCL1 is secreted by astrocytes and plays a crucial role in synapse formation, particularly in excitatory synapses. It promotes synaptic connectivity by enhancing NMDA-receptor recruitment, which is essential for normal synaptic connections and reducing neurodegenerative risks (Chen2020Regulation). SPARCL1's involvement in synapse formation and function highlights its importance in maintaining cellular interactions and tissue homeostasis (Gan2020SPARCL1).

## Clinical Significance
SPARCL1 (SPARC-like 1) is implicated in various cancers, often acting as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is significantly downregulated in several malignancies, including colorectal, gastric, and renal cell carcinomas, as well as gastric stromal tumors (GIST) (Shen2018Secreted; Li2011Down‐regulated; Ye2017SPARCL1). In gastric cancer, low SPARCL1 expression is associated with aggressive tumor features and poor differentiation, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Li2011Down‐regulated). Similarly, in colorectal cancer, SPARCL1 expression correlates with tumor differentiation and stage, indicating its role in prognosis (Han2017Prognostic).

In renal cell carcinoma, SPARCL1 suppresses cell migration and invasion, likely through the inactivation of MAPK signaling pathways, highlighting its tumor-suppressive function (Ye2017SPARCL1). In gastric GIST, SPARCL1 downregulation is linked to increased metastasis and poor prognosis, reinforcing its role as a malignancy suppressor (Shen2018Secreted).

SPARCL1 genetic alterations are present in 1.5% of all cancers, with the highest frequency in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), and bladder cancer (BLCA). In UCEC, altered SPARCL1 is associated with improved survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for immunotherapeutic response (He2022Immunological).

## Interactions
SPARCL1 interacts with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to mediate inflammatory responses. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6. The binding of SPARCL1 to TLR4 has been demonstrated in various studies, highlighting its role in promoting a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype and exacerbating conditions like viral pneumonia and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (Liu2021Sparcl1; Zhao2024Vascular).

In the context of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), SPARCL1 is targeted by miRNA-105-5p, which negatively regulates its expression. This interaction affects the FAK/Akt signaling pathway, as SPARCL1 overexpression decreases the levels of phosphorylated FAK and Akt, thereby inhibiting the pathway's activation. The regulation of SPARCL1 by miRNA-105-5p is facilitated through extracellular vesicles, which transfer the miRNA to ESCC cells, influencing cell growth and migration (He2022Extracellular).

These interactions underscore SPARCL1's role in modulating inflammatory and cancer-related pathways, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in various diseases.
