# H2AC17

## Overview
H2AC17 is a gene that encodes the protein H2A clustered histone 17, which is a variant of the histone H2A family. Histones are essential components of chromatin, the complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cell nuclei, and play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression by facilitating or hindering access to DNA. The H2A clustered histone 17 protein is involved in the structural organization of chromatin and is crucial for DNA packaging within the nucleus. This protein is categorized as a histone, which is a type of nuclear protein that contributes to the formation of nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin. The gene and its encoded protein have been studied for their involvement in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, and have been implicated in several diseases, such as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (Huang2023Identification; Wu2021Kidney).

## Clinical Significance
The H2AC17 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In patients with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) infection, H2AC17 is differentially expressed and associated with pathways such as the p53 signaling pathway, DNA replication, and apoptosis. This suggests a role in regulating the cell cycle and immune system functions in these patients (Huang2023Identification).

In the context of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), H2AC17 is identified as a necroptosis-related gene (NRG) with significant clinical effects. It is part of a high-risk NRG signature associated with shorter survival times, indicating a potential detrimental impact on KIRC prognosis (Wu2021Kidney).

In breast cancer, H2AC17 is downregulated in olaparib-treated triple-negative breast cancer cells, although its specific role in breast cancer remains unclear and requires further investigation (Hekmatshoar2024The).

Overall, alterations in H2AC17 expression and interactions are linked to various diseases, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in different pathological contexts.
