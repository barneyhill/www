# THAP10

## Overview
THAP10 is a gene that encodes the THAP domain-containing protein 10, which is a member of the THAP protein family characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain. This protein is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation and functions as a tumor suppressor, particularly in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and breast cancer. The THAP domain of THAP10 is unique due to its longer structure and specific amino acid substitutions, which may influence its DNA-binding capabilities. Unlike other THAP proteins, THAP10 lacks certain structural features that facilitate oligomerization, suggesting distinct functional properties (Sanghavi2021Synapomorphic; Sanghavi2019Classification). The gene's expression is epigenetically regulated, with implications for its role in cancer pathogenesis, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Li2017A; De2008Silencing).

## Structure
The THAP10 protein contains a THAP domain, a conserved DNA-binding domain characterized by a zinc-coordinating C2CH motif at the amino terminus and an AVPTIF box at the carboxy terminus. This domain typically folds into a β-α-β secondary structural fold, which is consistent with predictions for the THAP domains of the twelve human THAP proteins, including THAP10 (Sanghavi2021Synapomorphic). However, in THAP10, the phenylalanine in the AVPTIF motif is replaced by histidine, which may affect its interaction with DNA (Sanghavi2021Synapomorphic).

The THAP domain of THAP10 is noted to have unique insertions at the amino terminal region, leading to a longer domain compared to other homologs. These insertions do not follow a consensus sequence or secondary structure, indicating variability (Sanghavi2021Synapomorphic). The L4 loop within the THAP domain of THAP10 is the longest among human THAP proteins, consisting of 35 residues, which might suggest a stronger DNA interaction (Sanghavi2021Synapomorphic).

THAP10 lacks a predicted alpha helical region or coiled coil structure, which are features present in other THAP proteins that facilitate oligomerization (Sanghavi2019Classification). The carboxy terminal portions of THAP10 remain structurally and functionally uncharacterized (Sanghavi2019Classification).

## Function
THAP10 is a nuclear protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation, particularly in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with the t(8;21) translocation. It functions as a tumor suppressor gene by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting differentiation of myeloid cells. THAP10 achieves this by down-regulating genes associated with receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, which are crucial for cell growth and differentiation (Li2017A). 

The protein is epigenetically regulated, with its expression being suppressed by the AML1-ETO fusion protein through promoter hypermethylation. This suppression is linked to poor clinical outcomes in AML, as it leads to the activation of tyrosine kinase pathways that promote cell proliferation and block differentiation (Li2017A). THAP10 is also negatively regulated by miR-383, which further influences its role in leukemogenesis (Li2017A).

In addition to its role in leukemia, THAP10 is involved in breast cancer, where it is frequently silenced due to promoter hypermethylation. This silencing is associated with hormone-responsive pathways, as the gene's expression can be influenced by estrogen and anti-estrogen treatments (De2008Silencing).

## Clinical Significance
THAP10 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), THAP10 is epigenetically suppressed by the AML1-ETO fusion protein, which results from a chromosomal translocation. This suppression is linked to aberrant DNA methylation patterns, contributing to leukemia pathogenesis. THAP10 acts as a tumor suppressor in this context, and its reduced expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes. The gene is part of an epigenetic mini-circuitry involving AML1-ETO and miR-383, which further suppresses THAP10 expression, potentially affecting cell differentiation and proliferation (Li2017A).

In breast cancer, THAP10 is silenced through hypermethylation of its bidirectional promoter shared with the LRRC49 gene. This silencing is a frequent event, observed in a significant percentage of primary breast tumors. The hypermethylation correlates with reduced expression of THAP10, suggesting a role in breast cancer pathogenesis. The study also indicates that THAP10 expression can be upregulated by estrogen, highlighting its potential involvement in hormone-responsive breast cancer (De2008Silencing).

## Interactions
THAP10 is involved in several interactions that play a role in the regulation of gene expression and cellular processes. In the context of t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), THAP10 is a target gene of the oncogenic fusion protein AML1-ETO. This fusion protein recruits DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) to hypermethylate the promoter of THAP10, leading to its epigenetic suppression (Li2017A). THAP10 is also regulated by miR-383, which is upregulated in AML1-ETO positive leukemia cells, further contributing to the suppression of THAP10 expression (Li2017A).

THAP10 acts as a tumor suppressor and is involved in inhibiting myeloid proliferation and promoting differentiation in AML cells. Its expression is inversely correlated with AML1-ETO and tyrosine kinase C-KIT mRNA levels, suggesting a role in modulating receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways (Li2017A). The study of THAP10 interactions also highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in t(8;21) AML (Li2017A).

Additionally, THAP10 may interact with other members of the human THAP family, such as THAP9, indicating potential hetero-oligomerization capabilities (Sanghavi2020Oligomerisation). These interactions suggest a complex network of regulatory mechanisms involving THAP10 in cellular processes.
