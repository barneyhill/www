# PWP2

## Overview
The PWP2 gene encodes the PWP2 small subunit processome component, a protein integral to ribosome biogenesis. This protein is characterized by its WD40 repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, classifying it as a member of the beta-transducin superfamily of WD repeat-containing proteins. PWP2 is a crucial component of the small subunit processome, specifically involved in the early stages of ribosome assembly and the maturation of 18S rRNA, essential for forming the 40S ribosomal subunit. The protein operates within the nucleolus and is expressed ubiquitously across tissues, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular function. PWP2's interactions within the UTP-B complex, particularly with proteins such as Utp12p, Utp13p, Utp18p, and Utp21p, are vital for the assembly and function of the ribosomal subunit processome. Clinically, PWP2 is implicated in several inherited disorders and diseases related to defects in ribosome biogenesis, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Lafrenière1996Isolation; Boissier2017Pwp2; Jayasena2011Live).

## Structure
The PWP2 protein is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeat domains, which are structural motifs that form a beta-propeller structure. These domains are crucial for facilitating protein-protein interactions. The human PWP2 protein contains at least four well-defined WD repeats and several degenerate copies, identifying it as a member of the beta-transducin superfamily of WD repeat-containing proteins (Lafrenière1996Isolation). 

The protein's structure includes a tandem WD-repeat (tWD) domain at the N-terminus, which forms a tandem β-propeller structure. This domain is essential for interactions with other proteins such as Utp21p, Utp18p, and Utp6p, forming a core complex within the UTP-B complex (Boissier2017Pwp2). The C-terminal domain (CTD) is necessary for the assembly of the Utp12p:Utp13p heterodimer and plays a role in the nucleolar localization of UTP-B components (Boissier2017Pwp2).

The PWP2 protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively documented in the provided context. Information on specific splice variant isoforms is limited (Boissier2017Pwp2).

## Function
The PWP2 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the small subunit processome, a ribonucleoprotein complex essential for ribosome biogenesis. In healthy human cells, PWP2 is involved in the early stages of ribosome assembly, specifically in the processing and maturation of 18S rRNA, which is crucial for the formation of the 40S ribosomal subunit (Boissier2017Pwp2; Jayasena2011Live). The protein is active in the nucleolus, a sub-nuclear structure where ribosome production occurs, and is expressed in all tested tissues, indicating its fundamental role in cellular function (Lafrenière1996Isolation; Jayasena2011Live).

PWP2 contains WD repeats, which are motifs involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting its role in assembling protein complexes necessary for ribosome biogenesis (Lafrenière1996Isolation). The protein's structure includes two independent domains, with the C-terminal domain being crucial for the assembly of the UTP-B complex, a component of the SSU-processome (Boissier2017Pwp2). This complex is vital for the stable association with pre-rRNA, facilitating the maturation of ribosomal RNA and ensuring proper ribosome function, which is essential for protein synthesis and cellular growth (Boissier2017Pwp2).

## Clinical Significance
The PWP2 gene, located on chromosome 21q22.3, is implicated in several inherited disorders due to its role in regulatory pathways and ribosome biogenesis. It is considered a candidate gene for bipolar affective disorder, holoprosencephaly, autoimmune polyglandular disease type 1, and a form of nonsyndromic childhood-onset deafness (DFNB8) (Lafrenière1996Isolation). The gene's involvement in these conditions is linked to its potential role in G-protein coupled signal transduction pathways and its homology to other WD repeat-containing proteins involved in brain development (Lafrenière1996Isolation).

In vertebrates, defects in ribosome biogenesis, a process in which PWP2 is involved, can lead to diseases such as Treacher Collins syndrome and Diamond Blackfan anemia. These conditions are associated with issues in ribosomal RNA production and have a high predisposition for cancer (Jayasena2011Live). The PWP2 gene's expression pattern and its role in ribosome processing suggest that alterations in its function could contribute to nucleolar stress and p53 stabilization, potentially leading to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (Jayasena2011Live). Further studies, including the generation of haploinsufficient PWP2 transgenic knockout mice, are suggested to assess the gene's involvement in these disorders (Lafrenière1996Isolation).

## Interactions
The PWP2 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the UTP-B complex within the small subunit processome, which is involved in ribosome biogenesis. Pwp2p interacts with several proteins, including Utp12p, Utp13p, Utp18p, and Utp21p, forming a network of interactions essential for the proper assembly and function of the UTP-B complex. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pwp2p is particularly important for its interaction with the Utp12p:Utp13p heterodimer, which is necessary for the stable incorporation of the UTP-B complex into the SSU processome (Boissier2017Pwp2).

Pwp2p also forms a stable tetrameric module with Utp6, Utp18, and Utp21, which can be reconstituted independently of Utp12 and Utp13. Utp21 is necessary to recruit Pwp2p to this core complex, highlighting its role in the modular architecture of the UTP-B subcomplex (Pöll2014In). The tandem WD-repeat domain (tWD) of Pwp2p stabilizes its association with Utp21p and is necessary for forming the core UTP-B complex, which acts as a platform for the association of SSU components and pre-RNA segments (Boissier2017Pwp2).
