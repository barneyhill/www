# SIX3

## Overview
SIX3 is a gene that encodes the SIX homeobox 3 protein, a transcription factor crucial for the development of the forebrain and eyes in vertebrates. The SIX3 protein is characterized by its Six domain and a Six-type homeodomain, which facilitate its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Kawakami2000Six). As a transcription factor, SIX3 is involved in the regulation of gene expression by interacting with various proteins, including GEMININ and members of the Groucho-related family of co-repressors, to influence cell proliferation and differentiation (Turcu2019SIX3; Zhu2002Six3mediated). Mutations in the SIX3 gene are associated with holoprosencephaly, a congenital disorder affecting forebrain development, and have been implicated in tumor suppression in astrocytoma (Lacbawan2009Clinical; Yu2017SIX3). The gene's evolutionary conservation across species underscores its fundamental role in developmental processes (Kawakami2000Six).

## Structure
The SIX3 protein is characterized by the presence of a Six domain (SD) and a Six-type homeodomain (HD), which are essential for its function as a transcription factor (Kawakami2000Six). The homeodomain is a DNA-binding motif that is crucial for the protein's role in eye and forebrain development. Notably, the HD of SIX3 lacks two conserved amino acids typical of most homeodomains, which may affect its DNA binding specificity (Kawakami2000Six). The molecular structure of SIX3 is highly conserved between species, with the HD being perfectly conserved between mouse Six3 and human SIX3 (Kawakami2000Six).

SIX3 interacts with other proteins through its C-terminal region, which is crucial for binding to GEMININ, a cell cycle regulator. This interaction involves a disordered to ordered transition, indicating an induced folding mechanism (Turcu2019SIX3). The C-terminal region is also involved in protein-protein interactions with members of the Groucho-related family of co-repressors, such as Grg5, through an eh1-like motif within the Six domain (Zhu2002Six3mediated).

Mutations in the SIX3 gene, particularly in the homeodomain, are associated with developmental disorders such as holoprosencephaly (HPE) (Kawakami2000Six). These mutations can affect residues unique to the Six3/6 subfamily or those conserved across all Six proteins (Kawakami2000Six).

## Function
The SIX3 gene encodes a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the forebrain and eyes in vertebrates. In healthy human cells, SIX3 is involved in regulating gene expression by binding to regulatory DNA sequences and interacting with other proteins, such as GEMININ. This interaction promotes cell proliferation, which is essential for maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation (Turcu2019SIX3). The C-terminal regions of SIX3 are necessary for its interaction with GEMININ, which competes with CDT1 for binding, influencing gene expression and cell fate determination (Turcu2019SIX3).

SIX3 also plays a significant role in repressing Wnt1 expression in the anterior neuroectoderm, which is essential for the formation of anterior neural structures like the rostral forebrain. This repression helps maintain anterior neural fates and establish the anterior signaling center, contributing to forebrain maturation (Lagutin2003Six3). In the context of pancreatic β-cells, SIX3 acts as a transcriptional repressor, maintaining β-cell identity and function by suppressing the expression of non-β-cell genes (Bevacqua2020SIX2). These molecular activities underscore the importance of SIX3 in normal cellular function and development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SIX3 gene are significantly associated with holoprosencephaly (HPE), a severe congenital disorder characterized by the incomplete separation of the forebrain. SIX3 mutations are linked to more severe forms of non-chromosomal, non-syndromic HPE, with a mutation rate of 4.7% in a study of 800 HPE patients (Lacbawan2009Clinical). The clinical spectrum of HPE due to SIX3 mutations includes a range of brain and facial anomalies, such as microcephaly, cleft lip/palate, and hypotelorism (Paulussen2010The). The severity of HPE correlates with the degree of loss of function caused by the mutations, as demonstrated in zebrafish models (Lacbawan2009Clinical).

SIX3 mutations exhibit incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, suggesting that additional genetic or environmental factors may influence the phenotype (Lacbawan2009Clinical). The inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant, with a higher prevalence in females, indicating a potential protective effect (Lacbawan2009Clinical). About 14% of SIX3 mutations occur de novo (Lacbawan2009Clinical).

In addition to its role in HPE, SIX3 acts as a tumor suppressor in astrocytoma by repressing aurora kinase A and B, which are key regulators of mitosis. Altered expression of SIX3 in astrocytoma is associated with increased tumor proliferation and invasion (Yu2017SIX3).

## Interactions
SIX3 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation during development. One of its primary interactions is with the Groucho-related family of co-repressors, specifically Grg proteins such as Grg4 and Grg5. These interactions are mediated by the eh1-like motif within the Six domain of SIX3, which binds to the Q domain of Grg proteins. This interaction is essential for SIX3's function as a transcriptional repressor, particularly in eye development and autorepression of its own promoter (Zhu2002Six3mediated).

SIX3 also interacts with GEMININ, a cell cycle regulator, through its C-terminal regions. This interaction is distinct from its interaction with Grg proteins and involves the N- and C-terminal regions of GEMININ, rather than the coiled-coil domain. The binding affinity between SIX3 and GEMININ is characterized by a low micromolar affinity, indicating a specific and unique interaction mechanism (Turcu2019SIX3).

These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of SIX3 in regulating gene expression and developmental processes, particularly in the eye and forebrain, by forming complexes with different co-repressors and regulatory proteins.
