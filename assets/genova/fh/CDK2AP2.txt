# CDK2AP2

## Overview
CDK2AP2, or cyclin dependent kinase 2 associated protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of key cellular processes, particularly in stem cell biology and differentiation. The protein encoded by CDK2AP2 is a regulatory protein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells by modulating the expression of critical pluripotency factors such as Nanog. It is also involved in cell survival during differentiation and interacts with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), indicating its participation in complex signaling pathways. The protein's activity is primarily nuclear, where it influences transcriptional activities and cellular responses to DNA damage, thereby affecting cell proliferation and differentiation. CDK2AP2's expression is ubiquitous in adult tissues and conserved across species, highlighting its fundamental role in cellular homeostasis and development (Deshpande2012Cdk2ap2Is).

## Function
CDK2AP2 (cyclin dependent kinase 2 associated protein 2) is a crucial regulator of cellular processes in healthy human cells, particularly in the context of stem cell biology. It plays a significant role in maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells by regulating the expression of key pluripotency factors such as Nanog. Disruption of CDK2AP2 leads to spontaneous differentiation and a loss of self-renewal capacity, highlighting its importance in preventing premature differentiation and maintaining balanced lineage commitment during differentiation (Deshpande2012Cdk2ap2Is).

CDK2AP2 is involved in cell survival during differentiation into terminally differentiated cell types, and its expression is downregulated during normal stem cell differentiation, following a biphasic pattern. This suggests that CDK2AP2 facilitates the exit from self-renewal and ensures survival during terminal differentiation (Deshpande2012Cdk2ap2Is). The protein interacts with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and is involved in meiosis, as evidenced by its role in mouse oocytes (Deshpande2012Cdk2ap2Is).

CDK2AP2 is active in the nucleus, where it modulates transcriptional activities and cellular responses to DNA damage, influencing cell proliferation and differentiation. Its ubiquitous expression in adult tissues and conserved function across species underscore its importance in cellular processes (Deshpande2012Cdk2ap2Is).

## Clinical Significance
CDK2AP2 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in cell cycle regulation and differentiation. Alterations in the expression of CDK2AP2 can lead to significant effects on cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer. In murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs), disruption of CDK2AP2 expression results in spontaneous differentiation and increased apoptosis, indicating its critical role in maintaining pluripotency and survival during differentiation (Deshpande2012Cdk2ap2Is). The gene's dysregulation is associated with downregulation of the pluripotency factor Nanog, which is crucial for maintaining the self-renewal capacity of stem cells (Deshpande2012Cdk2ap2Is).

In the context of cancer, CDK2AP2 has been identified as having alterations in a small percentage of prostate cancer samples, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (BenSalem2021Genomic). Although specific diseases directly linked to CDK2AP2 mutations are not detailed, its involvement in cell cycle regulation and differentiation suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The gene's interaction with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways further underscores its potential impact on cellular proliferation and differentiation processes (Deshpande2012Cdk2ap2Is).

## Interactions
CDK2AP2 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It has been identified as an interacting partner of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and is a target for phosphorylation by MAPK and Cyclin B/Cdc2 during meiosis in mouse oocytes (Deshpande2012Cdk2ap2Is). This interaction suggests a role in regulating meiosis and oocyte maturation. CDK2AP2 also interacts with CDK2AP1, as demonstrated in a yeast-two hybrid study, indicating a potential collaborative function in cellular processes (Deshpande2012Cdk2ap2Is).

In the context of murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs), CDK2AP2 is involved in maintaining self-renewal and differentiation. The absence of CDK2AP2 leads to downregulation of the pluripotency factor Nanog, which is crucial for maintaining stem cell pluripotency (Deshpande2012Cdk2ap2Is). This suggests that CDK2AP2 may interact with regulatory pathways influencing Nanog expression and embryonic lineage commitment. Although specific interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins in these pathways are not detailed, CDK2AP2's role in these processes implies its participation in complex regulatory networks (Deshpande2012Cdk2ap2Is).
