# ARL6IP4

## Overview
The ARL6IP4 gene encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 6 interacting protein 4, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a GTPase-interacting protein, playing a crucial role in the regulation of intracellular trafficking and signal transduction pathways. ARL6IP4 is implicated in the modulation of membrane dynamics and has been associated with the regulation of the cytoskeleton and cellular morphology. The protein's interactions and functions are significant in understanding its role in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
