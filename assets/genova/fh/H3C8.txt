# H3C8

## Overview
H3C8 is a gene that encodes the H3 clustered histone 8 protein, a member of the histone H3 family, which is integral to the structural organization of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. Histone proteins, such as those produced by H3C8, are pivotal in the formation of nucleosomes, thereby facilitating essential cellular processes including DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation. The H3 clustered histone 8 protein is categorized as a histone, a type of protein that plays a key role in epigenetic regulation by influencing gene expression and cellular differentiation. The evolutionary conservation and intolerance to mutations of H3C8 underscore its importance in maintaining genetic stability (Liu2024Analysis). The gene's expression is modulated in response to environmental stressors, such as ionizing radiation and microgravity, implicating it in DNA integrity and cell cycle regulation (Malatesta2024Differential). These attributes highlight the gene's critical role in cellular homeostasis and its potential involvement in various clinical conditions.

## Structure


## Function
H3C8 is a gene that encodes a histone protein, part of the histone H3 family, which plays a crucial role in the structural organization of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. Histone proteins, including those encoded by H3C8, are essential for packaging DNA into nucleosomes, which facilitates DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation. This gene is involved in epigenetic regulation, influencing gene expression and cellular differentiation. In healthy human cells, H3C8 is implicated in maintaining genetic stability, as suggested by its evolutionary conservation and intolerance to mutations, indicated by PhyloP scores greater than 0.4 and RVIS percentiles below 25% (Liu2024Analysis). The down-regulation of H3C8 in response to ionizing radiation and simulated microgravity conditions suggests its involvement in processes related to DNA integrity and cell cycle regulation (Malatesta2024Differential). The suppression of H3C8 expression under these stress conditions may affect the cell cycle, particularly the G2/M phase transition, and could influence apoptosis and DNA damage repair pathways (Malatesta2024Differential). These functions highlight the gene's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stressors.

## Clinical Significance
The H3C8 gene, encoding a histone protein, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in chromatin structure and gene regulation. Alterations in the expression of H3C8 have been associated with gliomas, particularly glioblastomas, where its expression is reactivated in more aggressive forms of the disease. This reactivation correlates with the abundance of H3.1/H3.2 proteins, suggesting a link between H3C8 expression levels and glioma aggressiveness (HervásCorpión2021Potential).

In the context of spontaneous abortion, H3C8 has been identified as a candidate gene within copy number variants (CNVs) of uncertain significance. These CNVs, characterized by high PhyloP scores and low Residual Variance Intolerance Score (RVIS) percentiles, indicate that H3C8 is conserved and intolerant to mutations, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenicity of spontaneous abortion (Liu2024Analysis).

In breast cancer, specifically lobular carcinoma, the H3C8 gene, also referred to as HIST1H3D, has been reported to be downregulated. This downregulation contrasts with the overexpression of several DNA repair genes in breast cancer, highlighting the complex role of H3C8 in cancer progression and its potential impact on treatment resistance (Mohamed2021The).
