# ZNF814

## Overview
ZNF814 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 814, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which are small protein structural motifs that can bind to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. Zinc finger protein 814 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, by interacting with specific DNA sequences to modulate gene expression. The precise biological functions and pathways involving ZNF814 remain to be fully elucidated, but its role in gene regulation suggests it may have significant implications in cellular differentiation and development (Qiu2020aarFDC).
