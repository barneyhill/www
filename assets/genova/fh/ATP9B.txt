# ATP9B

## Overview
ATP9B is a gene that encodes the protein ATPase phospholipid transporting 9B (putative), which is a member of the P4-ATPase family. These proteins are integral membrane enzymes that play a critical role in the translocation of phospholipids across cellular membranes, thereby maintaining membrane asymmetry essential for various cellular functions such as vesicle trafficking and membrane biogenesis (LopezMarques2013P4ATPases:; Paulusma2005The). ATP9B is predominantly localized in the Golgi apparatus and endosomal membranes, where it contributes to the regulation of vesicle formation and trafficking (Folmer2009P4). Unlike other P4-ATPases, ATP9B can exit the endoplasmic reticulum independently of Cdc50 proteins, suggesting a unique functional mechanism (LopezMarques2013P4ATPases:). The protein is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues, with particularly high expression in the testis, indicating its potential significance in reproductive biology and other physiological processes (Folmer2009P4).

## Structure


## Function
ATP9B is a member of the P4-ATPase family, which are enzymes involved in the translocation of phospholipids across cellular membranes. These proteins play a crucial role in maintaining the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids, which is essential for various cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking, membrane biogenesis, and lipid homeostasis (LopezMarques2013P4ATPases:; Paulusma2005The). ATP9B is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus and endosomal membranes, where it contributes to the maintenance of membrane asymmetry and the regulation of vesicle formation and trafficking (Folmer2009P4).

While the specific biochemical activity of ATP9B remains to be fully elucidated, it is suggested that ATP9B may have a role distinct from other P4-ATPases, as it can exit the endoplasmic reticulum independently of Cdc50 proteins, which are typically required for the functional maturation of P4-ATPases (LopezMarques2013P4ATPases:). This indicates a potential unique function or mechanism of action for ATP9B in cellular processes. ATP9B is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with particularly high levels in the testis, suggesting its importance in reproductive biology and possibly other physiological processes (Folmer2009P4).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the ATP9B gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In ulcerative colitis (UC), the circular RNA derived from ATP9B, known as circAtp9b, is upregulated and correlates with increased PTEN expression. This upregulation promotes apoptosis in colonic epithelial cells, suggesting a role in UC pathogenesis (Li2021Overexpression). In osteoarthritis, circRNA_Atp9b acts as a competing endogenous RNA, regulating miR-138-5p and influencing extracellular matrix synthesis and inflammation. Its upregulation in chondrocytes is associated with inflammatory responses, indicating its involvement in disease progression (Zhou2018Circular).

In the context of major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicide, differential exon usage of ATP9B has been observed, suggesting potential alterations in splicing. Although the specific relationship to suicide remains unclear, these findings indicate a possible link to MDD (Pantazatos2016Wholetranscriptome). Despite these associations, the precise mechanisms by which ATP9B contributes to these conditions require further investigation to fully understand its clinical significance.

## Interactions
ATP9B, a member of the P4-ATPase family, is involved in phospholipid translocation across cellular membranes. Unlike most P4-ATPases, ATP9B does not require interaction with CDC50 proteins for its transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to other cellular locations. This is evidenced by the fact that ATP9B can exit the ER independently of CDC50A, as confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments that showed no interaction between ATP9B and endogenous CDC50A proteins (Tone2019ATPase).

Mutations in ATP9B, particularly in the aspartate residue of the DKTGT sequence motif, prevent its exit from the ER, indicating that the ATPase reaction cycle is crucial for its transport. However, mutations in the glutamate residue of the DGET motif, which affect dephosphorylation, do not prevent ATP9B from exiting the ER, suggesting that the phosphorylation state is linked to its transport (Tone2019ATPase).

The localization of ATP9B to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is independent of CDC50A, and certain mutants of ATP9B, such as the GL mutant, show different localization patterns, with a significant portion localizing to the TGN (Tone2019ATPase). There are no specific mentions of ATP9B interacting with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond these observations.
