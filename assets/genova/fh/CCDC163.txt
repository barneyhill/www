# CCDC163

## Overview
The CCDC163 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain-containing protein 163 homolog, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. Although the specific functions of CCDC163 homolog are not fully elucidated, proteins with coiled-coil domains are often implicated in the organization of the cytoskeleton, intracellular transport, and signal transduction pathways. The CCDC163 gene and its protein product are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their roles in cellular physiology and potential implications in human health and disease.
