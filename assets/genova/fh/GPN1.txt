# GPN1

## Overview
GPN1 is a gene that encodes the GPN-loop GTPase 1 protein, a member of the GTPase enzyme family. This protein is integral to the nuclear import and assembly of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), a critical enzyme for mRNA and noncoding RNA transcription in human cells. GPN1 is characterized by its GTPase domain and a unique C-terminal extension, which is essential for its dimeric stability and function. The protein forms homodimers and heterodimers, particularly with GPN3, facilitating the nucleocytoplasmic transport of RNAPII. GPN1's GTPase activity is crucial for its role in RNAPII assembly and import, impacting cellular growth and gene expression regulation. Beyond its fundamental cellular functions, GPN1 has clinical significance as a prognostic biomarker in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, and is implicated in metabolic conditions related to alcohol consumption and lipid metabolism (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based; Wang2022Bioinformatic; Carré2011Human).

## Structure
The human GPN1 protein is characterized by a GTPase domain and a C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids, which is absent in its archaeal counterparts. This C-terminal tail is crucial for the stability of the protein's dimeric form, although the GTPase domain alone is sufficient for dimer formation (GonzálezGonzález2017Human). The secondary structure of GPN1 is rich in alpha helices, as indicated by circular dichroism analysis, and it has a low percentage of beta sheets, consistent with a globular protein structure (GonzálezGonzález2017Human).

GPN1 forms a stable homodimer, as confirmed by size exclusion chromatography, native gels, and dynamic light scattering experiments (GonzálezGonzález2017Human). The dimeric structure is stabilized by interactions between the C-terminal extension and the GTPase domain (GonzálezGonzález2017Human). The protein can bind guanine nucleotides and hydrolyze GTP, with specific binding affinities for GDP and a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue (GonzálezGonzález2017Human).

The GPN1 protein also contains a conserved GPN motif, which is crucial for its GTPase activity and is located between the G2 and G3 motifs of the canonical G domain (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based). The protein's ability to form homodimers or heterodimers with other GPN proteins is independent of GTP binding (Korf2023Archaeal).

## Function
GPN1, a member of the GPN-loop GTPase family, plays a critical role in the nuclear import and assembly of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in human cells. This protein is essential for the proper localization and function of RNAPII, which is crucial for the transcription of mRNA and several noncoding RNAs (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based; Carré2011Human). GPN1 forms a heterodimer with GPN3, and this interaction is necessary for their mutual stability and function in RNAPII nuclear import (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based). The GTP-binding domain of GPN1 is vital for its role in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of RNAPII, as mutations in this domain disrupt the process (Carré2011Human).

GPN1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it associates with RNAPII subunits, including RPB1, RPB4, and RPB7, facilitating their assembly into the mature RNAPII complex (Niesser2016Structure; Carré2011Human). The protein's GTPase activity is crucial for its function, as it regulates the energy-dependent processes required for RNAPII assembly and import (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based). GPN1's role in RNAPII biogenesis is essential for maintaining cellular growth and gene expression regulation (Minaker2013Biogenesis).

## Clinical Significance
GPN1 (GPN-loop GTPase 1) has been identified as a significant prognostic and immunological biomarker in various cancers, particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Overexpression of GPN1 in LUAD is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including unfavorable overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free intervals. It is linked to advanced disease stages, lymph node metastasis, and a history of heavy smoking, making it an independent prognostic factor, especially in early-stage LUAD, females, older patients, and smokers (Wang2022Bioinformatic).

GPN1 expression is also correlated with tumor heterogeneity, affecting prognosis and treatment resistance. It shows associations with microsatellite instability, homologous recombination deficiency, and immune cell infiltration, indicating its role in modulating the tumor microenvironment and contributing to an immunosuppressive environment. This modulation is linked to increased levels of immunosuppressive cells and molecules, which can lead to poor outcomes in immunotherapy (Wang2022Bioinformatic).

In addition to its role in cancer, GPN1 is implicated in alcohol consumption and lipid metabolism, potentially influencing liver health. It may regulate pathways involved in alcohol-induced liver damage and lipid metabolism, suggesting a broader impact on metabolic conditions (Pazoki2023Evidence; O’Farrell2023Evidence).

## Interactions
GPN1, a GTPase, is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions, particularly with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) subunits. It forms stable associations with RNAPII, interacting directly with subunits RPB7, RPB4, and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RPB1. These interactions are essential for the nuclear import of RNAPII, as depletion of GPN1 results in the accumulation of RNAPII in the cytoplasm (Carré2011Human).

GPN1 also interacts with GPN3, another GTPase, forming a heterodimer that is crucial for the nuclear localization of RNAPII. This interaction is characterized by a large interface surface, and specific mutations in GPN1 can disrupt this interaction, affecting RNAPII nuclear targeting (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based). The GPN1-GPN3 heterodimer can exist in both GDP-bound (closed) and GTP-bound (open) conformations, with the closed conformation being more stable due to more extensive interactions (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based).

GPN1 is also associated with importin/exportin components, suggesting a role in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of RNAPII (Carré2011Human). These interactions highlight GPN1's role in the assembly and nuclear import of RNAPII, as well as its potential involvement in broader cellular transport mechanisms.
