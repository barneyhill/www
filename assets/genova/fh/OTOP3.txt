# OTOP3

## Overview
OTOP3 is a gene that encodes the protein otopetrin 3, which is a member of the otopetrin family of proteins. Otopetrin 3 is characterized as a transmembrane protein with 12 transmembrane domains, playing a crucial role in proton conduction across cellular membranes (Hughes2008Identification). The protein's structure is notable for its dimeric fold, stabilized by cholesterol-like molecules, which is essential for its function as a proton channel (Tsui2020Molecular). The gene and its encoded protein are evolutionarily conserved, with three key Otopetrin Domains that are critical for their biological activity (Hughes2008Identification). While the specific physiological roles of OTOP3 are still under investigation, its structural and functional characteristics suggest it may be involved in various cellular processes related to ion transport (Gan2024Structural).

## Structure
OTOP3, a member of the otopetrin protein family, is characterized by a structure that includes 12 transmembrane domains, with both the N- and C-termini located in the cytosol (Hughes2008Identification). The protein is divided into two structurally related halves, forming a unique dimeric fold (Tsui2020Molecular). This dimeric structure is stabilized by cholesterol-like molecules that occlude the central tunnel between subunits, preventing water and solute passage (Tsui2020Molecular).

The OTOP3 protein contains three highly conserved subdomains, known as Otopetrin Domains (OD-I, OD-II, and OD-III), which are crucial for its function (Hughes2008Identification). These domains are evolutionarily constrained and are integral to the protein's role in proton conduction (Hughes2008Identification). The tertiary structure likely involves a double-barrel architecture, similar to other OTOP family members, although specific details for OTOP3 are not fully elucidated (Gan2024Structural).

The protein's quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is essential for its function as a proton channel (Tsui2020Molecular). While specific post-translational modifications and splice variants of OTOP3 are not detailed, the structural conservation across the OTOP family suggests potential similarities in these aspects (Hughes2008Identification).
