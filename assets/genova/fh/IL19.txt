# IL19

## Overview
Interleukin 19 (IL-19) is a cytokine encoded by the IL19 gene, which is part of the IL-10 cytokine family. This protein is primarily involved in modulating immune responses and plays a crucial role in the resolution of inflammation. IL-19 is characterized by its unique structural features, including a seven-helix bundle and specific disulfide bridges, which distinguish it from other cytokines in its family (Zdanov2004Structural; Gallagher2000Cloning). Functionally, IL-19 acts as an anti-inflammatory cytokine, promoting a shift from a pro-inflammatory Th1/M1 phenotype to an anti-inflammatory Th2/M2 phenotype, thereby aiding in immune homeostasis (Leigh2020Resolution). It interacts with a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of IL-20R1 and IL-20R2, activating the STAT1 and STAT3 signaling pathways (Akdis2011Interleukins). Clinically, alterations in IL19 expression are associated with various inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Klonowska2022Combination; Witte2014IL19).

## Structure
Interleukin 19 (IL-19) is a cytokine that belongs to the IL-10 family and is characterized by a unique molecular structure. The primary structure of IL-19 consists of 177 amino acids, with a signal peptide at the N-terminus and conserved cysteine residues essential for proper folding (Gallagher2000Cloning). The secondary structure of IL-19 includes a seven-helix bundle composed of helices A-G, which is a distinctive feature among helical cytokines (Zdanov2004Structural; Wei2019Interleukin10). This bundle forms a compact hydrophobic core, stabilized by three disulfide bridges: Cys10-Cys103, Cys57-Cys109, and Cys58-Cys111 (Zdanov2004Structural; Wei2019Interleukin10).

The tertiary structure of IL-19 is further defined by a short β-sheet formed by the C-terminal strand and a short interhelical strand, which is unusual for helical cytokines (Zdanov2010Structural). IL-19 is a monomer in solution and does not form the intertwined dimers seen in some other IL-10 family members (Trivella2010Structure). Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at Asn38, which is one of the two predicted glycosylation sites (Trivella2010Structure; Pletnev2003Characterization). IL-19 does not signal through the canonical IL-10 receptor complex due to differences in receptor interaction regions (Gallagher2000Cloning).

## Function
Interleukin 19 (IL-19) is a cytokine that plays a significant role in modulating immune responses, particularly in the resolution of inflammation. It is primarily expressed in monocytes and can be upregulated in B and T lymphocytes by stimuli such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (Leigh2020Resolution). IL-19 functions as an anti-inflammatory cytokine, acting as a negative compensatory mechanism to dampen inflammatory stimuli and promote the resolution of inflammation (Leigh2020Resolution). It signals through receptor complexes involving IL-20Rα and IL-20Rβ chains, activating the JAK/STAT pathway, particularly STAT3, which is crucial for its anti-inflammatory effects (Leigh2020Resolution).

IL-19 is involved in shifting immune responses from a Th1/M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype to a Th2/M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype, which is associated with increased IL-4 and decreased IFNγ in regulatory T cells, as well as the induction of IL-10 secretion (Leigh2020Resolution). In non-immune cells, IL-19 reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis and adhesion molecule expression, aiding in tissue repair and reducing leukocyte infiltration (Leigh2020Resolution). These functions highlight IL-19's role in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential therapeutic applications in inflammatory diseases.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IL19 gene have been implicated in several inflammatory diseases. In psoriasis, IL-19 is part of the IL-23/IL-17 cascade, where it synergizes with IL-17A to enhance the expression of antibacterial proteins and chemokines in keratinocytes, contributing to local inflammation and immune cell infiltration in psoriatic lesions (Witte2014IL19). IL-19 expression is significantly higher in psoriatic skin compared to healthy skin, and its levels are reduced following treatment with anti-IL-17 biologics, suggesting its role in keratinocyte proliferation and psoriasis pathogenesis (Xu2021Interleukin17A).

In atopic dermatitis (AD), IL-19 levels are elevated in patients and correlate with disease severity. IL-19 is strongly expressed in AD lesional skin, particularly under the influence of IL-17A and IL-4, indicating its role in bridging Th17 to Th2 responses in AD (Klonowska2022Combination). IL-19 levels also serve as a biomarker for disease activity and treatment response in both psoriasis and AD, with reductions in IL-19 levels associated with clinical improvements (Konrad2019Assessment).

IL-19 is also involved in asthma, where its expression is induced by IL-13 and IL-17A, potentially exacerbating the condition by driving Th2 cytokine production (Huang2008Potentiation).

## Interactions
Interleukin 19 (IL-19) is a cytokine that primarily interacts with a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of IL-20R1 and IL-20R2 subunits. This interaction leads to the activation of the STAT1 and STAT3 signaling pathways, which are crucial for mediating the biological effects of IL-19 (Akdis2011Interleukins). IL-19 does not interact with the IL-10 receptor complex, despite being a homologue of IL-10, due to differences in key amino acids necessary for binding to the IL-10 receptor (Gallagher2000Cloning).

IL-19 is secreted as a glycosylated protein and functions as a monomer. It is expressed in monocytes following stimulation with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and is regulated by cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13, which enhance its expression in LPS-stimulated monocytes (Gallagher2000Cloning). IL-19 can also be induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Gallagher2000Cloning).

In the context of inflammation, IL-19 has been shown to induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α in monocytes, indicating its role in inflammatory responses (Akdis2011Interleukins). It also promotes the expression of Th2 cytokines, including IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13, by activated T cells, suggesting its involvement in Th2-cell responses (Akdis2011Interleukins).
