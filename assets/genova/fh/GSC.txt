# GSC

## Overview
The GSC (goosecoid homeobox) gene is a critical component in the regulation of embryonic development, encoding a transcription factor that is pivotal for cell fate determination and patterning during early stages such as gastrulation. The protein product, Goosecoid, is a homeobox transcription factor that functions primarily as a transcriptional activator and repressor, influencing the differentiation of mesodermal and neural crest cell lineages. This protein is integral to the development of craniofacial and skeletal structures, acting through interactions with other proteins and regulatory pathways. Goosecoid's activity is modulated by posttranslational modifications, such as mono-ubiquitination, which are essential for its role in transcriptional regulation. The gene's expression and function are crucial for proper mesodermal patterning and the formation of structures like the anterior streak and definitive endoderm, underscoring its importance in developmental biology (Liu2019USP21; Kalisz2012EVENSKIPPED; Izzi2008Sumoylation).

## Structure


## Function
The GSC (goosecoid homeobox) gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in early embryonic development, particularly in the regulation of genes necessary for cell fate determination and patterning during gastrulation. GSC is involved in the differentiation of mesodermal and neural crest cell lineages, influencing the development of craniofacial and skeletal structures. It functions as a transcriptional activator of the cartilage regulatory protein SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box (SOX)6, and its activity is regulated by mono-ubiquitination, which is necessary for its transcriptional activation (Liu2019USP21).

GSC is expressed in the primitive streak during early embryogenesis and is crucial for mesodermal patterning and the formation of the anterior streak and definitive endoderm in human embryonic stem cells (Kalisz2012EVENSKIPPED). It acts as a transcriptional repressor by binding to paired TAAT homeodomain sites or through recruitment by the forkhead/winged helix transcription factor Foxh1, playing a role in dorso-ventral patterning of mesodermal tissues (Izzi2008Sumoylation).

In mammals, GSC is a downstream effector in regulatory networks that define neural-crest cell-fate specification and mesoderm cell lineages, particularly during shoulder and hip formation (Parry2013SAMS). Its expression is crucial for the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoprogenitor cells and subsequently into osteoblasts, which are vital for bone formation (Parry2013SAMS).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GSC (goosecoid homeobox) gene have been implicated in several developmental disorders and conditions. Chronic ethanol exposure has been shown to up-regulate GSC expression, which may contribute to the etiology of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a severe form of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). This condition is characterized by developmental malformations, including craniofacial defects, due to excessive alcohol consumption during pregnancy (Halder2013Chronic). The up-regulation of GSC in response to ethanol is linked to the Nodal signaling pathway, which is crucial for early embryo patterning and axial mesendoderm formation (Halder2013Chronic).

In addition to its role in FASD, the GSC gene has been investigated in the context of cerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome (CCMS), a rare congenital condition characterized by severe micrognathia and rib-gap defects. Although GSC was considered a candidate gene due to its role in bone formation, no mutations were found in a study of a CCMS patient, suggesting that other genetic factors may be involved (Su2010Exclusion). These findings highlight the complex role of GSC in embryonic development and its potential involvement in various developmental disorders.

## Interactions
The Goosecoid (GSC) homeobox gene encodes a transcription factor that participates in various protein interactions crucial for its role in embryonic development. GSC interacts with the Groucho (Gro) corepressor through a conserved eh1/GEH motif, which is essential for mediating transcriptional repression in Drosophila embryos. This interaction is necessary for GSC's ability to repress target genes, such as the Sxl gene, in a Gro-dependent manner (Jiménez1999A).

In zebrafish, GSC physically associates with the vega2 homeobox protein, suggesting a molecular interaction that influences the regulation of organizer genes during development. This interaction is demonstrated through in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that vega2 acts as a negative regulator of GSC, impacting organizer formation and function (Kawahara2000Functional).

Additionally, GSC is subject to posttranslational modifications, such as mono-ubiquitination, which affects its function. The ubiquitin-specific protease USP21 interacts with GSC, promoting its deubiquitination and modulating its activity without altering protein stability. This interaction suggests a non-proteolytic mechanism where USP21 influences GSC's role in craniofacial development and cellular processes (Liu2019USP21).
