# DPM3

## Overview
The DPM3 gene encodes the dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase subunit 3, a regulatory protein that is a critical component of the dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) synthase complex. This protein is integral to the glycosylation pathways within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it functions primarily to anchor the catalytic subunit DPM1 to the ER membrane, thereby facilitating the synthesis of Dol-P-Man. Dol-P-Man is essential for various glycosylation processes, including N-glycosylation, O-mannosylation, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis (Lefeber2009Deficiency). The DPM3 protein contains a coiled-coil domain that is crucial for its interaction with DPM1, and mutations in this domain can lead to significant disruptions in glycosylation, resulting in congenital disorders such as muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy (Lefeber2009Deficiency; Svahn2019Dilated). As a regulatory subunit, DPM3 plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the Dol-P-Man synthase complex, highlighting its importance in cellular glycosylation processes (Freeze2014Solving).

## Structure
The DPM3 protein is a component of the dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) synthase complex, which plays a crucial role in glycosylation pathways. DPM3 contains a coiled-coil domain that is essential for anchoring the catalytic subunit DPM1 to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Lefeber2009Deficiency). This domain is involved in the protein's secondary structure, where hydrophobic interactions are important for maintaining the quaternary structure, specifically the binding between DPM3 and DPM1 (Lefeber2009Deficiency).

A pathogenic missense mutation, p.Leu85Ser, in the coiled-coil domain of DPM3 affects its ability to bind DPM1, leading to reduced Dol-P-Man synthase activity and impacting glycosylation processes such as O-mannosylation (Lefeber2009Deficiency). This mutation highlights the importance of the coiled-coil domain in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the DPM3 protein (Lefeber2009Deficiency).

The DPM3 protein is also stabilized by DPM2, another subunit of the Dol-P-Man synthase complex, which further supports its role in anchoring the complex to the ER membrane (Svahn2019Dilated). The specific details of the primary, tertiary, or other structural aspects of DPM3 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The DPM3 gene encodes a subunit of the dolichol-phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man) synthase complex, which is essential for glycosylation processes in human cells. This complex is responsible for the synthesis of Dol-P-Man, a crucial donor of mannose in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that supports several glycosylation pathways, including N-glycosylation, O-mannosylation, C-mannosylation, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis (Lefeber2009Deficiency). DPM3 plays a critical role in anchoring the catalytic subunit DPM1 to the ER membrane, facilitating the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to dolichol phosphate, which is vital for the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids (Lefeber2009Deficiency).

The coiled-coil domain of DPM3 is important for binding to DPM1, and mutations in DPM3 can affect this interaction, leading to reduced stability and activity of the enzyme complex. This can result in impaired glycosylation, as seen in reduced O-mannosylation in patient muscle biopsies (Lefeber2009Deficiency). DPM3 is particularly involved in O-mannosylation, which is crucial for the proper glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, a protein important for muscle function (Lefeber2009Deficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DPM3 gene are associated with a range of neuromuscular disorders, primarily characterized by defects in glycosylation processes. Notably, DPM3 mutations can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG type Io, and alpha-dystroglycanopathies, which include conditions such as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) and dilated cardiomyopathy (Johnson2018Detection; Svahn2019Dilated). Patients with DPM3 mutations often present with muscle weakness, elevated serum creatine kinase levels, and abnormal glycosylation profiles, particularly affecting N-glycosylation and O-mannosylation pathways (Svahn2019Dilated).

The clinical manifestations of DPM3 mutations can vary significantly. For instance, some patients exhibit mild limb-girdle muscular dystrophy without cardiomyopathy, while others may develop more severe symptoms, including dilated cardiomyopathy and stroke-like episodes (Johnson2018Detection). Despite the variability, these mutations generally do not lead to the multi-systemic manifestations typically seen in other congenital disorders of glycosylation, such as epilepsy or liver disease (Svahn2019Dilated).

The rarity of DPM3 mutations and their diverse phenotypic expressions underscore the importance of genetic testing and clinical documentation to better understand and diagnose these conditions (Svahn2019Dilated).

## Interactions
DPM3 is a subunit of the dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase (DPM) complex, which plays a crucial role in glycosylation pathways. It physically interacts with DPM1, the catalytic subunit of the DPM complex, through its coiled-coil domain. This interaction is essential for the stability and activity of DPM1, as DPM3 serves as an anchoring subunit that tethers DPM1 to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Lefeber2009Deficiency). Mutations in DPM3, such as the p.L85S mutation, can disrupt this interaction, leading to reduced stability and activity of DPM1, which in turn affects the function of the Dol-P-Man synthase complex (Lefeber2009Deficiency).

DPM3 also interacts with DPM2, the stabilizing subunit of the DPM complex, which is necessary for the proper functioning of the complex in glycosylation pathways (Freeze2014Solving). The interaction between DPM3 and DPM1 is particularly critical for O-mannosylation, a glycosylation process that, when impaired, can lead to muscular dystrophy and other congenital disorders of glycosylation (Lefeber2009Deficiency). These interactions highlight the regulatory role of DPM3 in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the DPM complex.
