# OPN3

## Overview
Opsin 3 (OPN3) is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) known as opsin 3, which is involved in various physiological processes across different cell types. As a member of the opsin family, opsin 3 is structurally similar to light-sensitive receptors but primarily functions in a light-independent manner in certain contexts, such as in human epidermal melanocytes where it regulates melanogenesis by modulating melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) signaling (Olinski2020Illuminating; Ozdeslik2019Human). In addition to its role in pigmentation, opsin 3 is implicated in cellular responses to ultraviolet A (UVA) exposure in dermal fibroblasts, contributing to photoaging through calcium-dependent pathways (Lan2019Opsin). The gene's expression and mutations have clinical significance, particularly in conditions like non-syndromic oligodontia and pigmentation disorders (Inagaki2021Identification; Ozdeslik2019Human).

## Structure


## Function
Opsin 3 (OPN3) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in human cells. In epidermal melanocytes, OPN3 acts as a negative regulator of melanogenesis by modulating the signaling of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). It achieves this by activating the Gαi subunit of G proteins, which decreases the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response, ultimately reducing melanin production (Ozdeslik2019Human). Despite its structural features suggesting potential light sensitivity, OPN3 does not mediate light-induced signaling in melanocytes, indicating a primarily light-independent function in these cells (Olinski2020Illuminating).

In human dermal fibroblasts, OPN3 is involved in the response to ultraviolet A (UVA) exposure, where it mediates calcium-dependent phototransduction, leading to increased calcium flux and the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This process contributes to photoaging by degrading extracellular matrix components (Lan2019Opsin).

OPN3 is also crucial for cell survival in melanocytes, as its downregulation leads to apoptosis through a mitochondrial pathway. This involves a decrease in intracellular calcium levels and changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability, triggering the activation of apoptotic pathways (Wang2020Opsin3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the OPN3 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In a Japanese population, specific missense mutations in OPN3, such as c.668 C > T (p.Gly223Asp) and c.768 C > T (p.Met256Ile), have been associated with non-syndromic oligodontia, a severe form of tooth agenesis. These mutations are predicted to be pathogenic and were not found in public genetic databases, suggesting their novelty and potential clinical significance in the pathogenesis of oligodontia (Inagaki2021Identification).

Alterations in OPN3 expression also impact pigmentation processes in human skin. OPN3 acts as a negative regulator of melanin production in melanocytes. Reduced expression of OPN3 leads to increased melanin levels, while overexpression results in decreased melanin production. This regulation occurs through OPN3's interaction with the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), affecting cAMP signaling pathways crucial for melanin synthesis (Ozdeslik2019Human).

Furthermore, OPN3 downregulation in melanocytes can induce apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway, highlighting its role in cell survival and potential implications for conditions related to melanocyte function (Wang2020Opsin3).

## Interactions
Opsin 3 (OPN3) is known to participate in several protein interactions that influence its function in various cellular processes. In airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells, OPN3 interacts with the G protein alpha subunit Gαs, which is part of a signaling pathway that leads to muscle relaxation. This interaction is confirmed through proximity ligation assays and co-immunoprecipitation, indicating a physical association between OPN3 and Gαs (Wu2021Opsin). OPN3 also interacts with G protein receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), which modulates the desensitization of OPN3. This interaction is demonstrated by increased co-localization and physical interaction between GRK2 and OPN3, as shown by proximity ligation assays and co-immunoprecipitation (Wu2021Opsin).

In human epidermal melanocytes, OPN3 forms a molecular complex with the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). This interaction negatively regulates MC1R-mediated signaling by reducing cAMP levels, which affects melanin production. The complex formation between OPN3 and MC1R is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Ozdeslik2019Human). These interactions highlight OPN3's role in modulating signaling pathways in different cellular contexts.
