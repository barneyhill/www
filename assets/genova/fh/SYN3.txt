# SYN3

## Overview
The SYN3 gene encodes synapsin III, a member of the synapsin family of neuronal phosphoproteins, which play a critical role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release at synapses. Synapsin III is primarily involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and is essential for synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Unlike other synapsins, synapsin III does not significantly alter vesicle fusion probability but instead regulates the size of the synaptic vesicle recycling pool, highlighting its specialized function in synaptic transmission and neuronal development (Feng2002Regulation). The protein is predominantly active in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, where it influences cytoskeletal organization and modulates synaptic vesicle availability, thereby affecting neuronal communication and brain function (Pieribone2002Expression). Synapsin III is also implicated in the early stages of neuronal development, particularly in axonogenesis and the maturation of dopaminergic neurons (Faustini2021Synapsin). The gene's expression and function are subject to regulation through alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, which are crucial for its role in neurodevelopment and synaptic function (Longhena2021An).

## Structure
Synapsin III (SYN3) is a member of the synapsin family, characterized by a conserved domain structure. The protein features a highly homologous N-terminal region, which includes domains A, B, and C. Domain A contains a major phosphorylation site that modulates synaptic vesicle association, while Domain C is crucial for interactions with actin filaments and synaptic vesicle phospholipids, and it mediates synapsin dimerization (Cesca2010The). The C-terminal region of SYN3 is more variable due to alternative splicing and includes a proline-rich domain J (Cesca2010The).

SYN3 undergoes various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which affects its interaction with actin and synaptic vesicle trafficking. Phosphorylation at Ser404 by Cdk5 influences neurite outgrowth and axon specification (Longhena2021An). The protein can form homodimers or heterodimers with other synapsins, such as Syn I and II, contributing to its role in synaptic vesicle clustering and regulation (Longhena2021An).

The SYN3 gene is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in six different isoforms, which may influence its function and localization (Longhena2021An). These structural features and modifications are integral to SYN3's role in synaptic function and neurodevelopment.

## Function
Synapsin III (SYN3) is a member of the synapsin family of proteins, which are involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release at synapses. In healthy human cells, SYN3 plays a crucial role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and is essential for synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. It is primarily active in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, where it influences the organization of the cytoskeleton and modulates synaptic vesicle availability, thereby affecting neuronal communication and brain function (Pieribone2002Expression).

SYN3 is involved in the early stages of neuronal development, particularly in axonogenesis. It regulates axonal growth, migration, and differentiation, as well as the survival of neuronal progenitors. In dopaminergic neurons, SYN3 controls early maturation, affecting dendritic arborization and soma area (Faustini2021Synapsin). The protein is also implicated in the development and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells, particularly in neurogenic regions such as the hippocampal dentate gyrus and olfactory bulb (Pieribone2002Expression).

SYN3's function is distinct from other synapsins, as it does not significantly alter the probability of vesicle fusion or repriming rates but primarily regulates the size of the synaptic vesicle recycling pool (Feng2002Regulation). This unique role suggests that SYN3 has specialized functions in synaptic transmission and neuronal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SYN3 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders. SYN3 is associated with schizophrenia, although evidence regarding its role in mood disorders like bipolar disorder and major depression is limited (Cruceanu2016DNA). While significant methylation changes in SYN3 related to mood disorders were not found, its association with schizophrenia suggests a potential role in synaptic dysfunctions that contribute to the disease (Cruceanu2016DNA).

In the context of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the SNP rs9621532, located near the SYN3 gene, has been studied for its potential protective role against neovascular AMD (nAMD). This SNP is associated with reduced expression of SYN3 in retinal pigment epithelial cells, which may influence the pathogenesis of nAMD (Ardeljan2013Influence).

SYN3 is also involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity, and its interactions with other proteins, such as C9orf72, are crucial for maintaining synaptic integrity. Disruptions in these interactions have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases like ALS/FTD, highlighting the importance of SYN3 in synaptic regulation and its potential impact on disease progression (Bauer2022An).

## Interactions
Synapsin III (SYN3) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in synaptic function. SYN3 interacts with alpha-synuclein (α-syn), a protein implicated in Parkinson's disease, forming co-aggregates that influence synaptic vesicle dynamics and dopamine release. This interaction is particularly significant in the context of α-syn aggregation, where SYN3 is found to co-localize with α-syn aggregates in the substantia nigra and striatum, as observed in SYN120 transgenic mice models (Faustini2020Alphasynucleinsynapsin; Zaltieri2015αsynuclein).

SYN3 also interacts with the C9orf72 protein, a relationship that is important for synaptic function. This interaction occurs at synapses and is mediated by the N-terminal longin domain of C9orf72 and the conserved C domain of synapsin, highlighting the role of SYN3 in synaptic vesicle regulation (Bauer2022An).

Additionally, SYN3 is known to bind to actin filaments, which affects the organization of synaptic vesicles and the architecture of the presynaptic site. This interaction is modulated by the phosphorylation state of SYN3, which influences its ability to crosslink synaptic vesicles with the actin mesh (Brachya2006Synaptic).
