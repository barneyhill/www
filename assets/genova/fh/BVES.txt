# BVES

## Overview
BVES, or blood vessel epicardial substance, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in maintaining epithelial and endothelial cell integrity. The protein, also referred to as BVES, is characterized by its three transmembrane domains and is predominantly involved in cell-cell adhesion, particularly at tight junctions. It plays a crucial role in the stability and integrity of epithelial monolayers by interacting with proteins such as ZO-1 and VAMP3, which are essential for the proper trafficking and recycling of junctional proteins. This function is vital for maintaining epithelial sheet formation and stability, as well as for integrin-dependent cell movements and the integrity of the actin-cytoskeletal network. BVES is also implicated in various clinical conditions, including congenital heart defects and muscular dystrophy, highlighting its significance in both cardiac and muscular health (De2019Muscular; Hager2010Identification; Osler2005Bves).

## Structure
The BVES protein is a transmembrane protein characterized by three transmembrane domains and an extracellular N-terminus with two N-glycosylation sites, specifically at Asn 20 and Asn 27, indicating its extracellular orientation (Knight2003Membrane). The intracellular C-terminus is highly conserved and contains the Popeye domain, although its specific function remains unknown (Osler2006Bves). The C-terminus is a likely candidate for protein interactions, as it interacts with the tight junction component ZO-1, suggesting a role in molecular regulation (Osler2006Bves; Osler2005Bves). 

The protein's size varies from approximately 42 to 58 kDa due to post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation (Osler2006Bves). BVES is known to oligomerize, existing predominantly in an oligomeric form under non-reducing conditions (Knight2003Membrane). The protein's dynamic cellular distribution and its ability to modulate epithelial integrity through interactions at tight junctions highlight its functional significance in cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Osler2005Bves). The BVES gene also has several splice variant isoforms, which may influence its function and localization.

## Function
The BVES gene encodes a transmembrane protein known as blood vessel epicardial substance (Bves), which plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial and endothelial cell integrity. Bves is involved in cell-cell adhesion, particularly at tight junctions, where it interacts with proteins such as ZO-1, contributing to the stability and integrity of epithelial monolayers (Osler2005Bves). It is essential for the proper trafficking and recycling of junctional proteins, which is vital for maintaining epithelial sheet formation and stability (Hager2010Identification; Osler2005Bves).

Bves also interacts with the vesicular transport protein VAMP3, facilitating the recycling of receptors like b-1-integrin, which is crucial for cell movement and adhesion (Hager2010Identification). This interaction is necessary for integrin-dependent cell movements and maintaining the actin-cytoskeletal network integrity (Hager2010Identification). In the context of intestinal health, BVES is critical for maintaining the epithelial barrier function, regulating tight junction-associated proteins, and modulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Choksi2018BVES). Its absence can lead to increased intestinal permeability and dysregulated immune responses, highlighting its protective role in epithelial integrity (Choksi2018BVES).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the BVES gene have been linked to several diseases. In the context of congenital heart defects, BVES is associated with non-syndromic tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Studies have identified novel genetic variants within the BVES gene in TOF patients, which are absent in control groups. These variants may affect RNA splicing and motif-binding sites, contributing to the condition (WU2013Mutational). The c.385C>T variant, in particular, is associated with sporadic TOF in the Han Chinese population and is linked to decreased transcriptional activity of the BVES gene, affecting heart development (Shi2019The).

BVES mutations are also implicated in muscular dystrophy with arrhythmia. Loss-of-function mutations in BVES can lead to early adult-onset skeletal muscle and cardiac conduction abnormalities, with symptoms varying among individuals. This condition is classified as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type R25 (LGMD R25) (De2019Muscular; Indrawati2020Two). The mutations result in partial or complete loss of function of BVES, affecting the POPDC1 protein and leading to reduced membrane localization of POPDC1 and POPDC2 in muscle tissues (De2019Muscular). These findings highlight the clinical significance of BVES in both cardiac and muscular disorders.

## Interactions
BVES (blood vessel epicardial substance) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for maintaining cellular functions. BVES interacts with ZO-1, a tight junction protein, which is essential for maintaining junctional integrity. This interaction confines ZO-1 and occludin to the cellular membrane, and a mutant form of BVES can lead to their intracellular localization (Parang2018Blood; Osler2005Bves). BVES also interacts with the vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3), which is involved in vesicular transport and cellular migration (Parang2018Blood).

In cardiac myocytes, BVES binds to cAMP and interacts with the 2-pore domain potassium channel TREK-1, influencing its membrane localization. A missense variant of BVES affects this interaction, leading to cardiac and muscular defects (Parang2018Blood). BVES also interacts with PR61α, a regulatory subunit of the PP2A complex, promoting c-Myc dephosphorylation and degradation, which is significant for regulating c-Myc protein levels and tumorigenesis (Parang2016BVES).

These interactions highlight BVES's role in cellular adhesion, migration, and signaling pathways, impacting both epithelial integrity and cardiac function.
