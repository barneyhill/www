# MSN

## Overview
The MSN gene encodes the protein moesin, a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family, which is integral to cellular structure and signaling. Moesin functions as a cytoskeletal linker protein, connecting the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby playing a pivotal role in maintaining cell shape, adhesion, and signal transduction (Kovács2022Hemizygous; Bretscher1999Regulation). The protein is characterized by a conserved domain structure, including an N-terminal FERM domain, a central helical domain, and a C-terminal domain, which facilitate its interactions with various cellular components (Michie2019Two). Moesin is particularly active in immune cells, where it influences processes such as lymphocyte homing and immune synapse formation, and is implicated in both immunological disorders and cancer progression (LagreslePeyrou2016Xlinked; Qin2020Interfering). Mutations in the MSN gene can lead to significant clinical manifestations, including immunodeficiencies and autoimmune conditions, highlighting its critical role in immune system function (Kovács2022Hemizygous; Fang2022A).

## Structure
Moesin (MSN) is a member of the ERM protein family, characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes an N-terminal FERM domain, a central helical domain, and a C-terminal domain (CTD) (Michie2019Two). The FERM domain is composed of three subdomains (F1, F2, and F3) that form a tri-lobed, cloverleaf structure, which is crucial for linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane (Michie2019Two). This domain is capable of binding peptide and phospholipid ligands, and it features a deep hydrophobic pocket and a solvent-exposed acidic patch (Michie2019Two; Pearson2000Structure).

The central helical domain consists of three helices (α1H, α2H, and α3H), with α2H and α3H forming an elongated antiparallel coiled-coil structure, maintained by a heptad repeat of hydrophobic residues (Michie2019Two). The CTD is involved in actin binding and is shorter and more divergent in sequence compared to the FERM domain (Michie2019Two). It contains a short actin-binding motif that interacts with filamentous F-actin (Michie2019Two).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating moesin's activity, particularly in facilitating the dissociation of the FERM and CTD domains to enable actin binding (Michie2019Two). The protein can exist in both a closed, autoinhibited state and an active, open form, with activation involving membrane binding and phosphorylation (Michie2019Two).

## Function
The MSN gene encodes the moesin protein, a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family, which plays a critical role in linking membrane-associated proteins to actin filaments in the cell cortex. This connection is essential for maintaining the structure and function of the plasma membrane and associated molecules, influencing cellular morphology, adhesion, and signaling pathways (Kovács2022Hemizygous; Bretscher1999Regulation). Moesin is particularly active in circulating lymphocytes, where it maintains cell rigidity and participates in the formation of the immunological synapse, a process crucial for effective immune responses (LagreslePeyrou2016Xlinked).

In healthy cells, moesin undergoes rapid phosphorylation cycles in response to chemokine activation or antigen presentation, affecting lymphocyte homing and B-cell receptor signaling (Kovács2022Hemizygous). It is also involved in cellular responses to pathogens and is a positive regulator of X4-tropic HIV-1 infection (Kovács2022Hemizygous). Moesin's role extends to regulating B- and T-cell activation by controlling receptor dynamics and scaffolding protein assembly, which is crucial for membrane-associated intracellular signaling (Kovács2022Hemizygous). Its deficiency can lead to impaired lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs, causing persistent lymphopenia (Hirata2012Moesindeficient).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MSN gene, which encodes the protein moesin, are associated with several immunological disorders. One such condition is X-linked moesin-associated immunodeficiency (X-MAID), characterized by recurrent bacterial and viral infections, lymphopenia, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Patients with X-MAID often exhibit impaired T-cell proliferation and altered migration and adhesion capacities (LagreslePeyrou2016Xlinked; Fang2022A). Specific mutations, such as the c.511C>T (p.Arg171Trp) and c.934G>T (p.Glu312Ter), have been identified in patients with these immunodeficiencies, leading to reduced MSN protein expression and function (Fang2022A; Bradshaw2018Exome).

Additionally, MSN mutations have been linked to a novel autoimmune phenotype of immunodeficiency 50 (IMD50), which includes symptoms like chronic ulcers, recurrent infections, and autoimmune thyroiditis (Kovács2022Hemizygous). The MSN gene's role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton is crucial for immune cell functions, and its dysfunction can lead to conditions such as very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD) (Fang2022A). These findings underscore the importance of MSN in maintaining immune system integrity and highlight the potential consequences of its mutations.

## Interactions
Moesin (MSN) is a member of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) protein family and is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the receptor CD44, where the FERM domain of MSN binds to the cytoplasmic tail of CD44. This interaction is implicated in Alzheimer's disease, as it is associated with microglial activity and neuro-inflammation. The binding of MSN to CD44 is modulated by phospholipid PIP2, which stimulates receptor tail binding through an allosteric mechanism (Du2023Development).

In the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), MSN interacts with the nuclear protein NONO. This interaction is essential for the nuclear localization of phosphorylated MSN, which in turn facilitates the phosphorylation of CREB by PKCζ, promoting cancer progression. The phosphorylation of MSN at threonine 558 is crucial for its interaction with NONO, and this complex plays a significant role in activating CREB signaling pathways (Qin2020Interfering).

These interactions highlight the diverse roles of MSN in both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.
