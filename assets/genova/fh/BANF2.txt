# BANF2

## Overview
BANF2, or Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor 2, is a gene that encodes the protein BANF family member 2, which is part of the barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) family. This family of proteins is known for its role in chromatin organization and nuclear assembly. BANF family member 2 is involved in DNA binding and plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the nucleus by interacting with various nuclear components. It is categorized as a DNA-binding protein, which suggests its involvement in gene regulation and chromatin remodeling processes. The precise biological functions and interactions of BANF2 are still under investigation, but it is believed to be significant in cellular processes such as DNA repair and replication (Qiu2020aarFDC).
