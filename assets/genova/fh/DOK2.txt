# DOK2

## Overview
DOK2, or docking protein 2, is a gene that encodes an adaptor protein involved in intracellular signal transduction. The DOK2 protein is characterized by its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which facilitate its role in membrane localization and interaction with phosphorylated tyrosine residues, respectively (Grimm2001Novel; Guittard2018Evolutionary). As a member of the docking protein family, DOK2 functions primarily as a negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, by recruiting negative signaling regulators to inhibit excessive pathway activation (Berger2013DOK2). This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining normal cellular processes and preventing tumorigenesis, particularly in lung and breast cancers, where DOK2 acts as a tumor suppressor (Chen2018Compound; SUN2021Introduction). Additionally, DOK2 is implicated in immune regulation, influencing immune checkpoint-related genes and immune markers, which highlights its potential role in cancer therapy and immune modulation (Xu2022DOK2).

## Structure
DOK2, also known as docking protein 2, is characterized by its structural domains that facilitate its role as an adaptor protein in signal transduction. The protein contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is crucial for membrane localization, and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which mediates interactions with phosphorylated tyrosine residues on receptor proteins (Grimm2001Novel; Guittard2018Evolutionary). The C-terminal region of DOK2 is rich in proline residues and contains multiple SH2 and SH3 binding motifs, which are important for interactions with other signaling proteins (Grimm2001Novel).

DOK2 undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation, which is essential for its function in signaling pathways. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within DOK2 allows for the recruitment of SH2 domain-containing proteins, playing a role in the negative regulation of immune cell signaling (Grimm2001Novel; Guittard2018Evolutionary). While the context does not provide specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of DOK2, it is noted that the protein is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins and lipids. There is no mention of splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
DOK2 (docking protein 2) is an adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in modulating intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). In healthy human cells, DOK2 functions as a negative regulator of signaling pathways, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. It achieves this by recruiting negative signaling regulators into the signaling complex, thereby inhibiting excessive activation of pathways that could lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer (Berger2013DOK2).

DOK2 is involved in the regulation of the RAS/RTK signaling pathway, acting as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting RAS activity. It enhances the recruitment of the RAS GTPase activating protein RASA1/RASGAP to RAS, which is crucial for maintaining normal cellular signaling and preventing tumorigenesis (Chen2018Compound; Berger2013DOK2). DOK2 is phosphorylated following EGF stimulation and can bind directly to phosphotyrosines on EGFR, suppressing the phosphorylation of SRC, AKT, and ERK (Berger2013DOK2).

In the context of lung cells, DOK2 is constitutively associated with the cell membrane and bound to EGFR, where it interacts with EGFR to suppress its downstream signaling. This suppression is partly mediated through the recruitment of RASA1, facilitating the inactivation of RAS and maintaining controlled cell growth (Berger2013DOK2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DOK2 gene are implicated in various cancers. In lung cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma, DOK2 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its loss or reduced expression is associated with poor survival outcomes and increased tumor proliferation. This is often due to its role in inhibiting MAPK signaling and its interaction with EGFR mutations, which can promote lung tumorigenesis (Chen2018Compound; Berger2013DOK2). In breast cancer, low DOK2 expression correlates with poor differentiation, larger tumor size, and higher metastasis rates, affecting drug resistance and prognosis (SUN2021Introduction).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high DOK2 expression is linked to inferior overall survival and disease-free survival, making it an independent risk factor. DOK2 is involved in several signaling pathways, including PI3K-Akt and MAPK, which are relevant for targeted cancer therapies (Xu2022DOK2). In colorectal cancer, low DOK2 expression is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis (SUN2021Introduction).

DOK2 also plays a role in immune regulation, with its expression affecting immune checkpoint-related genes and various immune markers, indicating its involvement in immune modulation and resistance mechanisms (Xu2022DOK2).

## Interactions
DOK2, a tumor suppressor gene, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in signal transduction pathways, particularly in the context of lung adenocarcinoma. DOK2 physically interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), especially in cells expressing mutant forms of EGFR, such as the L858R mutation. This interaction is significant as DOK2 is recruited to the EGFR complex upon activation, facilitating the inhibition of downstream signaling pathways by enhancing the recruitment of RASA1, a RAS GTPase-activating protein (RASGAP), to RAS. This recruitment helps suppress EGF-induced RAS and ERK activity, thereby opposing the effects of mutated EGFR (Berger2013DOK2).

DOK2 is also constitutively bound to RASA1 in cells harboring EGFR mutations, indicating its role in suppressing RAS activation via RASA1. The interaction between DOK2 and EGFR can be disrupted by proteins like SHC1, which competes for binding to the same phosphotyrosine sequences on EGFR, potentially overriding DOK2's recruitment to activated EGFR (Berger2013DOK2). These interactions highlight DOK2's function in modulating tyrosine kinase signaling and its tumor-suppressive role in lung cancer.
