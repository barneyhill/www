# OR1S2

## Overview
The OR1S2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily S member 2, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is involved in the detection of odorant molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. As a transmembrane receptor, it spans the cell membrane and transmits signals from the external environment to the interior of the cell, initiating a cascade of cellular responses. The olfactory receptors, including OR1S2, are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a hallmark of GPCRs. These receptors are highly diverse, allowing for the detection of a wide range of odorants, contributing to the complexity and sensitivity of olfactory perception (Qiu2020aarFDC).
