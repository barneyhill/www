# ATAT1

## Overview
The ATAT1 gene encodes the enzyme alpha tubulin acetyltransferase 1, which is a key player in the post-translational modification of microtubules through the acetylation of alpha-tubulin at lysine 40. This acetylation is crucial for the stabilization and function of microtubules, particularly in neurons where it facilitates axonal transport by enhancing the activity of molecular motors such as kinesin and dynein (Even2019ATAT1enriched; Li2015Tubulin). As a member of the acetyltransferase family, ATAT1 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and stress responses, by interacting with proteins like cortactin and HSPA5 (CastroCastro2012ATAT1MEC17; Fu2023SEPTIN2). The gene's expression is notably high in the central nervous system and ciliated tissues, underscoring its importance in complex biological functions such as learning and memory (Li2015Tubulin). Alterations in ATAT1 expression or function have been linked to several neurological disorders and cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2015Tubulin).

## Function
ATAT1 (alpha tubulin acetyltransferase 1) is a crucial enzyme in the acetylation of alpha-tubulin at lysine 40, a modification that plays a significant role in stabilizing microtubule structures. This acetylation is associated with long-lived microtubules, which are important for cellular stability and function (Li2015Tubulin). In neurons, ATAT1 is essential for proper axonal transport, as it enhances the recruitment and mobility of molecular motors like kinesin and dynein along axons. This process is vital for neuronal function, including cell survival and neurotransmission (Even2019ATAT1enriched).

ATAT1 is transported along microtubules on the surface of motile vesicles, which is necessary for efficient acetylation of alpha-tubulin and fast axonal transport (Even2019ATAT1enriched). The enzyme is also involved in the dynamic localization throughout the cell cycle, being observed in centrioles, nuclei, and basal bodies during interphase, and colocalizing with chromatids and spindle poles during telophase. This suggests roles in microtubule acetylation, RNA transcription activity, and cytokinesis (NekookiMachida2018Dynamic).

ATAT1's activity is not dependent on microtubule length, and it accesses the luminal acetylation site through transient holes in the microtubule lattice (Li2015Tubulin). It is expressed in various tissues, with the strongest expression in the central nervous system and ciliated tissues, indicating its importance in advanced functions such as learning and memory (Li2015Tubulin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the ATAT1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. ATAT1 is crucial for tubulin acetylation, a process important for maintaining microtubule stability and function. In Atat1-null mice, the absence of ATAT1 leads to enlarged lateral ventricles due to septal and striatal hypoplasia, which correlates with mild motor coordination defects. These structural abnormalities resemble conditions like Huntington's disease, characterized by striatal atrophy and motor dysfunction (Li2019ATAT1). 

Altered tubulin acetylation, potentially involving ATAT1, is linked to various neurological disorders, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Joubert syndrome, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. These conditions often involve decreased tubulin acetylation, suggesting that ATAT1 may play a role in their pathogenesis (Li2015Tubulin). 

In cancer, elevated tubulin acetylation influenced by ATAT1 is associated with increased cell adhesion and invasion, particularly in breast cancer. ATAT1 expression is also linked to pancreatic cancer-initiating cells, indicating its potential role in tumorigenesis (Li2015Tubulin). These findings suggest that ATAT1 is a significant factor in the development and progression of various diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ATAT1 (alpha tubulin acetyltransferase 1) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing its function and localization. It binds to cortactin, a protein involved in actin binding, and this interaction is independent of ATAT1's acetyltransferase activity. This binding is significant in the context of breast tumor cell invasion, where ATAT1 acetylates cortactin, affecting the dynamics and distribution of MT1-MMP endosomal compartments (CastroCastro2012ATAT1MEC17).

ATAT1 also interacts with microtubule-associated proteins, such as kinesin-1, which is crucial for its role in mitochondrial transport. This interaction is dependent on the N-terminal catalytic domain of ATAT1, which is necessary for its association with kinesin-1 and miro, forming a complex that is essential for maintaining mitochondrial motility and function (Kumar2023MFN2dependent).

In the context of cellular stress responses, ATAT1 has a stronger affinity for HSPA5 than the E3 ligase SCNN1B, suggesting a competitive relationship between acetylation and ubiquitination at the K327 site of HSPA5. This interaction is important for modulating the acetylation status of HSPA5, which plays a role in regulating inflammation (Fu2023SEPTIN2).
