# MAP1B

## Overview
The MAP1B gene encodes the microtubule-associated protein 1B, a critical cytoskeletal protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. This protein plays a pivotal role in neuronal development, particularly in axonal elongation and guidance, as well as in the stabilization of microtubules during dendrite and neurite elongation (Riederer2007Microtubuleassociated; Villarroel‐Campos2014The). MAP1B is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein and is predominantly expressed in the axons and dendrites of neurons, where it contributes to the establishment of neuronal polarity and synaptic connectivity (Riederer2007Microtubuleassociated). The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interactions with microtubules and actin filaments, thereby affecting neuronal growth and migration (Gonzalez‐Billault2003Microtubule‐associated). Mutations in the MAP1B gene have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its essential role in maintaining neuronal structure and function (Heinzen2018De; Walters2018MAP1B).

## Structure
The MAP1B protein is a large cytoskeletal protein with a molecular weight between 320 and 330 kDa, consisting of 2,464 amino acids (Riederer2007Microtubuleassociated). It is initially translated as a polyprotein precursor, which is cleaved into a heavy chain (MAP1B-HC) and a light chain (MAP1B-LC1) (Tögel1998Novel). The heavy chain is approximately 243 kDa, while the light chain is about 27 kDa (Cueille2007Characterization).

The primary structure of MAP1B includes two regions of repetitive amino acid sequences. The first region is highly basic, with motifs such as KKEE or KKF, spanning amino acids 589-787, and is crucial for microtubule binding (Noble1989The). The second region consists of 12 imperfect 15-amino acid-long repeats, which are involved in microtubule interactions (Noble1989The).

MAP1B's secondary and tertiary structures are characterized by its ability to form elongated, rod-shaped molecules with a terminal globular domain (Halpain2006The). The light chain can self-interact, forming dimers or oligomers, and is regulated by the heavy chain (Tögel1998Novel).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating MAP1B's interaction with microtubules and actin filaments (Riederer2007Microtubuleassociated). The protein is differentially phosphorylated at multiple sites, influencing its function in neuronal development (Cueille2007Characterization).

## Function
MAP1B (microtubule-associated protein 1B) is a critical component in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, essential for neuronal development and function. It is primarily active in the axons and dendrites of neurons, where it influences microtubule assembly and stability, playing a significant role in axonal elongation and guidance (Riederer2007Microtubuleassociated; Villarroel‐Campos2014The). MAP1B is involved in the stabilization of microtubules during the elongation of dendrites and neurites, contributing to the establishment of neuronal polarity and synaptic connectivity (Riederer2007Microtubuleassociated).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which modulate its interaction with microtubules and other cellular components. Phosphorylation by kinases like GSK3b and casein kinase II is crucial for maintaining microtubule stability and dynamics, affecting processes like axonal elongation and synaptic plasticity (Gonzalez‐Billault2003Microtubule‐associated; Villarroel‐Campos2014The). MAP1B also interacts with actin filaments, influencing actin dynamics and growth cone behavior, which are vital for neuronal growth and migration (Gonzalez‐Billault2003Microtubule‐associated).

In healthy human cells, MAP1B's functions are essential for maintaining neuronal structure and facilitating proper neural signaling, contributing to the overall architecture and function of the nervous system (Villarroel‐Campos2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAP1B gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. Loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in MAP1B have been linked to intellectual disability (ID) and significant white matter deficits. Individuals carrying these mutations often exhibit reduced brain volumes, particularly in the corpus callosum and cerebral white matter, leading to cognitive impairments and lower IQ scores (Walters2018MAP1B). These mutations also result in structural brain abnormalities, such as periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH), a condition characterized by misplaced neurons in the brain, often associated with epilepsy and cognitive impairments (Julca2019MAP1B; Heinzen2018De).

MAP1B mutations can also lead to other neurological abnormalities, including seizures and dysmorphic features. The gene's expression is regulated by the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), and its misregulation can affect synaptogenesis, contributing to conditions like Fragile X syndrome (Julca2019MAP1B). In mouse models, mutations in MAP1B result in a range of neurological abnormalities, such as ataxic gait and spastic tremors, indicating its critical role in neuronal development and stability (Edelmann1996Neuronal). These findings underscore the importance of MAP1B in maintaining normal brain function and its potential involvement in various neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
MAP1B interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in neuronal development and microtubule dynamics. The MAP1B light chain can bind to microtubules and actin filaments, with its activity regulated by the heavy chain. This interaction is crucial for microtubule stabilization and is modulated by phosphorylation (Tögel1998Novel). MAP1B also interacts with tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL), which is essential for the tyrosination of α-tubulin. This interaction is important for microtubule dynamics and neuronal migration, and it is not affected by MAP1B phosphorylation (Utreras2007MicrotubuleAssociated).

MAP1B binds to lissencephaly-related protein 1 (LIS1), influencing the LIS1-dynein complex, which is critical for neuronal migration (JiméNezMateos2005Binding). The light chains of MAP1B also interact with α1-syntrophin, localizing to specific domains in the nervous system, such as the nodes of Ranvier (FuhrmannStroissnigg2012The). Additionally, MAP1B interacts with the NMDA receptor subunit NR3A, affecting NR3A protein concentrations and potentially influencing NMDAR signaling (Eriksson2010MAP1B). These interactions highlight MAP1B's role in regulating microtubule stability and neuronal signaling pathways.
