# PADI1

## Overview
PADI1, or peptidyl arginine deiminase 1, is a gene that encodes an enzyme belonging to the peptidylarginine deiminase family, which is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through citrullination. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the structural and functional regulation of proteins, particularly within the epidermis, where it contributes to skin barrier maintenance and differentiation (Méchin2005The). Unlike other members of its family, PADI1 is characterized by a unique monomeric structure due to its elongated N-terminal tail, which prevents dimerization (Alghamdi2019An). The enzyme is primarily active in keratinocytes and corneocytes, where it facilitates the deimination of key proteins such as filaggrin and keratin K1, essential for skin hydration and homeostasis (Méchin2005The). Beyond its role in the epidermis, PADI1 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, through its influence on cellular metabolism and gene expression (Coassolo2021Citrullination).

## Structure
The PADI1 protein is characterized by its monomeric structure, which distinguishes it from other peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) that typically form homodimers. This monomeric form is due to an elongated N-terminal tail that prevents dimerization, a feature unique to PADI1. The presence of a glutamine residue at position 8, instead of the arginine found in other PADs, is crucial for maintaining this monomeric state (Alghamdi2019An).

Structurally, PADI1 consists of three domains: two N-terminal immunoglobulin (IgG)-like domains and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The N-terminal domain spans amino acid residues 1-300 and includes 19 β-strands and 4 α-helices, with three calcium ion binding sites. The C-terminal domain, which is highly conserved across PAD isozymes, features an α/β propeller motif essential for calcium ion binding and substrate deamination (Alghamdi2019An).

PADI1 also exhibits intrinsic disorder, with 19.2% of its residues predicted to be intrinsically disordered. This disorder is associated with potential disorder-based binding motifs (MoRFs) that may fold upon interaction with other proteins (Alghamdi2019An). Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation at sites such as Ser39, Ser45, and Ser132, and acetylation at Lys226, which are located within these disordered regions (Alghamdi2019An).

## Function
PADI1 (peptidyl arginine deiminase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of proteins through the process of deimination, where arginine residues are converted into citrulline. This modification is essential for the structural and functional regulation of proteins within the epidermis, particularly in the differentiation and maintenance of the skin barrier (Méchin2005The).

PADI1 is primarily active in the human epidermis, where it is involved in the deimination of filaggrin and keratin K1. These processes are crucial for maintaining the hydration and homeostasis of the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the skin. The deimination of filaggrin by PADI1 leads to the production of free amino acids, which are vital for the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) that maintains skin hydration (Méchin2005The).

PADI1 is located in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes and within the intracellular matrix of corneocytes, where it functions optimally at low calcium concentrations and is resistant to acidic pH. This localization and activity suggest that PADI1 is integral to the structural changes and integrity of the epidermis, contributing to skin barrier function and cornification (Méchin2005The).

## Clinical Significance
The PADI1 gene is implicated in various pathological conditions, primarily through its role in the citrullination of proteins, which can affect cellular processes such as differentiation and apoptosis. Alterations in PADI1 expression have been associated with certain cancers, where its upregulation is linked to enhanced glycolysis and cancer cell proliferation. This is particularly evident under hypoxic conditions, which are common in tumor environments, suggesting that PADI1 may contribute to the metabolic reprogramming observed in cancer cells (Coassolo2021Citrullination).

In the context of cancer, PADI1, along with PADI3, is involved in the citrullination of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a key enzyme in glycolysis. This modification can attenuate the inhibitory effects of certain amino acids on PKM2, thereby promoting glycolysis and supporting cancer cell growth (Coassolo2021Citrullination). The expression of PADI1 is also deregulated in rheumatoid arthritis, where increased citrullination of glycolytic enzymes is observed, potentially contributing to the disease's metabolic alterations (Coassolo2021Citrullination).

While PADI1 mutations have not been directly linked to specific diseases in the provided context, its altered expression and activity in cancer and rheumatoid arthritis highlight its clinical significance in these conditions.

## Interactions
PADI1 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids through its enzymatic activity of citrullination, which involves the conversion of arginine residues to citrulline. This post-translational modification affects protein function and interactions. In cancer cells, PADI1 citrullinates pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a key glycolytic enzyme, altering its interaction with ligands such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. This modification enhances glycolysis and promotes cancer cell proliferation by favoring the activator serine and reducing inhibition by other ligands (Coassolo2021Citrullination).

PADI1 is also involved in the citrullination of histones, particularly histones H3 and H4, during early embryo development. This modification alters chromatin structure, making it more permissive for transcription and is crucial for development beyond the 4-cell stage (Zhang2016Peptidylarginine). The enzyme's activity affects chromatin conformation and RNA polymerase II function, which are critical for transcriptional regulation during early embryonic development (Zhang2016Peptidylarginine). These interactions highlight PADI1's role in regulating gene expression and cellular metabolism through its citrullination activity.
