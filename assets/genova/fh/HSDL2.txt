# HSDL2

## Overview
The HSDL2 gene encodes the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-like 2 protein, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. This protein is characterized by its involvement in the oxidation and reduction of various substrates, including steroids and fatty acids, and plays a significant role in lipid metabolism (p&gt; Ectopic; Yang2021Lipid; Dong2019&lt). Structurally, the HSDL2 protein contains an N-terminal SDR domain and a C-terminal sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) domain, which are essential for its enzymatic functions and localization to peroxisomes (Yang2021Lipid). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis through processes such as energy production and steroid hormone regulation (Yang2021Lipid). HSDL2 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and reproductive organs, and has been implicated in several cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Sun2018Role; Ma2023HSDL2).

## Structure
The human hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-like 2 (HSDL2) protein is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, characterized by its involvement in the oxidation and reduction of various substrates, including steroids and fatty acids (p&gt; Ectopic; Yang2021Lipid; Dong2019&lt). The protein contains an N-terminal SDR domain and a C-terminal sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) domain, which are crucial for its enzymatic functions (Yang2021Lipid). The SDR domain typically features a Rossmann fold, a structural motif that includes a central β sheet flanked by α helices, which is essential for cofactor binding (Li2022Expression).

HSDL2 also contains conserved motifs such as NAD(P)+ coenzyme binding sites, which are integral to its enzymatic activity (Yang2021Lipid). The presence of a peroxisomal targeting signal (ARL) in the human HSDL2 protein suggests its localization to peroxisomes, where it may play a role in lipid metabolism (Yang2021Lipid). The protein's structure and domains indicate its involvement in lipid metabolic processes, which are significant in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer (Yang2021Lipid). However, specific details about post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of HSDL2 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The HSDL2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, which is involved in the oxidation and reduction of various substrates, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics (p&gt; Ectopic; Dong2019&lt). In healthy human cells, HSDL2 is ubiquitously expressed in tissues such as the liver, kidney, prostate, testes, and ovaries, and is located in peroxisomes and mitochondria (Yang2021Lipid). The protein contains an N-terminal SDR domain and a C-terminal sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) domain, along with a peroxisomal targeting signal, which suggests its involvement in lipid metabolism (Yang2021Lipid).

HSDL2 plays a critical role in lipid metabolism, which is essential for cell membrane lipid synthesis, energy production, and signal transduction, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Yang2021Lipid). The enzyme's activity in lipid metabolism is crucial for normal cellular activities, contributing to processes such as energy homeostasis and steroid hormone regulation (Yang2021Lipid). Despite its significant role in lipid metabolism, the specific molecular activities of HSDL2 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HSDL2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), HSDL2 expression is significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis, as it promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CCA cells by inhibiting the p53 pathway and suppressing ferroptosis through the p53/SLC7A11 axis (Ma2023HSDL2).

In ovarian cancer, HSDL2 is overexpressed, correlating with advanced tumor stages and lymphatic metastasis. Knockdown of HSDL2 in ovarian cancer cell lines results in suppressed cell growth, viability, and motility, while promoting apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (Sun2018Role).

HSDL2 is also upregulated in cervical cancer, where it is associated with poor survival outcomes. It promotes cell proliferation and metastasis, and its expression is negatively regulated by miR-26a-5p (Li2022MiR26a5p; Yang2021Lipid).

In papillary thyroid carcinoma, HSDL2 is overexpressed, promoting tumor progression. Its knockdown leads to reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zeng2019Downregulated).

In breast cancer, the circular RNA circHSDL2, derived from the HSDL2 gene, is upregulated and promotes cancer progression by modulating the Hippo signaling pathway (Wang2024Circular).

## Interactions
HSDL2 (hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase like 2) is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing various cellular processes. In cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells, HSDL2 interacts with the p53/SLC7A11 axis. Knockdown of HSDL2 leads to increased expression of SLC7A11, a component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter system xCT, which is involved in redox homeostasis and ferroptosis. This interaction is mediated through the p53 pathway, where p53 inhibits SLC7A11 transcription by binding to its promoter, thereby affecting ferroptosis indicators like GSH, ROS, and MDA levels (Ma2023HSDL2).

In cervical cancer, HSDL2 is regulated by miR-26a-5p, which directly targets HSDL2 by binding to its 3'-UTR. This interaction results in the modulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Overexpression of miR-26a-5p leads to decreased HSDL2 expression, while HSDL2 can partially counteract the effects of miR-26a-5p on these cellular processes (Li2022MiR26a5p).

In breast cancer, HSDL2 is implicated in cell proliferation and prognosis. Its expression influences cell cycle progression by affecting the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as CDK1, cyclin B1, and cyclin D1, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (p&gt; Ectopic; Dong2019&lt).
