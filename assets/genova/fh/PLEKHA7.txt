# PLEKHA7

## Overview
PLEKHA7 is a gene that encodes the pleckstrin homology domain containing A7 protein, which is a critical component of cellular architecture, particularly in epithelial cells. The protein is categorized as a scaffold protein due to its role in organizing and stabilizing cell-cell junctions, specifically adherens junctions. It is characterized by a unique domain structure, including pleckstrin homology (PH) and WW domains, which facilitate its interactions with phospholipids and other proteins. PLEKHA7 is essential for maintaining the integrity of adherens junctions by interacting with key proteins such as E-cadherin and p120-catenin, and it plays a role in microtubule tethering and cytoskeletal dynamics. Beyond its structural functions, PLEKHA7 is involved in regulating microRNA processing, contributing to its anti-tumorigenic properties. Mutations and altered expression of PLEKHA7 have been linked to various diseases, including cancer, hypertension, primary angle closure glaucoma, and non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate, highlighting its clinical significance (Kourtidis2016PLEKHA7; Lee2017Primary; Pulimeno2010PLEKHA7).

## Structure
PLEKHA7 is a protein characterized by its distinct domain organization, which includes two WW domains and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in the N-terminal half, and coiled-coil and proline-rich domains in the C-terminal half (Pulimeno2010PLEKHA7). The PH domain of PLEKHA7 adopts a seven-stranded beta-barrel structure capped by an alpha helix, with a highly positively charged barrel opening, which is crucial for its interaction with phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) (Aleshin2021Structural). This domain is involved in multivalent interactions with PIPs, leading to PIP clustering, which is essential for PLEKHA7's cellular functions (Aleshin2021Structural).

The protein is localized at adherens junctions in epithelial cells, where it plays a role in cell-cell adhesion (Pulimeno2010PLEKHA7). The C-terminal region, including the coiled-coil domain, is important for its localization at these junctions (Sluysmans2021WW). PLEKHA7 exists in multiple isoforms, as indicated by the presence of different polypeptide sizes and mRNA transcripts (Pulimeno2010PLEKHA7). The protein's interaction with membrane lipids is primarily enthalpy-driven, involving electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic contacts (Aleshin2021Structural). These structural features and interactions highlight PLEKHA7's role in membrane association and its potential as a drug target in cancer therapy (Aleshin2021Structural).

## Function
PLEKHA7 is a crucial protein involved in maintaining the integrity of adherens junctions (AJs) in epithelial cells. It is specifically localized at the apical zonula adherens (ZA) and plays a significant role in tethering microtubules to AJs, supporting junction stability and cell-cell adhesion (Kourtidis2016PLEKHA7; Pulimeno2010PLEKHA7). PLEKHA7 interacts with E-cadherin and p120-catenin, forming a complex that is distinct from other junctional complexes, and is involved in cytoskeletal dynamics by associating with actin-binding proteins and microtubule-related proteins (Kourtidis2016PLEKHA7).

PLEKHA7 also recruits PDZD11 to adherens junctions, which is essential for the stabilization of nectins, proteins critical for cell-cell junction formation and maintenance (Guerrera2016PLEKHA7). This interaction is vital for the efficient assembly of junctions, as evidenced by reduced junction assembly efficiency in PDZD11 knockout cells (Guerrera2016PLEKHA7).

In addition to its structural roles, PLEKHA7 is involved in regulating cellular behavior through microRNA (miRNA) processing. It interacts with components of the microprocessor complex, such as DROSHA and DGCR8, influencing miRNA expression and contributing to its anti-tumorigenic role by regulating the levels of specific miRNAs (Kourtidis2016PLEKHA7). PLEKHA7's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular architecture and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PLEKHA7 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of cancer, PLEKHA7 plays an anti-tumorigenic role by regulating microRNA (miRNA) expression. Loss of PLEKHA7 leads to the downregulation of anti-tumorigenic miRNAs and upregulation of pro-tumorigenic miRNAs, such as miR-19a, contributing to a pro-tumorigenic phenotype (Kourtidis2016PLEKHA7).

In cardiovascular health, mutations in PLEKHA7 have been associated with hypertension. A study using a rat model demonstrated that a mutation in PLEKHA7 resulted in attenuated salt-sensitive hypertension, suggesting that alterations in PLEKHA7 expression can significantly affect blood pressure regulation and renal health (Endres2014Mutation).

PLEKHA7 is also linked to primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), a major form of glaucoma. Reduced expression of PLEKHA7 in PACG patients correlates with the risk allele of the SNP rs11024102. This downregulation affects the actin cytoskeleton and compromises the blood-aqueous barrier, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of PACG (Lee2017Primary).

Additionally, PLEKHA7 mutations have been associated with non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NS-CL/P). Variants in PLEKHA7 may lead to reduced E-cadherin surface levels, affecting epithelial adhesion dynamics and contributing to the condition (Cox2018Mutations).

## Interactions
PLEKHA7 is a scaffold protein that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular architecture and function. It is localized at the zonula adherens of epithelial and endothelial cells and interacts with several proteins, including nectins, the Tspan33-ADAM10 complex, PDZD11, E-cadherin-associated protein p120-catenin, nezha/CAMSAP3, and paracingulin (Rouaud2020Scaffolding). The WW domains of PLEKHA7 are essential for forming a scaffold for nectins and the Tspan33-ADAM10 complex, while the PH domain mediates interactions with phospholipids and afadin (Rouaud2020Scaffolding).

PLEKHA7 also acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, enhancing their GTP hydrolysis rates. It forms complexes with Rac1 and Cdc42, but not with RhoA, and preferentially binds the GTP-bound forms of these proteins (Lee2017Primary). This interaction is crucial for modulating cell migration and actin dynamics (Lee2017Primary).

Additionally, PLEKHA7 interacts with PDZD11, which is important for the regulation of copper homeostasis. This interaction facilitates the targeting of the Menkes ATPase ATP7A to the cell periphery, crucial for maintaining low intracellular copper levels (Sluysmans2021PLEKHA5). PLEKHA7's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in maintaining cellular integrity and function.
