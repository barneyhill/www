# CD248

## Overview
CD248, also known as endosialin or tumor endothelial marker 1 (TEM1), is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in tissue remodeling and repair. The CD248 protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple domains such as a C-type lectin-like domain and EGF-like domains, and is extensively glycosylated (Becker2011CD248; Christian2001Molecular). It is primarily expressed in stromal fibroblasts, pericytes, and mesenchymal stem cells, where it plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and migration by interacting with extracellular matrix components (Khan2017Multimerin2; Di2019Linking). CD248 is notably involved in embryonic development and immune system regulation, with its expression diminishing postnatally, indicating its role in dynamic tissue processes (Teicher2019CD248:; Di2019Linking). Additionally, CD248 has been implicated in pathological conditions such as cancer and fibrosis, where its altered expression contributes to disease progression and presents potential therapeutic targets (Wilhelm2015CD248endosialin; Xu2021CD248+).

## Structure
CD248, also known as endosialin, is a type I transmembrane protein composed of 757 amino acids with a core molecular weight of 95 kDa, which increases to 165 kDa due to extensive glycosylation (Becker2011CD248; Christian2001Molecular). The protein structure includes an N-terminal signal leader peptide, a C-type lectin-like domain, a Sushi/CCP/scr-like domain, and three EGF-like domains, which are predicted to have calcium-binding functions (Becker2011CD248; Christian2001Molecular). The transmembrane domain spans amino acids 686-706, followed by a short intracellular domain (Becker2011CD248).

The extracellular region is highly O-glycosylated, with more than 30 possible O-glycosylation sites and one N-glycosylation site at Asn-628 (Becker2011CD248; Christian2001Molecular). The N-terminal segment shares sequence identity with thrombomodulin and complement receptor C1qRp, suggesting a similar three-dimensional structure (Christian2001Molecular). The protein's structure is characterized by conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges, contributing to its globular domain architecture (Christian2001Molecular).

CD248 is expressed in various splice variant isoforms, which may influence its function and localization, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Bagley2008Human). The protein is involved in cell adhesion and migration, interacting with extracellular matrix components (Khan2017Multimerin2).

## Function
CD248, also known as endosialin or tumor endothelial marker 1 (TEM1), is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed on stromal fibroblasts, pericytes, and mesenchymal stem cells, playing a significant role in tissue remodeling and repair. CD248 is involved in cell adhesion and migration by interacting with extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin, collagen I, and collagen IV, which facilitate cell attachment and migration during tissue development and repair processes (Teicher2019CD248:; Di2019Linking).

In the immune system, CD248 is expressed on CD8+ naive T cells, where it helps maintain these cells in a quiescent state, thus regulating their proliferation (Teicher2019CD248:). It is also involved in secondary lymphoid organ remodeling during adaptive immune responses, although it is not essential for B and T cell compartmentalization or antibody production (Teicher2019CD248:).

CD248's expression is high during embryonic development, particularly in stromal fibroblasts and cells of the developing vasculature, but diminishes postnatally, suggesting its role in dynamic tissue remodeling (Di2019Linking). In bone formation, CD248 acts as a negative regulator, influencing osteoblast activity and bone density (Naylor2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CD248 gene, also known as endosialin or tumor endothelial marker 1 (TEM1), have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and fibrotic conditions. In liver fibrosis, CD248 is upregulated and plays a critical role in hepatic stellate cell proliferation during chronic liver injury, suggesting its potential as a target for antifibrotic therapies (Wilhelm2015CD248endosialin). In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), high CD248 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, making it a potential prognostic and therapeutic target (Xu2021CD248+).

In cancer, CD248 is involved in tumor growth and metastasis. It is highly expressed in tumor-associated stromal fibroblasts and contributes to tumor progression through mechanisms such as extracellular matrix remodeling and immune cell recruitment (Maia2011CD248). In melanoma, CD248 expression is linked to vascular mimicry and metastasis, with its inhibition reducing these processes (Kuo2022Interference). CD248's role in cancer is further highlighted by its involvement in pathways like Notch and PDGF signaling, which influence tumor growth and stromal interactions (Maia2011CD248).

## Interactions
CD248, also known as endosialin or tumor endothelial marker 1 (TEM1), is involved in various protein interactions that influence cell adhesion, migration, and tumor progression. It specifically binds to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as fibronectin (FN), collagen I, and collagen IV, enhancing cell adhesion and migration, particularly in cancer invasion (Tomkowicz2007Interaction; Di2019Linking). The interaction with fibronectin involves the 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment, suggesting that CD248 recognizes conformationally dependent epitopes within this region (Tomkowicz2007Interaction).

CD248 also interacts with multimerin-2 (MMRN2), a protein that acts as an 'extracellular glue' between endothelial cells and pericytes or fibroblasts. This interaction occurs at a distinct region of MMRN2, allowing simultaneous binding with other proteins like CLEC14A and CD93, which are expressed by endothelial cells (Khan2017Multimerin2).

Additionally, CD248 has been shown to interact with Mac-2 Binding Protein, which may regulate repulsive signaling between epithelial and mesenchymal compartments of tumors, potentially influencing tumor metastasis (Becker2011CD248; juhasz2012murine). These interactions highlight CD248's role in modulating ECM interactions and cellular processes related to tumor growth and angiogenesis.
