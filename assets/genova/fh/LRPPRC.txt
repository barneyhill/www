# LRPPRC

## Overview
The LRPPRC gene encodes the leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein, which is primarily involved in mitochondrial RNA metabolism. This protein is characterized by its leucine-rich tandem repeats and is categorized as an RNA-binding protein due to its role in stabilizing and regulating mitochondrial mRNA. LRPPRC forms a complex with the stem-loop RNA-binding protein SLIRP, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial mRNA stability and promoting polyadenylation, thereby ensuring proper mitochondrial function (Siira2017LRPPRCmediated; Chujo2012LRPPRCSLIRP). The protein's function is vital for the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins, and its dysfunction is linked to various clinical conditions, including Leigh Syndrome French-Canadian type, a severe neurogenetic disorder (Sasarman2010LRPPRC; Piro2020Novel). Additionally, LRPPRC has been implicated in broader cellular processes, suggesting its integrative role across different cellular compartments (Liu2002Sequence).

## Structure
The LRPPRC protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains and motifs. It contains leucine-rich tandem repeats similar to PPR, TPR, and HEAT repeats, which are known for their role in RNA binding and processing (Liu2002Sequence). The primary structure of LRPPRC includes 23 tandem repeats, with a consensus sequence of LLxAYxxxGNVExAxxI, predicted to be 70% α-helical (Liu2002Sequence).

The secondary structure of LRPPRC is dominated by α-helices, forming a superhelical arrangement that facilitates RNA binding (Singh2024Structural). The tertiary structure is further defined by its interaction with other proteins, such as SLIRP, forming a complex that stabilizes mRNA in mitochondria (Singh2024Structural).

LRPPRC contains several functional domains, including Nuclear Export Signals (NES), an Epsin N-terminal Homology (ENTH) domain, a DUF28 domain, and a SEC1 domain, which are involved in various cellular processes such as vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal organization (Liu2002Sequence). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its function and stability (Sasarman2010LRPPRC).

## Function
The LRPPRC gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in mitochondrial RNA metabolism. LRPPRC is involved in the stabilization and regulation of mitochondrial mRNA, working in complex with SLIRP to prevent mRNA degradation and promote polyadenylation, which is crucial for mRNA stability and proper mitochondrial function (Chujo2012LRPPRCSLIRP). This complex binds to mitochondrial mRNAs, preventing their degradation by exonucleases such as PNPase and SUV3, and facilitates the polyadenylation process mediated by mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase (MTPAP) (Chujo2012LRPPRCSLIRP).

LRPPRC also acts as an RNA chaperone, binding to mitochondrial mRNAs and influencing their structure and stability, which is essential for the coordinated translation and stability of these mRNAs (Siira2017LRPPRCmediated). The protein is predominantly localized in mitochondria, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the steady-state levels of mitochondrial mRNAs, impacting cellular energy production and mitochondrial function (Chujo2012LRPPRCSLIRP; Mili2003LRP130). LRPPRC's function is vital for the proper translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins, and its loss can lead to significant disruptions in mitochondrial RNA structure and function (Siira2017LRPPRCmediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LRPPRC gene are primarily associated with Leigh Syndrome French-Canadian type (LSFC), a severe neurogenetic disorder characterized by cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency, particularly affecting the brain and liver. This condition is prevalent in the Saguenay-Lac-St Jean region of Quebec due to a founder effect, with a high carrier frequency and incidence rate (Piro2020Novel). LSFC manifests early in life with symptoms such as neonatal hypotonia, poor sucking, tremor, metabolic crises, and severe neurological impairments, including dystonia and seizures (Piro2020Novel). Mutations in LRPPRC, such as the common A354V substitution, lead to decreased protein expression and are linked to mitochondrial dysfunction (Mootha2003Identification).

The LRPPRC gene is also involved in mitochondrial RNA metabolism, where it stabilizes and translates mtDNA-encoded mRNAs. Mutations disrupt these processes, leading to reduced mitochondrial mRNA levels and impaired oxidative phosphorylation (Sasarman2010LRPPRC). Additionally, LRPPRC mutations can cause mitochondrial translation defects, affecting the assembly of COX and other mitochondrial complexes (Sasarman2010LRPPRC). Alterations in LRPPRC expression have been implicated in various cancers due to its role in mitochondrial gene expression and energy production (Siira2017LRPPRCmediated).

## Interactions
LRPPRC interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in mitochondrial gene expression and RNA metabolism. It forms a complex with SLIRP, a stem-loop RNA-binding protein, which is crucial for the stability and handling of mature mitochondrial mRNAs. This interaction is essential for posttranscriptional regulation in mitochondria, particularly in the context of diseases like Leigh Syndrome French-Canadian (LSFC) (Sasarman2010LRPPRC).

The LRPPRC/SLIRP complex binds extensively to mitochondrial mRNAs, promoting their polyadenylation and protecting them from degradation by enzymes such as PNPase and SUV3 helicase. This complex does not bind to poly(A) tails, indicating a specific interaction with mRNA coding regions (Chujo2012LRPPRCSLIRP). LRPPRC also interacts with mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase (MTPAP), facilitating the polyadenylation of mitochondrial mRNAs by preventing the formation of secondary structures at their 3' ends (Chujo2012LRPPRCSLIRP).

In addition to its mitochondrial roles, LRPPRC has been implicated in various cellular processes through its interactions with proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization, vesicular trafficking, and nucleocytosolic shuttling. These interactions suggest that LRPPRC may have integrative regulatory functions across different cellular compartments (Liu2002Sequence).
