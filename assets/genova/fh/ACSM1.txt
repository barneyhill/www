# ACSM1

## Overview
ACSM1, or acyl-CoA synthetase medium chain family member 1, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the activation of medium-chain fatty acids. This enzyme, categorized as a synthetase, plays a pivotal role in fatty acid metabolism by converting fatty acids into acyl-CoA thioesters, which are crucial intermediates for β-oxidation and energy production in mitochondria (Watkins2012Peroxisomal). Predominantly expressed in the liver, ACSM1 contributes to lipid homeostasis and energy balance by facilitating the breakdown of fatty acids (Watkins2012Peroxisomal). Beyond its metabolic functions, ACSM1 is implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Celis2009Molecular; Shrestha2022ACSM1).

## Function
ACSM1 (acyl-CoA synthetase medium chain family member 1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism by activating medium-chain fatty acids. This activation process involves converting fatty acids into acyl-CoA thioesters, which are essential for their subsequent degradation via β-oxidation in mitochondria (Watkins2012Peroxisomal). ACSM1 is primarily active in the liver, where it contributes to energy production and lipid homeostasis by facilitating the breakdown of fatty acids for energy (Watkins2012Peroxisomal).

In healthy human cells, ACSM1 is involved in the activation of medium-chain fatty acids, which are important substrates for various metabolic pathways, including lipid synthesis and energy production. The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular energy balance and supporting metabolic processes that rely on fatty acid oxidation (Watkins2012Peroxisomal). ACSM1's role in converting fatty acids into acyl-CoA thioesters also supports the synthesis of complex lipids and the elimination of xenobiotics, highlighting its importance in both lipid metabolism and detoxification processes (Watkins2012Peroxisomal).

## Clinical Significance
ACSM1 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression or mutations. In prostate cancer, ACSM1 is upregulated and plays a significant role in promoting tumor growth and survival by regulating fatty acid metabolism and constraining ferroptosis, a form of cell death. Its expression is regulated by the androgen receptor, and it is notably higher in malignant prostate tissues compared to non-malignant ones. Knockdown of ACSM1 in prostate cancer cell lines has been shown to suppress proliferation and increase cell death, indicating its role as a pro-survival factor (Shrestha2022ACSM1).

In breast cancer, specifically apocrine carcinoma, ACSM1 is part of an apocrine protein signature used to identify apocrine ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive apocrine carcinomas. The expression of ACSM1, along with other markers, helps classify lesions as apocrine in origin, although there is potential for loss of marker expression during tumor progression (Celis2009Molecular).

Additionally, ACSM1 has been linked to plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and possibly hypertension. It has also been identified as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia in genome-wide association studies, suggesting its involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders (Taiwo2020Approaches).
