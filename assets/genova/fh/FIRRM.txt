# FIRRM

## Overview
The FIRRM gene encodes the protein FIGNL1 interacting regulator of recombination and mitosis, which plays a crucial role in cellular processes related to DNA repair and cell division. This protein is involved in the regulation of homologous recombination, a critical mechanism for maintaining genomic stability by repairing double-strand breaks in DNA. FIRRM is also implicated in mitotic processes, ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein functions as a regulatory component, interacting with other proteins to modulate their activity in these pathways. Its precise role in these cellular mechanisms underscores its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and preventing genomic instability, which can lead to various diseases, including cancer (Qiu2020aarFDC).
