# MLLT6

## Overview
MLLT6 is a human gene that encodes the protein MLLT6, PHD finger containing, which is involved in various cellular processes, including gene regulation and chromatin remodeling. The protein is characterized by the presence of a PHD finger domain, which is often associated with chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation. MLLT6 has been implicated in oncogenic processes, particularly in breast cancer and leukemia, where it is involved in gene amplification and chromosomal rearrangements. In breast cancer, MLLT6 is frequently overexpressed and linked to the aberrant Wnt-signaling pathway, while in leukemia, it acts as a fusion partner in MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia, contributing to the disease's aggressiveness (Yokoyama2015Molecular; Willis2003Detailed). The protein's role in the DOT1L-H3K79 methyltransferase complex further underscores its importance in the regulation of gene expression and cancer pathogenesis (Chen2015Targeting).

## Clinical Significance
MLLT6, also known as AF17, is implicated in various cancers due to its gene amplification and overexpression. In breast cancer, MLLT6 is frequently amplified and overexpressed, particularly in the 17q12-23 region, suggesting a role in breast carcinogenesis. This gene is associated with the aberrant Wnt-signaling pathway, which is often observed in breast cancers (Willis2003Detailed). MLLT6 is also noted for its differential expression in HR+/HER2+ breast cancer patients, where it may influence survival outcomes and resistance to hormone therapy, although its impact is not statistically significant (Chen2019The).

In leukemia, MLLT6 is a fusion partner in MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These rearrangements are associated with aggressive forms of leukemia, contributing to oncogenesis by disrupting normal cellular functions (Yokoyama2015Molecular; Burillo‐Sanz2018MLL‐rearranged). MLLT6's involvement in the DOT1L-H3K79 methyltransferase complex suggests a role in the regulation of gene expression, which is crucial for leukemogenesis (Chen2015Targeting). These findings highlight MLLT6's significance in cancer biology, particularly in breast cancer and leukemia.
