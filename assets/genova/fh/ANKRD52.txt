# ANKRD52

## Overview
ANKRD52 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 52 protein, which is a member of the ankyrin repeat protein family. This protein is characterized by its multiple ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to its role as a regulatory subunit within the protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) holoenzyme. The ankyrin repeat domain 52 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and miRNA-mediated gene silencing. It plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by participating in the dephosphorylation of specific substrates, such as ASK3 and AGO2, which are essential for cellular responses to osmotic stress and miRNA silencing, respectively (Lee2021TAZ; Ohama2019The). Additionally, ANKRD52 has been implicated in cancer biology, acting as a tumor suppressor by modulating the activity of kinases like PAK1, thereby influencing cancer cell mobility and metastasis (Lee2021TAZ). The gene is also associated with anthropometric traits and the regulation of circular intronic RNAs, highlighting its diverse biological significance (Li2021Linking; Cho2021A).

## Structure
ANKRD52 is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains, which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. The protein contains 28 copies of the ankyrin motif, making it a member of the ankyrin repeat protein family. These repeats typically form a helix-loop-helix conformation, contributing to the secondary structure of the protein. The tertiary structure of ankyrin repeat proteins often resembles a solenoid-like shape, which facilitates versatile binding capabilities (Lee2021TAZ).

The quaternary structure of ANKRD52 involves its role as a regulatory subunit within the PP6 holoenzyme, which includes a catalytic subunit and other regulatory subunits. This integration is crucial for its function in recognizing and interacting with the PP6 holoenzyme (Lee2021TAZ).

While specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of ANKRD52 are not provided, its role as a regulatory subunit suggests it may undergo modifications that affect its interactions within the holoenzyme complex (Lee2021TAZ). The protein's ankyrin repeats are highly consistent in length, typically 30-33 amino acids, and include conserved motifs such as the tetrapeptide TPLH, which are important for stability and folding (Chakrabarty2022Sequence).

## Function
ANKRD52 is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes through its function as a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) holoenzyme. This holoenzyme is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and other cellular functions. ANKRD52, as part of the PP6 complex, is crucial for the dephosphorylation of specific substrates, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Lee2021TAZ; Stefansson2008Protein).

In healthy human cells, ANKRD52 is involved in the regulatory volume increase (RVI) process, which helps cells recover from osmotic stress. It forms a complex with PP6 to regulate the dephosphorylation of ASK3, a process vital for cell survival under hyperosmotic conditions (Ohama2019The). ANKRD52 also participates in miRNA-mediated regulation by forming a complex with PP6 to maintain the efficacy of miRNA silencing, which is necessary for the dephosphorylation of AGO2, a key protein in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (Ohama2019The).

ANKRD52 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular functions such as cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Its role as a regulatory subunit suggests it may modulate the activity of PP6, impacting processes like chromosome segregation and spindle assembly (Ohama2019The; Stefansson2008Protein).

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD52 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer. In lung adenocarcinomas, ANKRD52 functions as a tumor suppressor, and its expression is negatively regulated by the transcriptional co-regulator TAZ. Low levels of ANKRD52 are associated with increased phosphorylation of PAK1, a protein that promotes cancer cell mobility and tumor progression. This suggests that reduced ANKRD52 expression may contribute to cancer metastasis and poorer patient outcomes (Lee2021TAZ).

In addition to its role in cancer, ANKRD52 has been associated with anthropometric traits such as height and body mass index (BMI) in genome-wide association studies. These studies have identified genetic variants in ANKRD52 that correlate with these traits, suggesting a potential role in growth and development (Cho2021A).

The gene is also involved in the regulation of circular intronic RNAs (ciRNAs), specifically ci-ankrd52, which may play a role in transcriptional processes. Abnormal accumulation of ci-ankrd52 has been observed in certain conditions, although the clinical implications of this are not fully understood (Li2021Linking).

## Interactions
ANKRD52 is involved in several protein interactions, primarily through its role as a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) complex. It specifically associates with the PP6 catalytic subunit (PP6c) and the SAPS domain subunits, such as PP6R1, forming a stable complex that is predominantly cytoplasmic (Stefansson2008Protein). This complex is crucial for the dephosphorylation of various substrates, including PAK1, a kinase involved in cell mobility and cancer metastasis. ANKRD52 promotes the dephosphorylation of PAK1 through its interaction with the PP6c complex, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor by reducing cancer cell mobility and tumor progression (Lee2021TAZ).

ANKRD52 also interacts with Argonaute 2 (AGO2) in the context of miRNA-mediated gene silencing. It forms a complex with PP6 to dephosphorylate AGO2, which is essential for maintaining the efficacy of miRNA silencing and allowing AGO2 to engage new targets (Ohama2019The). This interaction is significant for regulating the IFNγ response and cancer cell recognition by T cells, as ANKRD52 mutations can impair the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, affecting immune responses (Song2021Tumor).
