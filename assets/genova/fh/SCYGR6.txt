# SCYGR6

## Overview
SCYGR6 is a gene that encodes the protein small cysteine and glycine repeat containing 6, which is characterized by its unique sequence of cysteine and glycine repeats. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions remain to be fully elucidated. It is categorized as a structural protein due to its repeat motifs, which suggest a role in maintaining cellular architecture or facilitating protein-protein interactions. The expression and regulation of SCYGR6, as well as its interactions with other cellular components, are areas of active research, with implications for understanding its potential roles in health and disease.
