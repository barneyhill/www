# ZNF112

## Overview
ZNF112 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 112, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can bind to DNA. These proteins are typically involved in transcriptional regulation, playing crucial roles in the control of gene expression. Zinc finger protein 112 is implicated in various cellular processes, including development and differentiation, by modulating the transcription of target genes. The specific functions and interactions of ZNF112 and its encoded protein are still under investigation, but they are believed to be significant in understanding the complex regulatory networks within the cell.
