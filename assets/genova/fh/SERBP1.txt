# SERBP1

## Overview
The SERBP1 gene encodes the SERPINE1 mRNA Binding Protein 1, a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. Unlike typical RNA-binding proteins, SERBP1 lacks conventional RNA-binding motifs and instead contains unique hyaluronic acid binding protein homology domains and RG/RGG repeats, which facilitate its interaction with RNA and its involvement in liquid-liquid phase separation (Baudin2021Structural). This protein is predominantly disordered, with specific structured regions that are conserved among vertebrates, highlighting their functional significance (Baudin2021Structural). SERBP1 is involved in translation regulation, ribosome biogenesis, stress response, and splicing regulation, interacting with numerous proteins and RNA molecules to modulate these processes (Breunig2024SERBP1). Clinically, alterations in SERBP1 expression are associated with various diseases, including glioblastoma and Alzheimer's disease, where it influences tumor growth and neurodegeneration, respectively (Breunig2024SERBP1; Kosti2020The).

## Structure
The SERBP1 protein, also known as SERPINE1 mRNA Binding Protein 1, is characterized by its intrinsic disorder and atypical RNA-binding properties. It lacks canonical RNA-binding motifs such as RNA-recognition motifs (RRM), zinc fingers, or K-homology (KH) domains. Instead, it contains two hyaluronic acid binding protein (HABP) homology domains, IHABP4 and HABP4, and two RG/RGG repeats crucial for RNA-binding and liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (Baudin2021Structural). The protein is predominantly disordered, with structured regions predicted around residues 5-80 and 270-360, which align with conserved sequences among vertebrates, indicating their functional importance (Baudin2021Structural).

The secondary structure includes a stable α-helix between residues 289-299, which may mediate homodimerization or act as a molecular recognition motif, although it does not participate in RNA binding (Baudin2021Structural). SERBP1 is monomeric and adopts a compact conformation under physiological conditions, as shown by size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation (Baudin2021Structural). The protein's interaction with RNA is mediated by the RGG boxes, which recognize G-rich RNA sequences, and this interaction is crucial for its role in mRNA regulation and phase separation (Baudin2021Structural).

## Function
SERBP1 (SERPINE1 mRNA binding protein 1) is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in translation regulation and ribosome biogenesis, interacting with ribosomal proteins and influencing translation initiation. SERBP1 can act as both a repressor and activator of translation, depending on the cellular context, such as enhancing CtIP mRNA translation during the S phase and repressing translation during mitosis via the PKCε pathway (Breunig2024SERBP1).

SERBP1 is also involved in stress responses, migrating to stress granules under stress conditions, and modulating translation. It interacts with the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex and CSDE1, participating in both cap-dependent and cap-independent translation (Breunig2024SERBP1). In ribosome biogenesis, SERBP1 binds to rRNA and snoRNAs, affecting pre-rRNA processing and modification, and interacts with proteins involved in rDNA transcription and the cohesin complex (Breunig2024SERBP1).

In addition to its role in translation and ribosome biogenesis, SERBP1 is involved in splicing regulation, cell division, and chromosome segregation. It interacts with PARP1 in PARylation-dependent protein complexes, influencing splicing and cell division processes (Breunig2024SERBP1). SERBP1's functions are dynamic and context-dependent, involving various pathways and interactions (Breunig2024SERBP1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the SERBP1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly glioblastoma (GBM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In glioblastoma, SERBP1 acts as an oncogenic factor, with high expression levels correlating with poor patient survival and response to therapy. Knockdown of SERBP1 in GBM cells leads to decreased tumor growth and affects cancer-relevant phenotypes, suggesting its role in maintaining glioma stem cell characteristics and influencing cancer metabolism and epigenetic regulation (Kosti2020The). SERBP1 is also linked to other cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer, where it is associated with cell migration, invasion, and metastasis (Kosti2020The).

In Alzheimer's disease, SERBP1 is found in Tau aggregates and stress granules, interacting with proteins like PARP1. Its increased expression in AD brains suggests a role in neurodegeneration, potentially through impaired ribosome biogenesis and translation (Breunig2024SERBP1). SERBP1's interactions with RNA-binding proteins involved in neurological disorders, such as FMR1 and SMN1, further indicate its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases and conditions affecting neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis (Breunig2024SERBP1).

## Interactions
SERBP1 (SERPINE1 mRNA Binding Protein 1) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with PARP1, an enzyme crucial for DNA repair and gene expression regulation. This interaction is enhanced by PARylation, a post-translational modification that SERBP1 undergoes, allowing it to bind to PAR and participate in PARylation-dependent protein complexes. These complexes are involved in splicing, cell division, and ribosome biogenesis (Breunig2024SERBP1).

SERBP1 also interacts with RNA-binding proteins such as FMR1, FXR1, FXR2, CAPRIN1, and SYNCRIP, which are involved in synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis (Baudin2021Structural). It binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit, indicating a role in translation regulation, and remains associated with ribosomes even after mRNA digestion, suggesting a stable interaction with the ribosomal subunit itself (Muto2018The).

In neuronal cells, SERBP1 interacts with the Argonaute2 (Ago2)/miR-92 complex, influencing the post-transcriptional regulation of the KCC2 gene, which is essential for neuronal function (Barbato2022Silencing). It also binds to G-rich RNA sequences, affecting its liquid-liquid phase separation propensity (Baudin2021Structural).
