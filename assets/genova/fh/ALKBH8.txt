# ALKBH8

## Overview
The ALKBH8 gene encodes the alkB homolog 8, a tRNA methyltransferase that plays a pivotal role in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules. This protein is a member of the ALKBH family and is characterized by its 2-oxoglutarate and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase domain and a methyltransferase domain, which are essential for its function in tRNA modification (Honda2024ALKBH8). The protein is primarily involved in the methylation of 5-carboxymethyluridine in tRNA, a modification crucial for the accurate translation of selenocysteine-containing proteins, which are vital for cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms (Endres2015Alkbh8; Leonardi2020The). ALKBH8's activity is linked to cellular responses to oxidative stress and is implicated in maintaining genomic stability. Mutations in the ALKBH8 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Saad2021Neurodevelopmental; Feng2022The).

## Structure
The ALKBH8 protein is characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It contains a 2-oxoglutarate and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase domain (2-OG domain) and a methyltransferase (MT) domain, which are crucial for its function in tRNA modification (Honda2024ALKBH8). The 2-OG domain is involved in demethylation processes, while the MT domain is responsible for methylating 5-carboxymethyluridine (cm5U) in tRNA (Honda2024ALKBH8). 

ALKBH8 also features an RNA recognition motif (RRM), which is highly conserved and consists of three α-helices and six β-sheets (Xu2020Multisubstrate). This motif is a putative nucleic acid binding fold found in many RNA-associated proteins (Fu2010Human). The protein's structure includes a central AlkB-like domain and a carboxy-terminal MTase domain, which requires the cofactor TRMT112 for its catalytic activity (Cavallin2022HITSCLIP).

The protein is the largest member of the ALKBH family and has unique features such as the presence of only two key loops, L3 and L4, which form an open cleft for substrate binding (Xu2020Multisubstrate). These structural elements contribute to its substrate specificity and enzymatic activity. ALKBH8 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, with some presence in the nucleus, and may shuttle between these locations (Fu2010Human).

## Function
The ALKBH8 gene encodes a tRNA methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules, specifically at the wobble uridine position. This modification is essential for the proper translation of selenocysteine-containing proteins, which are vital for detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining cellular redox homeostasis (Endres2015Alkbh8; Leonardi2020The). ALKBH8 catalyzes the formation of 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm5U) and 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U), modifications that are critical for the accurate decoding of genetic information during protein synthesis (Cavallin2022HITS-CLIP; Fu2010Human).

In healthy human cells, ALKBH8 is active in the cytoplasm, where it ensures the proper function of tRNAs, particularly those involved in the translation of stress-related proteins such as glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases. These proteins are key components of the antioxidant defense system, helping to protect cells from oxidative damage (Endres2015Alkbh8; Honda2024ALKBH8). The gene's activity is linked to the cellular response to oxidative stress, contributing to genomic stability and overall organismal health (Endres2015Alkbh8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALKBH8 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal recessive 71 (MRT71) syndrome. This condition is characterized by intellectual disability, global developmental delay, and various neurological symptoms. In an Egyptian family, a novel homozygous frame-shift variant in the ALKBH8 gene was associated with global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and structural brain anomalies such as cerebral volume loss and cerebellar vermian hypoplasia (Saad2021Neurodevelopmental). 

In other studies, recessive truncating mutations in ALKBH8 have been identified in consanguineous families, leading to intellectual disability and severe impairment of wobble uridine modification in tRNA. These mutations result in the absence of specific tRNA modifications, indicating a loss of function and highlighting the brain's sensitivity to impaired wobble modification (Monies2019Recessive).

Alterations in ALKBH8 expression have also been implicated in glioblastoma (GBM), where higher transcription levels of ALKBH8 are associated with shorter overall survival in patients. This suggests that ALKBH8 may play a role in GBM pathogenesis and could serve as a prognostic biomarker or therapeutic target (Feng2022The).

## Interactions
The human gene ALKBH8 encodes a tRNA methyltransferase that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. ALKBH8 is known to bind with high affinity to mature tRNAs, particularly those containing wobble uridine modifications, such as tRNA Glu (UUC) and tRNA Glu (CUC) (Cavallin2022HITS-CLIP). It also interacts with a range of non-coding RNAs, including C/D box snoRNAs and other ncRNAs like 7SK RNA and vault RNAs (Cavallin2022HITS-CLIP).

In terms of protein interactions, ALKBH8 forms complexes with the TRiC chaperonin, a large assembly required for folding numerous cytosolic substrates. This interaction is mediated by the methyltransferase domain of ALKBH8 (Fu2010Human). ALKBH8 also interacts with a low-molecular-mass protein termed human 'Trm112-like', which is involved in methylation processes (Fu2010Human). The interaction with Trm112 requires both the AlkB motif and the methyltransferase domain, suggesting a role in RNA modification (Fu2010Human).

These interactions highlight ALKBH8's role in RNA modification and its potential involvement in protein folding and cellular stress responses. The presence of mRNAs in the HITS-CLIP data set suggests unexpected interactions, although the functional significance of these remains to be fully understood (Cavallin2022HITS-CLIP).
