# DEFB106A

## Overview
DEFB106A is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 106A, which is part of the beta-defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides play a crucial role in the innate immune system by providing a first line of defense against a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses (Pazgier2006Human). The protein defensin beta 106A is characterized by its distinctive structural features, including six conserved cysteine residues that form three intramolecular disulfide bonds, contributing to its stability and functional integrity (Pazgier2006Human). The gene DEFB106A is expressed in various tissues, where it contributes to the host's immune response by disrupting the membrane integrity of invading microorganisms (Machado2015An). As a member of the beta-defensin family, defensin beta 106A is involved in modulating immune responses and may have additional roles in inflammation and wound healing (Pazgier2006Human).

## Structure
DEFB106A, a member of the beta-defensin family, is characterized by a primary structure that includes six conserved cysteine residues. These cysteines form three intramolecular disulfide bonds, which are crucial for the stability and folding of the protein (Pazgier2006Human). The secondary structure of DEFB106A is dominated by three β-strands arranged in an antiparallel sheet, a common feature among beta-defensins (Machado2015An). This arrangement is stabilized by the disulfide bridges, which are essential for maintaining the protein's structural integrity (Pazgier2006Human).

The tertiary structure of DEFB106A is described as having a 'defensin-like' topological fold, similar to other human beta-defensins, which includes a β-sheet stabilized by disulfide bridges (Pazgier2006Human). This structure allows for the accommodation of residues with varying properties, contributing to the functional diversity of the protein (Machado2015An). There is no specific information available on the quaternary structure of DEFB106A, as beta-defensins generally do not form quaternary structures (Pazgier2006Human). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as proteolytic processing, which are common in beta-defensins (Pazgier2006Human).
