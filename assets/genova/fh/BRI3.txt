# BRI3

## Overview
BRI3 is a gene that encodes the brain protein I3, a type II integral transmembrane glycoprotein predominantly expressed in the brain. The BRI3 protein is characterized by its involvement in neuronal differentiation and development, as well as its role in modulating amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, which is significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease. The protein contains a BRICHOS domain, which functions as a molecular chaperone to prevent protein misfolding and aggregation, thereby contributing to protein homeostasis in the brain. BRI3 interacts with various proteins, including APP and SCG10, influencing amyloid-beta production and stabilizing the microtubule network, respectively. These interactions highlight BRI3's potential impact on neurodegenerative processes and its clinical significance in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (Gong2008BRI3; Matsuda2009BRI3; Poska2020Recombinant).

## Structure
The BRI3 protein is a type II integral transmembrane glycoprotein encoded by the BRI3 gene, consisting of 267 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 30 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.47 (Vidal2001Sequence). The protein features a single transmembrane domain located between amino acids 58 and 80, with the C-terminal part being extracellular (Vidal2001Sequence). The BRI3 protein lacks a signal sequence for transport through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Vidal2001Sequence).

The BRICHOS domain of BRI3, spanning residues 112-230, is characterized by a central five-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices, similar to the BRICHOS domain of BRI2 (Poska2020Recombinant). This domain forms high molecular weight oligomers, which are crucial for its chaperone activity against protein aggregation (Poska2020Recombinant). The BRI3 BRICHOS domain also contains a disulfide bond, contributing to its structural stability (Poska2020Recombinant).

Post-translational modifications of BRI3 include a potential N-glycosylation site at asparagine 169 and phosphorylation sites at serine residues 30 and 54 (Vidal2001Sequence). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Vidal2001Sequence).

## Function
The BRI3 gene encodes a type II integral membrane protein predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a significant role in neuronal differentiation and development. BRI3 interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and acts as an endogenous negative regulator of amyloid-beta (Aβ) production, which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. It inhibits the cleavage of APP by secretases, thereby reducing the levels of Aβ peptides and APP intracellular domains (Matsuda2009BRI3). BRI3 specifically binds to mature APP, and its overexpression decreases the secretion of amyloidogenic peptides, suggesting a protective role in APP processing (Matsuda2009BRI3).

BRI3 also interacts with the microtubule-destabilizing protein SCG10, stabilizing the microtubule network and affecting neurite outgrowth, which indicates its involvement in modulating the cytoskeletal network and neuronal differentiation (Gong2008BRI3). Additionally, BRI3 contains a BRICHOS domain, which functions as a molecular chaperone to prevent protein misfolding and aggregation, further supporting its role in maintaining protein homeostasis in the brain (Poska2020Recombinant).

## Clinical Significance
BRI3 (brain protein I3) is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its interactions with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid β (Aβ) peptides. Alterations in BRI3 expression levels have been observed in AD patients, with decreased levels of the 30 kDa form of BRI3 in the hippocampus and temporal cortex compared to controls, suggesting a specific alteration in BRI3 processing in AD (Dolfe2018The). BRI3 is targeted for degradation by the NRBP1-containing CRL2/CRL4A complex, which increases amyloid β production by reducing the inhibitory effects of BRI3 on APP processing (Yasukawa2020NRBP1Containing). This degradation process is significant in the pathogenesis of AD, as BRI3, along with BRI2, inhibits amyloid β aggregation and promotes its clearance (Yasukawa2020NRBP1Containing).

BRI3's BRICHOS domain also plays a role in modulating Aβ interactions, although it is less effective than the Bri2 BRICHOS domain in inhibiting Aβ42 fibril formation (Dolfe2018The). The interaction of BRI3 with amyloid plaques in AD patients, but not in healthy controls, further underscores its clinical significance in neurodegenerative conditions (Dolfe2018The).

## Interactions
BRI3 interacts with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. It binds to the amyloid precursor protein (APP), specifically interacting with mature APP rather than its cleavage fragments, and influences APP processing by reducing amyloid-beta (Aβ) production (Matsuda2009BRI3). This interaction is specific to the juxtamembrane region of APP and does not involve other APP homologs like APLP2 (Matsuda2009BRI3). BRI3 also interacts with immature beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE), but not its mature form, suggesting a role in modulating APP processing indirectly (Matsuda2009BRI3).

BRI3 is a transcriptional target of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and interacts with IFITM3 and MGAT1, as identified through yeast two-hybrid screening. These interactions are stronger with the a-isoform of BRI3 and are confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization assays, indicating potential roles in cellular proliferation and development (AKİVA2018Identification).

BRI3 also interacts with NRBP1, which regulates its degradation, thereby influencing amyloid β production and APP processing (Yasukawa2020NRBP1Containing). These interactions highlight BRI3's involvement in critical cellular pathways and its potential impact on neurodegenerative processes.
