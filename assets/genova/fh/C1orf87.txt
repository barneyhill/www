# C1orf87

## Overview
C1orf87 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 87. This protein is associated with cilia-related functions and is part of expression cluster 49, which is linked to ciliated cells and cilium organization. The protein is predominantly expressed in ciliated cells, such as those found in the respiratory tract and reproductive system, and has been localized to the tips of cilia and ciliary rootlets. Although the precise molecular functions of the protein encoded by C1orf87 are not fully elucidated, its expression pattern suggests a significant role in the structural and functional maintenance of cilia, which are crucial for cellular processes like movement and signaling (Karlsson2022Genomewide). Additionally, C1orf87 has been implicated in various carcinomas, with alterations in its expression levels observed in different cancer types, indicating its potential involvement in tumorigenesis (Paula2014Mining).

## Structure


## Function
C1orf87 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes a protein involved in cilia-related functions. The protein is part of expression cluster 49, which is associated with ciliated cells and cilium organization. This cluster includes genes that are highly expressed in ciliated cells or cells with flagella, such as respiratory ciliated cells and spermatocytes. The presence of C1orf87 has been validated in ciliated cells and flagella through antibody-based profiling, confirming its localization on the tip of cilia and ciliary rootlets in fallopian tube and airway epithelia (Karlsson2022Genomewide).

The study of C1orf87 provides insights into its spatial expression in ciliated cells, suggesting its involvement in the structural or functional aspects of cilia. While the specific molecular activities of C1orf87 are not fully characterized, its expression pattern indicates a role in the organization and function of cilia, which are essential for various cellular processes, including movement and signaling. The gene's expression in specific cell types highlights its potential importance in maintaining the proper function of ciliated cells, contributing to the overall health and function of tissues where these cells are present (Karlsson2022Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
C1orf87, also known as the Carcinoma Related EF-Hand (CREF) gene, has been implicated in various carcinomas due to alterations in its expression levels. In breast and lung carcinomas, C1orf87 is downregulated, which suggests a potential tumor suppressor role, as indicated by the observation of loss of heterozygosity in 27% of tumors (Paula2014Mining). Conversely, the gene is upregulated in liver carcinomas compared to normal tissues, highlighting its complex role in cancer biology (Paula2014Mining).

Mutations in C1orf87 are present in 12% of lung tumor samples and 11% of breast tumor samples, indicating its involvement in these cancers (Paula2014Mining). The gene's expression is also altered in other cancers; its mRNA is upregulated in ovary, muscle, and bladder cancers, while protein expression is increased in liver, prostate, renal, and endometrial carcinomas (Paula2014Mining).

In the context of lung cancer, C1orf87 is downregulated in adenocarcinoma, potentially due to the lack of differentiation into ciliated cells, although the clinical significance of this observation remains unclear (Blackburn2017Quantitative). Additionally, C1orf87 is upregulated in brain metastatic small cell lung cancer, with a significant log fold change, though its clinical implications in this context are not fully understood (Namini2022Comparative).
