# GPATCH11

## Overview
GPATCH11 is a gene that encodes the protein G-patch domain containing 11, which is characterized by the presence of a G-patch domain known for its involvement in RNA binding and processing. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including RNA metabolism and cell division, due to its localization in the nucleus and association with structures involved in chromosome segregation, such as the kinetochore and centromere (Duek2018Exploring). GPATCH11 is the human ortholog of the yeast CMG1/YLR271W and is known to interact with the RNA helicase DHX15, suggesting a role in modulating RNA helicase activity and spliceosome regulation (Duek2018Exploring; Memet2024Insights). Mutations in GPATCH11 have been linked to clinical conditions such as early-onset retinal dystrophy and neurological impairments, highlighting its significance in human health (Perrault2023GPATCH11; Zanetti2023GPATCH11variants).

## Structure


## Function
GPATCH11 is a protein involved in RNA processing, characterized by the presence of a G-patch domain, which is known for its role in RNA binding and processing. This domain suggests that GPATCH11 may participate in the crosstalk between RNA processing machinery and kinetochore assembly, indicating a potential role in cell division (Duek2018Exploring). The protein is localized in the nucleus and at transient structures linked to chromosome segregation, such as the kinetochore and centromere, supporting its involvement in these cellular processes (Duek2018Exploring).

GPATCH11 is also identified as the ortholog of the yeast CMG1/YLR271W, which interacts with the helicase PRP43 to stimulate its RNA binding and ATPase activities. This interaction suggests that GPATCH11 might similarly interact with DHX15, the human ortholog of PRP43, potentially modulating its functions in RNA metabolism (Duek2018Exploring). The protein is expressed during ciliogenesis and is downregulated in primary ciliary dyskinesia bronchial tissues, indicating a possible role in cilia-related processes (Duek2018Exploring). These functions highlight GPATCH11's involvement in essential cellular activities, particularly those related to RNA processing and cell division.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GPATCH11 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily characterized by early-onset retinal dystrophy and neurological impairments. Individuals with biallelic mutations in GPATCH11 often present with severe visual dysfunction from birth, progressive retinal degeneration, and intellectual disabilities. These conditions may occur with or without seizures and skeletal anomalies (Perrault2023GPATCH11; Zanetti2023GPATCH11variants). 

The gene's variants lead to mis-splicing, which significantly impacts the expression of small nuclear RNAs, particularly U4 snRNA, resulting in retinal and neurological health issues. In mouse models, mutations analogous to human variants cause rapid retinal degeneration, memory impairment, and infertility, highlighting the gene's critical role in these processes (Perrault2023GPATCH11; Zanetti2023GPATCH11variants). 

Clinical features in affected individuals include intellectual disability, speech and walking delays, dyspraxia, and visual problems such as reduced visual acuity and hypermetropia. Electroretinography results are often flat, indicating significant retinal dysfunction. Some individuals also exhibit dysmorphic features and other systemic issues like short stature, encephalopathy, and diabetes (Perrault2023GPATCH11; Zanetti2023GPATCH11variants). 

These findings underscore the genetic and clinical heterogeneity associated with GPATCH11 mutations, emphasizing its role in autosomal recessive disease transmission (Perrault2023GPATCH11).

## Interactions
GPATCH11 is known to interact with the RNA helicase DHX15, a member of the DEAH/RHA family. This interaction was identified through immunoprecipitation experiments, which showed a 46.8-fold enrichment of DHX15 when co-precipitated with GPATCH11, indicating a strong association between the two proteins (Memet2024Insights). The interaction between GPATCH11 and DHX15 suggests that GPATCH11 may play a role in modulating the functions of DHX15, similar to how its yeast ortholog CMG1 interacts with PRP43 to stimulate RNA binding and ATPase activities (Duek2018Exploring).

GPATCH11 is also implicated in RNA metabolism and spliceosome regulation. It is associated with the spliceosome, particularly in the context of pre-mRNA splicing and transcriptional regulation. Mutations in GPATCH11 have been linked to splicing abnormalities, affecting the abundance of U4 and possibly U5 snRNA, which are components of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex crucial for splicing (Perrault2023GPATCH11; Zanetti2023GPATCH11variants). The protein's nuclear distribution pattern, characterized by nuclear speckles and a diffuse presence in the nucleoplasm, aligns with its role in the spliceosome (Perrault2023GPATCH11).
