# POLR1C

## Overview
The POLR1C gene encodes the RNA polymerase I and III subunit C, a critical component of the RNA polymerase complexes I and III, which are essential for the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and small RNAs, respectively. This protein plays a pivotal role in ribosome biogenesis and the synthesis of small RNAs, such as tRNA and 5S rRNA, which are vital for protein synthesis and various cellular processes. POLR1C is particularly significant in craniofacial development, as it is involved in the specification and migration of cranial neural crest cells. Mutations in POLR1C can lead to disorders such as Treacher Collins Syndrome and POLR3-related leukodystrophy, underscoring its importance in normal developmental and cellular functions (Lau2016Pathogenesis; Thiffault2015Recessive).

## Function
The POLR1C gene encodes a subunit of RNA polymerases I and III, which are essential for the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and other small RNAs in human cells. In healthy cells, POLR1C plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis, a process vital for protein synthesis and cellular function. RNA polymerase I is primarily responsible for the transcription of rRNA, a key component of ribosomes, while RNA polymerase III transcribes small RNAs, including tRNA and 5S rRNA, which are essential for protein synthesis and other cellular processes (Lau2016Pathogenesis; Thiffault2015Recessive).

POLR1C is active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to the assembly and function of RNA polymerases I and III, ensuring the proper transcription of rRNA and small RNAs necessary for cellular growth and development (Thiffault2015Recessive). The gene's function is particularly important in craniofacial development, as it is involved in the specification and migration of cranial neural crest cells, which are crucial for facial structure formation (Lau2016Pathogenesis). Disruptions in POLR1C function can lead to conditions such as Treacher Collins Syndrome, characterized by craniofacial malformations, highlighting its significance in normal developmental processes (Lau2016Pathogenesis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLR1C gene are associated with several distinct genetic disorders, primarily affecting the development and function of the nervous system and craniofacial structures. POLR1C mutations can lead to POLR3-related leukodystrophy, a type of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy characterized by hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. These mutations impair the assembly and nuclear import of RNA polymerase III, crucial for the transcription of tRNAs and other small non-coding RNAs, leading to decreased levels of certain tRNAs essential for central nervous system myelin development (Thiffault2015Recessive; Kraoua2019Novel).

POLR1C mutations are also implicated in Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS), a condition characterized by craniofacial deformities such as malar and mandibular hypoplasia, downward slanting of the palpebral fissures, and ear malformations. In TCS, POLR1C mutations affect the targeting of RNA polymerase I to the nucleolus, disrupting ribosome biogenesis (Thiffault2015Recessive; Ghesh2019Autosomal).

Additionally, novel POLR1C variants have been identified in cases of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, presenting with symptoms like severe myoclonus, dystonia, and cerebellar atrophy. These variants can lead to altered protein localization and splicing dysregulation, contributing to the disease phenotype (Kashiki2020POLR1C; Naseer2022NextGeneration).

## Interactions
POLR1C is a subunit shared by RNA polymerases I and III, which are crucial for the transcription of ribosomal RNA and small RNAs. It interacts with other subunits within these polymerase complexes, such as POLR1A and POLR1B in RNA polymerase I, and POLR3A and POLR3B in RNA polymerase III, facilitating transcription initiation and elongation. Studies have shown that mutations in POLR1C can impair the assembly and nuclear import of RNA polymerase III, leading to decreased binding to POLR3-transcribed genes. This is evidenced by reduced binding of mutated POLR1C variants to tRNA-Met genes compared to the wild type, as observed in chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) experiments (Thiffault2015Recessive).

The interactions of POLR1C with other proteins are also affected by specific mutations. For instance, the p.Asn32Ile (N32I) and p.Asn74Ser (N74S) mutations in POLR1C selectively impair the assembly of RNA polymerase III, as demonstrated by reduced co-purification of POLR3-specific subunits in proteomic analyses (Thiffault2015Recessive). These mutations do not affect the assembly of RNA polymerase I, highlighting the distinct roles of POLR1C in these complexes (Thiffault2015Recessive).
