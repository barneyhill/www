# CIMIP3

## Overview
CIMIP3 is a gene that encodes the protein ciliary microtubule inner protein 3, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of cilia. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of eukaryotic cells that are involved in movement and sensory functions. The protein encoded by CIMIP3 is categorized as a structural protein, specifically associated with the microtubule components of cilia. It is integral to the assembly and stability of the ciliary axoneme, the core structure of cilia, which is essential for their motility and signaling capabilities. Mutations or dysregulation of CIMIP3 can lead to ciliary dysfunction, which is implicated in a range of ciliopathies, disorders characterized by defects in cilia structure or function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
