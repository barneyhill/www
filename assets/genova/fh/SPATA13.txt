# SPATA13

## Overview
SPATA13, also known as spermatogenesis associated 13, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the context of eye physiology and pathology. The protein encoded by SPATA13 is characterized as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of Rho GTPase signaling pathways. These pathways are essential for cellular functions such as cytoskeletal remodeling, cell adhesion, and migration. SPATA13 is notably expressed in ocular tissues, including the iris, cornea, ciliary body, and retina, where it contributes to maintaining the contractile properties of cells involved in aqueous humor outflow, thus implicating it in the pathogenesis of primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) (Waseem2020Mutations). Beyond its ocular significance, SPATA13 has been linked to social behavior in animal models, suggesting its broader role in neurobehavioral functions (Bourbia2019The).

## Structure
The SPATA13 gene encodes a protein involved in cellular processes, particularly in the context of primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG). The protein is known to have several domains, including an adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-binding region (ABR), a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a Dbl homology (DH) domain, and a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. These domains are crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways, such as the Rho GTPase signaling pathway, which is important for cell adhesion, migration, and mitosis (Waseem2020Mutations).

SPATA13 produces multiple transcripts through alternative splicing, with two main isoforms being SP-1277 and SP-652. The SP-1277 isoform contains an additional 625 residues compared to SP-652 and is characterized by 16 intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), the longest being 157 residues. These IDRs are predicted to become more compact due to a 9 bp deletion, potentially affecting protein interactions (Waseem2020Mutations).

The protein localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with specific localization patterns during cell division. During interphase, SP-1277 shows granular nuclear signals, and during mitosis, it localizes to the equatorial region and kinetochore (Waseem2020Mutations).

## Function
The SPATA13 gene, also known as ASEF2, encodes a protein involved in the regulation of Rho GTPase signaling pathways, which are crucial for various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal remodeling, microtubule dynamics, gene transcription, and phospholipid metabolism (Waseem2020Mutations). Rho GTPases, regulated by RHO-GEFs, RHO-GAPs, and RHO-GDIs, play a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by switching between active and inactive states. SPATA13 variants have been shown to affect GEF activity, which is important for modulating the activity of Rho GTPases (Waseem2020Mutations).

In healthy human cells, SPATA13 is highly expressed in tissues such as the iris, cornea, ciliary body, and retina, which are involved in eye function (Waseem2020Mutations). The gene's role in regulating the Rho GTPase pathway suggests its involvement in maintaining the contractile properties of trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal cells, which are important for aqueous humor outflow in the eye (Waseem2020Mutations). Additionally, SPATA13 may play a role in cell adhesion and migration, as a proportion of its protein product is found in the cytoplasm even in dividing cells, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the blood-aqueous barrier (Waseem2020Mutations). The gene's involvement in these pathways indicates its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and tissue homeostasis in the eye (Waseem2020Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPATA13 gene have been implicated in the development of primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), a significant cause of blindness worldwide. A specific 9 bp deletion in SPATA13 has been associated with PACG, showing variable expression and reduced penetrance among affected individuals. This mutation is believed to alter protein interactions and affect cellular processes such as mitosis and cytoskeletal reorganization, which are crucial in the pathogenesis of PACG (Waseem2020Mutations). The SP-1277 isoform of SPATA13, in particular, has been shown to have lower guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity, which can be further altered by mutations, potentially impacting cell adhesion and migration (Waseem2020Mutations).

In addition to its role in eye diseases, SPATA13 has been studied for its influence on social behavior and nocturnal activity in mice. Knockout studies have shown that loss of SPATA13 affects social dominance, suggesting a role in social hierarchy dynamics (Bourbia2019The). These findings indicate that alterations in SPATA13 expression or mutations may have broader implications for neurobehavioral functions and mental health conditions.

## Interactions
SPATA13, also known as spermatogenesis associated 13, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. SPATA13 interacts with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein through its adenomatous polyposis coli-binding region (ABR) and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. This interaction activates SPATA13's guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity, which is essential for mediating downstream cellular events such as cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration (Waseem2020Mutations). 

SPATA13 also interacts with Rho GTPases, particularly RAC1, influencing cell adhesion, migration, and mitosis. Mutations in SPATA13, such as the SP-1277 variant, can alter its RAC1-dependent GEF activity, impacting these cellular processes and potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) (Waseem2020Mutations). 

Additionally, SPATA13 is known to interact with PLEKHA7, a protein with GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity. PLEKHA7 is involved in maintaining the integrity of the blood aqueous barrier and affects actin cytoskeleton organization, which is significant in the context of PACG (Waseem2020Mutations). These interactions highlight SPATA13's role in regulating cellular dynamics and its potential implications in disease mechanisms.
