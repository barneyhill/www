# DPF3

## Overview
DPF3, or double PHD fingers 3, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the BRM/BRG1-associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex. This protein is categorized as a zinc finger protein and is a member of the D4 protein family, characterized by its distinct structural domains, including a Krüppel-like C2H2 zinc finger and two C-terminal PHD zinc fingers. The DPF3 gene produces two isoforms, DPF3a and DPF3b, which differ in their structural composition and functional roles. DPF3a is primarily involved in myogenic differentiation and cardiac gene transcription, while DPF3b plays a role in binding acetylated or methylated lysine residues on histone tails, facilitating chromatin remodeling. The expression of DPF3 is notably significant in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, where it contributes to muscle development and function. Clinically, alterations in DPF3 expression are associated with cardiac hypertrophy and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Cui2015Phosphorylation; Lange2008Regulation; Cui2022The).

## Structure
The DPF3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the BRM/BRG1-associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex. It is a zinc finger protein and a member of the D4 protein family, characterized by several domains: an N-terminal 2/3 domain, a Krüppel-like C2H2 zinc finger, and two C-terminal PHD zinc fingers (PHD-1 and PHD-2) (Leyder2022Unveiling). DPF3 exists in two isoforms, DPF3a and DPF3b, which differ in their C-terminal regions. DPF3b contains three zinc finger domains, while DPF3a has a single truncated PHD zinc finger followed by a C-terminal domain (Leyder2022Unveiling; Lange2008Regulation).

Both isoforms are intrinsically disordered proteins with a high disorder content and lack a hydrophobic core, making them prone to aggregate into amyloid fibrils. DPF3b forms antiparallel β-sheets, while DPF3a forms α-helix intermediates before rearranging into β-sheets (Leyder2022Unveiling; Mignon2022Structural). The molecular mass of DPF3b is 43.08 kDa, consisting of 378 amino acids, whereas DPF3a has a molecular mass of 40.24 kDa and consists of 357 amino acids (Leyder2022Unveiling). DPF3b can bind to acetylated or methylated lysine residues on histone tails, facilitating the recruitment of the BAF complex, while DPF3a is involved in myogenic differentiation and cardiac gene transcription (Mignon2022Structural; Lange2008Regulation).

## Function
The DPF3 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. DPF3 contains PHD finger domains that enable it to bind to acetylated and methylated lysine residues on histones, particularly histones 3 and 4. This binding facilitates the recruitment of the BAF complex to specific genomic sites, influencing transcriptional activation or repression (Lange2008Regulation).

DPF3 is expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues and is involved in muscle development and function. It acts as a tissue-specific anchor between histone modifications and the BAF complex, directing chromatin remodeling activities essential for muscle fiber organization and cardiac function (Lange2008Regulation). In healthy human cells, DPF3a interacts with transcriptional repressors like HEY1, and this interaction is modulated by phosphorylation, which is important for cardiac hypertrophy and gene expression regulation (Cui2015Phosphorylation).

DPF3's role in muscle development is further highlighted by its regulation by the transcription factor Mef2a, which binds to the DPF3 promoter and activates its expression, ensuring proper muscle structure and function (Lange2008Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the DPF3 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In the context of cardiac health, DPF3 is significantly upregulated in hypertrophic hearts, particularly in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis. This upregulation is associated with pathological cardiac hypertrophy, where DPF3a interacts with transcriptional repressors HEY, leading to the activation of fetal genes involved in hypertrophy (Cui2015Phosphorylation). DPF3 is also upregulated in the right ventricular myocardium of patients with Tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect, suggesting its role in cardiac development and disease (Cui2015Phosphorylation; Lange2008Regulation).

In cancer, particularly clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the DPF3a isoform is upregulated in metastatic tumors, promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration. This suggests a role in tumor metastasis and highlights DPF3a as a potential therapeutic target in ccRCC (Cui2022The). The gene's involvement in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation underscores its significance in both cardiac and cancer pathologies.

## Interactions
DPF3, particularly its isoform DPF3a, is involved in various protein-protein interactions as part of its role in chromatin remodeling. DPF3a is a component of the BRG1-associated factor (BAF) complex, where it acts as a hub for protein-protein interactions due to its intrinsically disordered nature (Mignon2021Revealing). It interacts with all subunits of the casein kinase 2 (CK2) complex, including CK2α, CK2α', and CK2β, and is phosphorylated by CK2, which is crucial for its function in cardiac hypertrophy (Cui2015Phosphorylation).

DPF3a also interacts with the HEY family of transcriptional repressors, particularly HEY1, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This interaction is important for the regulation of gene expression during cardiac hypertrophy (Cui2015Phosphorylation). In muscle differentiation, DPF3a interacts with HRP2, which is necessary for recruiting the BAF complex to specific genomic regions, influencing gene expression (Zhu2020HRP2–DPF3a–BAF).

In the context of cancer, DPF3a interacts with SNIP1, a SMAD nuclear-interacting protein, modulating TGF-β signaling in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Cui2022The). These interactions highlight DPF3a's role in various physiological and pathological processes through its involvement in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation.
