# KIF23

## Overview
KIF23 is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin family member 23, a motor protein that plays a pivotal role in cytokinesis, the final stage of cell division. As a member of the kinesin superfamily, KIF23 is characterized by its motor domain, which facilitates ATP binding and microtubule interaction, enabling its function as a plus-end-directed motor enzyme. The protein is a crucial component of the centralspindlin complex, essential for the formation of the central spindle and midbody during mitosis. KIF23's activity is tightly regulated through post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by Aurora B kinase, and its expression is controlled in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The gene's mutations and altered expression have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia type III and several cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Fischer2013p53; Liljeholm2013Congenital; Li2022Kinesin).

## Structure
KIF23, also known as mitotic kinesin-like protein 1 (MKLP1), is a motor protein involved in cytokinesis. It is part of the kinesin superfamily and contains a conserved motor domain at its N-terminus, which binds ATP and microtubules, facilitating its motor function (Liljeholm2013Congenital). The protein also has a coiled-coil domain in the middle, which is predicted to aid in dimerization, and a C-terminal tail domain that plays a role in cargo binding and regulation (Liljeholm2013Congenital).

KIF23 exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing. The full-length isoform includes exon 18 and encodes a 960 amino acid protein, while the D18 isoform lacks exon 18, resulting in an 856 amino acid protein. A novel transcript lacking both exons 17 and 18 has also been identified (Liljeholm2013Congenital). These isoforms are expressed in a tissue-dependent manner.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate KIF23's activity. For instance, phosphorylation by Aurora B kinase is involved in releasing centralspindlin, a complex that includes KIF23, from an inactive state (Liljeholm2013Congenital). The protein's function and stability are also influenced by ubiquitination, which is mediated by TRAF6 and is crucial for the degradation of midbody ring derivatives during cytokinesis (Isakson2013TRAF6).

## Function
KIF23, also known as kinesin family member 23, is a motor protein that plays a critical role in cytokinesis, the final step of cell division. It is a component of the centralspindlin complex, which is essential for the proper formation of the central spindle and midbody during cell division. KIF23 functions by cross-bridging antiparallel microtubules and driving their movement, particularly during the late stages of mitosis, facilitating the separation of daughter cells (Fischer2013p53; Liljeholm2013Congenital).

KIF23 is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, with its expression peaking in the G2/M phase. This regulation is controlled through a cell cycle-dependent element (CDE) and/or a cell cycle genes homology region (CHR) in its promoter, with the DREAM and MMB complexes playing key roles in this process (Fischer2013p53). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it localizes to the interzone of mitotic spindles, acting as a plus-end-directed motor enzyme (Fischer2013p53).

Phosphorylation of KIF23 by Aurora B kinase at the S911 site is crucial for its function in cytokinesis, ensuring its proper localization to the central spindle and midbody (Neef2006Cooperation). This spatial regulation of protein phosphorylation is vital for successful cell division, highlighting KIF23's essential role in maintaining genomic stability (Neef2006Cooperation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KIF23 gene have significant clinical implications. A specific mutation, c.2747C>G (p.P916R), in the KIF23 gene is linked to Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia type III (CDA III), a rare hereditary disease characterized by large multinucleated erythroblasts in the bone marrow. This mutation leads to cytokinesis failure, resulting in binucleated cells, which are a hallmark of CDA III (Liljeholm2013Congenital). The mutation has been identified in both Swedish and American families, indicating it is not population-specific (Liljeholm2013Congenital).

KIF23 is also implicated in various cancers. Overexpression of KIF23 is observed in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it is associated with genomic amplifications rather than activating mutations (Vikberg2017Mutation). In gliomas, high KIF23 expression correlates with higher tumor grades and poor survival outcomes (Zhao2021Mutation). Similarly, in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), KIF23 is upregulated and linked to poor prognosis, promoting cancer progression through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Li2022Kinesin). These findings suggest that KIF23 plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and could serve as a potential therapeutic target in these cancers.

## Interactions
KIF23, a member of the kinesin family, is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It interacts with PRC1, a microtubule-associated protein that regulates cytokinesis, forming a complex that localizes to the spindle midzone during mitosis and is highly enriched at the midbody during cytokinesis (Liu2020KIF23). KIF23 also interacts with Amer1, a protein involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction occurs within the membrane localization and APC-binding domains of Amer1, interfering with Amer1's ability to bind to APC and negatively regulate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Liu2020KIF23).

In the context of cytokinesis, KIF23 is ubiquitinated by TRAF6, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is essential for the degradation of midbody ring derivatives through selective autophagy. This process involves the formation of a complex with SQSTM1 and WDFY3, which are necessary for the clearance of these structures (Isakson2013TRAF6). These interactions highlight KIF23's role in both cell division and signaling pathways, contributing to its function in cancer progression and cellular proliferation.
