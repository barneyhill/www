# CLYBL

## Overview
The CLYBL gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme citramalyl-CoA lyase, which is involved in unique metabolic pathways within human cells. This enzyme exhibits malate synthase and β-methylmalate synthase activities, marking a novel discovery in human biochemistry as these activities were previously attributed only to plants and lower organisms (Strittmatter2013CLYBL). Citramalyl-CoA lyase is categorized as a member of the HpcH/HpaI aldolase/citrate lyase family and is characterized by a (β/α)8 TIM barrel fold, a structural motif common among enzymes that facilitate various biochemical reactions (Strittmatter2013CLYBL). The enzyme's function is crucial for alternative carbon assimilation pathways, potentially aiding in biomass accumulation from lipids without carbon loss (Strittmatter2013CLYBL). Additionally, CLYBL is implicated in vitamin B12 metabolism, with its expression notably high in brown fat and kidney tissues, suggesting a specialized role in these organs (Strittmatter2013CLYBL). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with vitamin B12 levels, where certain polymorphisms can lead to reduced circulating B12, highlighting its potential impact on human health (Strittmatter2013CLYBL).

## Structure
The CLYBL protein is a human mitochondrial enzyme with a length of 340 amino acids, featuring a canonical amino-terminus mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) and a Pfam domain from the HpcH/HpaI aldolase/citrate lyase family (Strittmatter2013CLYBL). Structurally, CLYBL adopts a (β/α)8 TIM barrel fold, a common structure among enzymes like malate synthases, which includes substrate-binding sites formed by loops connecting β-strands and α-helices (Strittmatter2013CLYBL). The catalytic center involves Mg2+ coordinated by substrate oxygen atoms, Glu171, Asp206, and water molecules, with Glu75 and Asp76 stabilizing the complex. Arg107 is crucial for substrate positioning through hydrogen bonds (Strittmatter2013CLYBL).

CLYBL lacks a C-terminal extension found in other malate synthases, which may contribute to its lower catalytic activity (Strittmatter2013CLYBL). The protein is missing a large C-terminal domain present in other malate synthase enzymes, including a conserved aspartate residue critical for catalytic activity, suggesting it may require intermolecular interactions within an oligomeric structure to function properly (Strittmatter2013CLYBL). Asp320 is tentatively identified as the plausible catalytic residue (Strittmatter2013CLYBL). The protein's expression is particularly high in brown fat and is strongly co-expressed with members of the mitochondrial B12 pathway (Strittmatter2013CLYBL).

## Function
The CLYBL gene encodes a human mitochondrial enzyme with malate synthase and β-methylmalate synthase activities, marking the first time such activities have been attributed to a human protein (Strittmatter2013CLYBL). This enzyme is involved in converting glyoxylate and acetyl-CoA to malate, and glyoxylate and propionyl-CoA to β-methylmalate, processes typically associated with the glyoxylate shunt in plants and lower organisms (Strittmatter2013CLYBL). CLYBL's enzymatic activities suggest it could participate in alternative carbon assimilation pathways, potentially contributing to biomass accumulation from lipids without carbon loss (Strittmatter2013CLYBL).

CLYBL is expressed in the mitochondria of all mammalian organs, with the highest expression in brown fat and kidney, indicating a role in specific tissues (Strittmatter2013CLYBL). The enzyme's activity is dependent on divalent cations, with magnesium being essential for its function (Strittmatter2013CLYBL). CLYBL is also linked to vitamin B12 metabolism, as it is co-expressed with mitochondrial B12 pathway members, and its loss-of-function polymorphism is associated with low B12 levels in plasma (Strittmatter2013CLYBL). This suggests a potential role in mitochondrial B12 metabolism, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Strittmatter2013CLYBL).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLYBL gene, particularly a polymorphism resulting in a premature stop codon, are associated with significantly reduced levels of circulating vitamin B12. This polymorphism leads to a truncated protein and has been shown to have the largest effect on B12 levels among studied SNPs, especially in Chinese men who are homozygous for the stop codon, resulting in a three-fold reduction in B12 levels (Strittmatter2013CLYBL). The loss-of-function mutation, identified as rs41281112, changes Arg259 to a premature stop codon, affecting CLYBL expression and leading to reduced mRNA and protein levels (Strittmatter2013CLYBL).

The CLYBL gene is also implicated in the itaconate degradation pathway, where its loss of activity can lead to the accumulation of itaconyl-CoA, impairing mitochondrial coenzyme B12 metabolism. This genetic variation is common in East Asians, Europeans, Latinos, and South Asians, but rare in Africans, and may influence susceptibility to bacterial infections and the metabolism of itaconate (Cordes2021Exploring). Despite these associations, the broader role of CLYBL in human physiology and its connection to vitamin B12 metabolism is not fully understood, and further research is needed to elucidate its clinical significance (Strittmatter2013CLYBL).
