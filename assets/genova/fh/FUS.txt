# FUS

## Overview
The FUS gene encodes the FUS RNA binding protein, a multifunctional protein that belongs to the FET family of RNA-binding proteins. This protein is characterized by its involvement in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including transcriptional regulation, RNA splicing, and mRNA transport. Structurally, the FUS protein contains several domains that facilitate its interaction with RNA, such as the RNA recognition motif (RRM), zinc finger (ZnF) domain, and arginine/glycine-rich regions (RGG domains) (Ozdilek2017Intrinsically). Functionally, FUS is predominantly nuclear, where it plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with RNA polymerase II and influencing the phosphorylation state of its C-terminal domain (Masuda2016FUS‐mediated). Additionally, FUS is implicated in the regulation of alternative splicing and the translation of localized mRNAs, which is essential for proper neuronal function (Yasuda2013The; Masuda2016FUS‐mediated). Clinically, mutations in the FUS gene are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), where they contribute to disease pathogenesis through mechanisms involving both loss of nuclear function and toxic cytoplasmic aggregation (LópezErauskin2018ALSFTDLinked; Chen2021FUS).

## Structure
The FUS RNA binding protein is part of the FET protein family and is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several domains contributing to its RNA binding properties. The primary structure of FUS includes an N-terminal low complexity (LC) domain and five putative RNA binding domains (RBDs): an RNA recognition motif (RRM), a zinc finger (ZnF) domain, and three arginine/glycine-rich regions (RGG1, RGG2, and RGG3) (Ozdilek2017Intrinsically). The RRM and ZnF domains are structured and can fold independently, although they do not bind RNA with high affinity on their own. The RGG/RG domains, which are intrinsically disordered, enhance the RNA binding affinity of the RRM and ZnF domains through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding (Ozdilek2017Intrinsically).

The secondary structure of FUS involves alpha helices and beta sheets, as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Ozdilek2017Intrinsically). The tertiary structure is formed by the interaction of these domains to create a functional RNA binding protein, although specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided in the context (Ozdilek2017Intrinsically).

FUS undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and methylation, which can influence its function and interactions. The protein is known to oligomerize along RNA, forming large RNA-rich granules, and is involved in RNA-dependent phase separation, which is crucial for its cellular activities (Ganser2024The; Ozdilek2017Intrinsically).

## Function
The FUS RNA binding protein plays a crucial role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is predominantly located in the nucleus, where it is involved in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing, including pre-mRNA splicing and polyadenylation (Masuda2016FUS‐mediated). FUS interacts with RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), particularly affecting the phosphorylation state of its C-terminal domain, which is essential for transcription elongation and RNA processing (Schwartz2012FUS; Masuda2016FUS‐mediated). 

FUS also regulates alternative splicing by interacting with the spliceosome and various splicing factors, influencing the inclusion or exclusion of exons in mRNA transcripts (Ishigaki2012Positiondependent; Masuda2016FUS‐mediated). It binds to specific RNA motifs and structural features, although it exhibits limited sequence specificity, suggesting a broad impact on the neuronal transcriptome (Nakaya2013FUS; Masuda2016FUS‐mediated).

In addition to its nuclear functions, FUS is involved in the translation of localized mRNAs within cell protrusions, promoting efficient translation in these regions (Yasuda2013The). This multifaceted role of FUS in RNA metabolism is critical for maintaining proper neuronal function and development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FUS gene are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). In ALS, FUS mutations are associated with both familial and sporadic cases, with a higher prevalence in juvenile ALS (JALS) where they are considered a common pathogenic factor (Chen2021FUS). These mutations often occur in the nuclear localization signal (NLS) region, leading to cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of the FUS protein, which contributes to neuronal toxicity and disease progression (Chen2021FUS; Sproviero2012FUS).

In FTLD, FUS mutations are less common but still significant, with some cases showing cognitive dysfunction alongside motor neuron disease (Ishigaki2018Importance). The pathogenic mechanisms involve both a loss of normal nuclear function and a gain of toxic function due to cytoplasmic accumulation (Ishigaki2018Importance; LópezErauskin2018ALSFTDLinked).

FUS mutations can also affect RNA processing and protein homeostasis, leading to increased aggregation and altered subcellular localization, which are critical factors in the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative conditions (Deng2014The).

## Interactions
The FUS RNA binding protein is involved in numerous interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids, playing a critical role in RNA processing and transcription regulation. FUS interacts with TAF15 and EWSR1, members of the same family of RNA-binding proteins, in a manner independent of RNA, suggesting simultaneous RNA binding by FUS and TAF15 (Kapeli2017Genetic). It also associates with the TFIID complex and RNA polymerase II, promoting transcriptional activation (Kapeli2017Genetic). FUS is a binding partner of TDP-43, a relationship necessary for mediating HDAC6 expression (Kapeli2017Genetic).

FUS interacts with several splicing factors, including YB-1, U1C, SR, and SF1, and is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing (Nakaya2013FUS; Kapeli2017Genetic). It binds to RNA primarily through its RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain, with a preference for AU-rich stem-loop structures and GGU or GUGGU motifs (Kapeli2017Genetic). FUS also participates in phase separation, driven by its RNA binding domain (RBD) and modulated by its low complexity domain (LCD), which affects droplet size and dynamics (Ganser2024The). These interactions highlight FUS's role in a network of RNA-binding proteins that regulate RNA processing and transcription.
