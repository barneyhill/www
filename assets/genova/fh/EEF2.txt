# EEF2

## Overview
The EEF2 gene encodes the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2), a critical GTPase protein involved in the elongation phase of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. Located on chromosome 19 in humans, EEF2 plays a pivotal role in facilitating the translocation of the ribosome along mRNA, which is essential for the addition of amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain (Kaul2011Eukaryotic). The protein's function is regulated by phosphorylation, a process that modulates its activity in response to cellular energy status and various physiological cues (Hizli2013Phosphorylation; Browne2002Regulation). Structurally, eEF2 is a monomeric protein with a mass of 95.2 kDa, consisting of 857 amino acids, and it undergoes unique post-translational modifications that are crucial for its function and interaction with ribosomal subunits (Pellegrino2018Structural; Kaul2011Eukaryotic). EEF2's interactions with other proteins, such as the HIV-1 Gag protein and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2 (CPEB2), underscore its multifaceted role in cellular regulation and viral pathogenesis (ValienteEcheverría2014eEF2; Chen2011CPEB2-eEF2). Variants in the EEF2 gene have been implicated in neurological disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Hekman2012A; Oji2009Overexpression).

## Structure
The eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (EEF2) is a monomeric protein with a mass of 95.2 kDa, consisting of 857 amino acid residues. It is located in the cytoplasm and encoded by a gene on Chromosome 19 in humans (Kaul2011Eukaryotic). Structurally, EEF2 contains six domains (I-VI) and is homologous to bacterial EF2 and archaeal aEF2. The protein is organized into three structural blocks: domains I-II, domain III, and domain IV-V, which can move relative to each other (Merrill2006The; Kaul2011Eukaryotic). 

EEF2 features a GTP-binding motif towards the N-terminus, essential for ribosome binding and function (Kaul2011Eukaryotic). The protein undergoes a unique post-translational modification where a histidine residue (His-715) is converted into diphthamide, which is crucial for ADP-ribosylation by diphtheria toxin (Pellegrino2018Structural; Kaul2011Eukaryotic). This modification is important for maintaining mRNA reading-frame fidelity during translation (Pellegrino2018Structural).

The tertiary structure of EEF2 includes dynamic conformational changes, particularly during GTP hydrolysis, which are necessary for its role in ribosomal translocation (Merrill2006The; Taylor2007Structures). The protein's domains interact with both the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, facilitating the translocation of tRNA and mRNA (Spahn2004Domain).

## Function
The eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (EEF2) is a critical protein involved in the elongation phase of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. It facilitates the translocation of the ribosome along mRNA, allowing for the addition of amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain. EEF2 is a GTPase, meaning it binds and hydrolyzes GTP, which is essential for its function in translocation. This activity is crucial for the movement of tRNA and mRNA within the ribosome, ensuring the proper delivery and positioning of tRNA on the ribosome (Hizli2013Phosphorylation; Kaul2011Eukaryotic).

In healthy human cells, EEF2 is regulated by phosphorylation, which inhibits its function by preventing ribosome binding. This regulation is mediated by EEF2 kinase, which is activated in a calcium/calmodulin-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of EEF2 is a key mechanism for controlling protein synthesis, especially in response to cellular energy status and various physiological cues (Hizli2013Phosphorylation; Browne2002Regulation). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is encoded by a gene on chromosome 19 in humans (Kaul2011Eukaryotic). EEF2's function is essential for maintaining translational fidelity and allowing rapid resumption of translation when conditions improve (Browne2002Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EEF2 gene are associated with several neurological disorders. Variants in EEF2 have been linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 26 (SCA26), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cerebellar atrophy and Purkinje cell degeneration. The P596H variant in EEF2 disrupts translational fidelity, leading to increased ribosomal frameshift read-through and greater susceptibility to proteostatic disruption, contributing to the pathogenesis of SCA26 (Hekman2012A). This mutation affects the ability of eEF2 to maintain the correct reading frame during translation, potentially leading to neurodegenerative processes (Hekman2012A).

De novo variants in EEF2 have also been identified in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), characterized by motor delay, macrocephaly with ventriculomegaly, and other structural brain anomalies. These variants alter cellular growth and translational fidelity, with specific variants showing different effects on translational processes (Nabais2020De). The study suggests that EEF2 variants can cause a broader spectrum of neurological disorders, including childhood-onset NDDs and benign external hydrocephalus (Nabais2020De).

In cancer, eEF2 is overexpressed in gastric and colorectal cancers, contributing to cancer progression by enhancing cell growth and promoting G2/M cell cycle progression (Oji2009Overexpression).

## Interactions
EEF2 (eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2) is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. EEF2 interacts with the HIV-1 Gag protein, which is crucial for preventing stress granule (SG) assembly during HIV-1 infection. This interaction helps the virus evade the host's stress response, thereby facilitating viral replication. The interaction between EEF2 and Gag is largely RNA-independent and is stabilized by Cyclophilin A (CypA) (ValienteEcheverría2014eEF2).

EEF2 also interacts with the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2 (CPEB2), which modulates the elongation phase of mRNA translation. CPEB2 binds to EEF2, inhibiting eEF2/ribosome-activated GTP hydrolysis, thereby slowing down peptide elongation. This interaction is particularly important in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) RNA translation (Chen2011CPEB2-eEF2).

Additionally, EEF2 forms a stable complex with the p53 protein in the cytoplasm, as demonstrated in Clone 2 cells. This interaction is stable under various conditions, including different NaCl concentrations, and involves the binding of EEF2 to p53 (Yin2003Cytoplasmic). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of EEF2 in cellular regulation and viral pathogenesis.
