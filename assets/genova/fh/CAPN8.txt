# CAPN8

## Overview
CAPN8 is a gene that encodes the protein calpain 8, a member of the calpain family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases. Calpain 8 is predominantly expressed in the gastric surface mucus cells of the stomach, where it plays a critical role in gastric mucosal defense. Unlike other calpains, calpain 8 can function independently of the conventional regulatory subunit, forming homo-oligomers and a heterodimeric complex with calpain 9, known as G-calpain. This complex is essential for protecting the gastric mucosa from injury by facilitating processes such as mucus secretion and cell migration. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms with distinct structural features, and its expression and mutations have been linked to various gastrointestinal disorders and cancer (Hata2010Calpain; Lan2021Comprehensive).

## Structure
CAPN8, also known as calpain 8, is a member of the calpain family of Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases. The protein structure includes a regulatory N-terminal domain, a protease domain composed of sub-domains IIa and IIb, a C2-like Ca2+/phospholipid-binding domain, and a penta-EF-hand (PEF) domain (Hata2010Calpain). CAPN8 is unique in that it can be active without the CAPNS1 regulatory subunit and forms a homo-oligomer when expressed alone (Hata2010Calpain). 

The gene encoding CAPN8 undergoes alternative splicing, producing isoforms with and without the 5EF-hand domain, a feature unique to this gene in mammals (Hata2001Both). The primary structure of CAPN8 is highly conserved between species, with the mouse and rat orthologues showing high similarity (Hata2001Both). 

CAPN8 forms a heterodimeric complex with CAPN9, known as G-calpain, which is involved in gastric mucosal defense. In this complex, CAPN8 plays a catalytic role, while CAPN9 serves a regulatory function (Hata2016A). The interaction between CAPN8 and CAPN9 is crucial for their stability and activity, highlighting the importance of their quaternary structure in physiological functions (Hata2010Calpain).

## Function
Calpain 8 (CAPN8) is a calcium-dependent cysteine protease predominantly expressed in the gastric surface mucus cells of the stomach. It plays a crucial role in gastric mucosal defense by forming a protease complex with calpain 9, known as G-calpain. This complex is essential for protecting the gastric mucosa from injury induced by external stresses, such as ethanol, by facilitating processes like mucus secretion and pit cell migration (Hata2010Calpain; Sorimachi2011Impact). 

CAPN8 is involved in membrane trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, which is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis in gastric cells (Hata2010Calpain). It exhibits Ca2+-dependent activity without the need for the conventional calpain regulatory subunit, forming homo-oligomers through C2-like domains, which suggests a unique regulatory mechanism (Hata2007Stomachspecific). 

In vivo, CAPN8 forms a hybrid heterodimer with CAPN9, and disruption of either gene in mice leads to increased susceptibility to gastric ulcers, highlighting its role in maintaining gastric health (Ono2012Calpains). CAPN8's activity is crucial for the stability and proteolytic function of the G-calpain complex, which is necessary for the gastric mucosal defense and restitution (Hata2010Calpain).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CAPN8 gene have been implicated in various gastrointestinal disorders. CAPN8, along with CAPN9, forms a protease complex known as G-calpain, which plays a crucial role in gastric mucosal defense. Mutations in CAPN8 can lead to increased susceptibility to stress-induced gastropathies, such as those caused by alcohol, due to compromised proteolytic activity (Hata2010Calpain). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CAPN8, such as A136V, may reduce its proteolytic function, potentially increasing the risk of gastric mucosal diseases (Hata2010Calpain).

In the context of cancer, CAPN8 has been found to be overexpressed in pancreatic cancer tissues, with its expression levels correlating with advanced tumor stages. This overexpression is associated with poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival, suggesting that CAPN8 may serve as a prognostic biomarker in pancreatic cancer (Lan2021Comprehensive). The dysregulation of CAPN8 in these conditions highlights its potential role in tumor progression and its significance as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CAPN8, or calpain 8, is known to form a protease complex with calpain 9, known as G-calpain, which is involved in gastric mucosal defense. This complex is a heterodimer consisting of one molecule each of CAPN8 and CAPN9, with a total molecular weight of approximately 180 kDa. The formation of this complex is crucial for its proteolytic activity, which is essential for stress-induced gastric mucosal protection (Hata2010Calpain; Hata2016A). 

CAPN8 and CAPN9 are interdependent at the protein level, as demonstrated by the significant decrease in calpain 9 levels in Capn8 knockout mice, and vice versa. This interdependence suggests that CAPN8 and CAPN9 act as molecular chaperones for each other, similar to the role of CAPNS1 for calpain 2 (Hata2010Calpain). 

CAPN8 is also involved in vesicle trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, although specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Hata2010Calpain). The physiological significance of CAPN8 forming homo-oligomers when expressed without calpain 9 remains unclear (Hata2010Calpain).
