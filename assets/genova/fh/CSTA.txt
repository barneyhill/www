# CSTA

## Overview
CSTA is a gene that encodes the protein cystatin A, a member of the cystatin superfamily, which functions primarily as a cysteine protease inhibitor. Cystatin A plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of the epidermis by inhibiting proteolytic enzymes such as cathepsins, thereby protecting cellular components from degradation (Gupta2015Cell). The protein is predominantly expressed in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis and is integral to the formation of the cornified cell envelope, contributing to cell-cell adhesion and the epidermal barrier's resilience (Blaydon2011Mutations). Beyond its dermatological functions, cystatin A is also involved in regulating platelet activation and thrombus formation, particularly under metabolic stress conditions (Mezzapesa2019Increased). Mutations in the CSTA gene are linked to skin disorders such as autosomal recessive exfoliative ichthyosis and have implications in various cancers, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and prognosis (Wang2021Decreased; Blaydon2011Mutations).

## Structure
Cystatin A (CSTA) is a member of the cystatin superfamily, characterized by its role as a cysteine protease inhibitor. The primary structure of CSTA consists of approximately 100 amino acid residues, forming a single polypeptide chain without disulfide bonds or carbohydrate moieties (Nandy2017A; Turk2008Cystatins:). The secondary structure of CSTA includes a five-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet with a propeller twist, embraced by an alpha-helix (Jenko2003Crystal). This configuration contributes to its wedge-shaped molecular structure, which is typical of cystatins (Turk2008Cystatins:).

The tertiary structure of CSTA is compact and stable, allowing it to effectively inhibit papain-like cysteine proteases by binding tightly to their active sites (Turk2008Cystatins:). CSTA functions as a monomer, lacking a quaternary structure (Nandy2017A). The protein's N-terminal region is particularly important for its inhibitory function, forming a hook-like structure that interacts with target enzymes (Jenko2003Crystal).

Post-translational modifications of CSTA include phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions (Nandy2017A). The gene encoding CSTA can undergo mutations that affect its structure and function, as seen in conditions like exfoliative ichthyosis (Blaydon2011Mutations).

## Function
Cystatin A (CSTA) is a cysteine protease inhibitor that plays a crucial role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. In healthy human cells, CSTA is involved in the formation of the cornified cell envelope, contributing to the structural stability of the skin by inhibiting proteolytic enzymes such as cathepsins B, H, and L (Gupta2015Cell; Blaydon2011Mutations). This inhibition is essential for protecting cytoplasmic and cytoskeletal proteins from degradation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and tissue integrity (Gupta2015Cell).

CSTA is primarily localized in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis, with the strongest expression in the granular layer, where it plays a significant role in cell-cell adhesion, particularly under mechanical stress (Blaydon2011Mutations). The protein is also found in the cytoplasm and is a component of the cornified cell envelope in the upper skin layers, where it helps inhibit exogenous proteases that could compromise the epidermal barrier (Blaydon2011Mutations).

CSTA's role extends beyond the skin, as it is expressed in megakaryocytes and platelets, where it regulates platelet activation and thrombus formation, particularly under conditions of metabolic stress such as obesity and diabetes (Mezzapesa2019Increased).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CSTA gene, which encodes cystatin A, are implicated in several skin disorders and cancers. Autosomal recessive exfoliative ichthyosis (AREI) is a rare skin condition caused by loss-of-function mutations in CSTA. This condition is characterized by congenital erythroderma, hyperhidrosis, and diffuse hyperkeratosis with palmoplantar skin peeling. A novel homozygous mutation, c.172C>T (p.Arg58Ter), results in the absence of cystatin A in the epidermis, leading to epidermal barrier abnormalities and reduced cell-cell adhesion (MoosbruggerMartinz2015Epidermal; Blaydon2011Mutations).

In cancer, decreased expression of CSTA is associated with poor prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), promoting lymphatic metastasis and correlating with lower overall survival rates (Wang2021Decreased). Conversely, CSTA expression is variable across different cancers, being upregulated in some, such as lung and breast cancers, and downregulated in others, like gastric carcinoma (Gupta2015Cell; Bilodeau2009Analysis).

CSTA is also linked to psoriasis, where specific polymorphisms in the gene are associated with increased disease risk, particularly in individuals carrying the HLA-Cw6 risk allele (Vasilopoulos2008Association).

## Interactions
Cystatin A (CSTA) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion and skin integrity. It interacts with desmoglein 2 (Dsg2), a protein involved in cell adhesion. This interaction is significant in maintaining desmosomal structures, as evidenced by increased cell fragmentation when both CSTA and Dsg2 are knocked down, indicating a synergistic role in cell adhesion (Gupta2015Cell). CSTA also affects the localization of Dsg2 and other proteins involved in cell adhesion, suggesting a regulatory pathway involving these proteins (Gupta2015Cell).

CSTA is a cysteine protease inhibitor that interacts with cathepsins, inhibiting their protease activity. This interaction is crucial for protecting cells from proteolytic damage and maintaining the structural integrity of the skin (Gupta2015Cell). In the context of exfoliative ichthyosis, CSTA's role in cell-cell adhesion is highlighted by its involvement in maintaining desmosome-mediated adhesion, with its deficiency leading to significant adhesion defects (Blaydon2011Mutations).

CSTA is also involved in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, which are crucial for cancer progression, as it is upregulated by transcriptional factor III A (GTF3A) in colorectal cancer (Wang2022Transcriptional).
