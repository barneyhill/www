# PRICKLE1

## Overview
PRICKLE1 is a gene that encodes the prickle planar cell polarity protein 1, a key component of the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, including cell movement, orientation, and differentiation, particularly within the central nervous system and skeletal development. As a cytoplasmic protein, prickle planar cell polarity protein 1 interacts with several other proteins, such as Dishevelled proteins and small GTPases, to regulate cellular dynamics and signaling pathways like Wnt/β-catenin and Hedgehog. These interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular polarity and function, impacting processes such as neural tube closure, craniofacial development, and osteoblast differentiation. Mutations in the PRICKLE1 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, including progressive myoclonus epilepsy-ataxia syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal development and disease (Wan2018Prickle1; Liu2013Prickle1; Bassuk2008A).

## Structure


## Function
PRICKLE1 is a crucial component of the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell movement and orientation. In healthy human cells, PRICKLE1 is involved in the regulation of neuronal morphogenesis, particularly in axonal and dendritic development. It is expressed in specific cell populations within the central nervous system, such as pyramidal neurons in the cortex and starburst amacrine cells in the retina, but not in retinal ganglion cells or Muller glia (Liu2013Prickle1).

PRICKLE1 plays a significant role in the differentiation and migration of osteoblasts, particularly in the frontal bone, by regulating signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and Hedgehog. This regulation is crucial for proper osteoblast differentiation and craniofacial development (Wan2018Prickle1). In the cochlea, PRICKLE1 is involved in the growth of neurites in spiral ganglion neurons, which are responsible for innervating outer hair cells, although it does not affect hair cell polarity (Yang2017Prickle1).

PRICKLE1's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and development, impacting overall organismal outcomes such as neural tube closure and craniofacial structure formation (Radaszkiewicz2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRICKLE1 gene are associated with several neurological disorders. One significant condition linked to PRICKLE1 mutations is autosomal-recessive progressive myoclonus epilepsy-ataxia syndrome. This disorder is characterized by myoclonic seizures, generalized convulsive seizures, and neurological decline, including ataxia and mild cognitive impairment. The mutation disrupts the interaction between PRICKLE1 and the neural gene regulator REST, affecting neuronal gene regulation (Bassuk2008A).

PRICKLE1 mutations are also implicated in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). These mutations can disrupt synaptic homeostasis by affecting the interaction between PRICKLE1 and SYNAPSIN I, a protein involved in synaptogenesis and synaptic vesicle formation. This disruption may contribute to ASD and potentially link it to epilepsy (Paemka2013PRICKLE1).

In addition, PRICKLE1 mutations have been associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by developmental arrest and various seizure types. A case study highlighted a novel PRICKLE1 mutation in a young boy, whose seizures were partially responsive to a combination of medications (Mastrangelo2018PRICKLE1‐related).

These findings underscore the critical role of PRICKLE1 in neurological pathologies, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for these conditions.

## Interactions
PRICKLE1 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with Dishevelled proteins (DVL2 and DVL3), which are core components of the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. This interaction is essential for maintaining chondrocyte polarity during endochondral ossification. The Prickle1 Bj mutation disrupts these interactions, leading to defects in limb and craniofacial morphology due to altered Wnt/PCP signaling (Wan2020Chondrocyte).

PRICKLE1 also interacts with small GTPases like RhoA and Rac1, which are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cell migration speed and directionality. It forms a complex with the Arh-gap21/23 complex to inhibit RhoA activity in lamellipodia, affecting cell migration (Radaszkiewicz2023The).

In the context of focal adhesion dynamics, PRICKLE1 interacts with CLASPs and PHLDB2 (LL5β), which are essential for microtubule stability and focal adhesion turnover. These interactions are crucial for PRICKLE1's role in cell migration and polarization, as it promotes focal adhesion disassembly in cooperation with the CLASP-LL5β complex (Lim2016Prickle1).
