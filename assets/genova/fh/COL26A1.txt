# COL26A1

## Overview
The COL26A1 gene encodes the collagen type XXVI alpha 1 chain, a unique member of the collagen protein family involved in the extracellular matrix. Unlike typical collagens, this protein is characterized by its small size and the presence of only two short collagenous domains, lacking the extensive Gly-X-Y repeating sequences that are common in other collagen types (Onursal2021Collagen). Although it does not fit neatly into established collagen categories, type XXVI collagen shares some structural similarities with type VI collagen, particularly in forming beaded microfilaments (Onursal2021Collagen). The protein is implicated in maintaining tissue integrity and function, with potential roles in bone plasticity and other physiological processes (Caso2017Interindividual). Despite its structural uniqueness, the precise molecular functions and clinical significance of COL26A1 remain areas of active research.

## Structure
The COL26A1 gene encodes the collagen type XXVI alpha 1 chain, a protein involved in the extracellular matrix. This protein is noted for its unique structural characteristics compared to other collagens. It is described as being uncharacteristically small, comprising only two very short collagenous domains, which is atypical for collagen proteins (Onursal2021Collagen). These domains are part of the protein's primary structure, which lacks the extensive Gly-X-Y repeating sequences commonly found in other collagens.

Type XXVI collagen is sometimes mentioned in the context of beaded-filament-forming collagens, although it does not fit neatly into this or any other specific collagen category (Onursal2021Collagen). The supramolecular assembly of type XXVI collagen shares similarities with type VI collagen, forming characteristic beaded microfilaments in the extracellular matrix (Onursal2021Collagen).

The protein's secondary and tertiary structures are not well-documented, and there is no specific information on its quaternary structure. Post-translational modifications typical of collagens, such as hydroxylation and glycosylation, are likely but not specifically detailed for COL26A1. The protein's role and structural uniqueness suggest potential significance in bone plasticity and related conditions (Caso2017Interindividual).

## Function
COL26A1 encodes the collagen type XXVI alpha 1 chain, a protein that plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of extracellular matrices. Collagens, including COL26A1, are essential for providing tissue strength and elasticity. They are involved in various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation, which are crucial for the development and maintenance of tissues. The expression of COL26A1 is tissue-specific, indicating its specialized roles in certain tissues. By contributing to the extracellular matrix, COL26A1 supports the structural framework that cells require for proper function and interaction. This structural support is vital for the physiological processes that ensure tissue resilience and repair. The precise molecular activities of COL26A1 within the cell, including its interactions with other matrix components, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The COL26A1 gene has been implicated in various health conditions through its altered expression and potential genetic variations. In African Americans, the expression of COL26A1 is associated with West African ancestry and has been linked to diseases such as cardiovascular and renal diseases, as well as drug response variability. This association suggests that genetic and epigenetic differences in the liver, influenced by ancestry, may contribute to the disproportionate impact of certain chronic diseases in this population (Park2018Uncovering).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, COL26A1 is among the down-regulated genes in circulating classical monocytes, indicating its involvement in the inflammatory processes characteristic of RA (Sales2023Transcriptomic). Additionally, in a study on psoriasiform skin inflammation in mice, the downregulation of Col26a1 was observed, although the primary focus was on CARD14 mutations (Sundberg2019Gain).

Despite these associations, the functional role of COL26A1 in disease remains not well understood, and further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance. The gene has not been functionally characterized in detail, and its role in specific diseases is still under investigation (Kember2015Copy).
