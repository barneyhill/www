# CCL23

## Overview
CCL23, or C-C motif chemokine ligand 23, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the CC chemokine subfamily, which plays a pivotal role in immune system regulation. The protein encoded by CCL23 is involved in the chemotactic migration of immune cells, such as monocytes and dendritic cells, to sites of inflammation or injury, primarily through its interaction with the CCR1 and FPRL1 receptors (Hwang2005Human; ArrudaSilva2017Human). The gene undergoes alternative splicing to produce different isoforms, notably CCL23α and CCL23β, with the latter containing a unique SHAAG domain that enhances its activity on the FPRL1 receptor (Miao2007Proinflammatory). CCL23 is also implicated in processes such as angiogenesis and the modulation of myeloid progenitor cell proliferation, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological and pathological conditions (Hwang2005Human; Shih2005CCL23myeloid).

## Structure
The CCL23 gene encodes a chemokine that exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, notably CCL23α and CCL23β. CCL23α is a 99-residue protein, while CCL23β is a 116-residue variant that includes an additional 18-residue peptide sequence, known as the SHAAG domain, replacing the Arg 25 residue of CCL23α (Miao2007Proinflammatory). The SHAAG domain is critical for the activity of CCL23β on the FPRL1 receptor, a feature that distinguishes it from other chemokines (Miao2007Proinflammatory).

The primary structure of CCL23β includes a 24-amino acid inhibitory N-terminal domain and a 75-amino acid chemokine domain. Proteolytic processing by proinflammatory proteases removes the inhibitory N-terminal domain, activating the protein's functions (Miao2007Proinflammatory). The SHAAG domain is essential for FPRL1 activity, with its N-terminal methionine being crucial for potency (Miao2007Proinflammatory).

The tertiary and quaternary structures of CCL23 are not detailed in the available context, but the presence of conserved cysteines suggests potential disulfide bonds that could influence the protein's folding and stability (Miao2007Proinflammatory). The CCL23 protein is involved in immune responses, particularly through its interaction with CCR1 and FPRL1 receptors.

## Function
CCL23, also known as C-C motif chemokine ligand 23, is a member of the CC chemokine subfamily that primarily interacts with the CCR1 receptor. It plays a significant role in the regulation of immune responses by influencing the migration and differentiation of various cell types. CCL23 is involved in the chemotactic migration of monocytes, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells, guiding these cells to sites of inflammation or injury (Hwang2005Human; ArrudaSilva2017Human). 

In endothelial cells, CCL23 promotes angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, by inducing cell migration through the CCR1 receptor. This process is crucial for wound healing and tissue regeneration (Hwang2005Human). CCL23 also affects myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, where it inhibits their proliferation and release, potentially protecting these cells during chemotherapy by slowing their turnover (Shih2005CCL23myeloid).

CCL23 is produced by neutrophils and monocytes in response to specific stimuli, such as pro-inflammatory agonists, and is involved in early stages of inflammation and immune responses (ArrudaSilva2017Human). Its activity is mediated through a signaling pathway involving the Gi/Go protein, phospholipase C, and protein kinase C delta, which are crucial for its chemotactic effects (Kim2010CKβ8CCL23).

## Clinical Significance
The CCL23 gene has been implicated in various diseases, primarily through alterations in its expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CCL23 expression is significantly downregulated compared to normal liver tissue. This reduction is associated with poor prognosis, as patients with lower CCL23 levels have a median survival of 27.57 months compared to 82.87 months for those with higher levels. The loss of CCL23 may contribute to oncogenesis by impairing the recruitment of leukocytes to the tumor site, thus facilitating immune evasion by tumor cells (Karan2021CCL23).

In the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), polymorphisms in the CCL23 gene have been studied for potential associations with the disease. Although specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CCL23, such as CCL23 316C and CCL23 -289A>C, showed transmission distortion in certain subgroups of MS patients, these findings were not statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons (Bugeja2006An). Despite these observations, the role of CCL23 in MS remains uncertain, and further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance in this context (Bugeja2006An).

## Interactions
CCL23, also known as C-C motif chemokine ligand 23, interacts primarily with chemokine receptors CCR1 and FPRL1. The protein exists in different forms, such as CCL23α and CCL23β, which are produced through alternative splicing. These forms are processed by proinflammatory proteases, enhancing their activity and enabling them to interact with specific receptors. The processed form CCL23β Δ24 is a potent ligand for both CCR1 and FPRL1, facilitating immune cell migration and activation (Miao2007Proinflammatory).

The SHAAGtide peptide, derived from CCL23, is a high-affinity ligand for FPRL1 and acts as a strong attractant for monocytes and neutrophils. This peptide is significantly more potent than other natural agents acting on FPRL1, highlighting its role in immune response modulation (Miao2007Proinflammatory). The SHAAG domain within CCL23β is crucial for FPRL1 activity, while the C-terminal chemokine domain is essential for CCR1 interaction (Miao2007Proinflammatory).

CCL23's interactions with these receptors suggest its involvement in linking innate and adaptive immunity, although the context does not mention direct interactions with nucleic acids (Miao2007Proinflammatory).
