# NOL11

## Overview
NOL11 is a gene that encodes the nucleolar protein 11, a crucial component involved in ribosome biogenesis. This protein is categorized as a nucleolar protein and plays a significant role in the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) within the small subunit (SSU) processome, which is essential for the maturation of the small ribosomal subunit 18S rRNA. NOL11 is localized in the nucleolus and is integral to maintaining nucleolar integrity and optimal rDNA transcription. The protein interacts with other components of the SSU processome, such as hUTP4/Cirhin, and is involved in pre-rRNA transcription and processing. Mutations or disruptions in NOL11 have been linked to various developmental disorders, including craniofacial abnormalities and North American Indian childhood cirrhosis, highlighting its importance in cellular and developmental processes (Baserga2013NOL11; Griffin2015The; Sondalle2014Human).

## Function
NOL11 is a nucleolar protein that plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis in human cells. It is a component of the small subunit (SSU) processome, which is involved in the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) necessary for the maturation of the small ribosomal subunit 18S rRNA (Baserga2013NOL11). NOL11 localizes to the nucleolus and pseudo-nucleolar organizing regions, and its localization is influenced by RNA polymerase I transcription activity (Baserga2013NOL11).

NOL11 interacts with hUTP4/Cirhin and is associated with the human t-UTP subcomplex, suggesting its involvement in pre-rRNA transcription and processing (Baserga2013NOL11). Knockdown experiments in HeLa cells have shown that NOL11 is essential for the proper processing of pre-rRNA at specific cleavage sites, and its depletion leads to the accumulation of unprocessed pre-rRNA intermediates (Baserga2013NOL11). This indicates that NOL11 is crucial for optimal rDNA transcription and maintaining normal nucleolar morphology (Baserga2013NOL11).

The interaction between NOL11 and hUTP4/Cirhin is important for the proper subcellular localization of hUTP4/Cirhin, and mutations affecting this interaction can lead to defects in ribosome biogenesis (Baserga2013NOL11). Overall, NOL11 is essential for the transcription and processing of pre-rRNA, nucleolar integrity, and ribosome biogenesis in healthy human cells (Baserga2013NOL11).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NOL11 gene have been implicated in several developmental disorders and conditions. NOL11 is crucial for ribosome biogenesis, and its dysfunction can lead to craniofacial abnormalities. In Xenopus models, knockdown of NOL11 results in significant craniofacial defects, such as microcephaly and malformed craniofacial cartilages, due to increased apoptosis in cranial neural crest cells (Griffin2015The). These defects are associated with increased p53 levels, indicating a nucleolar stress response (Griffin2015The).

NOL11 has also been linked to North American Indian childhood cirrhosis (NAIC), a rare autosomal recessive disease. This condition is associated with mutations in the CIRH1A gene, which encodes a protein that interacts with NOL11, suggesting that disruptions in this interaction may contribute to the disease (Sondalle2014Human).

Additionally, a genome-wide association study identified a rare variant in the NOL11 gene associated with tooth agenesis, specifically the agenesis of maxillary second premolars, highlighting its potential role in dental development disorders (Jonsson2018Rare). These findings underscore the clinical significance of NOL11 in various developmental anomalies.

## Interactions
NOL11 is a nucleolar protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in pre-rRNA transcription and processing. It interacts with hUTP4/Cirhin, a protein implicated in North American Indian childhood cirrhosis (NAIC). This interaction is crucial for the nucleolar localization of hUTP4/Cirhin, as mutations in hUTP4/Cirhin that reduce its interaction with NOL11 lead to improper localization and are associated with NAIC (Baserga2013NOL11).

NOL11 is part of a complex with other t-UTP subcomplex members, including hUTP5, hUTP15, and hUTP17, indicating its role in the SSU processome, which is essential for the maturation of the small ribosomal subunit 18S rRNA (Baserga2013NOL11). It also associates with fibrillarin, a component of the SSU processome, and this association is dependent on RNA polymerase I transcription (Baserga2013NOL11).

In Xenopus tropicalis, NOL11 is essential for craniofacial development, and its depletion leads to increased p53 levels, indicating a nucleolar stress response. This suggests that NOL11's interactions are not only crucial for ribosome biogenesis but also for maintaining cellular homeostasis during development (Griffin2015The).
