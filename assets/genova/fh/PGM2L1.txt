# PGM2L1

## Overview
PGM2L1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphoglucomutase 2 like 1, which is involved in sugar metabolism, particularly in the synthesis of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate and other sugar bisphosphates. This enzyme is predominantly expressed in the brain and plays a crucial role in regulating sugar metabolism by influencing the activity of various phosphomutases and enzymes such as hexokinase, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and phosphofructokinase (Morava2021Impaired). Despite its significant role in maintaining glucose-1,6-bisphosphate levels, PGM2L1 deficiency does not impair the formation of nucleotide diphosphate sugars or protein glycosylation, indicating a complex regulatory function in energy metabolism (Morava2021Impaired). The gene has also been implicated in various cancers and neurological research, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Liu2021A; Sun2022Identification).

## Function
PGM2L1 (phosphoglucomutase 2 like 1) is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate and other sugar bisphosphates in human cells. This enzyme plays a crucial role in sugar metabolism, particularly in the brain, where it is predominantly expressed (Morava2021Impaired). PGM2L1 significantly increases the concentration of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate, which is essential for the activation of phosphomutases involved in the synthesis of nucleotide diphosphate (NDP) sugars, although its deficiency does not affect NDP-sugar levels or protein glycosylation (Morava2021Impaired).

The enzyme's activity is critical for maintaining normal levels of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate, which can inhibit hexokinase and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase while stimulating phosphofructokinase, suggesting a regulatory role in sugar metabolism (Morava2021Impaired). Despite its deficiency leading to a significant reduction in glucose-1,6-bisphosphate, the concentration remains above the threshold required for phosphoglucomutase activation, indicating that PGM2L1 deficiency does not impair the formation of UDP-glucose or other NDP-sugars (Morava2021Impaired). The regulation of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate degradation by inosine monophosphate (IMP) suggests a role in energy metabolism, particularly during energy shortages (Morava2021Impaired).

## Clinical Significance
PGM2L1 has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression and genetic alterations influencing cancer prognosis. High expression of PGM2L1 is associated with a high survival rate in thyroid cancer, but a low survival rate in hepatocellular carcinoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and mesothelioma (Liu2021A). The gene shows multiple copy number amplifications in cancers such as bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast cancer, esophageal cancer, head and neck cancer, lung squamous-cell carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, and sarcoma (Liu2021A). PGM2L1 also exhibits higher mutation frequencies in breast cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer cell lines (Liu2021A).

In addition to its role in cancer, PGM2L1 has been identified as a key gene in Alzheimer's disease research, although it was not among the final feature genes associated with the disease (Sun2022Identification). The gene's high expression in the prefrontal cortex suggests a potential role in brain function, which might be relevant in neurological contexts (Muenks2017Sequencestructure). Despite these associations, specific diseases directly resulting from PGM2L1 mutations or expression alterations are not well-documented, indicating a need for further research to fully understand its clinical significance.
