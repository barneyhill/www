# ETS2

## Overview
ETS2 is a gene that encodes the ETS proto-oncogene 2, a transcription factor belonging to the ETS family, which is characterized by a conserved ETS domain that facilitates DNA binding. This transcription factor is involved in regulating various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, by binding to specific DNA sequences and modulating the expression of target genes. The ETS2 protein is predominantly nuclear and is known for its role in the regulation of genes involved in extracellular matrix turnover and tumor invasion, as well as its involvement in T-cell activation and endothelial cell function (Maroulakou2000Expression; Bhat1990Reciprocal; Charlot2010A). ETS2 interacts with several proteins, including other ETS family members and transcriptional coactivators, which enhance its transcriptional activity (Jayaraman1999p300cAMPresponsive; Basuyaux1997The). Clinically, alterations in ETS2 expression have been linked to various diseases, such as cancers and Down syndrome-related conditions, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Heru1996Down’s; Carbone2004Triplex).

## Structure
The ETS2 protein is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, characterized by a conserved ETS domain that facilitates DNA binding. This domain is part of the winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain superfamily, which recognizes a core GGAA/T sequence (Tootle2005Post-translational; Charlot2010A). The ETS2 protein is predicted to be a nuclear protein, containing a nuclear-transit signal, and belongs to Class II of the ETS family, which includes two v-ets-homologous regions, domains A and C (Watson1988Mammalian).

The protein is highly conserved between humans and mice, with over 91% amino acid identity, and contains a consensus glycosylation site beginning at amino acid 268, indicating post-translational modification (Watson1988Mammalian). Phosphorylation is a significant post-translational modification for ETS2, particularly at Thr-72, which is crucial for its role in mammary tumor development and macrophage function during inflammation (Charlot2010A). The Pointed (PNT) domain, present in ETS2, is involved in protein-protein interactions and is regulated by MAP kinase signaling (Oikawa2003Molecular; Slupsky1998Structure). Specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ETS2 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ETS2 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to regulate the transcription of target genes. ETS2 is involved in the regulation of genes coding for matrix-degrading metalloproteinases, which are essential for extracellular matrix turnover and tumor invasion (Maroulakou2000Expression). In the context of neural development, ETS2 is expressed in the central nervous system during late embryogenesis and is maintained in adult animals, suggesting its necessity for correct neuronal function (Maroulakou2000Expression).

ETS2 also plays a role in T-cell activation and proliferation. In resting T cells, ETS2 expression is undetectable, but it is induced upon activation, indicating its association with cellular activation and proliferation (Bhat1990Reciprocal). Additionally, ETS2 is crucial for the regulation of microRNA-126 (miR-126) in endothelial cells, influencing gene suppression pathways that are important for vascular biology and endothelial cell function (Harris2010Ets-1). These functions highlight ETS2's involvement in maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating proper cellular responses in various biological contexts.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ETS2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers and Down syndrome-related conditions. In prostate cancer, ETS2 is often overexpressed, contributing to tumor growth and survival by regulating genes such as Bcl-xL, c-myc, and cyclin D1. Targeting ETS2 with triplex-forming oligonucleotides has been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Carbone2004Triplex).

In colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a distal super-enhancer activates ETS2, leading to its upregulation. This enhancer interacts with the ETS2 promoter, and its activity is associated with increased ETS2 expression in CRC tissues. Genetic variations within this enhancer, such as an IBD-risk SNP, can affect ETS2 expression by altering transcription factor binding, linking genetic predisposition to disease pathogenesis (Chen2023A).

In Down syndrome, overexpression of ETS2 due to chromosome 21 triplication is associated with skeletal abnormalities and increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. ETS2's role in these conditions is linked to its influence on cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Chatterjee2013Potential; Heru1996Down’s).

## Interactions
ETS2 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It forms strong interactions with the c-Fos/c-Jun complex, which are stabilized by DNA, particularly the stromelysin-1 promoter DNA containing EBS and AP-1 sites (Basuyaux1997The). The interaction with the Fos/Jun heterodimer is stronger than with Fos or Jun alone, and is both DNA-dependent and independent (Basuyaux1997The).

ETS2 also interacts with other Ets family members, such as ERG and ETS1. The interaction with ERG is particularly strong and involves multiple domains, including the transactivation domain, while ETS1 binds only to the C-terminal domain of ETS2 (Basuyaux1997The). ETS2's interaction with ERG is DNA-independent, as shown by the lack of effect from ethidium bromide, a DNA intercalator (Basuyaux1997The).

ETS2 interacts with the transcriptional coactivators p300/CBP, which enhance its transcriptional activity. The transactivation domain of ETS2 binds to both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of p300/CBP, while the DNA-binding domain binds only to the C-terminal region (Jayaraman1999p300cAMPresponsive). These interactions are crucial for the transcriptional activation of promoters containing Ets-binding sites (Jayaraman1999p300cAMPresponsive).
