# MBD3L3

## Overview
MBD3L3 is a gene that encodes the protein methyl-CpG binding domain protein 3 like 3, which is a member of the MBD3L family. This family of proteins is characterized by their interaction with the Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase (NuRD) complex, a key player in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Unlike other members of the MBD family, MBD3L proteins, including MBD3L3, do not possess the CpG-binding domain, which is typically essential for the recruitment of the NuRD complex to specific DNA targets. This unique feature allows MBD3L3 to modulate the activity of the NuRD complex by potentially preventing its recruitment to DNA, thereby influencing gene expression patterns. The role of MBD3L3 is particularly significant in the context of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), where it is involved in the regulation of the DUX4 gene expression, contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease (Campbell2018NuRD).

## Structure


## Interactions
MBD3L3 is part of the MBD3L family, which interacts with the Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase (NuRD) complex. MBD3L proteins, including MBD3L3, can replace MBD2 or MBD3 in the NuRD complex. This replacement is significant because MBD3L proteins lack the CpG-binding domain, which is crucial for the recruitment of the NuRD complex to its DNA targets. By substituting for MBD2 or MBD3, MBD3L3 and its family members antagonize the NuRD-mediated transcriptional repression, potentially preventing the complex from being recruited to its DNA targets (Campbell2018NuRD).

In the context of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), MBD3L proteins are implicated in modulating the repression of the D4Z4 array by the NuRD complex, thereby influencing the expression of the DUX4 gene. The expression of MBD3L proteins, such as MBD3L2, has been shown to amplify DUX4 expression in FSHD cells, suggesting a role in a positive feed-forward mechanism that facilitates the spread of DUX4 expression between nuclei in myotubes (Campbell2018NuRD). This interaction highlights the role of MBD3L3 in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the context of FSHD.
