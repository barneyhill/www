# GOLGA8S

## Overview
GOLGA8S is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A8 family member S, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. Golgins are a group of coiled-coil proteins that are primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids within the cell. The golgin A8 family member S is implicated in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus and facilitating vesicular transport processes. Although the specific biological functions and interactions of GOLGA8S remain to be fully elucidated, its role in cellular transport and Golgi structure suggests potential implications in various cellular processes and diseases. Further research is necessary to understand the precise mechanisms and pathways involving GOLGA8S and its encoded protein.
