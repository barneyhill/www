# VMP1

## Overview
VMP1, or vacuole membrane protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multi-spanning membrane protein involved in critical cellular processes such as autophagy and the regulation of membrane contact sites. The VMP1 protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is characterized by six transmembrane regions, playing a pivotal role in the formation of autophagosomes, which are essential for cellular degradation and recycling mechanisms (Tábara2016VMP1; Wang2020Roles). As a member of the DedA superfamily, VMP1 is implicated in ion-coupled transport functions and is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis through its interactions with key autophagy-related proteins, such as Beclin 1 (Molejon2013The; Okawa2021Evolution). The protein's involvement in ER-mitochondria contact sites underscores its importance in lipid metabolism and calcium homeostasis, impacting cellular energy metabolism and signaling (Tábara2016VMP1). VMP1's role in these processes highlights its significance in cellular structure and function, with implications for various diseases, including cancer, where its expression levels and interactions can influence disease progression and patient outcomes (Lin2021VMP1; Amirfallah2019High).

## Structure
VMP1 is a multi-spanning membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in processes such as autophagy and membrane contact site regulation. The protein contains six transmembrane regions, with both the N-terminus and C-terminus predicted to face the cytoplasmic side (Tábara2016VMP1). The C-terminal region includes an ER-retention signal, while the N-terminal region has a conserved sequence capable of forming an amphipathic alpha helix, which influences membrane curvature (Tábara2016VMP1).

VMP1 is part of the DedA superfamily, which includes the VTT domain, similar to the DedA domain found in bacterial proteins. This domain is characterized by a unique structure with two reentrant loops and two transmembrane helices, suggesting a potential ion-coupled transport function (Okawa2021Evolution). The VTT domain is predicted to form a complex structure with several transmembrane helices, some of which may be discontinuous (Okawa2021Evolution).

The protein is associated with ER-microdomains and is involved in the regulation of membrane contact sites and autophagy, but specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context (Tábara2016VMP1; Okawa2021Evolution).

## Function
VMP1 (vacuole membrane protein 1) is a crucial component in the regulation of autophagy and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis in healthy human cells. It is an ER-localized, multi-spanning membrane protein that plays a significant role in the formation of autophagosomes, which are essential for the degradation and recycling of cellular components (Wang2020Roles; Tong2024VMP1:). VMP1 interacts with Beclin 1, a key initiator of autophagy, facilitating the recruitment of autophagy-related proteins to the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) and promoting the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) on autophagosomal membranes (Molejon2013The).

VMP1 is also involved in the regulation of membrane contact sites (MCS) between the ER and other organelles, such as mitochondria, lipid droplets, and endosomes. These contacts are crucial for lipid metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and organelle communication (Tábara2016VMP1; Wang2020Roles). The protein's role in maintaining ER-mitochondria contact sites is particularly important for calcium and lipid traffic, which are essential for cellular energy metabolism and signaling (Tábara2016VMP1). VMP1's activity in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function, impacting processes like autophagy and organelle dynamics (Tong2024VMP1:).

## Clinical Significance
The VMP1 gene is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions playing significant roles in disease progression and patient outcomes. In breast cancer, particularly HER2-positive tumors, high VMP1 expression is associated with shorter overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Amirfallah2019High). In glioma, VMP1 is overexpressed and correlates with poor prognosis, promoting cell proliferation and therapy resistance (Lin2021VMP1). 

In pancreatic cancer, VMP1 is overexpressed and linked to poorly differentiated tumors and increased chemotherapy resistance (Renna2024Decoding). Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma, VMP1 downregulation is associated with poor prognosis and increased metastasis (Renna2024Decoding). VMP1 also plays a role in ovarian cancer, where its effects vary depending on the genetic context, showing both pro- and anti-malignant properties (Renna2024Decoding).

VMP1's interactions with microRNAs, such as miR-21 and miR-210, further influence cancer progression. These interactions can lead to altered VMP1 expression, affecting cancer cell behavior and treatment resistance (Renna2024Decoding). The gene's involvement in autophagy and its regulatory mechanisms highlight its complex role in cancer and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
VMP1 interacts with several key proteins involved in autophagy. A significant interaction is with Beclin 1, where VMP1 binds to the BH3 domain of Beclin 1 through its C-terminal hydrophilic domain, known as VMP1-AtgD. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment and activation of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, which is essential for autophagosome formation (Molejon2013The). The VMP1-Beclin 1 interaction also promotes the dissociation of Beclin 1 from Bcl-2, an autophagy inhibitor, thereby facilitating autophagy induction (Molejon2013The).

VMP1 is also involved in the regulation of ER-mitochondria contact sites. Although VMP1 is not essential for establishing these contacts, its depletion leads to structural changes in the ER and affects mitochondrial morphology, indicating its role in regulating the extension and frequency of these contacts (Tábara2016VMP1). VMP1 interacts with Vps13D, a protein that regulates mitochondria and ER contact sites, suggesting a role in mitophagy and mitochondrial morphology (Shen2021Vmp1). These interactions highlight VMP1's multifaceted role in cellular processes related to autophagy and organelle dynamics.
