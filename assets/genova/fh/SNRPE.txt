# SNRPE

## Overview
The SNRPE gene encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide E (SmE), a critical component of the spliceosome, which is involved in the splicing of pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. SmE is categorized as a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) protein and is integral to the formation of the spliceosomal core, participating in the assembly of the U snRNPs that are essential for mRNA maturation. The SNRPE gene is expressed in the nucleus, where it plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression and ensuring the accurate processing of pre-mRNA into mature mRNA by removing introns and joining exons. This process is vital for maintaining proper gene expression and protein diversity, which are crucial for cellular function and development (Chen2019A).

## Function
The SNRPE gene encodes the SmE protein, a crucial component of the spliceosome, which is responsible for the splicing of pre-mRNA in human cells. This process is essential for generating mature mRNA from precursor mRNA by removing non-coding intronic sequences and joining coding exonic sequences. The spliceosome is composed of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), and SmE, along with other Sm proteins, forms the common Sm core of these U snRNPs (Chen2019A). 

In healthy human cells, SNRPE is involved in the assembly of these snRNPs, particularly through its interaction with the SMN complex, which is necessary for the proper assembly and function of the spliceosome (Chen2019A). This interaction is crucial for maintaining normal mRNA splicing and, consequently, proper gene expression and protein diversity (Chen2019A). 

The SNRPE gene is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression and mRNA maturation. Proper functioning of SNRPE is vital for the precise spatio-temporal expression of lineage-specific genes, which is important for the specific morphology and physiological capacities of different cell types (Chen2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SNRPE gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In high-grade prostate cancer, SNRPE is overexpressed, promoting cancer cell proliferation by regulating androgen receptor (AR) expression. Knockdown of SNRPE in prostate cancer cells results in decreased AR expression and reduced cancer cell viability, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (ANCHI2011SNRPE).

SNRPE mutations are also associated with non-syndromal microcephaly, a condition characterized by reduced brain size and intellectual disability. A specific missense mutation, c.65T>C (p.Phe22Ser), impairs the assembly of spliceosomal U snRNPs, leading to widespread mRNA splicing defects. This mutation disrupts the interaction of the SmE protein with the SMN complex, crucial for proper spliceosome function, and results in significant developmental consequences, particularly affecting brain development (Chen2019A).

Additionally, mutations in SNRPE have been linked to autosomal-dominant hypotrichosis simplex, a hereditary form of hair loss. Mutations such as c.1A>G and c.133G>A (p.Gly45Ser) affect the protein's structure and function, potentially impacting its role in pre-mRNA processing and contributing to the hair loss phenotype (Pasternack2013Mutations).

## Interactions
SNRPE, also known as SmE, is a component of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing. It forms a stable heteromeric complex with SmF and SmG proteins, known as the E-F-G complex, which is an intermediate in the snRNP assembly process. This complex is RNA-free and serves as a structural platform for snRNP core assembly, interacting strongly with the D1-D2 complex to form a stable RNP subcore particle (Raker1996The).

SNRPE interacts with the SMN complex, which is essential for the transfer of Sm proteins onto U snRNA. A missense mutation in SNRPE (c.65T>C, p.Phe22Ser) impairs its interaction with the SMN complex and SmD3, preventing its incorporation into U snRNPs and affecting pre-mRNA splicing (Chen2019A). This mutation also disrupts SNRPE's interaction with Gemin2, a component of the SMN complex, due to a change in the polarity of the amino acid residue (Chen2019A).

SNRPE has been shown to bind to the hsp70 promoter region, indicating a role in regulating hsp70 gene expression. It interacts with Hsp105b, enhancing hsp70 promoter activity, and localizes to the nucleus where it binds to the N-terminal region of Hsp105b (Saito2016Yeast).
