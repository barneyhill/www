# ANKRD17

## Overview
ANKRD17 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 17 protein, which is a member of the ankyrin repeat-containing protein family. This protein is characterized by its multiple ankyrin repeat domains and a KH domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and RNA binding, respectively. ANKRD17 plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and transcriptional regulation. It is particularly significant in the regulation of the Yes-associated protein (YAP) nuclear import and stability, which is crucial for cellular proliferation and behavior. Additionally, ANKRD17 is involved in immune responses, interacting with components of the RIG-I-like receptor pathway and contributing to the activation of transcription factors such as IRF-3 and NF-κB. The gene's mutations are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in human development and immune system regulation (Sidor2019Mask; Ray2012Experimental; Wang2012Ankrd17; Chopra2021Heterozygous).

## Structure
The ANKRD17 protein is characterized by multiple ankyrin repeat domains, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions. In mice, ANKRD17 has two major isoforms: one consisting of 2603 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 274 kDa, and another with 2352 amino acids and a mass of 247 kDa (Ray2012Experimental). The protein contains 25 ankyrin repeats and one KH domain, which are involved in diverse biological processes, including the regulation of the NF-kB signaling cascade and DNA replication during the S-phase of the cell cycle (Ray2012Experimental; Menning2013A).

ANKRD17 is involved in the regulation of YAP nuclear import and stability, facilitated by its ankyrin repeat domains and RNA-binding KH-domains, which may enable multivalent interactions and clustering of YAP molecules (Sidor2019Mask). The protein is also implicated in cell-autonomous antiviral innate immune regulation and pro-inflammatory responses in human myeloid and epithelial cells (Menning2013A). ANKRD17 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and exists in different splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and interactions (Chen2024Case).

## Function
ANKRD17 encodes a protein that is part of the ankyrin repeat-containing protein family, which is known for mediating protein-protein interactions. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and transcriptional regulation. ANKRD17 is involved in the regulation of YAP (Yes-associated protein) nuclear import and stability, which is essential for controlling cellular behavior and proliferation. The protein contains ankyrin repeat domains that facilitate its binding to YAP, promoting its nuclear import and stability, and preventing its degradation by E3 ubiquitin ligases (Sidor2019Maska; Sidor2019Mask).

ANKRD17 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, contributing to the dynamic regulation of YAP by the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and tissue homeostasis (Sidor2019Maska). The protein is also implicated in immune responses, particularly in NOD2 and NOD1 mediated responses to bacterial infections, highlighting its role in the immune system (Chen2024Case). ANKRD17's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cell biology and organismal outcomes, such as cell proliferation and immune response.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANKRD17 gene are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, speech delay, and dysmorphic features. This condition is primarily caused by heterozygous loss-of-function variants, including truncating, missense, and splice site mutations, many of which are de novo. These mutations lead to a syndrome with phenotypic features such as developmental delay, growth failure, feeding difficulties, epilepsy, and recurrent infections (Chopra2021Heterozygous). The ANKRD17 gene is highly intolerant to loss of function, as indicated by a gnomAD pLI score of 1.0, underscoring its critical role in human development (Chopra2021Heterozygous).

A novel splicing variant in ANKRD17 has been identified in a Chinese male juvenile with developmental delay and transient tic disorder, leading to exon 32 skipping and premature protein termination. This variant is classified as pathogenic and expands the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of ANKRD17-related disorders (Chen2024Case).

ANKRD17 is also implicated in inflammatory responses, particularly in bacterial infections, through its role in Nod1- and Nod2-mediated NF-kB activation. This involvement suggests potential implications for diseases related to immune response dysregulation (Menning2013A).

## Interactions
ANKRD17 is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play a crucial role in immune signaling pathways. It interacts with components of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway, including RIG-I, MDA5, and VISA, enhancing the activation of transcription factors such as IRF-3 and NF-κB, which leads to increased transcription of IFN-β (Wang2012Ankrd17). The ankyrin repeat domain of ANKRD17 is essential for its interaction with RIG-I, while its interaction with VISA does not require these motifs (Wang2012Ankrd17).

ANKRD17 also interacts with TRAF6 and potentiates TRIF-induced IFN-β activation, although it does not significantly affect interactions between VISA and MITA, TRAF3, or TRAF6 (Wang2012Ankrd17). In the context of influenza A virus infection, ANKRD17 interacts with the viral protein PA-X, which suppresses ANKRD17-mediated immune responses, specifically the induction of IFN-β expression (Li2021Influenza).

ANKRD17 is also identified as a binding partner of Nod2, a protein involved in inflammatory responses, with its N-terminal domain mediating this interaction (Menning2013A). These interactions highlight ANKRD17's role in modulating immune and inflammatory responses.
