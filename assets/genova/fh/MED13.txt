# MED13

## Overview
MED13 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 13, a critical component of the Mediator complex involved in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. The MED13 protein is part of the CDK8 kinase module and plays a significant role in modulating transcriptional activity through its interactions with various transcription factors and other subunits of the Mediator complex. Structurally, MED13 is characterized by its Argonaute-like architecture, which includes several unique insertions that facilitate its interactions within the complex. Functionally, MED13 acts as a transcriptional regulator, particularly influencing glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in muscle tissue, and is involved in cellular responses to DNA damage. Clinically, mutations in the MED13 gene are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and have implications in cancer resistance to alkylating agents, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Chen2024Structural; Ranjan2018Therapeutic; Snijders2018De).

## Structure
The MED13 protein is a component of the human Mediator complex and exhibits a unique molecular structure. It is the largest subunit of the complex, with a molecular weight of approximately 250 kDa, and consists of 2174 amino acids (Chen2024Structural; Snijders2018De). MED13 has an Argonaute-like architecture, comprising four globular domains: N, PAZ, MID, and PIWI, along with two linker regions, L1 and L2, forming two lobes with a central channel (Chen2024Structural; Li2021Structure). 

The protein contains several unique insertions not found in classical Argonaute proteins, including PAZ-ins, PIWI-ins, and MID-ins, which contribute to its interactions with other subunits of the CKM (Chen2024Structural). MED13 also features two zinc-binding sites that enhance its stability and protein-protein interactions (Chen2024Structural). 

The intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of MED13 interacts with the core Mediator complex, influencing RNA polymerase II binding and modulating transcription regulation (Chen2024Structural). Mutations in MED13 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting its interaction potential and structural integrity (Snijders2018De).

## Function
MED13 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. In healthy human cells, MED13 functions as a transcriptional regulator, influencing various molecular processes and cellular functions. It acts as a transcriptional repressor in muscle tissue, particularly affecting genes involved in glucose uptake and glycogen storage. This regulation is mediated through its interaction with transcription factors such as NURR1 and MEF2, impacting systemic glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity (Ranjan2018Therapeutic; Amoasii2016A).

In skeletal muscle, MED13 suppresses glucose metabolism, which is particularly evident under high-fat diet conditions that induce insulin resistance. The deletion of MED13 in muscle tissue enhances glucose utilization and storage, improving insulin responsiveness and preventing hepatic steatosis (Amoasii2016A).

MED13 also plays a role in cellular resistance to DNA damage, particularly alkylation damage. Loss of MED13 leads to the upregulation of cyclin D1, which is associated with increased resistance to alkylating agents and altered cell cycle progression. This suggests that MED13 is involved in regulating cell cycle control and DNA damage response pathways, maintaining cellular homeostasis (Roliński2021Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MED13 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. These include intellectual disability, developmental delays, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Patients with MED13 mutations may also exhibit optic nerve abnormalities, mild congenital heart defects, and facial dysmorphisms (Snijders2018De). The mutations often occur de novo and are particularly impactful when they affect the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the protein (Snijders2018De).

MED13 mutations have also been linked to a condition resembling Kabuki syndrome, characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, and distinct facial features. This suggests a potential overlap in the clinical presentation of MED13-related disorders and Kabuki syndrome (De2020Could).

In cancer, alterations in MED13 expression can lead to increased resistance to alkylating agents. Loss of MED13 results in the overexpression of cyclin D1, which contributes to altered cell cycle progression and enhanced DNA repair, thereby reducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Stabilizing MED13 through CDK8/19 inhibition has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to sensitize cancer cells to these agents (Roliński2021Loss).

## Interactions
MED13 is a component of the CDK8 kinase module within the Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by interacting with RNA polymerase II and various transcription factors. MED13 interacts with the SCF-Fbw7 ubiquitin ligase, which targets MED13 for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This interaction is dependent on a conserved phosphodegron within MED13, which is recognized by Fbw7. Mutations in this region can disrupt the binding and degradation process, affecting the stability of MED13 and its regulatory functions (Davis2013The; Snijders2018De).

The CDK8 module, including MED13, can associate with the core Mediator complex, influencing transcription initiation and reinitiation. The presence of MED13 is essential for the physical interaction between the kinase module and the Mediator complex, impacting transcriptional regulation (De2020Could). MED13 also interacts with other subunits of the CDK8 module, such as MED12, CDK8, and cyclin C, to modulate transcriptional activity (Borggrefe2011Interactions).

In yeast, MED13 is part of the Cdk8 module, which is involved in transcription repression by blocking RNA polymerase II interaction with the Mediator complex (Guglielmi2004A). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of MED13 in transcriptional regulation and its involvement in various cellular processes.
