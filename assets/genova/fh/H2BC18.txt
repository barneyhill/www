# H2BC18

## Overview
The H2BC18 gene encodes the H2B clustered histone 18 protein, which is a member of the histone H2B family. Histones are essential nuclear proteins that package and order DNA into structural units called nucleosomes, playing a critical role in the regulation of gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. The H2B clustered histone 18 protein is involved in the formation of nucleosomes and is crucial for maintaining chromatin stability and facilitating DNA replication and repair processes. As a core histone, it contributes to the dynamic regulation of chromatin accessibility, thereby influencing various cellular processes, including transcription, replication, and DNA damage response (Qiu2020aarFDC).
