# TBCB

## Overview
TBCB, or tubulin folding cofactor B, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the regulation of microtubule dynamics within cells. The protein, also referred to as tubulin folding cofactor B, is involved in the proper folding and assembly of αβ-tubulin heterodimers, which are essential components of microtubules. As a cytosolic protein, TBCB plays a significant role in microtubule polymerization and depolymerization, processes vital for maintaining cell shape, intracellular transport, and mitosis. The protein is characterized by distinct domains, including an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain, a central coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal cytoskeleton-associated protein glycine-rich domain, which facilitate its interactions with α- and β-tubulin (AraujoGarrido2020Tubulin; Nolasco2021Colchicine). TBCB's function is regulated through various post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, which influence its stability and activity (Tan2017HILI). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are implicated in several clinical conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, highlighting its importance in cellular and physiological processes (Zheng2022Decreased; Nolasco2021Colchicine).

## Structure
TBCB (tubulin folding cofactor B) is a 244-amino acid protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. Its molecular structure includes several distinct domains: an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, a central coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal cytoskeleton-associated protein glycine-rich (CAP-Gly) domain (AraujoGarrido2020Tubulin; Nolasco2021Colchicine). These domains facilitate its interaction with α- and β-tubulin, playing a crucial role in tubulin dimer formation and dissociation (Nolasco2021Colchicine).

The UBL domain is implicated in potential interactions with the proteasome, suggesting a role in protein degradation pathways (Nolasco2021Colchicine). The CAP-Gly domain is involved in binding to the α-tubulin monomer, which is essential for the dissociation of tubulin heterodimers (Nolasco2021Colchicine). 

TBCB undergoes various post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and phosphorylation, which regulate its function and stability (Tan2017HILI). Phosphorylation by PAK1 is particularly important for microtubule polymerization, while nitration can inhibit this phosphorylation, affecting microtubule dynamics (Nolasco2021Colchicine). These modifications highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms controlling TBCB's activity in microtubule dynamics.

## Function
Tubulin folding cofactor B (TBCB) plays a critical role in the dynamics and stability of microtubules in healthy human cells. It is involved in the de novo synthesis of microtubules by facilitating the proper folding and assembly of αβ-tubulin heterodimers, which are essential for microtubule formation (Zheng2022ERK12; Nithianantham2015Tubulin). TBCB specifically binds to α-tubulin monomers after their folding and assists in the formation of αβ-tubulin dimers, maintaining a pool of soluble dimers necessary for microtubule dynamics (Tian2013TubulinSpecific; Nithianantham2015Tubulin).

TBCB is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear area and microtubule organizing centers, where it influences microtubule growth at both the plus and minus ends (Zheng2022ERK12). It regulates microtubule polymerization and depolymerization, processes crucial for cell shape, intracellular transport, and mitosis (Nolasco2021Colchicine). TBCB also interacts with end-binding proteins EB1 and EB3 to regulate microtubule plus-end growth, which is vital for the formation and growth of astrocyte processes (Zheng2022Decreased).

In addition to its role in microtubule dynamics, TBCB is involved in the dissociation and recycling of tubulin heterodimers, ensuring the proper concentration of free tubulin heterodimers in the cell (Nolasco2021Colchicine). This function is crucial for maintaining microtubule integrity and dynamics, impacting various cellular processes such as cell division and motility (Nolasco2021Colchicine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TBCB gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. TBCB is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, and its dysregulation can lead to neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, changes in TBCB expression have been associated with disorders such as giant axonal neuropathy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which are characterized by disrupted microtubule networks and altered cell morphology (Nolasco2021Colchicine). 

In the context of fetal alcohol syndrome, alterations in TBCB expression, potentially regulated by the MAPK signaling pathway, have been linked to morphological and functional changes in astrocytes. This is particularly evident after chronic alcohol exposure, where decreased TBCB expression disrupts microtubule plus-end growth, leading to disordered astrocyte processes (Zheng2022Decreased). 

TBCB has also been implicated in cancer development. Its role in microtubule dynamics suggests that alterations in TBCB could affect tumor cell behavior and response to treatment (Nolasco2021Colchicine). Additionally, TBCB's interaction with proteins like HILI, which affects its phosphorylation and degradation, may influence cancer progression by impacting microtubule stability (Tan2017HILI).

## Interactions
Tubulin folding cofactor B (TBCB) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in microtubule dynamics. TBCB interacts with the Salmonella effector protein SseK1, which glycosylates TBCB, specifically adding N-acetylglucosamine to arginine residues. This interaction is specific to SseK1, as SseK2 and SseK3 do not glycosylate TBCB, although TBCB does show a stable interaction with SseK3 without undergoing glycosylation (AraujoGarrido2020Tubulin). The glycosylation by SseK1 is significant as it influences microtubule stability by increasing the acetylation level of α-tubulin, which correlates with enhanced microtubule stability (AraujoGarrido2020Tubulin).

TBCB also interacts with end-binding proteins 1 and 3 (EB1 and EB3), which are essential for microtubule plus-end growth. These interactions are crucial for the proper formation of astrocyte processes, and disruptions in these interactions can lead to formation disorders, particularly after chronic alcohol exposure (Zheng2022Decreased). The expression levels of EB1 and EB3 are interdependent and are influenced by TBCB, highlighting the importance of these interactions in maintaining microtubule dynamics (Zheng2022Decreased).
