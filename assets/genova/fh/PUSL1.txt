# PUSL1

## Overview
PUSL1 (pseudouridine synthase like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA molecules through the process of pseudouridylation. This protein is categorized as an RNA-modifying enzyme, specifically a pseudouridine synthase, which catalyzes the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine in various RNA species, including mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, and snRNA. The pseudouridylation process is essential for RNA stability, structure, and function, impacting RNA processing and translation, and thereby influencing protein synthesis and cellular function. PUSL1 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it plays a critical role in maintaining mRNA stability and function. Altered expression of PUSL1 has been associated with several cancers, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Jin2022Integrative; Ding2016Identification; Dai2022Quantitative).

## Function
PUSL1 (pseudouridine synthase like 1) is involved in the modification of RNA molecules through the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine, a process known as pseudouridylation. This modification is crucial for the stability and function of various RNA species, including mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, and snRNA. Pseudouridylation can affect RNA stability, localization, structure, splicing, and function, thereby playing a significant role in RNA processing and translation, which impacts protein synthesis and cellular function (Jin2022Integrative; Dai2022Quantitative).

PUSL1 is active in the nucleus and cytoplasm, where RNA processing occurs. It is part of a group of enzymes that contribute to the deposition of pseudouridine sites in mRNA, as demonstrated in HeLa cell transcripts. The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining mRNA stability and function, which can influence cellular processes and organismal outcomes (Dai2022Quantitative).

While the specific role of PUSL1 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in RNA modification suggests it plays a critical role in maintaining normal cellular functions and potentially in the regulation of gene expression (Ding2016Identification).

## Clinical Significance
PUSL1 (pseudouridine synthase like 1) has been implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PUSL1 is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to non-cancerous tissues. Its high expression is associated with poor overall survival and is considered an independent risk factor for prognosis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for HCC diagnosis and prognosis (Jin2022Integrative). 

In breast cancer, PUSL1 is identified as a risk factor, with higher expression levels correlating with poorer survival outcomes. This association is supported by a Cox p-value of less than 0.05, indicating its potential role in breast cancer prognosis (Qi2021TTSurv:). 

PUSL1 is also involved in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it is part of a risk model associated with cell pyroptosis. Its expression is higher in high-risk groups, correlating with lower survival rates, and it is considered a risk factor with a hazard ratio greater than 1 (Bin2022Establishment). 

These findings suggest that PUSL1's altered expression may contribute to tumor progression and poor prognosis in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.
