# MAPK1IP1L

## Overview
The MAPK1IP1L gene encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 interacting protein 1 like, which is involved in cellular signaling pathways. This protein is part of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which plays a crucial role in transducing extracellular signals into cellular responses, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The MAPK1IP1L protein is known to interact with MAPK1, also known as ERK2, and is implicated in modulating its activity. This interaction suggests a regulatory role in the MAPK signaling cascade, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stimuli. The precise biological functions and mechanisms of MAPK1IP1L are still under investigation, but its involvement in critical signaling pathways highlights its potential significance in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
