# HSPA2

## Overview
HSPA2 is a gene that encodes the heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 2, a molecular chaperone involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of human reproduction and stress response. The HSPA2 protein is a member of the Hsp70 family, which is known for its role in protein folding, assembly, and transport, as well as in protecting cells from stress-induced damage. It is predominantly expressed in the testes, where it plays a critical role in spermatogenesis, particularly during meiosis and sperm maturation (Son1999Specific; Huszar2000Putative). HSPA2 is also implicated in sperm-egg recognition and fertilization, forming complexes with other proteins essential for these processes (Redgrove2012The). Beyond its reproductive functions, HSPA2 has been studied for its involvement in cancer biology, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Sojka2020HSPA2; Yang2019RNF144A).

## Function
HSPA2, a member of the Hsp70 family, is a molecular chaperone involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in human spermatogenesis. It plays a significant role in protein assembly, folding, and transport through ATP hydrolysis, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and protecting cells from stress-induced damage (Huszar2000Putative). HSPA2 is prominently expressed in the cytoplasm of elongating spermatids and mature sperm, indicating its developmental regulation during spermatogenesis (Huszar2000Putative). 

In human testes, HSPA2 is highly expressed in spermatocytes and spermatids, but not in spermatogonia or somatic cells, suggesting a specific role during meiosis (Son1999Specific). It is involved in chromatin remodeling and sperm maturation, interacting with proteins like TP2, PARP-1, and PARP-2, which are crucial for chromatin reorganization (Scieglinska2015Expression). HSPA2 also contributes to sperm-egg recognition, forming part of a complex necessary for fertilization (Scieglinska2015Expression).

The protein's expression is linked to cytoplasmic extrusion and plasma membrane remodeling, processes vital for developing the zona pellucida-binding site, which is crucial for sperm function and fertility (Huszar2000Putative). Reduced levels of HSPA2 are associated with abnormal spermiogenesis and increased aneuploidy, highlighting its importance in male fertility (Scieglinska2015Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HSPA2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in male fertility and cancer. In the context of male fertility, HSPA2 is crucial for spermatogenesis. Reduced expression of HSPA2 in humans is associated with aberrant spermiogenetic maturation, nonfunctional sperm, and increased aneuploidy frequencies. This reduction correlates with impaired meiotic division and is observed in men with abnormal spermatogenesis and idiopathic male infertility (Scieglinska2015Expression).

In cancer, HSPA2 has been identified as a cancer-related protein with controversial roles. While some studies suggest that HSPA2 supports cancer cell growth and invasiveness, others indicate it is not essential for maintaining the malignant phenotype of certain cancer cells, such as those in lung, breast, and cervical cancers (Sojka2020HSPA2). In breast cancer, HSPA2 is targeted by the tumor suppressor RNF144A for ubiquitination and degradation. High HSPA2 expression correlates with poor prognosis and aggressive cancer features, while low RNF144A expression is linked to increased HSPA2 stability and breast cancer progression (Yang2019RNF144A). These findings highlight the complex role of HSPA2 in cancer biology.

## Interactions
HSPA2, a member of the Hsp70 family, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for sperm function and fertility. It forms a multimeric complex with sperm adhesion molecule 1 (SPAM1) and arylsulfatase A (ARSA), which are implicated in sperm-egg recognition. This complex, referred to as Complex IV, is primarily located in the acrosomal region of the sperm head and is essential for zona pellucida (ZP) binding (Redgrove2012The). 

HSPA2 also interacts with BCL2-associated athanogene 6 (BAG6), which stabilizes HSPA2 in human spermatozoa. This interaction is crucial for maintaining HSPA2 stability and function, particularly in the context of sperm capacitation and maturation. BAG6 and HSPA2 co-localize in the equatorial and apical regions of the sperm head, and their interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays (Bromfield2015Novel).

Additionally, HSPA2 is associated with small extracellular vesicles (EVs), where it interacts with other proteins like CD63, CD9, and CD81. This association is enhanced under proteotoxic stress conditions, indicating a role in cellular stress responses (Sojka2023Heat).
