# SETMAR

## Overview
SETMAR is a human gene that encodes a unique fusion protein combining a SET domain, known for its histone methyltransferase activity, with a mariner transposase domain. This fusion protein, often referred to as Metnase, plays a critical role in DNA repair, replication, and chromatin modification. The SET domain of the protein is responsible for the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36, which is crucial for chromatin accessibility and transcription regulation. Meanwhile, the mariner transposase domain retains DNA binding and cleavage capabilities, although it has diverged from typical transposase structures. SETMAR is particularly significant in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, facilitating the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and ensuring genomic stability. Its involvement in various cellular processes and interactions with other proteins underscores its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and its potential implications in cancer progression (Lié2022SETMAR; Roman2007Biochemical; Tellier2021Structure).

## Structure
SETMAR is a fusion protein composed of a SET domain and a mariner transposase domain. The SET domain is responsible for histone lysine methyltransferase activity, specifically targeting histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) and lysine 4 (H3K4) (Tellier2018Human; Roman2007Biochemical). This domain includes a histone lysine methyltransferase motif, which is crucial for its function in chromatin modification (Roman2007Biochemical).

The transposase domain of SETMAR retains several features of the ancestral Hsmar1 transposase, including a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif essential for sequence-specific DNA binding, particularly to the terminal inverted repeats (TIR) of the Hsmar1 element (Roman2007Biochemical). The transposase domain also contains a DDE-like motif, which is critical for DNA cleavage activity, although the third D/E amino acid is mutated to N, indicating a divergence from typical transposase structures (Roman2007Biochemical).

SETMAR's structure includes a PreSET domain with a cysteine- and histidine-rich Zn++ binding motif, contributing to its stability and function (Roman2007Biochemical). The protein's DNA binding and cleavage activities are independent of the TIR sequence, highlighting its unique functional adaptations (Roman2007Biochemical). The interaction between SETMAR and human Pso4 (hPso4) is crucial for its role in DNA repair, with the SET domain playing a significant role in this interaction (Beck2008Human).

## Function
The SETMAR gene, also known as METNASE, encodes a fusion protein that combines a SET histone methyltransferase domain with a mariner transposase domain. This protein is involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily in DNA repair, replication, and chromatin modification. SETMAR plays a significant role in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, a crucial mechanism for repairing DNA double-strand breaks. It enhances the recruitment and stabilization of repair proteins at these breaks, facilitating efficient DNA repair (Lié2022SETMAR; Tellier2021Structure).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, SETMAR is involved in DNA replication, particularly in the restart of stalled replication forks. It interacts with proteins such as PCNA and RAD9 to ensure replication continuity and genomic stability (Tellier2021Structure). The protein also aids in chromosome decatenation, a process essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division, by enhancing the activity of topoisomerase IIα (Shaheen2010MetnaseSETMAR:).

SETMAR's histone methyltransferase activity, specifically the dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me2), is associated with chromatin accessibility, transcription regulation, and DNA repair (Shaheen2010MetnaseSETMAR:). This activity is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression in healthy human cells (Lié2022SETMAR).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SETMAR gene have been linked to various cancers. Dysregulation of SETMAR is associated with glioblastoma, leukemia, breast cancer, colon cancer, and mantle cell lymphoma (Tellier2021Structure). In glioblastoma, SETMAR is crucial for the survival of radiation-resistant cells by facilitating DNA repair through the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Knockdown of SETMAR in these cells reduces the recruitment of repair proteins, leading to cell senescence and suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to prevent glioblastoma recurrence (Kaur2020Inhibition).

In colon cancer, particularly those with high microsatellite instability, a frameshift mutation in SETMAR has been identified, although such mutations are rare (Moon2021Mutation). Overexpression of SETMAR in osteosarcoma cells alters the transcriptome, affecting cancer pathways related to angiogenesis and cellular proliferation (Tellier2021Structure). In bladder cancer, SETMAR expression inhibits lymph node metastasis by increasing H3K27me3 at oncogene promoters, and its alternative splicing is regulated by NONO, affecting cancer metastasis (Xie2021NONO). These findings highlight the gene's role in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
SETMAR, also known as Metnase, is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions that are crucial for its role in DNA repair. It forms a stable complex with the human homolog of the ScPSO4/PRP19 protein (hPso4), which is essential for its localization at double-strand break (DSB) sites. This interaction is necessary for Metnase's function in DNA repair, as hPso4 mediates Metnase's association at DNA damage sites (Beck2008Human). Metnase also interacts with DNA Ligase IV and XRCC4, key components of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of NHEJ (Hromas2008The).

SETMAR retains the ability to bind specifically to the 30-bp Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs) of the Hsmar1 transposon, a feature enhanced by its interaction with hPso4, which allows it to recognize sequences beyond Hsmar1 TIRs (Lié2022SETMARa). The SET domain of SETMAR interacts with PRPF19 and DNA Ligase IV, targeting SETMAR to DSBs where it can dimethylate histone H3 lysine 36, recruiting and stabilizing NHEJ factors like Ku70 and NBS1 (Tellier2018SETMAR). These interactions highlight SETMAR's multifaceted role in DNA repair and chromatin modification.
