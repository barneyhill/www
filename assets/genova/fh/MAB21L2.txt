# MAB21L2

## Overview
MAB21L2 is a gene that encodes the mab-21 like 2 protein, which is a member of the nucleotidyltransferase fold protein family. Although the protein does not exhibit demonstrated nucleotidyltransferase activity, it plays a crucial role in developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system and eye formation (Tsang2018Generation; Deml2015Mutations). The mab-21 like 2 protein is involved in modulating Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathways, acting as a transcriptional repressor and interacting with SMAD1, a key component of the BMP signaling pathway (Baldessari2004MAB21L2). This interaction is essential for maintaining dorsoventral polarity during embryogenesis and for the differentiation of neuronal identities (Baldessari2004MAB21L2). Mutations in MAB21L2 have been linked to various ocular and skeletal conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in human developmental disorders (Deml2015Mutations).

## Structure
The MAB21L2 protein is a member of the nucleotidyltransferase fold protein family, although specific nucleotidyltransferase activity has not been demonstrated in vivo or in vitro (Tsang2018Generation). The protein is composed of 359 amino acids and shares structural similarities with the C. elegans mab-21 cell fate-determining factor (Deml2015Mutations). The mab-21 domain is predicted to span amino acids 62-346, indicating a significant portion of the protein is involved in this domain (Deml2015Mutations).

The MAB21L2 protein is suggested to have a structural role, potentially involving interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins, rather than a catalytic function (de2016Structural). It can bind single-stranded RNA nonspecifically, although no specific targets have been identified (Tsang2018Generation). The protein's structure may require a conformational change or assembly to activate any latent enzymatic activity (Tsang2018Generation).

Mutations in MAB21L2, such as R51C/H, E49K, and R247Q, are linked to ocular coloboma and affect protein stability by disrupting critical salt bridges and bonding networks (de2016Structural). These mutations are located in regions crucial for protein-protein interactions, which are essential for the protein's function (de2016Structural).

## Function
The MAB21L2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in various developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system and eye formation. It functions as a transcriptional repressor and is involved in modulating Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathways, which are essential for maintaining dorsoventral polarity during embryogenesis (Baldessari2004MAB21L2). MAB21L2 interacts with SMAD1, a nuclear transducer of BMP2/4/7 signaling, suggesting a conserved genetic interaction across species (Baldessari2004MAB21L2). This interaction is vital for the differentiation of dopaminergic precursors and the specification of neuronal identities along the dorsoventral axis of the neural tube (Baldessari2004MAB21L2).

In healthy cells, MAB21L2 is expressed at high levels during neurulation and morphogenesis, contributing to neural tube and eye formation. It is prominently expressed in the embryonic midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord, where it coexists with BMP signaling molecules, indicating its role in the specification of neuronal identities (Baldessari2004MAB21L2). The gene is also involved in cerebellar development, as evidenced by its expression in the cerebellar plate and granule cell neurons (Baldessari2004MAB21L2). MAB21L2's function in healthy cells is likely related to its role in these developmental processes, ensuring proper signaling and transcriptional regulation during critical stages of development (Baldessari2004MAB21L2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAB21L2 gene are associated with several ocular and skeletal conditions. Notably, mutations such as c.151 C>G, p.(Arg51Gly) and c.152 G>A, p.(Arg51His) have been linked to ocular coloboma, microcornea, and cataracts. These mutations are found in affected individuals and absent in unaffected ones, indicating a strong correlation with these conditions (Deml2015Mutations). The p.(Arg51Gly) mutation, in particular, is associated with a dominant phenotype in humans, leading to significant ocular abnormalities (Deml2015Mutations).

Other mutations, such as p.(Arg51Cys) and p.(Arg51His), have been linked to severe phenotypes including bilateral anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and rhizomelic skeletal dysplasia (de2016Structural). These mutations are thought to destabilize the protein structure, affecting its function in eye and skeletal development (de2016Structural).

Research using zebrafish and mouse models has demonstrated that MAB21L2 mutations can lead to defects in retinal development, increased cell death, and altered expression of ocular markers, further supporting the gene's role in these developmental processes (Deml2015Mutations). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MAB21L2 mutations in human developmental disorders.

## Interactions
MAB21L2 is known to interact with SMAD1, a component of the BMP signaling pathway. This interaction occurs both in vitro and in vivo and is enhanced by BMP4 treatment, although it is not entirely dependent on receptor-mediated phosphorylation. The interaction between MAB21L2 and SMAD1 is direct and does not involve SMAD4, indicating that MAB21L2 modulates BMP signaling through SMAD1 alone (Baldessari2004MAB21L2).

MAB21L2 acts as a transcriptional repressor when targeted to a heterologous promoter, suggesting it may function as a transcriptional repressor or co-repressor in the BMP signaling pathway. This role is supported by its ability to antagonize the effects of BMP4 overexpression in vivo, which is crucial for early vertebrate development (Baldessari2004MAB21L2).

Mutations in MAB21L2, such as the p.(Arg51Gly) allele, have been associated with ocular diseases and are thought to destabilize the protein, potentially through a 'dominant negative' mechanism. These mutations may affect the protein's ability to interact with nucleic acids or other proteins, such as SMAD proteins, which are part of the TGF-β signaling pathway (de2016Structural; Deml2015Mutations).
