# TTLL3

## Overview
The TTLL3 gene encodes the enzyme tubulin tyrosine ligase-like 3, which is a tubulin glycylase involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin through glycylation. This enzyme plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of primary cilia, structures essential for cellular signaling and homeostasis. TTLL3 is particularly significant in tissues such as the colon and retina, where it influences cell proliferation and ciliary structure, respectively. The protein's function in balancing tubulin glycylation and glutamylation is vital for ciliary stability and function, with implications for diseases such as colorectal cancer, retinitis pigmentosa, and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (Rocha2014Tubulin; Nazlamova2022Microtubule; Wang2020Frequent).

## Function
The TTLL3 gene encodes a tubulin glycylase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of tubulin through glycylation. This modification is essential for the formation and maintenance of primary cilia, which are important for cellular signaling and homeostasis. In the colon, TTLL3 is the only glycylase expressed, and its absence leads to a reduction in the number of primary cilia, resulting in increased cell proliferation and a higher risk of tumor development (Rocha2014Tubulin).

In the retina, TTLL3 is responsible for the monoglycylation of cilium microtubules, a process necessary for ciliogenesis and the maintenance of ciliary structure. This function is particularly important in photoreceptor cells, where TTLL3 helps maintain the structural integrity of cilia, which is critical for healthy retinal function (Nazlamova2022Microtubule).

TTLL3 also plays a role in balancing tubulin glycylation and glutamylation, ensuring the stability and function of cilia. Mis-splicing of TTLL3 can lead to increased tubulin glutamylation and cilium degeneration, as observed in models of retinitis pigmentosa (Nazlamova2022Microtubule).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TTLL3 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In colorectal cancer (CRC), TTLL3 is consistently downregulated, which is associated with increased tumor incidence and size in mouse models. Although somatic mutations in TTLL3 are rare in CRC, its downregulation is a common feature across various CRC cell lines, suggesting a role in tumor development (Rocha2014Tubulin).

In retinitis pigmentosa (RP), TTLL3 is involved in the monoglycylation of cilium microtubules, a process crucial for ciliogenesis. Mis-splicing of TTLL3 in cells with mutations in pre-mRNA splicing factor genes PRPF6 and PRPF31 leads to increased tubulin glutamylation, resulting in cilium degeneration and retinal degeneration. This suggests that TTLL3 mis-splicing contributes to the retinal degeneration observed in RP (Nazlamova2022Microtubule).

In persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), rare missense mutations in TTLL3, such as p.E317K and p.P777S, have been identified. These mutations are associated with the PPHN phenotype, highlighting the gene's involvement in hypoxia-related pathways (Wang2020Frequent).
