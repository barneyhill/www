# PLA2G2A

## Overview
The PLA2G2A gene encodes the enzyme phospholipase A2 group IIA (sPLA2-IIA), a member of the secreted phospholipase A2 family, which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and inflammatory processes. This enzyme is characterized by its ability to hydrolyze phospholipids, particularly in bacterial membranes, thereby contributing to host defense mechanisms and innate immunity (Murakami2016The; Scott2021Human). Structurally, sPLA2-IIA is a calcium-dependent enzyme with a compact, globular form stabilized by disulfide bonds, and it often functions as a homodimer (Kim2020Structural). Beyond its antimicrobial activity, sPLA2-IIA is involved in the production of proinflammatory lipid mediators, such as arachidonic acid, which are precursors for eicosanoids that amplify inflammatory responses (Scott2021Human). The enzyme's interactions with integrins and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins further underscore its role in cellular signaling and inflammation (Fujita2015Proinflammatory; Murakami1999Functional). Due to its involvement in various pathological conditions, including cancer, PLA2G2A is a significant focus of research for potential therapeutic interventions (Zhang2022PLA2G2A; He2015PLA2G2A).

## Structure
The human gene PLA2G2A encodes the enzyme phospholipase A2 group IIA, which is involved in lipid metabolism. The primary structure of PLA2G2A consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, characterized by a conserved active site sequence (Asp-Xxx-Cys-Cys-Xxx-Xxx-His-Asp) and a calcium-binding loop (Xxx-Cys-Gly-Xxx-Gly-Gly) (Kim2020Structural). The secondary structure includes elements such as α-helices and β-strands, contributing to its overall stability and function (Kim2020Structural).

The tertiary structure of PLA2G2A is a compact, globular form stabilized by disulfide bonds, with a unique pattern that includes a specific bond between Cys 50 and Cys 133 (Kim2020Structural). This structure is crucial for its enzymatic activity, as it facilitates the formation of a catalytic dyad composed of histidine and aspartate, which are essential for substrate hydrolysis (Kim2020Structural).

PLA2G2A often functions as a homodimer, representing its quaternary structure (Kim2020Structural). The enzyme contains a calcium-binding domain that is critical for its activity, as calcium ions stabilize the intermediate and coordinate with the substrate during catalysis (Kim2020Structural). Common post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, can affect its function and stability (Kim2020Structural).

## Function
The PLA2G2A gene encodes the enzyme phospholipase A2 group IIA (sPLA2-IIA), which plays a significant role in host defense and inflammation. In healthy human cells, sPLA2-IIA is primarily involved in hydrolyzing phospholipids in bacterial membranes, particularly those rich in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which is abundant in Gram-positive bacteria. This activity is crucial for its bactericidal function, contributing to innate immunity by eliminating bacteria at physiological concentrations (Murakami2016The; Scott2021Human).

sPLA2-IIA is secreted by immune cells such as macrophages and platelets in response to proinflammatory stimuli, and it is highly expressed in exocrine glands like intestinal Paneth cells and tear glands, which are exposed to environmental bacteria (Murakami2016The; Scott2021Human). The enzyme's activity is largely extracellular, facilitated by its positive charge, which allows it to bind to anionic substrates on bacterial membranes (Scott2021Human).

In addition to its antimicrobial role, sPLA2-IIA is involved in the production of proinflammatory lipid mediators, such as arachidonic acid, which are precursors for eicosanoids. These mediators play a role in amplifying inflammation, although the enzyme's activity on normal cell membranes is limited due to its low affinity for phosphatidylcholine (Murakami2016The; Scott2021Human).

## Clinical Significance
PLA2G2A (phospholipase A2 group IIA) is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In rectal cancer, high PLA2G2A expression is associated with poor therapeutic response and outcomes in patients undergoing neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). It serves as an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival and local recurrence-free survival, indicating a more aggressive clinical course and resistance to treatment (He2015PLA2G2A).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with K-ras mutations, PLA2G2A expression is upregulated, correlating with poor clinical outcomes. This upregulation supports cancer cell survival by enhancing fatty acid synthesis and energy metabolism, making PLA2G2A a potential therapeutic target in K-ras-driven cancers (Zhang2022PLA2G2A).

In prostate cancer, elevated serum levels of PLA2G2A are linked to increased tumor grade and metastasis. A specific 5′UTR polymorphism in the PLA2G2A gene affects mRNA translation efficiency and protein levels, influencing cancer progression (Ozturk2020Association).

The role of PLA2G2A in cancer is complex, with both pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic effects observed in different tissues, necessitating further research to fully understand its implications (Wang2013Expression).

## Interactions
PLA2G2A, also known as secreted phospholipase A2 type IIA (sPLA2-IIA), engages in several significant protein interactions that influence its role in inflammation and cellular signaling. sPLA2-IIA directly binds to integrins such as αvβ3, α4β1, and α5β1 at a newly identified site (site 2), leading to integrin activation. This interaction is independent of sPLA2-IIA's catalytic activity and does not involve the classical RGD-binding site, suggesting an allosteric mechanism (Fujita2015Proinflammatory).

sPLA2-IIA also interacts with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), particularly glypican-1. This interaction is crucial for its role in prostaglandin biosynthesis, as it enhances arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin E2 generation in response to inflammatory stimuli (Murakami1999Functional).

In addition, sPLA2-IIA binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on cell surfaces, facilitating the eicosanoid pathway and promoting the release of arachidonic acid. This binding is driven by the protein's basic charge and is independent of its catalytic activity (Kim2020Structural). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PLA2G2A in inflammatory processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
