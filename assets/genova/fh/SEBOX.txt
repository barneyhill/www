# SEBOX

## Overview
SEBOX is a gene that encodes the SEBOX homeobox protein, a transcription factor integral to early embryonic development. This protein is categorized as a homeobox protein, which is known for its role in regulating gene expression during developmental processes. SEBOX is particularly involved in the regulation of maternal effect genes (MEGs) and the formation of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), a structure essential for early embryogenesis. Through its interactions with other transcription factors such as FIGLA, SEBOX influences the expression of key components of the SCMC, thereby playing a crucial role in the organization and regulation of translational machinery in oocytes and early embryos (Park2015Associations; Bebbere2016The). Additionally, SEBOX is implicated in the degradation of maternal mRNAs and the activation of the zygotic genome, processes vital for successful preimplantation development (Park2015Associations).

## Interactions
SEBOX is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in early embryogenesis by regulating the expression of maternal effect genes (MEGs). It is involved in the formation of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), a multiprotein structure crucial for early embryonic development. SEBOX influences the expression of SCMC components such as MATER and PADI6, suggesting its role in organizing and regulating the translational machinery in oocytes and early embryos (Bebbere2016The).

SEBOX also interacts with FIGLA, another transcription factor involved in SCMC formation. The upregulation of FIGLA in SEBOX-knockdown oocytes indicates that SEBOX may regulate SCMC component genes directly or indirectly through FIGLA (Park2015Associations). This interaction highlights SEBOX's role in the transcriptional regulation of genes essential for preimplantation development.

In SEBOX-knockdown embryos, there is inadequate degradation of maternal mRNAs and incomplete expression of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) markers, suggesting that SEBOX is involved in maternal mRNA degradation and ZGA (Park2015Associations). These findings underscore SEBOX's critical function in orchestrating the expression of MEGs and ensuring proper embryonic development.
