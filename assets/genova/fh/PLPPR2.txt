# PLPPR2

## Overview
PLPPR2, or phospholipid phosphatase-related 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the phospholipid phosphatase-related proteins (PLPPRs) family. This protein is primarily involved in lipid signaling pathways, with significant roles in neuronal development and function. Although PLPPR2 lacks catalytic activity against lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), it is implicated in the regulation of LPA signaling, which is crucial for neuronal processes such as cortical development and synapse transmission (Fuchs2022Plasma). The protein is predominantly localized in intracellular compartments, suggesting its involvement in intracellular signaling (Fuchs2022Plasma). Beyond its neuronal functions, PLPPR2 is also associated with metabolic changes and has been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer prognosis and muscle pathology (Vogel2021Histopathology; Meckelmann2020Metabolic; MuñozBello2024Potential).

## Function
PLPPR2, a member of the phospholipid phosphatase-related proteins (PLPPRs) family, is involved in lipid signaling pathways, particularly in the context of neuronal development and function. Although the specific function of PLPPR2 in healthy human cells is not fully elucidated, it is known to play a role in neuronal growth and excitability. PLPPR2 is expressed in various brain regions during development, including the hippocampus, neocortex, olfactory bulbs, and cerebellum, and its expression remains constant throughout development into adulthood (Fuchs2022Plasma).

PLPPR2 is involved in the regulation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling, a pathway crucial for neuronal functions such as cortical development and synapse transmission. Despite lacking catalytic activity against LPA, PLPPR2 may influence LPA signaling by binding directly to LPA or similar molecules (Fuchs2022Plasma). The protein is primarily localized in intracellular compartments when overexpressed, suggesting a role in intracellular signaling processes (Fuchs2022Plasma).

In addition to its neuronal roles, PLPPR2 expression is influenced by metabolic changes, such as those induced by ANRIL knockdown, which increases its expression in certain contexts (Meckelmann2020Metabolic). However, the precise molecular activities and organismal outcomes of PLPPR2 in healthy human cells remain to be fully characterized.

## Clinical Significance
PLPPR2 has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its altered expression levels. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), particularly in HPV-positive cases, high expression of PLPPR2 is associated with poor survival outcomes in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). A study identified PLPPR2 as one of 26 genes with high expression linked to decreased overall survival, forming part of a 60-gene signature used to predict survival outcomes in these patients (MuñozBello2024Potential).

In genetically engineered mice, the knockout of the Plppr2 gene results in widespread myopathy, characterized by muscle lesions, internalization of myocyte nuclei, and necrosis. These findings suggest a potential role for PLPPR2 in muscle integrity and function, with more severe effects observed in male mice compared to females (Vogel2021Histopathology).

Additionally, PLPPR2 has been identified in regions with significant genetic differentiation related to muscle growth and development in Lijiang pigs, indicating its potential involvement in muscle development pathways (Lan2024Muscle). While the specific clinical implications of PLPPR2 mutations in humans are not fully detailed, its expression patterns suggest a role in both cancer prognosis and muscle pathology.
