# P2RX4

## Overview
The P2RX4 gene encodes the purinergic receptor P2X 4, a ligand-gated ion channel that is part of the P2X receptor family. This receptor is primarily activated by extracellular ATP and is characterized by its trimeric structure, with each subunit containing two transmembrane segments and a large extracellular domain. The P2X4 receptor plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including synaptic transmission, cardiac function, and immune responses, by regulating ion flow, particularly Na+ and Ca2+, across cell membranes (Huang2014P2X4; Bragança2020Resolving). It is expressed in diverse cell types such as neurons, immune cells, and endothelial cells, and is involved in maintaining ion homeostasis and Ca2+-dependent signaling (Sophocleous2022The). The receptor's interactions with other proteins, including members of the P2X family, influence its function and cellular signaling pathways, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Kanellopoulos2021Structural; MurrellLagnado2008Assembly).

## Structure
The P2RX4 receptor is a trimeric ion channel activated by ATP, with each subunit comprising two transmembrane segments and a large extracellular domain. The primary structure of P2RX4 includes conserved residues that are crucial for its function (Habermacher2016Molecular). The secondary structure is characterized by alpha-helices in the transmembrane domains and beta-sheets in the extracellular domain, which is stabilized by disulfide bonds (Habermacher2016Molecular; Kanellopoulos2021Structural). 

The tertiary structure of P2RX4 reveals a unique 'dolphin' shape, with distinct regions such as the body, head, dorsal fin, and flippers, contributing to its functional architecture (Kanellopoulos2021Structural). The quaternary structure forms a trimeric assembly, with ATP binding sites located between subunits, facilitating the channel's opening upon ATP binding (Alves2014Structural; Habermacher2016Molecular).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are present in the ectodomain, contributing to the receptor's stability and function (Habermacher2016Molecular). The receptor's dynamics and function may be influenced by the absence of intracellular N- and C-termini in crystallographic studies, which are important for forming large-conductance pores (Alves2014Structural).

## Function
The P2RX4 gene encodes the P2X4 receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel activated by ATP, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, P2X4 receptors are involved in regulating ion flow, particularly Na+ and Ca2+, across the cell membrane, leading to membrane depolarization and activation of Ca2+-sensitive intracellular processes (Huang2014P2X4; Bragança2020Resolving). These processes include modulation of synaptic transmission, regulation of cardiac function, and immune responses (Sophocleous2022The; Huang2014P2X4).

P2X4 receptors are expressed in various cell types, including neurons, immune cells, and endothelial cells, and are crucial for maintaining ion homeostasis and Ca2+-dependent signaling (Sophocleous2022The; Bragança2020Resolving). They are also involved in lysosomal functions, where they form ATP-activated cation channels regulated by luminal pH, suggesting a role in membrane trafficking of acidic organelles (Huang2014P2X4).

In the immune system, P2X4 receptors contribute to T cell receptor signaling, T cell migration, and neutrophil chemoattraction, playing a protective role in conditions like sepsis by modulating inflammation and cytokine release (Kanellopoulos2021Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the P2RX4 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a rare haplotype involving the P2RX4 Tyr315Cys variant and the P2RX7 Gly150Arg variant is more frequently found in patients compared to healthy controls. This haplotype impairs the phagocytic function of macrophages and microglia, crucial for clearing subretinal deposits, thereby increasing susceptibility to AMD (Gu2013A). The P2RX4 Tyr315Cys mutation specifically affects the scavenger function of these cells, contributing to a chronic inflammatory environment and debris accumulation in the retina (Caseley2014NonSynonymous).

In cancer, particularly prostate cancer, the P2RX4 rs25644 allele GG is associated with a high risk of cancer but a low risk of recurrence. This variant influences inflammation and immune cell function, which are critical in the tumor microenvironment (Alharbi2021The). Increased expression of P2RX4 has been correlated with certain cancers, suggesting its role in cancer pathogenesis through pathways like CAD/P2XR4/ADCY1/Ca2+ signaling (Alharbi2021The).

P2RX4 is also implicated in cardiovascular conditions. The 1248A>G polymorphism, resulting in a Y315C substitution, is associated with high pulse pressure, a cardiovascular risk factor (Caseley2014NonSynonymous).

## Interactions
P2RX4, a purinergic receptor, is known to participate in various interactions with other proteins, particularly within the P2X receptor family. It forms heteromeric complexes with P2X5 and P2X6, which are stable even under harsh conditions, indicating strong interactions (Torres1999Heterooligomeric). P2RX4 also interacts with P2X7, although the nature of this interaction has been debated. Some studies suggest that P2RX4 and P2X7 can form heteromeric complexes, affecting receptor localization and function (Guo2007Evidence). However, other research indicates limited interaction between full-length P2RX4 and P2X7, with significant interactions observed only in specific configurations or truncated forms (Schneider2017Interaction).

P2RX4's interaction with P2X7 is significant in immune responses, as it can potentiate P2X7-dependent activation of inflammasomes, leading to increased cytokine release (Kanellopoulos2021Structural). The receptor is also involved in forming multi-protein signaling complexes, interacting with other ion channels and proteins from different structural classes, which influences receptor function and trafficking (MurrellLagnado2008Assembly). These interactions highlight P2RX4's role in modulating cellular signaling pathways and its potential impact on physiological processes.
