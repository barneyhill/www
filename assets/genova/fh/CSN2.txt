# CSN2

## Overview
The CSN2 gene encodes the protein casein beta, a phosphoprotein that is a major component of mammalian milk. Casein beta is categorized as a milk protein and plays a pivotal role in the formation and stabilization of casein micelles, which are essential for the transport and digestion of calcium and phosphate during lactation (Pauciullo2015Molecular). The gene is primarily expressed in the mammary gland, where it is regulated by various transcription factors to ensure proper milk production. The phosphorylation of casein beta is crucial for its function, as it facilitates the binding of calcium ions, thereby contributing to the nutritional and functional properties of milk (Pauciullo2014The). This protein's interactions with other casein proteins, such as kappa-casein, are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of milk, impacting both infant nutrition and the dairy industry.

## Structure


## Function
The CSN2 gene encodes the β-casein protein, a major component of milk, which plays a crucial role in the formation of micelles. These micelles are essential for the transport and digestion of calcium and phosphate, providing vital nutrients during lactation (Pauciullo2015Molecular). In healthy human cells, β-casein is active in the mammary gland, where it contributes to the nutritional and functional properties of milk, impacting infant nutrition and dairy product processing (Pauciullo2015Molecular).

The β-casein protein undergoes phosphorylation at specific serine residues, a modification that is important for its function and is shared with bovine β-casein (Pauciullo2014The). This phosphorylation is crucial for the stabilization of casein micelles, which are necessary for efficient calcium binding and transport (Pauciullo2015Molecular). The regulatory mechanisms of β-casein expression involve several transcription factor binding sites, such as CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) and Mammary Gland Factor/STAT5, which are important for its transcriptional activation in the mammary gland (Pauciullo2014The). These molecular processes ensure the proper synthesis and secretion of β-casein, supporting its role in milk production and lactation.

## Interactions
CSN2, or casein beta, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation of micelles in milk by interacting with calcium and other casein proteins. One of its significant interactions is with kappa-casein, forming complexes that are essential for the stability and digestion of milk. These interactions are vital for the structural integrity of casein micelles, which are necessary for the proper delivery of calcium and phosphate in milk. The interaction between CSN2 and kappa-casein is a key factor in the stabilization of these micelles, preventing the precipitation of calcium phosphate and ensuring the milk remains in a liquid state suitable for consumption and digestion. This interaction is not only important for the nutritional quality of milk but also for its processing and storage, as it affects the texture and stability of dairy products. The ability of CSN2 to form such complexes highlights its importance in dairy science and nutrition, as well as its potential implications in food technology and health.
