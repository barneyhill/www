# JMY

## Overview
JMY (junction mediating and regulatory protein) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and transcriptional regulation. The protein encoded by JMY is categorized as an actin nucleation factor and a transcription coactivator, playing a pivotal role in cellular processes such as cell motility, DNA damage response, and apoptosis. JMY facilitates actin filament assembly by activating the Arp2/3 complex and independently nucleating unbranched filaments, contributing to the formation of branched actin networks essential for cell movement (FiratKaralar2011The; Zuchero2009p53-cofactor). Additionally, JMY acts as a coactivator of the tumor suppressor protein p53, enhancing its transcriptional activity in response to DNA damage, thereby influencing cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Coutts2009A; King2020The). The dual localization of JMY in the cytoplasm and nucleus underscores its versatile role in both actin dynamics and transcriptional regulation, making it a critical component in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Coutts2009A; Zuchero2012Actin).

## Structure
The JMY protein is characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It contains a C-terminal WWWCA region, which comprises three tandem actin monomer-binding WH2 domains, a central connector domain, and an acidic region. These domains are crucial for JMY's ability to nucleate actin filaments and promote the nucleation activity of the Arp2/3 complex (FiratKaralar2011The; Zuchero2012Actin). The WH2 domains overlap with a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS), which regulates JMY's subcellular localization by blocking importins from binding to the NLS when actin monomers are bound (Zuchero2012Actin).

JMY also features a polyproline region and three central coiled-coil segments, which are involved in its function as a transcription coactivator in the p53 response (FiratKaralar2011The). The protein's structure allows it to nucleate unbranched actin filaments independently and activate the Arp2/3 complex to promote Y-branched actin networks (FiratKaralar2011The). JMY's activity is regulated by its N-terminal domain and central coiled-coil region, which may influence its function and localization (FiratKaralar2011The).

## Function
The JMY protein is a multifunctional actin nucleation factor that plays a significant role in cell motility and actin assembly in healthy human cells. It localizes to the leading edge of migrating cells, where it overlaps with filamentous actin, indicating its involvement in building the leading edge and enhancing cell motility. JMY's actin nucleation activity is crucial for this process, as it activates the Arp2/3 complex to create branched filament networks and can also assemble filaments directly using a Spire-like mechanism to create unbranched filaments (Zuchero2009p53-cofactor).

JMY also functions as a transcriptional co-activator of p53, a key protein in the DNA damage response. It enhances p53's transcriptional activity, particularly in the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, thus playing a role in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. JMY's nuclear presence is essential for its role in p53 transcriptional activity, while its cytoplasmic functions are related to actin dynamics and cell motility (Coutts2009A; King2020The).

In response to DNA damage, JMY accumulates in the nucleus, enhancing the p53 transcription response and reducing its role in cell motility, indicating a dual role in cytoplasmic and nuclear processes (Coutts2009A).

## Interactions
JMY (junction mediating and regulatory protein) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a cofactor of p53 and in actin regulation. JMY interacts with actin monomers and the Arp2/3 complex, facilitating actin nucleation and assembly. It can nucleate unbranched actin filaments independently and activate the Arp2/3 complex to form branched actin networks (FiratKaralar2011The). JMY's interaction with actin is mediated through its WH2 domains, which also regulate its nuclear import by competing with importins, particularly Impβ, for binding (Zuchero2012Actin).

JMY also interacts with the transcription factor p53 and its cofactor p300, enhancing p53-mediated transcriptional activation. This interaction is significant in the context of DNA damage and apoptosis, where JMY acts as a transcriptional coactivator of p53 (King2021The). Additionally, JMY competes with MRTF-A for actin binding, influencing MRTF-SRF transcriptional activity independently of actin polymerization (Kluge2018Regulation).

In apoptosis, JMY interacts with cytochrome c and caspase-3, forming cytoplasmic territories rich in F-actin, which are crucial for the activation of caspase-3 (King2021The). These interactions highlight JMY's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including actin dynamics, transcriptional regulation, and apoptosis.
