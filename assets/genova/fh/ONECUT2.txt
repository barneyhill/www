# ONECUT2

## Overview
ONECUT2 is a gene that encodes the one cut homeobox 2 protein, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression across various biological processes. This protein is characterized by its CUT and homeodomain (HOX) domains, which facilitate its binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing the transcription of target genes. ONECUT2 plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, adhesion, and differentiation, and is part of the ONECUT transcription factor family, which includes other members like hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 and ONECUT3. The protein is notably involved in the development of retinal ganglion cells and has significant implications in the progression of several cancers, including prostate, hepatocellular, and lung cancers, where it affects tumor growth and metastasis through various molecular pathways (Chatterjee2023The; Yu2020Emerging; Guo2019ONECUT2).

## Structure
The ONECUT2 (OC2) protein is a transcription factor involved in aggressive prostate cancer, characterized by a CUT domain and a homeodomain (HOX) that cooperatively bind DNA. The CUT domain consists of five alpha helices, with the alpha-3 helix and its flanking loops making extensive contacts with the DNA, primarily through hydrogen bonds formed by key residues such as Q353, S364, and D370 (Chatterjee2023The). The HOX domain, comprising three alpha helices, also interacts with DNA, with residues like N476 and an arginine pair (R479 and R480) forming base-specific hydrogen bonds (Chatterjee2023The).

The structural analysis reveals that the alpha-3 helix of the CUT domain undergoes significant reorganization upon DNA binding, highlighting its role in DNA interaction (Chatterjee2023The). The RR motif in the HOX domain is unique, with the first arginine providing flexibility to adapt to base variability and the second arginine interacting with a conserved guanine for sequence selectivity (Chatterjee2023The). The intact OC2 protein binds DNA with high affinity, characterized by a favorable enthalpy change, indicating stable hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions (Chatterjee2023The). The CUT domain initiates binding, inducing conformational changes that facilitate HOX domain interaction, leading to a stable DNA complex (Chatterjee2023The).

## Function
ONECUT2, also known as OC-2, is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression associated with various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and differentiation. It is part of the ONECUT transcription factor family, which also includes hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 and ONECUT3. The ONECUT2 protein is characterized by a one cut domain and an atypical homologous domain, which enable it to bind specific DNA sequences and stimulate the expression of target genes (Yu2020Emerging).

In healthy human tissues, ONECUT2 is primarily distributed in the gallbladder, duodenum, liver, and small intestines, with lower expression levels observed in the brain, pancreas, stomach, and testes. Its function in these tissues involves the regulation of processes crucial for normal cellular and tissue function, contributing to the development and maintenance of an organism (Yu2020Emerging).

In the context of retinal development, studies in mice have shown that ONECUT2, along with ONECUT1, is expressed during the development of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and is involved in their fate specification and differentiation. This suggests a role in establishing competence for RGC fate and potentially regulating genes not controlled by other known pathways (Wu2012Onecut).

## Clinical Significance
The ONECUT2 gene is implicated in the progression and prognosis of several cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In prostate cancer, ONECUT2 acts as a key driver of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), with its expression being significantly upregulated in NEPC compared to other prostate cancer types. This upregulation is associated with poor clinical outcomes and is linked to hypoxia signaling pathways, suggesting that targeting hypoxia could be a therapeutic strategy (Guo2019ONECUT2).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ONECUT2 facilitates metastasis by upregulating fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), contributing to poor prognosis. Targeting the ONECUT2 signaling pathway with FGFR1 and ACLY inhibitors has been suggested as a potential therapeutic approach (Liu2021ONECUT2).

ONECUT2 is also involved in lung cancer, where its overexpression is linked to shorter survival times in lung adenocarcinoma patients, particularly those with RAS-driven tumors and TP53 loss of function (Ma2019ONECUT2). In gastric cancer, ONECUT2 upregulation due to hypomethylation is associated with increased tumor growth, indicating its role in cancer progression (Seo2020ONECUT2).

## Interactions
ONECUT2 (one cut homeobox 2) is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene expression and cellular pathways. In prostate cancer, ONECUT2 interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), where it acts as a repressor of AR gene expression, potentially contributing to the development of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) by suppressing the AR axis (Yu2020Emerging). It also binds to the forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) promoter, inhibiting its expression, which is significant as FOXA1 is an inhibitor of neuroendocrine differentiation (Yu2020Emerging).

ONECUT2 is involved in the regulation of hypoxia-induced gene expression in NEPC cells by affecting HIF1α binding to chromatin. Although it does not alter HIF1α protein levels, it influences HIF1α genomic occupancy, which is reduced upon ONECUT2 knockdown. This regulation is mediated through the activation of SMAD3, a co-factor that modulates HIF1α binding (Guo2019ONECUT2).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ONECUT2 facilitates metastasis by upregulating FGF2 and ACLY. It directly binds to the promoters of these genes, enhancing their transcription. This interaction is crucial for HCC metastasis, as knockdown of FGF2 and ACLY inhibits the metastasis facilitated by ONECUT2 (Liu2021ONECUT2).
