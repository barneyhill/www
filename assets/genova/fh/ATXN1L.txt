# ATXN1L

## Overview
The ATXN1L gene encodes the ataxin 1-like protein, which is a member of the ATXN1 protein family. This protein is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. Ataxin 1-like is particularly important in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell function, extracellular matrix remodeling, and lung alveolarization. It interacts with key proteins such as Capicua (CIC) and TRIM25, influencing gene expression and protein stability. The protein is ubiquitously expressed, with notable abundance in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex, indicating its involvement in diverse biological pathways. Clinically, alterations in ATXN1L expression are linked to developmental abnormalities and cancer, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and developmental processes (Lee2011ATXN1; Felício2023Functional; Kahle2013Ataxin1L).

## Function
The ATXN1L gene encodes a protein that is part of the ATXN1 protein family, which plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. ATXN1L is involved in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function, acting as a negative regulator. In the absence of ATXN1L, HSCs exhibit enhanced activity, increased self-renewal capacity, and superior reconstituting activity, suggesting that ATXN1L normally functions to restrict the number and activity of blood-forming stem cells (Kahle2013Ataxin1L).

ATXN1L is also crucial for extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and lung alveolarization. It forms complexes with the transcriptional repressor CIC, which are important for regulating gene expression. The loss of ATXN1L leads to destabilization of CIC, resulting in the derepression of target genes, including those involved in ECM remodeling, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This regulation is essential for maintaining ECM integrity and preventing developmental abnormalities, such as defects in lung alveolarization (Lee2011ATXN1).

ATXN1L is expressed ubiquitously, with high levels in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex, indicating its involvement in various biological pathways and its importance in maintaining normal cellular and developmental processes (Felício2023Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ATXN1L gene have significant clinical implications. ATXN1L is crucial for normal lung development and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Loss of ATXN1L function leads to lung alveolarization defects, characterized by enlarged air spaces and reduced elastic fiber formation, due to the overexpression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes such as MMP9 and MMP12. These defects are associated with conditions like emphysema and are observed in Atxn1L-null mice (Lee2011ATXN1).

In cancer, ATXN1L plays a role in modulating sensitivity to MAPK pathway inhibitors. Its deletion leads to reduced CIC protein levels, resulting in increased expression of ETV transcription factors, which are normally repressed by CIC. This alteration can mediate resistance to MEK inhibitors, particularly in RAS- or BRAF-mutant tumors, and is associated with poor survival outcomes in BRAF mutant melanoma patients treated with MAPK inhibitors (Wang2017ATXN1L).

ATXN1L's interaction with CIC is also implicated in tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis, as mutations in the CIC gene have been identified in cancer patients. The downregulation of ATXN1L, along with ATXN1 and CIC, in certain cancers suggests that loss of their functions might contribute to tumorigenesis (Lee2011ATXN1).

## Interactions
ATXN1L interacts with the Capicua (CIC) protein, playing a crucial role in stabilizing CIC and enhancing its binding efficiency to promoter regions of target genes. This interaction is essential for the transcriptional repression of genes such as ETV4, DUSP6, and SPRY4. The absence of ATXN1L leads to reduced CIC binding to these promoter regions, indicating that ATXN1L is vital for CIC's DNA-binding capability (wong2020functional).

ATXN1L also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, which mediates CIC degradation. In ATXN1L knockout cells, there is increased interaction between CIC and TRIM25, leading to CIC degradation. This suggests that ATXN1L protects CIC from TRIM25-mediated degradation, independent of ERK activity (Wong2020TRIM25).

In addition to its interaction with CIC, ATXN1L is involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix remodeling and lung alveolarization through its role in the ATXN1/ATXN1L-CIC complex. This complex regulates the expression of Pea3 group genes, which are involved in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gene regulation (Lee2011ATXN1). ATXN1L's interaction with CIC and other proteins highlights its significant role in transcriptional regulation and protein stability.
