# SLC22A23

## Overview
SLC22A23 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 23, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family 22. This family is known for its role in the transport of organic ions across cellular membranes. The SLC22A23 protein is distinct within its family due to its unique structure, featuring only nine transmembrane regions compared to the typical twelve found in other family members, suggesting potential differences in transport mechanisms and binding sites (Jacobsson2007Identification). While the specific function of SLC22A23 remains to be fully elucidated, it is categorized under the organic anion transporter-related subfamily and is implicated in membrane ion transport, possibly contributing to cellular homeostasis and metabolic processes (Ekizoglu2018Investigation; Uchimura2024Knockout). The gene's expression is notably high in the liver and has been associated with various health conditions, including certain cancers and reproductive disorders, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Uchimura2024Knockout; Jacobsson2007Identification). Further research is necessary to clarify the precise biological roles and mechanisms of SLC22A23 in human health and disease (Yee2021Emerging).

## Structure
The SLC22A23 protein is a member of the solute carrier family 22, which typically features 12 transmembrane (TM) helices. However, SLC22A23 is noted for having a deviant topology with only 9 TM regions, distinguishing it from other family members (Jacobsson2007Identification). This structural difference suggests that SLC22A23 may have alternative transport mechanisms and binding sites. Unlike other SLC22 family members, SLC22A23 lacks the STIVTEW(D/N)LVC motif between TM1 and TM2, which may indicate a specific functional role or the absence of a common ligand binding site (Jacobsson2007Identification).

The protein is composed of 405 amino acids and is encoded by nine exons (Jacobsson2007Identification). The sequence is supported by one full-length mRNA and one partial mRNA from GenBank, along with 13 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (Jacobsson2007Identification). The SLC22A23 protein is phylogenetically isolated and lacks close paralogs, which may influence its function and regulation (Jacobsson2007Identification). The protein's expression has been detected in various tissues, with the highest levels observed in the liver (Jacobsson2007Identification).

## Function
The SLC22A23 gene is a member of the solute carrier 22 (SLC22) family, which is involved in the transport of organic ions across cellular membranes. This family is divided into subgroups based on their substrate specificity, including organic cation transporters (OCTs), organic anion transporters (OATs), and organic zwitterion transporters (OCTNs) (Ekizoglu2018Investigation). Although the specific function of SLC22A23 in healthy human cells is not well-documented, it is suggested to play a role in membrane transport, potentially requiring additional molecules or co-factors to exhibit functional activity (Ekizoglu2018Investigation).

SLC22A23 is categorized under the OAT-related subfamily, which includes other transporters like SLC22A17, SLC22A18, and SLC22A31 (Nigam2018The). The gene is associated with the transport of organic molecules and ions, similar to other members of the SLC22 family, and is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic processes (Ekizoglu2018Investigation). Despite its unclear specific substrate and role, SLC22A23 is believed to function as a membrane ion transporter, possibly related to organic anion transporters (Uchimura2024Knockout). Further research is needed to elucidate its precise function and mechanisms in healthy human cells (Yee2021Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC22A23 gene, part of the solute carrier family, is associated with various diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. Although the exact substrate and biological role of SLC22A23 remain unclear, its increased expression has been observed in certain cancers, such as endometrial stromal cells and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis (Uchimura2024Knockout). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLC22A23 gene have been linked to conditions like endometriosis, indicating its involvement in reproductive health disorders (Uchimura2024Knockout).

The gene's expression is notably increased in response to prenatal undernutrition, which may contribute to the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) phenotype, linking fetal nutritional stress to adult non-communicable diseases and psychiatric disorders (Uchimura2024Knockout). Despite these associations, the clinical significance of SLC22A23 in humans is not fully understood, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets (Yee2021Emerging).
