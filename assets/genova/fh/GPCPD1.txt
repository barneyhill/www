# GPCPD1

## Overview
GPCPD1, or glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase 1, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, specifically the hydrolysis of glycerophosphocholine into choline and glycerol-3-phosphate. This enzyme is categorized as a phosphodiesterase and plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular phospholipid balance and choline homeostasis, which are essential for various cellular functions, including membrane composition and signaling pathways (Cikes2021Glucose; Aisyah2024GDE5Gpcpd1). GPCPD1 is predominantly active in muscle tissues, where it contributes to glucose metabolism and insulin signaling, thereby influencing metabolic homeostasis and muscle function (Cikes2021Glucose; Aisyah2024GDE5Gpcpd1). Alterations in GPCPD1 expression have been linked to clinical conditions such as cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Wen2022Histone; Cikes2021Glucose).

## Function
GPCPD1, or glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase 1, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing glycerophosphocholine (GPC) into choline and glycerol-3-phosphate. This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining cellular phospholipid balance and choline homeostasis, which are vital for various cellular functions, including membrane composition and signaling pathways (Cikes2021Glucose; Aisyah2024GDE5Gpcpd1).

In healthy human cells, GPCPD1 is primarily active in muscle tissues, where it is involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling. The enzyme's activity ensures proper glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity, which are critical for maintaining metabolic homeostasis in muscle tissue. Disruption of the GPCPD1-GPC metabolic pathway can lead to impaired glucose metabolism, as evidenced by increased GPC levels in aged muscles and in individuals with type 2 diabetes (Cikes2021Glucose).

GPCPD1's role extends to influencing muscle function by regulating phosphatidylcholine composition, which affects muscle contractility and fatigue resistance. The enzyme's activity is linked to the regulation of glycolytic metabolites and glycerophospholipid profiles, highlighting its importance in muscle physiology and metabolic processes (Aisyah2024GDE5Gpcpd1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GPCPD1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer and metabolic disorders. In cancer, high expression levels of GPCPD1 are associated with increased metastasis and poor survival rates in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma. This is due to GPCPD1's role in generating choline, which promotes cancer cell migration and invasion. The histone methyltransferase GLP epigenetically activates GPCPD1, enhancing its expression and contributing to tumor progression. Knockdown of GPCPD1 or inhibition of GLP reduces cancer cell migration and invasion, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment (Wen2022Histone).

In metabolic disorders, GPCPD1 is involved in glucose metabolism, with its deficiency linked to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, particularly in aging and type 2 diabetes. Muscle-specific deficiency of GPCPD1 leads to the accumulation of glycerophosphocholine (GPC), impairing glucose uptake and insulin signaling in muscle tissues. This disruption in the GPCPD1-GPC metabolic pathway is observed in aged individuals and type 2 diabetic patients, indicating its role in age-related glucose intolerance and metabolic dysfunctions (Cikes2021Glucose).
