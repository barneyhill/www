# ATP6AP2

## Overview
ATP6AP2 is a gene that encodes the ATPase H+ transporting accessory protein 2, also known as the (pro)renin receptor. This protein is a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the assembly and function of the vacuolar-type H+-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is essential for acidifying intracellular compartments. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, autophagy, and glycosylation, by facilitating the proper assembly of the V-ATPase complex (Hirose2019ATP6AP2; Rujano2017Mutations). ATP6AP2 is highly expressed in the central nervous system and is crucial for neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity, underscoring its importance in CNS development and function (Hirose2019ATP6AP2). Mutations in ATP6AP2 are linked to several disorders, including glycosylation disorders and X-linked parkinsonism with spasticity, highlighting its clinical significance (Rujano2017Mutations; Korvatska2013Altered).

## Structure
ATP6AP2, also known as the (pro)renin receptor, is a type I transmembrane protein involved in the assembly of the vacuolar-type H+-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase). The protein consists of four domains: a signal peptide (SP), an extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane domain (TM), and a cytosolic domain (CD) (Kinouchi2013The). The ECD is crucial for the biogenesis of active V-ATPase, and mutations affecting this domain can lead to defects in V-ATPase assembly (Kinouchi2013The).

ATP6AP2 undergoes proteolytic cleavage in the Golgi apparatus, resulting in an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF). The NTF is secreted extracellularly, while the CTF remains membrane-bound (Kinouchi2013The). The protein's transmembrane anchor includes a long α-helix and a short α-helical turn connected by an extended linker with N-and C-terminal tails (Abbas2020Structure).

Post-translational modifications of ATP6AP2 include glycosylation, which is essential for its stability and function. Mutations in ATP6AP2 can lead to glycosylation disorders, affecting protein stability and leading to increased degradation (Rujano2017Mutations). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may influence its function in various cellular processes (Guida2018ATP6AP2).

## Function
ATP6AP2, also known as ATPase H+ transporting accessory protein 2, plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis by acting as an accessory subunit of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. This complex is essential for acidifying intracellular compartments, which is necessary for various cellular processes such as protein degradation, autophagy, and glycosylation (Rujano2017Mutations). ATP6AP2 is involved in the assembly of the V-ATPase complex, particularly the V0 sector, in the endoplasmic reticulum, ensuring proper V-ATPase function (Rujano2017Mutations).

In healthy human cells, ATP6AP2 supports lysosomal acidification, which is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating the degradation of endocytosed proteins (Hirose2019ATP6AP2). It is also implicated in regulating autophagic flux and mTOR signaling, with its deficiency leading to impaired lysosomal positioning and function (Hirose2019ATP6AP2). ATP6AP2 interacts with V-ATPase assembly factors to maintain efficient V-ATPase activity, supporting normal autophagic processes and mTOR signaling (Rujano2017Mutations).

The protein is highly expressed in the central nervous system and is essential for neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and memory functions, highlighting its importance in CNS development and function (Hirose2019ATP6AP2). ATP6AP2's role extends to various tissues, including pancreatic β cells, where it maintains cellular viability and is involved in pathways such as MAPK/ERK and PI3-AKT-mTOR (Taguchi2023ATP6AP2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP6AP2 gene are associated with several disorders, primarily due to its role in glycosylation and autophagy. ATP6AP2 mutations can lead to a glycosylation disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, liver disease, psychomotor impairment, and cutis laxa. These mutations result in hypoglycosylation of serum proteins and defects in autophagy, contributing to the clinical manifestations observed in patients (Rujano2017Mutations). 

The ATP6AP2 gene is also implicated in X-linked parkinsonism with spasticity (XPDS), where altered splicing leads to the overexpression of a minor isoform, affecting the V-ATPase complex and impairing protein degradation and autophagy, particularly in the brain's striatum (Korvatska2013Altered). 

Additionally, ATP6AP2 mutations can cause developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), characterized by severe epileptic seizures and developmental impairment. Synonymous variants in ATP6AP2 can lead to exon skipping and protein truncation, affecting physiological processes and contributing to the early onset of DEE (Liang2024Synonymous). 

These findings highlight the critical role of ATP6AP2 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its involvement in various genetic disorders.

## Interactions
ATP6AP2, also known as the (pro)renin receptor, is involved in several critical protein interactions. It plays a significant role in the assembly and function of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. ATP6AP2 interacts with ATP6AP1, a crucial interaction for the assembly of the V-ATPase complex, as demonstrated in yeast and Drosophila models (Guida2018ATP6AP2; Rujano2017Mutations). This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal regions of both proteins (Rujano2017Mutations). ATP6AP2 also interacts with V-ATPase subunits such as ATP6V0c and ATP6V0d1, requiring both its extracellular and transmembrane domains (Chen2020The).

In addition to its role in V-ATPase assembly, ATP6AP2 is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. It interacts with Wnt receptors like LRP6 and frizzled, which are essential for this signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for the trafficking and stabilization of the LRP6/β-catenin protein complex, particularly in bone formation and differentiation (Xiong2024ATP6AP2). ATP6AP2's interactions extend to various cellular processes, including protein degradation and neuronal survival, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis (Hirose2019ATP6AP2).
