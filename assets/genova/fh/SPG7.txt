# SPG7

## Overview
The SPG7 gene encodes the protein paraplegin, a mitochondrial metalloprotease that is part of the AAA (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) protein family. Paraplegin plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, particularly in the assembly and activity of the mitochondrial m-AAA protease complex, which is essential for protein quality control and ribosome maturation within mitochondria (Karlberg2009Crystal; Koppen2007Variable). As a metalloprotease, paraplegin is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), impacting cellular energy metabolism and apoptosis (Shanmughapriya2015SPG7; Hurst2019SPG7). Mutations in the SPG7 gene are linked to various neurodegenerative disorders, including hereditary spastic paraplegia and cerebellar ataxia, highlighting its clinical significance (van2012Genotype–phenotype; Elleuch2006Mutation).

## Structure
The SPG7 gene encodes paraplegin, a mitochondrial metalloprotease that is part of the AAA (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) protein family. The primary structure of paraplegin includes a conserved AAA domain, which is crucial for its function (Karlberg2009Crystal). The secondary structure of the AAA domain is characterized by a five-stranded parallel beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices, along with a C-terminal bundle of four antiparallel alpha-helices (Karlberg2009Crystal). 

In terms of tertiary structure, paraplegin forms a hexameric ring, which is typical for proteins in the AAA family. This hexameric formation is essential for its role in substrate binding and chemomechanical coupling (Karlberg2009Crystal). The quaternary structure involves the formation of hetero-oligomeric complexes with other proteins, such as AFG3L2, but not as a homomeric complex (Hurst2019SPG7). 

Paraplegin is involved in the assembly of the mitochondrial m-AAA protease complex, which is crucial for protein quality control and ribosome maturation within mitochondria (Koppen2007Variable). The protein does not form functional homo-oligomers but interacts with AFG3L2 to form active proteolytic complexes (Hurst2019SPG7).

## Function
The SPG7 gene encodes a protein known as paraplegin, which is a component of the mitochondrial matrix ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities (m-AAA) protease complex. This complex is crucial for the processing and assembly of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), which regulates calcium influx into mitochondria, a key factor in maintaining mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and regulating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) (Hurst2019SPG7). SPG7 interacts with other proteins such as cyclophilin D (CypD) and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1), forming a complex essential for mPTP function, which is involved in mitochondrial calcium retention and response to oxidative stress (Shanmughapriya2015SPG7).

In healthy human cells, SPG7 plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function by regulating calcium dynamics and mPTP activity, which are important for cellular energy metabolism and apoptosis regulation (Shanmughapriya2015SPG7; Hurst2019SPG7). The loss of SPG7 can lead to altered mitochondrial calcium handling and increased resistance to calcium-induced mPTP opening, highlighting its role in cellular stress responses (Shanmughapriya2015SPG7; Hurst2019SPG7).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPG7 gene are associated with a range of neurodegenerative conditions, primarily hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and cerebellar ataxia. SPG7 mutations can lead to both pure and complicated forms of HSP, characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs, often accompanied by additional symptoms such as cerebellar ataxia, optic neuropathy, and peripheral neuropathy (van2012Genotype–phenotype; Elleuch2006Mutation). The gene is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, but there is evidence suggesting it may also cause autosomal dominant HSP (Estiar2021Evidence).

SPG7 mutations have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to conditions like chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) and spastic ataxia. These mutations can result in mitochondrial DNA maintenance disorders, leading to symptoms such as ptosis, proximal muscle weakness, and swallowing difficulties (Pfeffer2014Mutations). The p.(Ala510Val) variant is notably prevalent among patients with these conditions (Estiar2021Evidence).

SPG7 mutations are also implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with some patients exhibiting cortical atrophy patterns suggestive of frontotemporal dementia (Osmanovic2020SPG7). The broad clinical spectrum of SPG7-related disorders poses challenges for genetic counseling and diagnosis (Estiar2021Evidence).

## Interactions
SPG7, also known as paraplegin, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for mitochondrial function. It is a component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) complex, interacting with Cyclophilin D (CypD) and Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 (VDAC1). These interactions are essential for PTP opening, with SPG7 binding to CypD in the mitochondrial matrix and VDAC1 at the contact sites between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (Shanmughapriya2015SPG7). The interaction with CypD is particularly significant, as it is sensitive to the CypD inhibitor Cyclosporin A, indicating a direct binding relationship (Shanmughapriya2015SPG7).

SPG7 is also part of the m-AAA protease complex, where it interacts with AFG3L2. This complex is involved in the processing of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), affecting calcium influx and mitochondrial permeability transition pore regulation (Hurst2019SPG7). SPG7's interaction with MCU and its components, such as EMRE, MICU1, and MCUR1, is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and mPTP function (Hurst2019SPG7). These interactions highlight SPG7's role in both protein quality control and mitochondrial dynamics.
