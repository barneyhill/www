# FAM184A

## Overview
FAM184A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 184 member A. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of ciliogenesis, a critical process for the formation and function of cilia in human cells. FAM184A is associated with centriolar satellites, structures essential for cilia formation, and interacts with DNAJC27, a novel regulator of ciliogenesis. The protein's localization to centriolar satellites and its role in maintaining cilia length underscore its importance in cellular processes related to cilia. The presence of FAM184A orthologs exclusively in organisms with primary cilia suggests an evolutionary adaptation to support ciliogenesis (Piette2021Comprehensive). Additionally, variations in FAM184A have been linked to several diseases, including Parkinson's disease and brain injuries, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Ek2024Novel; Markopoulou2021Variable).

## Structure


## Function
FAM184A is involved in the regulation of ciliogenesis, a process crucial for the formation and function of cilia in human cells. It interacts with DNAJC27, a novel regulator of ciliogenesis, and is associated with centriolar satellites, which are key structures in cilia formation. Depletion of FAM184A in hTERT RPE1 cells results in significantly shorter cilia, indicating its essential role in maintaining cilia length and function (Piette2021Comprehensive). FAM184A co-localizes with PCM1, a master assembly factor of centriolar satellites, suggesting that it is a satellite-specific protein involved in the assembly and maintenance of these structures (Piette2021Comprehensive).

The localization of FAM184A to centriolar satellites is dependent on DNAJC27, as its depletion reduces the overlap of FAM184A with PCM1 foci, highlighting the interdependent roles of these proteins in ciliogenesis (Piette2021Comprehensive). The presence of FAM184A orthologs only in organisms with primary cilia suggests an evolutionary adaptation to support ciliogenesis, underscoring its importance in cellular processes related to cilia (Piette2021Comprehensive). These findings suggest that FAM184A plays a significant role in the regulation of ciliogenesis and centriolar satellite function in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
FAM184A has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its genetic variations and expression alterations. In Parkinson's disease (PD), variants of FAM184A are significantly associated with motor symptoms such as chorea and severe dyskinesia, with p-values of 3.55 × 10^-4 and 1.71 × 10^-4, respectively. This suggests a potential role for FAM184A in the manifestation of these symptoms, although it is not a central node in protein-protein interaction networks related to PD (Markopoulou2021Variable).

In the context of brain injury, FAM184A has been identified as a potential biomarker for severe injuries in a sheep model of intrauterine asphyxia. Its high expression levels are associated with severe brain injuries, indicating its potential as a biomarker, though further validation is needed (Ek2024Novel).

FAM184A is also mentioned in studies on endometrial cancer as part of a prognostic gene signature, although specific details about its clinical significance in this context are limited (Liu2019Identification). Additionally, it has been identified in the 'cases_only' set in a study on tick-borne encephalitis, suggesting a potential involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Ignatieva2019Exomewide).
