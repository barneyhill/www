# SPANXB1

## Overview
SPANXB1 is a gene that encodes the SPANX family member B1 protein, which is part of the cancer-testis antigen (CTA) family. This protein is primarily expressed in testicular tissue and is involved in spermatogenesis, particularly during the later stages of meiosis. The SPANXB1 protein is associated with chromatin remodeling and sperm maturation, playing a role in sperm motility and fertility (Salemi2009SPANXB; Lucotte2018Dynamic). Additionally, SPANXB1 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, where it is involved in promoting metastasis and cell migration (Yi2023Therapeutic; Wang2022Screening). The gene exhibits extensive copy number variations, which may influence its expression and function in reproductive biology and cancer (Lucotte2018Dynamic). Despite its recognized roles, the precise molecular mechanisms and cellular processes involving SPANXB1 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Hansen2007A).

## Function
The SPANXB1 gene is involved in spermatogenesis, particularly during the later stages of meiosis. It is expressed in pachytene spermatocytes during meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) and its expression increases significantly during postmeiotic sex chromosome reactivation (PSCR), suggesting a role in chromatin remodeling and sperm maturation (Lucotte2018Dynamic). The SPANXB1 protein is part of the SPANX gene family, which is located on the X chromosome and is associated with testicular germ cell development. These proteins are expressed in sperm cells and are believed to influence sperm motility and fertility, although their specific function in healthy human cells remains undetermined (Salemi2009SPANXB).

The SPANXB1 gene exhibits extensive copy number variations (CNVs) within human populations, which may affect its expression levels and function. These CNVs are particularly notable in testis-expressed genes, indicating a potential role in reproductive biology (Lucotte2018Dynamic). Despite the high degree of sequence conservation and expression in testicular tissue, the precise molecular mechanisms and cellular processes involving SPANXB1 in healthy human cells are not fully understood (Hansen2007A).

## Clinical Significance
SPANXB1 has been implicated in various conditions related to its altered expression levels. In hypogonadic patients, SPANXB1 is found to be up-regulated, which is associated with defective spermatogenesis. This suggests that changes in SPANXB1 abundance may reflect dysregulation in spermatogenesis processes, potentially contributing to male infertility (Grande2022The).

In cancer biology, SPANXB1 is classified as a cancer-testis antigen (CTA) and has been found in extracellular vesicles in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), where it promotes a metastatic phenotype. This indicates that SPANXB1 may influence the tumor microenvironment to enhance metastasis, although specific clinical implications of SPANXB1 mutations or expression changes in cancer are not fully detailed (Nin2023Biology).

The SPANX gene family, to which SPANXB1 belongs, is also noted for its expression in testicular tissue and its potential involvement in cancer, such as melanoma and prostate cancer, due to its role in cell proliferation and immune evasion. However, the specific clinical significance of SPANXB1 mutations or interactions in these cancers is not explicitly addressed in the provided context (Jodar2017Semen).

## Interactions
SPANXB1 is involved in several interactions that contribute to its role in cancer and cellular processes. It has been identified as a potential target of the metastasis suppressor endophilin-A1 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The depletion of SPANXB1 by siRNA leads to increased expression of endophilin-A1 and a reduction in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) promoters such as RAC1, α-actin, vinculin, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), indicating its role in promoting cell migration and invasion (Yi2023Therapeutic).

SPANXB1 is also part of the SPANX family, which interacts with LMNA, a protein involved in nuclear structure and function. This interaction may influence metastasis and cell proliferation by affecting LMNA's interaction with other proteins like BANF1 and EMD, which are involved in chromatin organization and nuclear assembly (Unknownauthors2020SPANXRegulationofLAMINACNetwork:PerspectivesinCancerandLaminopathies).

In the context of breast cancer brain metastases, SPANXB1 is one of the genes associated with worse metastasis-free survival. Knockdown experiments have shown that SPANXB1 significantly inhibits cell migration, highlighting its potential role in metastasis (Wang2022Screening).
