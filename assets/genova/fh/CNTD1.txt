# CNTD1

## Overview
The CNTD1 gene encodes the Cyclin N-Terminal Domain-Containing 1 protein, which plays a pivotal role in meiotic processes, particularly in crossover formation and cell cycle regulation. Unlike typical cyclins, CNTD1 functions independently of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), despite possessing a cyclin-like N-terminal domain. This protein is crucial for ensuring accurate genetic recombination and chromosome segregation during meiosis, as it interacts with various proteins and complexes, such as the Cullin1 ubiquitin ligase and Replication Factor C (RFC) complexes, to modulate crossover formation and cell cycle checkpoints (Gray2019Cyclin). The gene is expressed in a truncated form in vivo, which lacks the N-terminal domain, highlighting its unique evolutionary adaptation and functional significance across species (Gray2020Cyclin). The absence or malfunction of CNTD1 can lead to meiotic errors and infertility, underscoring its critical role in reproductive biology (Wood2023CNTD1).

## Structure
The CNTD1 protein is characterized by a cyclin-like N-terminal domain, which is crucial for its function in cell cycle regulation. This domain is typically involved in binding and activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), although CNTD1 operates in a cyclin-independent manner. The protein is encoded by a 7-exon gene and has a predicted full-length form of 334 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 40 kDa. However, in vivo studies have identified a predominant short form of CNTD1, which is 249 amino acids in length and lacks the N-terminal cyclin homology domain, resulting in a molecular weight of approximately 30 kDa (Wood2023CNTD1; Gray2019Cyclin).

The short form of CNTD1 is produced due to the use of an alternative start codon near the beginning of exon 3, leading to a protein that does not interact with CDKs like CDK2 or CDK4 (Gray2020Cyclin). This truncated isoform is conserved across several species, indicating its evolutionary significance (Gray2020Cyclin). The protein forms discrete foci along pachytene chromosomes during meiosis, suggesting a role in crossover formation (Gray2019Cyclin). The cyclin box fold, a structural motif found in cyclin proteins, is present in CNTD1 and is important for its function and interaction with other proteins (Bondarieva2020Prolinerich).

## Function
The CNTD1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in meiotic crossover formation and cell cycle progression, particularly during prophase I of meiosis. In mammalian cells, CNTD1 is essential for the maturation of meiotic crossovers and the deselection of excess pre-crossover sites, ensuring proper genetic recombination and diversity. It collaborates with proteins such as HEI10 and RNF212 to regulate crossover site selection and maturation, which is critical for accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis (Holloway2014Mammalian).

CNTD1 functions in a cyclin-independent manner, interacting with components of the Cullin1 ubiquitin ligase complex and the Replication Factor C (RFC) complex. These interactions facilitate the regulation of crossover formation and cell cycle progression by modulating the activity of key proteins like WEE1 kinase, which is involved in cell cycle checkpoints (Gray2019Cyclin).

In female meiosis, CNTD1 is critical for prophase I progression and the establishment of the ovarian reserve. It is involved in the repair of double-strand breaks and the proper loading of crossover designation factors such as MutLγ, which are essential for class I crossover resolution (Wood2023CNTD1). The absence of CNTD1 leads to meiotic errors and infertility due to disrupted crossover formation and synapsis maintenance (Wood2023CNTD1).

## Interactions
The Cyclin N-Terminal Domain-Containing 1 (CNTD1) protein is involved in several critical interactions during meiosis. CNTD1 interacts with the proline-rich protein PRR19, forming a complex essential for meiotic crossing over in mice. This interaction is supported by co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays, indicating a physical association between the two proteins (Bondarieva2020Prolinerich).

CNTD1 also interacts with itself, as demonstrated in yeast two-hybrid assays, suggesting that it may form homodimers or multimers (Bondarieva2020Prolinerich). Additionally, CNTD1 is involved in interactions with the Replication Factor C (RFC) complex, particularly with RFC3 and RFC4, which are important for DNA mismatch repair during meiosis (Gray2019Cyclin).

Despite being a distant member of the cyclin family, CNTD1 does not bind cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in a traditional manner due to the absence of the N-terminal cyclin domain in its predominant isoform in mice. However, it does interact with CDK2, specifically the 39-kDa isoform, in a manner that does not require CDK2's catalytic activity (Bondarieva2020Prolinerich). These interactions highlight CNTD1's role in coordinating meiotic crossover formation with cell cycle progression.
