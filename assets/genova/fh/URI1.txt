# URI1

## Overview
The URI1 gene encodes the URI1 prefoldin-like chaperone, a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation and protein complex assembly. As a member of the prefoldin family, URI1 functions as a molecular chaperone, facilitating the proper folding and stabilization of proteins within the cell (ChavesPérez2018Roles). The protein is characterized by its prefoldin-like domain, which is essential for its chaperone activity, and its ability to interact with the RPB5 subunit of RNA polymerase II, thereby influencing gene expression and chromatin remodeling (Thomas2018Role; Mita2013Analysis). URI1 is also a component of the PAQosome complex, which plays a critical role in the assembly and maturation of multiprotein complexes (ChavesPérez2018Roles). Beyond its structural and regulatory functions, URI1 is implicated in nutrient signaling pathways, such as the mTOR pathway, linking nutrient availability to cellular growth and metabolism (ChavesPérez2018Roles). The gene's dysregulation is associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tummala2014Inhibition; Theurillat2011URI).

## Structure
The URI1 protein, also known as the URI1 prefoldin-like chaperone, is characterized by several conserved domains that contribute to its function. It contains a prefoldin-like domain (PFD), an RPB5 interaction region, and a URI box, all of which are evolutionarily conserved across species (ChavesPérez2018Roles). The prefoldin-like domain is crucial for URI1's chaperone activity and its interaction with other proteins, such as PDRG1, where it stabilizes the protein through its hook-shaped beta strands (Mita2013Analysis).

URI1 is part of a heterohexameric chaperone complex known as the PAQosome, which includes two α subunits (URI and STAP1) and four β subunits (PFDN2, PFDN6, and PFDN4r) (ChavesPérez2018Roles). This complex is involved in the assembly and maturation of multiprotein complexes in mammalian cells. URI1 also contains nuclear (NLS) and cytoplasmic (CLS) localization signals, with the CLS being dominant, indicating its primary localization in the cytoplasm (ChavesPérez2018Roles).

Post-translational modifications of URI1 include phosphorylation and acetylation, which are essential for its function and may influence its role in nuclear processes (Mita2013Analysis). These structural features and modifications highlight URI1's role in cellular homeostasis and stress response.

## Function
The URI1 protein, also known as the unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor, plays a significant role in transcription regulation and cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, URI1 functions as a transcriptional regulator by interacting with RNA polymerase II and the RPB5 subunit, influencing gene expression and chromatin remodeling (Thomas2018Role; Mita2016URI). URI1 is part of a multiprotein complex that includes components like UXT and KAP1, which are involved in transcriptional repression and chromatin structure maintenance (Thomas2018Role).

URI1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it coordinates cellular processes related to metabolism, proliferation, and gene expression (Mita2016URI). In the cytoplasm, URI1 is involved in the assembly of RNA polymerase II, while in the nucleus, it regulates transcription by modulating the phosphorylation of KAP1 through the recruitment of PP2A phosphatase (Mita2016URI). This regulation is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and repressing retrotransposons, which are typically dormant in somatic cells (Mita2016URI).

URI1 also plays a role in nutrient signaling pathways, particularly the mTOR pathway, where it is phosphorylated in response to insulin signaling, linking nutrient availability to gene expression and cell growth (ChavesPérez2018Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the URI1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. In ovarian cancer, URI1 is identified as an oncogene that is frequently amplified and overexpressed. This amplification is observed in approximately 10% of ovarian carcinomas, with overexpression detected in nearly 40% of cases. Such alterations are associated with higher tumor grades, broader spread, and poor response to chemotherapy, correlating with poor disease-specific survival (Theurillat2011URI). URI1 amplification disrupts the negative feedback mechanism regulating S6K1 signaling, enhancing cell survival and resistance to apoptosis, which contributes to chemotherapy resistance (Theurillat2011URI).

In liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), URI1 overexpression is linked to poor prognosis. It induces DNA damage and NAD+ depletion, critical factors in liver tumorigenesis. High URI1 expression correlates with increased DNA damage markers and is associated with hepatitis B and C virus-related HCC, suggesting a role in viral infection-induced liver cancer (Tummala2014Inhibition). These findings highlight the potential of URI1 as a therapeutic target in cancers where it is overexpressed or amplified.

## Interactions
URI1, also known as Unconventional prefoldin RPB5 Interactor, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in transcriptional regulation and other cellular processes. URI1 interacts with the RPB5 subunit of RNA polymerase II, forming part of the R2TP/prefoldin-like complex, which is crucial for the assembly of RNA polymerase II (Mita2013Analysis). It also binds to and stabilizes the PDRG1 protein, suggesting a role in maintaining the stability of this complex (Mita2013Analysis).

In prostate cancer cells, URI1 interacts with KAP1/TRIM28, a protein involved in gene repression, and modulates its phosphorylation through the recruitment of PP2A phosphatase, affecting KAP1's ability to recruit repression complexes (Mita2016URI). URI1 also interacts with ART-27/UXT and components of the R2TP/prefoldin-like complex, which are important for RNA polymerase II complex assembly (Mita2016URI).

In yeast, the homologous protein Uri1p interacts with translation initiation factors such as eIF1A and components involved in protein quality control, indicating a role in translation initiation and cotranslational quality control (Deplazes2009Yeast). These interactions highlight URI1's multifaceted role in cellular processes across different species.
