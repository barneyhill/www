# CERS3

## Overview
CERS3, or ceramide synthase 3, is a gene that encodes the enzyme ceramide synthase 3, which is integral to the synthesis of very long-chain ceramides. These ceramides are crucial components of the epidermal lipid barrier, playing a significant role in maintaining skin integrity and function. The CERS3 protein is categorized as an integral membrane protein and is predominantly expressed in the epidermis and testis, where it contributes to skin lipid synthesis and spermatogenesis. It is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and characterized by several transmembrane domains, which facilitate its role in lipid synthesis. The enzyme's activity is essential for the formation of the cornified lipid envelope and extracellular lipid lamellae, structures vital for the skin's barrier function. Mutations in the CERS3 gene are associated with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, highlighting its clinical significance in skin disorders and its broader role in epidermal homeostasis (Jennemann2011Loss; Radner2013Mutations; Dubot2019Inherited).

## Structure
The CERS3 protein is an integral membrane protein involved in the synthesis of very long-chain ceramides, crucial for maintaining the skin's barrier function. It is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is characterized by several transmembrane domains, which facilitate its role in lipid synthesis (Radner2013Mutations; Stiban2010Ceramide). The protein includes a Tram-Lag-CLN8 (TLC) domain, essential for its acyl CoA specificity, and a Lag1p motif within this domain, which is critical for its enzymatic activity (Stiban2010Ceramide; Park2014Ceramide).

CERS3 is expressed predominantly in the epidermis and testis, where it plays a significant role in skin lipid synthesis and spermatogenesis (Stiban2010Ceramide; Mullen2012Ceramide). The protein's activity is regulated through post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can modulate its function (Stiban2010Ceramide). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of CERS3 are not provided, its functional domains and membrane topology are well-documented, highlighting its importance in sphingolipid metabolism and skin physiology (Radner2013Mutations; Mullen2012Ceramide).

## Function
Ceramide synthase 3 (CERS3) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the synthesis of very long-chain ceramides, which are essential components of the epidermal lipid barrier. In healthy human cells, CERS3 is primarily active in the epidermis, where it is involved in the formation of the cornified lipid envelope (CLE) and extracellular lipid lamellae (ELL), structures vital for maintaining the skin's barrier function (Jennemann2011Loss). CERS3 catalyzes the N-acylation of dihydrosphingosine with acyl-CoAs ranging from long to very long aliphatic chains (C18-C28), contributing to the normal sphingolipid profile of the epidermis (Radner2013Mutations).

CERS3 is localized at the interface between the stratum granulosum and the stratum corneum, where it facilitates the production of ceramides necessary for the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes (Radner2013Mutations). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the formation and maintenance of the lipid lamellae in the stratum corneum, which is essential for the skin's permeability barrier function (Yamamoto2021Comprehensive). The absence of CERS3 activity can lead to impaired skin barrier function, highlighting its importance in epidermal homeostasis and protection against environmental insults (Jennemann2011Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CERS3 gene are linked to autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), a group of skin disorders characterized by abnormal keratinization and scaling of the skin. Patients with CERS3 mutations often present with symptoms such as collodion membranes at birth, generalized erythema, scaling, and localized hyperkeratosis (Radner2013Mutations; Dubot2019Inherited). Histological analyses of affected individuals reveal abnormal skin morphology, including acanthosis and psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, due to the absence of functional CERS3 protein, which leads to a significant reduction in very long-chain ceramides essential for skin barrier function (Radner2013Mutations).

In addition to skin disorders, CERS3 mutations can also affect spermatogenesis, leading to increased apoptosis during meiosis and spermatogenic arrest (Dubot2019Inherited). A contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving CERS3 and ADAMTS17 has been observed, resulting in a combination of ichthyosiform skin abnormalities and Weill-Marchesani-like syndrome symptoms (Astudillo2014Human; Radner2013Mutations). The loss of CERS3 function disrupts the synthesis of ultra-long-chain ceramides, compromising the skin's barrier integrity and increasing susceptibility to infections (Jennemann2011Loss).

## Interactions
Ceramide synthase 3 (CERS3) interacts with acyl-coenzyme A-binding protein (ACBP) to regulate the synthesis of very-long-chain ceramides. ACBP activates CERS3 by binding to very-long-chain acyl-CoA esters, which is essential for stimulating CERS3 activity. This interaction is specific, as demonstrated by the inability of liver-type fatty-acid-binding protein-1 (FABP1) to substitute for ACBP in activating CERS3. The interaction between CERS3 and ACBP has been localized to the perinuclear/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) region using a proximity ligation assay (PLA) (Ferreira2017Regulation).

CERS3 also forms a functional complex with ceramide synthase 2 (CerS2) and elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 1 (ELOVL1), which promotes the coordinated synthesis of very-long-chain acyl-CoA esters and ceramides. This complex is crucial for ceramide synthesis and is primarily stimulated by ACBP in liver cytosol (Ferreira2017Regulation).

Mutations in CERS3, such as a genomic microdeletion affecting a coiled-coil structure, suggest potential protein-protein interactions that facilitate dimerization, although specific interactions with DNA or other proteins via this motif are not detailed (Radner2013Mutations).
