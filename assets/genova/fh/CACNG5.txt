# CACNG5

## Overview
CACNG5 is a gene that encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit gamma 5, a protein that belongs to the gamma subunit family of voltage-gated calcium channels. This protein plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of these channels, which are essential for the regulation of calcium ion flow across cell membranes. The CACNG5 protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is primarily active in excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells, where it contributes to processes like muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression (Dong2018Suppressed). Additionally, CACNG5 is involved in the modulation of AMPA receptors in the central nervous system, influencing their gating and trafficking as part of the transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) (Templin2012Patterned). The gene has been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Curtis2011Case–case; Dong2018Suppressed).

## Function
CACNG5 encodes a protein that is part of the gamma subunit family of voltage-gated calcium channels, which are crucial for regulating calcium ion flow across cell membranes. This regulation is essential for various cellular processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. The CACNG5 protein modulates channel activity and is primarily active in the cell membrane, contributing to the proper functioning of excitable cells like neurons and muscle cells (Dong2018Suppressed).

In the central nervous system, CACNG5 is involved in the modulation of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which are critical for fast excitatory neurotransmission. As a member of the transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs), CACNG5 influences the gating and trafficking of AMPARs, potentially altering their biophysical properties by stabilizing specific conformations (Templin2012Patterned). This modulation can affect the desensitization kinetics and steady-state currents of AMPARs, as observed in specific brain regions like the hippocampus (Jackson2011The).

CACNG5 also plays a role in the MAPK signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It has been implicated in the regulation of neuronal apoptosis and inflammation, suggesting a protective role in neuronal tissues (Dong2018Suppressed).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CACNG5 gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. CACNG5 is associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, with genetic markers near this gene showing significant associations in studies comparing these conditions (Curtis2011Case–case). The gene is also involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, where it interacts with microRNA-96 (miR-96) to regulate the MAPK signaling pathway. Suppression of miR-96, which targets CACNG5, has been shown to inhibit apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons, suggesting a protective role against Parkinson's disease progression (Dong2018Suppressed).

In epilepsy, polymorphisms in CACNG5, such as rs740805, have been linked to poor response to anti-epileptic drugs, indicating its potential role in drug resistance (p&gt; Genetic; ALEitan2020&lt). Additionally, CACNG5 is part of the 17q24.2 microdeletion syndrome, which is characterized by intellectual disability, mood swings, and hallucinations, among other symptoms (Vergult201117q24.2). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in various neurological conditions, suggesting it as a potential target for therapeutic interventions.
