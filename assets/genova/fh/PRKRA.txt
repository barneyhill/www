# PRKRA

## Overview
The PRKRA gene encodes the protein activator of interferon-induced protein kinase EIF2AK2, commonly referred to as PACT. This protein is a crucial component of the cellular stress response and RNA interference pathways. As a double-stranded RNA-binding protein, PACT is involved in the activation of the protein kinase EIF2AK2 (PKR), which plays a significant role in the integrated stress response by modulating protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α). Additionally, PACT is implicated in the RNA silencing pathway, interacting with key components such as Dicer and hAgo2 to facilitate microRNA processing and RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) assembly. Mutations in the PRKRA gene have been linked to Dystonia 16 (DYT16), a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions, highlighting its clinical significance (Lee2006The; Frederick2023Luteolin; Zech2014DYT16).

## Structure
The PRKRA protein, also known as PACT in humans, is characterized by its ability to bind double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) and activate the protein kinase EIF2AK2 (PKR). Structurally, PRKRA contains three tandem double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs). The first two domains are primarily responsible for binding dsRNA, while the third domain facilitates dimerization and protein-protein interactions (Lu2024Prkra). 

The secondary structure of PRKRA includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of RNA-binding proteins. The tertiary structure is organized to allow efficient interaction with dsRNA and other proteins, such as PKR. The quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is crucial for its function in sequestering eIF2 complexes from the translation machinery, leading to global inhibition of protein synthesis (Lu2024Prkra).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate PRKRA's activity, although specific sites and effects are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's ability to form dimers through the dsRBD3 domain is essential for its role in translation regulation and stress response (Lu2024Prkra).

## Function
The PRKRA gene encodes the protein PACT, which plays a significant role in the cellular stress response by activating the protein kinase PKR (EIF2AK2) in healthy human cells. PACT activates PKR in response to various stress signals, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, and serum deprivation. This activation leads to the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) on serine 51, resulting in a temporary reduction in general protein synthesis. This process is a key regulatory event in the integrated stress response (ISR), which helps cells adapt to environmental stresses and maintain cellular homeostasis (Patel2000PACT; Frederick2023Luteolin).

In addition to its role in stress response, PACT is involved in the RNA silencing pathway. It interacts with Dicer, a component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), to facilitate the processing of pre-miRNA into mature miRNA, which is crucial for gene expression regulation. PACT's interaction with Dicer and other components like TRBP and hAgo2 suggests its involvement in the assembly and function of RISC, impacting miRNA biogenesis and RNA interference efficiency (Lee2006The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRKRA gene are associated with Dystonia 16 (DYT16), a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions and, in some cases, parkinsonism. The most notable mutation is the homozygous c.665C>T (p.Pro222Leu) missense mutation, which has been identified in multiple families, including those from Brazil and Poland (Camargos2008DYT16; Zech2014DYT16). This mutation leads to dysregulated activation of the protein kinase PKR, affecting the integrated stress response and resulting in increased apoptosis and sensitivity to stress (Burnett2020Dystonia). 

DYT16 typically presents with early-onset generalized dystonia, often beginning in the limbs, neck, or larynx, and may include symptoms such as dysphonia and dysarthria (Lange2021Genotype–Phenotype). The disorder follows an autosomal-recessive inheritance pattern, with most patients carrying the homozygous p.Pro222Leu mutation (Lange2021Genotype–Phenotype). 

Research suggests that PRKRA mutations may also contribute to other neurological conditions through mechanisms such as enhanced type I interferon production, which is linked to interferonopathies (Vaughn2022DYTPRKRA). The phenotypic variability among patients with PRKRA mutations indicates a wide range of disease severity and age of onset (dos2018The).

## Interactions
PRKRA, also known as PACT, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular stress responses and RNA interference pathways. PRKRA interacts with EIF2AK2 (PKR), activating it in response to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and stress signals. This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis (Dickerman2011Missense). PRKRA also forms heterodimers with the TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP), which can inhibit PKR activation. This interaction involves their N-terminal dsRNA binding motifs and C-terminal Medipal domains (Dickerman2011Missense).

In the RNA silencing pathway, PRKRA interacts with Dicer, a key enzyme, through its third double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD3). This interaction is crucial for the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) assembly, although PRKRA does not enhance Dicer's processing activity (Lee2006The). PRKRA also binds to hAgo2, another important protein in the RNA silencing pathway, independently of Dicer (Lee2006The).

PRKRA is involved in the formation of a multiprotein complex with TRBP, Dicer, and hAgo2, which is capable of pre-miRNA processing and target RNA cleavage (Lee2006The). These interactions highlight PRKRA's role in modulating both stress response pathways and RNA interference mechanisms.
