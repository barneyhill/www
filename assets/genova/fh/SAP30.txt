# SAP30

## Overview
SAP30 is a gene that encodes the Sin3A associated protein 30, a critical component of the Sin3A corepressor complex involved in transcriptional regulation. The SAP30 protein is characterized by its zinc finger motif, which facilitates DNA binding, and a conserved C-terminal SIN3 interaction domain that enables its integration into the Sin3A complex. As a transcriptional coactivator, SAP30 plays a significant role in gene silencing by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) to chromatin, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression. The protein's ability to form homodimers and its interactions with various transcription factors and corepressors underscore its importance in cellular processes, including those related to cancer progression. SAP30's involvement in breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma highlights its clinical significance, as alterations in its expression and interactions are linked to tumor growth and metastasis (Hu2022Targeting; Viiri2009DNA-Binding; Bao2023SAP30).

## Structure
SAP30 is a protein that is part of the Sin3A corepressor complex, playing a role in transcriptional regulation. The molecular structure of SAP30 includes a zinc finger motif in the central region, which is crucial for its DNA-binding activity. This motif is characterized by a C2CH-type zinc-binding module, consisting of four cysteine and two histidine residues that coordinate a zinc ion, stabilizing the protein structure (Viiri2009Phylogenetic; Viiri2009DNA-Binding). The zinc-binding module is essential for the protein's stability, as mutations in these residues lead to degradation (Viiri2009DNA-Binding).

SAP30 also contains a conserved C-terminal SIN3 interaction domain, which binds the paired amphipathic helix 3 domain of SIN3A, facilitating its role in the Sin3A complex (Bao2023SAP30). The protein has a polybasic region adjacent to the zinc-binding module, which acts as a nuclear localization signal and is involved in binding monophosphoinositides (Viiri2009Phylogenetic).

SAP30 can form a homodimer, which is important for its function as a transcriptional coactivator in breast cancer, where it interacts with MLL1 and the SIN3A/3B complex (Bao2023SAP30). The protein is known to undergo alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms that may affect its function and interactions (Viiri2009DNA-Binding).

## Function
SAP30 (Sin3A associated protein 30) is a component of the Sin3A corepressor complex, which plays a crucial role in transcriptional repression by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) to chromatin, leading to chromatin condensation and gene silencing (Viiri2009DNA-Binding). In healthy human cells, SAP30 functions as a bridging molecule within the Sin3 complex, facilitating interactions between various proteins, including HDACs, DNA-binding transcription factors, and other corepressors (Viiri2009DNA-Binding). It is involved in N-CoR-mediated repression by specific transcription factors and affects gene expression in a promoter-dependent manner (Viiri2009DNA-Binding).

SAP30 is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with core histones and nucleosomes, partly mediated by its central acidic region (Viiri2009DNA-Binding). It contains a C2CH-type zinc-binding module essential for its stability and DNA-binding activity, which is sequence-independent and induces strong DNA bending (Viiri2009DNA-Binding). SAP30 also has a polybasic region that mediates specific interactions with monophosphoinositides (PIPs), which compete with DNA binding, influencing its repression activity (Viiri2009Phylogenetic). These interactions suggest that SAP30 plays a role in Sin3-mediated repression through multiple interactions with the nuclear matrix, nuclear proteins, and DNA (Viiri2009Phylogenetic).

## Clinical Significance
SAP30 (Sin3A associated protein 30) is implicated in several cancers due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In breast cancer, SAP30 is highly upregulated at the mRNA and protein levels in over 50% of patients, particularly those with metastatic cancer, despite the gene locus not being amplified. This upregulation is associated with tumor growth and metastasis, as SAP30 coordinates with the SIN3A/3B complex and MLL1 to increase chromatin accessibility and coactivate transcription of genes involved in cell motility, angiogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis (Bao2023SAP30). SAP30's interaction with the SIN3 complex and MLL1 is crucial for its role in promoting breast cancer progression, and its overexpression is linked to poor clinical outcomes (Bao2023SAP30).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), SAP30 is highly expressed and interacts with UHRF1, a protein involved in transcriptional regulation. This interaction is essential for the repression of MXD4 and the process of leukemogenesis. Disruption of the UHRF1-SAP30 interaction has been shown to delay leukemogenesis, highlighting its significance in AML progression (Hu2022Targeting).

SAP30 is also involved in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), where it is associated with the activation of the NETO2 gene, suggesting a role in the molecular mechanisms underlying this type of kidney cancer (Snezhkina2018Transcription).

## Interactions
SAP30 (Sin3A associated protein 30) is a component of the Sin3A corepressor complex and participates in various protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. It interacts directly with the PAH3 domain of mSin3A and other components of the complex, such as HDAC1 and RBBP4/7, stabilizing the complex and facilitating transcriptional repression (Grzenda2009Sin3:). SAP30 also interacts with transcription factors like YY1, recruiting the mSin3/HDAC histone deacetylase complex to E2F-dependent promoters through direct interaction with RBP1 (Grzenda2009Sin3:). 

SAP30 can independently recruit HDAC1 to promoter DNA, even in the absence of Sin3, as demonstrated by its ability to repress transcription in a sin3Δ mutant strain (Grzenda2009Sin3:). It also binds and bends DNA through a zinc-dependent module, with its DNA-binding activity being sequence-independent, suggesting a general role in anchoring to nucleosomal/linker DNA (Viiri2009DNA-Binding). 

In the context of breast cancer, SAP30 interacts with the SIN3 complex and MLL1, promoting tumor progression by enhancing chromatin accessibility and activating transcription of genes related to cell motility and angiogenesis (Bao2023SAP30). SAP30 forms homodimers and interacts with MLL1 and SIN3A, with specific mutations affecting these interactions (Bao2023SAP30).
