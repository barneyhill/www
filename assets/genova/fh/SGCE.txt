# SGCE

## Overview
The SGCE gene encodes the epsilon-sarcoglycan (ε-SG) protein, a single-pass transmembrane protein that is a crucial component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) in muscle tissues. This protein plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cell membranes by linking the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, thereby contributing to muscle function and stability (Xiao2017Role). In addition to its role in muscle tissues, ε-sarcoglycan is expressed in the brain, where it is involved in synaptic function and neuronal excitability, particularly in regions such as the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus (Sperandeo2022Cortical; Grütz2017Faithful). Mutations in the SGCE gene are associated with myoclonus-dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by myoclonic jerks and dystonia, and can also be linked to psychiatric symptoms (Kinugawa2009Myoclonus‐dystonia:; Grabowski2003The). The gene's expression and function are subject to complex regulatory mechanisms, including alternative splicing and genomic imprinting, which influence its diverse roles in both muscle and neural tissues (Ritz2010SGCE; Xiao2017Role).

## Structure
The SGCE gene encodes the epsilon member of the sarcoglycan family, which are single-pass transmembrane proteins and components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) (Xiao2017Role). The SGCE protein, also known as ε-SG, has a primary structure that includes amino acids 1 to 317 located in the extracellular space, with only 23% of the full-length protein in the cytoplasmic space (amino acids 339-437) (Xiao2017Role). The protein is part of a heterotetrameric complex in muscles, contributing to the structural stability of the plasma membrane (Ritz2010SGCE).

The SGCE protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms. In humans, a brain-specific isoform incorporates alternative exon 11b and shows high expression in Purkinje cells and neurons of the cerebellar dentate nucleus (Xiao2017Role). This isoform, along with others, encodes proteins with C-terminal PDZ-binding motifs, which may contribute to a unique function in the brain (Ritz2010SGCE). In mice, another brain-specific isoform may be expressed, encoded by an elongated exon 11b (exon 11c) (Xiao2017Role). The molecular structure of these isoforms includes transmembrane domains and isoform-specific domains, with the brain-specific isoform having a PDZ-binding motif derived from exon 11b (Xiao2017Role).

## Function
The SGCE gene encodes the protein ε-sarcoglycan, a component of the sarcoglycan complex, which is part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) in muscle cells. This complex plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cell membranes by linking the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, thereby contributing to muscle function and stability (Xiao2017Role). In the brain, SGCE is expressed in various isoforms, including a brain-specific isoform that incorporates alternative exon 11b. This isoform is highly expressed in Purkinje cells and neurons of the cerebellar dentate nucleus, suggesting a role in synaptic function (Ritz2010SGCE; Xiao2017Role).

The ε-sarcoglycan protein is primarily located in the extracellular space, with a smaller portion in the cytoplasmic space, indicating its involvement in cellular signaling pathways (Xiao2017Role). In neurons, the brain-specific isoform of SGCE is predominantly expressed in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus, where it localizes to the plasma membrane, contributing to cellular structure and function (Grütz2017Faithful). The protein's role in maintaining normal neuronal excitability and synaptic function is crucial for proper motor coordination and cognitive processes (Sperandeo2022Cortical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SGCE gene are primarily associated with myoclonus-dystonia (M-D), a movement disorder characterized by myoclonic jerks and dystonia. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance due to maternal genomic imprinting, where the maternal allele is typically silenced (Kinugawa2009Myoclonus‐dystonia:; Grabowski2003The). The SGCE gene is located on chromosome 7q21.3 and encodes the epsilon-sarcoglycan protein, a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (Kinugawa2009Myoclonus‐dystonia:).

Mutations in SGCE often result in loss of function, with many leading to premature protein truncation or misfolded proteins that are degraded intracellularly (CazurroGutiérrez2021εSarcoglycan:). These mutations can include exon rearrangements, base pair substitutions, and large deletions (Grünewald2008Myoclonusdystonia:). The disorder is characterized by variable expression, with symptoms such as myoclonic jerks and dystonia often alleviated by alcohol consumption (Kutschenko2021Functional; Asmus2002Myoclonus–dystonia).

In addition to movement disorders, SGCE mutations can be associated with psychiatric symptoms, including panic attacks and obsessive-compulsive behavior (Grabowski2003The). The genetic complexity of M-D is further highlighted by the presence of contiguous gene syndromes, where large deletions involving SGCE and adjacent genes can lead to more complex phenotypes (Kinugawa2009Myoclonus‐dystonia:).

## Interactions
SGCE (sarcoglycan epsilon) is involved in several protein interactions, primarily within the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), which connects the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix in muscle tissues. This complex includes other sarcoglycans such as beta, delta, and zeta sarcoglycans, as well as beta-dystroglycan (Ritz2010SGCE; Xiao2017Role). In the brain, SGCE is part of dystrophin-associated protein complexes, which are crucial for maintaining structural stability and synaptic functions (Xiao2017Role).

In breast cancer cells, SGCE interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its E3 ubiquitination ligase, c-Cbl. SGCE acts as a sponge molecule, inhibiting EGFR lysosomal degradation by sequestering c-Cbl, thereby stabilizing EGFR protein levels. This interaction is significant in the context of breast cancer stem cells, as it contributes to resistance against EGFR-targeted therapies (Zhao2020SGCE). SGCE does not directly interact with EGFR but influences its ubiquitination through c-Cbl, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays (Zhao2020SGCE). These interactions highlight SGCE's role in modulating EGFR fate and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
