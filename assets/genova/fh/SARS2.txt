# SARS2

## Overview
The SARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme seryl-tRNA synthetase 2 (SerRS), which plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. As a member of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family, SerRS is responsible for the attachment of serine to its corresponding tRNA, a crucial step in the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins necessary for the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Yang2023Novel). Beyond its primary function in protein synthesis, SerRS also serves as a transcriptional repressor, regulating angiogenesis by inhibiting the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) (Yang2023Novel). Mutations in the SARS2 gene are linked to mitochondrial disorders such as HUPRA syndrome and congenital sideroblastic anemia, underscoring the gene's essential role in cellular energy metabolism and vascular regulation (Colin2021Biallelic; Zhou2021Novel).

## Function
The SARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS), an enzyme crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme is responsible for attaching serine to the 3'-ends of tRNA Ser, a process essential for the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins and the formation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Yang2023Novel). Proper functioning of SerRS is vital for maintaining mitochondrial activity, as it ensures the correct translation of proteins necessary for cellular respiration and energy production, particularly in organs with high energy demands like the kidneys (Yang2023Novel).

In addition to its role in protein synthesis, SerRS has regulatory functions in cellular pathways. It acts as a transcriptional repressor of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), inhibiting angiogenesis by binding to the VEGFA promoter and preventing the binding of transcription factors such as c-myc and HIF-1α (Yang2023Novel). This regulation is crucial for controlling the proliferation of pulmonary artery endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, highlighting the enzyme's role in vascular regulation and its importance in maintaining cellular and organ health (Yang2023Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SARS2 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase, are associated with several mitochondrial diseases, most notably HUPRA syndrome and congenital sideroblastic anemia (CSA). HUPRA syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hyperuricemia, pulmonary hypertension, renal failure, and alkalosis. These symptoms arise due to the disruption of mitochondrial function, particularly affecting tissues with high energy demands such as the nervous system and kidneys (Zhou2021Novel). The syndrome is linked to compound heterozygous mutations in the SARS2 gene, which impair the enzyme's function by altering its secondary structure and affecting mitochondrial protein synthesis (Zhou2021Novel).

Congenital sideroblastic anemia, another condition associated with SARS2 mutations, presents with non-regenerative anemia that is refractory to erythropoietin treatment, necessitating regular blood transfusions. This condition is linked to biallelic mutations in the SARS2 gene, which are predicted to be damaging and result in a loss of function. The study of these mutations suggests a potential role of SARS2 in erythropoiesis, as evidenced by in vitro models showing the gene's importance in this process (Colin2021Biallelic). These findings highlight the critical role of SARS2 in maintaining mitochondrial function and its impact on human health when mutated.
