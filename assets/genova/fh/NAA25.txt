# NAA25

## Overview
NAA25 is a gene that encodes the N-alpha-acetyltransferase 25, NatB auxiliary subunit, a protein that is a critical component of the N-terminal acetyltransferase B (NatB) complex. This complex is involved in the N-terminal acetylation of proteins, a post-translational modification that influences protein stability, localization, and function. The NAA25 protein, as part of the NatB complex, plays a significant role in the cytoplasm, particularly in the formation and maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cellular structure and motility (Van2012Nterminal). The interaction between NAA25 and the catalytic subunit NAA20 is crucial for the acetylation activity of the complex, affecting approximately 21% of human proteins (Deng2021Protein). NAA25's involvement in cellular processes and its expression levels have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Xu2022Knockdown).

## Structure


## Function
NAA25, also known as the NatB auxiliary subunit, is a component of the N-terminal acetyltransferase B (NatB) complex, which plays a crucial role in the N-terminal acetylation of proteins. This post-translational modification is significant for protein stability, localization, and function. In human cells, NAA25 is involved in maintaining the structure and function of the actin cytoskeleton. It facilitates the acetylation of proteins such as tropomyosin-1, which is essential for its interaction with actin, thereby supporting cellular structure and function (Van2012Nterminal).

The NatB complex, including NAA25, is active in the cytoplasm and is critical for the formation of actomyosin fibers and focal adhesions, which are necessary for cellular migration and the transmission of intracellular forces to the extracellular matrix (Van2012Nterminal). Knockdown of NAA25 in human cells leads to impaired actomyosin and focal adhesion formation, highlighting its role in cell motility and cytoskeletal organization (Van2012Nterminal).

NAA25 also plays a role in coordinating the stoichiometry of NAT complex subunits, which is essential for the functional assembly of these complexes, potentially through post-transcriptional regulation (Koufaris2024Bioinformatic).

## Clinical Significance
The NAA25 gene, also known as the NatB auxiliary subunit, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and potential mutations. In breast cancer, NAA25 is highly expressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and its knockdown in breast cancer cell lines leads to increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. This suggests that high expression of NAA25 may contribute to cancer progression by promoting cell proliferation and survival, potentially impacting overall survival in breast cancer patients (Xu2022Knockdown).

In the context of ischemic stroke in children, the NAA25 gene was investigated for its potential role in prognosis. However, studies found no significant difference in the presence of NAA25 mutations between patients and healthy controls, indicating that these mutations are not risk factors for ischemic stroke in children (Bozpolat2019The). Despite this, the gene's involvement in other conditions, such as coronary artery disease, has been suggested in different populations, although not confirmed in the context of stroke (Bozpolat2019The). These findings highlight the complex role of NAA25 in disease and underscore the need for further research to fully understand its clinical significance.

## Interactions
NAA25, also known as the NatB auxiliary subunit, is a component of the NatB complex, which also includes the catalytic subunit NAA20. This complex is responsible for the N-terminal acetylation of approximately 21% of human proteins. The interaction between NAA25 and NAA20 is characterized by extensive contacts, with the major interface mediated by the α1-α2 loop of NAA20. This interaction is crucial for the acetylation activity of the NatB complex, as mutations in the contact residues generally reduce its acetylation activity (Deng2021Protein).

NAA25 is also involved in modulating substrate specificity and potentially acts as a ribosome anchor, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available context (Koufaris2024Bioinformatic). In breast cancer samples, NAA25 shows a high correlation with NAA20 at the protein level, suggesting a coordinated regulation that may influence their interaction and function (Koufaris2024Bioinformatic). Despite these insights, the context does not provide detailed information on transient interactions or specific binding partners beyond the NatB complex.
