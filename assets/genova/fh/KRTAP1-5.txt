# KRTAP1-5

## Overview
KRTAP1-5 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 1-5, a member of the high sulfur keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. This protein is characterized by its high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, contributing to the structural stability and mechanical strength of human hair. The KRTAP1-5 protein is expressed in specific regions of the hair follicle, particularly in the differentiated portions of the hair cortex and cuticle, where it interacts with keratin intermediate filaments to form a robust matrix. This interaction is crucial for the formation of a hard and compact hair fiber, providing resilience and durability to the hair shaft. The gene is located on chromosome 17q21.2, a region with a high density of KAP genes, and typically consists of a single exon, which may influence the protein's primary structure (Rogers2006Human).

## Structure
The KRTAP1-5 protein is a member of the KAP1 family, characterized by a high sulfur content, with cysteine residues comprising 24.1-26.5 mol % of the protein. This high cysteine content facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, which are crucial for the protein's structural stability. The protein also contains significant amounts of serine (12.9-17.5 mol %) and glycine (8.6-11.4 mol %) residues, contributing to its unique structural properties (Rogers2006Human).

KRTAP1-5 is one of the larger keratin-associated proteins, with a molecular weight ranging from 12.3 to 18.2 kDa. It features dimeric cysteine-containing pentameric repeats, which are specific to this family, suggesting a role in the protein's quaternary structure. These repeats may contribute to the protein's ability to form complex structures within the hair matrix (Rogers2006Human).

The protein is located on chromosome 17q21.2, a region known for a high density of KAP genes. These genes are typically small, around 1 kb, and often consist of a single exon, which may influence the protein's primary structure (Rogers2006Human). The specific post-translational modifications of KRTAP1-5 are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
KRTAP1-5 is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, specifically classified within the high sulfur KAPs due to its high cysteine content, which ranges from 24.1% to 26.5% (Rogers2006Human). These proteins are integral to the structure and function of human hair, where they interact with keratin intermediate filaments to form a matrix that provides mechanical strength and resilience to hair fibers (Rogers2006Human). KRTAP1-5, along with other KAPs, is expressed in specific regions of the hair follicle, particularly in the differentiated portions of the hair cortex and cuticle, which are crucial for the formation of a hard and compact hair fiber (Rogers2006Human).

The KAP1 family, to which KRTAP1-5 belongs, is characterized by proteins that are relatively large, ranging from 12.3 to 18.2 kDa, and contain dimeric cysteine-containing pentameric repeats (Rogers2006Human). These structural features facilitate the cross-linking of keratin filaments, contributing to the integrity and durability of the hair shaft. Although the specific function of KRTAP1-5 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its role in hair structure and integrity is implied through its expression patterns and biochemical properties (Rogers2006Human).
