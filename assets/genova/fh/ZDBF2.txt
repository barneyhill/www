# ZDBF2

## Overview
ZDBF2 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger DBF-type containing 2, which is involved in transcriptional regulation and epigenetic processes in humans. The protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which facilitate its role in DNA binding and modulation of gene expression. ZDBF2 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other transcription factors to influence gene expression patterns essential for normal cellular function and development (Duffié2014The). The gene is notably involved in genomic imprinting, a process that results in parent-of-origin-specific gene expression, and plays a critical role in regulating DNA methylation dynamics at the GPR1/ZDBF2 locus (Duffié2014The). Additionally, ZDBF2 is implicated in postnatal growth and feeding behavior, particularly through its influence on hypothalamic circuits that regulate appetite, underscoring its importance in neonatal development and survival (Glaser2021The).

## Structure


## Function
The ZDBF2 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation and epigenetic processes in humans. It contains zinc finger domains, which are typically involved in binding DNA and influencing gene expression. ZDBF2 is active in the nucleus, where it may interact with other transcription factors to modulate gene expression patterns critical for normal cellular function and organismal development (Duffié2014The).

In humans, ZDBF2 is involved in genomic imprinting, a process where genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. The gene is associated with the regulation of DNA methylation dynamics, particularly at the GPR1/ZDBF2 locus, which is conserved from mice to humans. This locus demonstrates a unique pattern of imprinting, with differential methylation regions (DMRs) that are crucial for the gene's expression in various tissues, including the placenta and testis (Duffié2014The).

ZDBF2 is also implicated in regulating postnatal growth and feeding behavior, as it influences hypothalamic circuits that stimulate appetite. This regulation is crucial for survival and growth during the neonatal period, highlighting the gene's role in adapting to oral feeding and optimizing body weight gain (Glaser2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZDBF2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. A notable association is with Nasopalpebral lipoma-coloboma syndrome (NPLCS), a rare autosomal dominant disorder. In a study, a de novo frameshift mutation in the ZDBF2 gene was identified in a patient with NPLCS, characterized by nasopalpebral lipomas, eyelid colobomas, telecanthus, and maxillary hypoplasia. This mutation was absent in the patient's parents and a control group, suggesting its potential pathogenic role in the syndrome (Chacón‐Camacho2016Exome).

In mice, the Zdbf2 gene plays a crucial role in postnatal growth and feeding behavior. Its absence leads to undernutrition, decreased IGF-1 signaling, and reduced body weight gain, which can result in increased lethality in neonates. These findings suggest that alterations in Zdbf2 expression could have significant implications for neonatal growth and development, potentially affecting long-term health outcomes (Glaser2022The). The gene's dosage is critical, with reduced expression leading to growth reduction and increased expression enhancing growth, indicating its role in regulating body homeostasis (Glaser2022The).
