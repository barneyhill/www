# SCUBE3

## Overview
SCUBE3, or signal peptide, CUB domain, and EGF-like domain-containing protein 3, is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The SCUBE3 protein is characterized by its modular structure, which includes an N-terminal signal peptide, EGF-like repeats, and a CUB domain, facilitating its role in protein-protein interactions and signaling modulation (Lin2023The; Tu2014SCUBE3). Functionally, SCUBE3 acts as a co-receptor in growth factor signaling, particularly influencing muscle and bone development through interactions with fibroblast growth factors and bone morphogenetic proteins (Lin2023The; Tu2014SCUBE3). Additionally, SCUBE3 is implicated in pathological processes, such as cancer progression and skeletal disorders, where its expression and mutations can significantly impact disease outcomes (Kumar2022The; Lin2023The).

## Structure
The SCUBE3 protein, encoded by the SCUBE3 gene, is characterized by a modular structure comprising several distinct domains. It includes an N-terminal signal peptide, nine EGF-like repeats, a spacer region, three cysteine-rich motifs, and a CUB domain at the C-terminus (Lin2023The; Tu2014SCUBE3). The EGF-like domains contain conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, crucial for maintaining structural stability (Lin2023The). These domains also feature a calcium-binding motif, similar to those found in human NOTCH1, which contributes to the protein's functional conformation (Lin2023The).

The CUB domain is highly conserved and plays a significant role in protein-protein interactions, binding growth factors and receptors, and modulating signaling pathways (Lin2023The). SCUBE3 can form homodimers or heterodimers with other SCUBE proteins, and it undergoes proteolytic processing to separate its N-terminal EGF-like repeats from the C-terminal CUB domain (Lin2023The). Post-translational modifications, such as N-linked glycosylation, are also observed in SCUBE3, which can be inhibited by tunicamycin or removed by peptide-N-glycosidase F (Tu2014SCUBE3). These structural features enable SCUBE3 to function effectively in various signaling pathways, including those involved in development and disease progression.

## Function
SCUBE3 is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a significant role in modulating growth factor signaling pathways, particularly in muscle and bone development. In muscle development, SCUBE3 acts as a co-receptor for fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8), enhancing its signaling through interaction with fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4). This interaction is crucial for the differentiation of fast muscle fibers, as evidenced by studies showing that SCUBE3 knockdown leads to reduced expression of myogenic markers and impaired myogenic differentiation (Tu2014SCUBE3).

In bone development, SCUBE3 enhances bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling by facilitating the binding of BMP2/4 ligands to type II receptors and recruiting BMP type I receptors. This process is essential for endochondral bone formation, and disruptions in SCUBE3 function can lead to skeletal disorders (Lin2023The).

SCUBE3 is also involved in odontoblastic differentiation and pulp regeneration, acting as a ligand or co-receptor for various signaling receptors, including BMP and TGF-β receptors. This role is critical for tooth development and epithelium-mesenchyme interactions (Wang2023Epitheliumderived).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SCUBE3 gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and skeletal disorders. In cancer, SCUBE3 is frequently altered, with increased expression linked to poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, and metastatic melanoma. In NSCLC, SCUBE3 upregulation is associated with advanced-stage tumors and reduced survival time, as it promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis through the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway (Kumar2022The; Lin2023The). In breast cancer, high SCUBE3 expression correlates with low E-cadherin levels, indicating its role in cancer progression (Kumar2022The). Conversely, in renal cell carcinoma, SCUBE3 acts as a tumor suppressor, where its methylation is linked to increased cancer relapse and mortality (Lin2023The).

In skeletal disorders, mutations in SCUBE3 lead to developmental abnormalities such as craniofacial deformities, short stature, and skeletal dysplasia. These mutations disrupt the protein's structure, affecting its stability and function, particularly in bone morphogenesis and BMP signaling pathways (Lin2023The). Specific mutations, such as Scube3 N294K and Scube3 C301Y, impair protein interactions and signaling, resulting in skeletal phenotypes (Lin2023The).

## Interactions
SCUBE3, a member of the SCUBE protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with TGF-β receptors, particularly TGFβRII, facilitating the activation of the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and metastasis in cancer cells (Kumar2022The). SCUBE3 also interacts with matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9, which cleave SCUBE3 into fragments that can bind to TGF-β receptors, further promoting signaling pathways involved in cancer progression (Huo2021SCUBE3; Kumar2022The).

In addition to its role in cancer, SCUBE3 functions as a BMP2/4 coreceptor, enhancing BMP signaling by interacting with BMP type I receptors. This interaction is important for bone development and skeletal disorders (Lin2023The). Mutations in SCUBE3 can disrupt these interactions, leading to skeletal abnormalities (Lin2023The). SCUBE3 also forms complexes with other SCUBE family members, such as SCUBE1, through EGF-like domain-mediated interactions, which are essential for its role in modulating growth factor signaling (Lin2023The).
