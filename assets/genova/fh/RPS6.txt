# RPS6

## Overview
RPS6 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein S6, a critical component of the 40S ribosomal subunit involved in the translation of mRNA into proteins. The protein ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) is categorized as a ribosomal protein and plays a pivotal role in protein synthesis, cell growth, and proliferation. It is subject to extensive post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, which is regulated by several signaling pathways, including the mTOR and MAPK pathways. These modifications influence its function in ribosome biogenesis and mRNA translation efficiency. RPS6 is also implicated in various cellular processes, such as cell size determination, glucose homeostasis, and the regulation of cell survival, making it a significant player in both normal cellular function and disease states, including cancer and neurological disorders (Yi2021Ribosomal; Magnuson2011Regulation; Meyuhas2009Chapter).

## Structure
The ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit and is composed of 249 amino acids, encoded by the RPS6 gene located on chromosome 9p21 (Yi2021Ribosomal). The primary structure of RPS6 includes a sequence of amino acids that undergoes various post-translational modifications, with phosphorylation being the most studied. Phosphorylation occurs at five conserved C-terminal serine residues: S235, S236, S240, S244, and S247. These modifications are regulated by kinases such as S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RSKs), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase C (PKC), and are influenced by the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1/S6K and MAPK pathways (Yi2021Ribosomal).

The secondary and tertiary structures of RPS6 involve its folding into alpha helices and beta sheets, although specific details on these structures are not provided in the context. RPS6 is involved in the assembly of the ribosome, indicating its quaternary structure as part of the 40S ribosomal subunit (Yi2021Ribosomal). The protein's phosphorylation status is crucial for its function in various cellular processes, including mRNA translation and ribosome biogenesis (Yi2021Ribosomal).

## Function
Ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit and plays a critical role in protein synthesis by participating in the translation of mRNA into proteins. RPS6 is involved in cell growth and proliferation, and its phosphorylation is regulated by signaling pathways such as mTOR, which affects ribosome biogenesis and cellular metabolism (Magnuson2011Regulation).

Phosphorylation of RPS6 is mediated primarily by S6K1 and S6K2 kinases, with S6K2 playing a predominant role. This phosphorylation is crucial for determining cell size, cell proliferation, and glucose homeostasis (Meyuhas2009Chapter). RPS6 phosphorylation is highest at the start codons of main open reading frames (ORFs) and decreases as ribosomes translate the ORF, particularly affecting mRNAs with long ORFs. This phosphorylation state influences translation efficiency, with a lack of phosphorylation leading to reduced translation efficiency in mRNAs with short coding sequences (Bohlen2021Phosphorylation).

RPS6 is also involved in the regulation of cell survival through mitochondrial substrates and plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of estrogen receptor-a (ERa), impacting the proliferation of ER-positive breast cancer cells (Meyuhas2009Chapter).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RPS6 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and neurological disorders. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hyperphosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) is associated with poor clinical outcomes. This hyperphosphorylation promotes cell proliferation and migration, contributing to tumor progression, and is regulated by the Akt2/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway (Chen2015Hyperphosphorylation). 

In the context of neurological disorders, a somatic variant of RPS6, p.R232H, has been identified in hemimegalencephaly with intractable epilepsy. This variant increases neuroprogenitor proliferation and is associated with cortical dyslamination and increased phospho-RPS6 in dysmorphic neurons (Pelorosso2019Somatic).

RPS6 phosphorylation is also significant in various cancers, including breast cancer, glioblastoma, and gastric cancer. High levels of phosphorylated RPS6 (p-RPS6) are linked to tumor progression and poor survival outcomes. In some cancers, RPS6 phosphorylation occurs independently of mTOR signaling, suggesting alternative regulatory pathways (Yi2021Ribosomal). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of RPS6 in disease progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in ribosomal integrity and function. RPS6 interacts with the large subunit protein rpL10/Grc5p, which is essential for ribosomal subunit joining and assembly. This interaction is significant for maintaining ribosomal integrity and ensuring proper protein synthesis (PACHLER2004Functional). RPS6 is also implicated in the formation of intersubunit bridges B1a and B1b/c, which are vital for the structural integrity of the ribosome (PACHLER2004Functional).

In the context of cancer, RPS6 interacts with various signaling pathways and proteins, impacting cell survival, proliferation, and drug resistance. It is involved in the mTORC1/S6K pathway, which regulates its phosphorylation and activity in protein synthesis and cell growth (Yi2021Ribosomal). RPS6 also interacts with the La autoantigen under oxidative stress, influencing NRF2 translation, and is involved in the IL6/IL6 receptor pathway in glioblastoma multiforme (Yi2021Ribosomal).

RPS6's phosphorylation state affects its interactions, with phosphorylated RPS6 (p-RPS6) being regulated by various kinases and phosphatases, including S6K1 and PP2A, which modulate its role in translation and cell growth (Yi2021Ribosomal).
