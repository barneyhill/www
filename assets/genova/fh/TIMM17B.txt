# TIMM17B

## Overview
TIMM17B is a gene that encodes the translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 17B, a transmembrane protein that is a critical component of the TIM23 complex. This complex is essential for the translocation of nuclear-encoded proteins across the mitochondrial inner membrane, a process vital for mitochondrial biogenesis and function (Wrobel2016The). The TIMM17B protein is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells and plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of the TIM23 complex by forming disulfide bonds, which stabilize its transmembrane domains (Wrobel2016The). TIMM17B's involvement in the MIA pathway underscores its importance in the oxidative biogenesis of mitochondrial proteins, impacting cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis (Wrobel2016The). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various clinical conditions, including sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, ovarian carcinoma, and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Weng2024Exploring; Bogorodskiy2021Role; Erdogan2020Genome‑wide).

## Function
TIMM17B is a crucial component of the TIM23 complex, which is involved in the translocation of proteins across the mitochondrial inner membrane. This complex plays a significant role in mitochondrial biogenesis by facilitating the import and insertion of nuclear-encoded proteins into the mitochondria, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Wrobel2016The). TIMM17B is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells and is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the TIM23 translocase complex. It achieves this by forming disulfide bonds, a feature conserved among eukaryotes, which helps stabilize the transmembrane domains and ensure proper assembly of the translocase complex (Wrobel2016The).

In healthy human cells, TIMM17B is involved in recruiting sequence pre-translocase-related motors and sorting proproteins in the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is crucial for efficient protein import and mitochondrial stability (Mingting2023High). The protein's function is linked to the MIA pathway, involving oxidoreductase Mia40 and sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1, which are important for the oxidative biogenesis of mitochondrial proteins (Wrobel2016The). This role is vital for cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis, impacting overall cellular function and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
The TIMM17B gene is implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in mitochondrial function. In the context of sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, TIMM17B is part of the TIM23 complex, which is crucial for mitochondrial protein import. The gene's expression is significantly elevated in sepsis patients, suggesting its involvement in the pathophysiology of septic myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction (Weng2024Exploring). 

Alterations in TIMM17B expression have also been observed in the context of ovarian carcinoma. The gene is hypermethylated in BRCA1 positive cases compared to BRCA1 negative cases, indicating a potential epigenetic regulation mechanism in cancer (Erdogan2020Genome‑wide). 

Furthermore, TIMM17B is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The TIM23 complex, which includes TIMM17B, is essential for mitochondrial protein import, and its dysfunction is linked to conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases (Bogorodskiy2021Role). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TIMM17B in various diseases, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
TIMM17B is a component of the TIM23 complex, which is essential for the translocation of preproteins across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Within this complex, TIMM17B interacts with other proteins such as TIMM23 and TIMM50. These interactions are crucial for the import and sorting of mitochondrial proteins, maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity (Weng2024Exploring; Paz2024Biochemical).

In the context of sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, TIMM17B, along with other members of the TIM23 complex, shows elevated expression levels in sepsis patients compared to healthy controls. This suggests that TIMM17B's interaction within the TIM23 complex may play a role in the mitochondrial response to inflammatory conditions (Weng2024Exploring).

The TIM23 complex, including TIMM17B, is involved in mitochondrial inner membrane protein transport, highlighting its role in mitochondrial pathways related to immune response (Weng2024Exploring). Despite the reduction in expression after prolonged inflammatory conditions, TIMM17B remains significantly upregulated compared to control groups, indicating its persistent involvement in mitochondrial function during stress (Weng2024Exploring).
