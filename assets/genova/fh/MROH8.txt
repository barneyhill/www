# MROH8

## Overview
The MROH8 gene encodes the protein maestro heat-like repeat family member 8, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its heat-like repeat domains, which suggest a role in protein-protein interactions, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. MROH8 has been implicated in several human diseases, including Niemann-Pick type C disease and Alzheimer's disease, where it may influence disease severity and susceptibility, respectively. Additionally, MROH8 is associated with renal cell carcinoma and breast cancer risk, indicating its potential involvement in cancer biology (Xavier2024Identification; Motzer2022Molecular; Hytönen2021Missense; Carswell2024Exome).

## Clinical Significance
The MROH8 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its genetic variants and expression alterations. In Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C) disease, variants in MROH8 have been identified in affected siblings, suggesting a potential role in modifying disease severity. Although the specific impact of these variants is not fully detailed, the gene's involvement in lipid-associated processes aligns with the cholesterol and sphingolipid transport defects characteristic of NP-C (Carswell2024Exome).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, MROH8 has been identified as a susceptibility gene when hippocampal atrophy is used as a quantitative trait in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (Carswell2024Exome). This association suggests that MROH8 may influence neurodegenerative processes.

In canine studies, a missense variant in MROH8 was identified, causing a glycine-to-serine substitution. Although considered less pathogenic than other variants studied, it highlights the gene's potential involvement in hearing loss (Hytönen2021Missense).

MROH8 is also part of a gene expression signature associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), where it may play a role in predicting response to anti-angiogenic therapy and influencing disease prognosis (Motzer2022Molecular). Its involvement in breast cancer risk loci has been noted, although specific disease associations are not detailed (Xavier2024Identification).
