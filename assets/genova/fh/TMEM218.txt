# TMEM218

## Overview
TMEM218 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 218, which is a crucial component of the transition zone (TZ) in primary cilia. This protein is characterized by its three transmembrane helices, which are essential for its structural and functional roles within the ciliary transition zone. As a part of the MKS complex, TMEM218 is involved in ciliogenesis and the regulation of ciliary protein content, acting as a diffusion barrier that separates the cilium from the cytoplasm. The protein's interactions with other transmembrane proteins at the TZ periphery are vital for maintaining ciliary integrity and function. Mutations in TMEM218 are linked to ciliopathies such as Joubert and Meckel syndromes, underscoring its significance in normal cellular signaling and homeostasis (Gonçalves2017The; Van2021TMEM218). Additionally, TMEM218 is enriched in rod photoreceptor clusters, suggesting a role in retinal health and disease (Mustafi2016Transcriptome).

## Structure
The TMEM218 protein is characterized by the presence of three transmembrane helices, which are integral to its structure and function. These helices are located in evolutionarily constrained regions, indicating their critical role in maintaining the protein's stability and function (Van2021TMEM218). Specific variants, such as G44V, R94*, R115C, and R115H, occur at conserved positions within or adjacent to these transmembrane alpha helices, suggesting their potential impact on the protein's function and association with ciliopathy phenotypes (Van2021TMEM218).

The TMEM218 protein is involved in the structural organization of the transition zone (TZ) in cilia, where it interacts with other transmembrane proteins to form a module at the TZ periphery. This region acts as a diffusion barrier and regulates ciliary protein content (Van2021TMEM218). The protein is part of the MKS complex, which is crucial for ciliogenesis and ciliary function (Gonçalves2017The).

TMEM218 has at least two isoforms, suggesting alternative splicing events that may contribute to its functional diversity (Van2021TMEM218). However, specific details on the primary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
TMEM218 is a component of the transition zone (TZ) in the primary cilium, an organelle present on nearly every human cell that plays a crucial role in sensing various environmental cues. The transition zone is essential for separating the cilium from the cytoplasm by regulating the protein content within the cilium and acting as a diffusion barrier. TMEM218 interacts with other components of the TZ and is speculated to be part of the ciliary necklace, a structure encircling the cilium near its base. This protein is believed to contribute to the structural integrity and functional regulation of the cilium, which is vital for cellular signaling and maintaining homeostasis (Van2021TMEM218).

In healthy cells, TMEM218 is associated with many proteins related to ciliopathies, indicating its significant role in ciliary biology. The dysfunction of TMEM218 is linked to disorders such as Joubert and Meckel syndromes, highlighting its importance in normal cellular functions (Van2021TMEM218). Additionally, TMEM218 is enriched in rod photoreceptor clusters, suggesting a role in photoreceptor maintenance and potentially in the development of retinal diseases (Mustafi2016Transcriptome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM218 gene are associated with ciliopathies, specifically Joubert syndrome (JBTS) and Meckel syndrome. These conditions are part of a spectrum of recessive disorders caused by primary cilium dysfunction, which affects cellular signaling and can lead to a variety of clinical manifestations (Van2021TMEM218). TMEM218 dysfunction is linked to a small percentage of Joubert syndrome cases, accounting for approximately 0.16% (Van2021TMEM218).

Clinical features associated with TMEM218 mutations include the molar tooth sign on brain imaging, vermis hypoplasia, brainstem dysplasia, and occipital encephalocele. Individuals may also experience developmental disabilities, ranging from full dependence to near independence, and retinal dystrophy, with conditions such as Leber congenital amaurosis and early-onset rod-cone retinal dystrophy being common (Van2021TMEM218). Other features include polydactyly, polycystic kidneys, and in some cases, hypoplastic left heart syndrome (Van2021TMEM218).

The severity of the phenotype often correlates with the predicted severity of the genetic variant, with certain variants like p.Arg94* being particularly deleterious (Van2021TMEM218). TMEM218's role in ciliary biology and its interaction with other ciliopathy-related proteins suggest that deleterious variants in this gene can lead to these complex syndromes (Van2021TMEM218).

## Interactions
TMEM218 is a component of the transition zone (TZ) in cilia, where it interacts with other TZ components. It is part of a distinct module at the TZ periphery, interacting with transmembrane proteins such as TMEM216, TMEM231, TMEM80, TMEM17, and TMEM237. These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of the ciliary transition zone, which is essential for the regulation of ciliopathy-related proteins (Van2021TMEM218).

The transition zone is a critical area for protein passage and is associated with various ciliopathies. TMEM218's role in this zone suggests it may be involved in forming multiprotein complexes that regulate the entry and exit of proteins into the cilium. This function is vital for maintaining ciliary structure and function, which is disrupted in ciliopathies like Joubert and Meckel syndromes (Van2021TMEM218).

While specific interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed, the involvement of TMEM218 in these protein complexes highlights its importance in cellular signaling pathways related to ciliary function. The dysfunction of TMEM218 and its interactions can lead to developmental disabilities and other features associated with ciliopathies (Van2021TMEM218).
