# RBM45

## Overview
RBM45, or RNA binding motif protein 45, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including RNA processing, splicing, and transport. The protein, characterized by its three RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, is predominantly localized in the nucleus but can shuttle to the cytoplasm, indicating its involvement in both nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA processes (Li2016Immunoprecipitation; Chen2021Structural). RBM45 is known for its interactions with other RNA-binding proteins, such as TDP-43 and FUS, which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting a role in cellular stress responses and disease mechanisms (Li2016Immunoprecipitation). The protein's ability to form homo-oligomers through its homo-oligomer assembly (HOA) domain is crucial for its function in RNA splicing and stability (Li2016Immunoprecipitation). Alterations in RBM45 expression and mutations have been linked to neurodegenerative conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), highlighting its clinical significance (van2021Familybased; Collins2020RBM45).

## Structure
RBM45 (RNA binding motif protein 45) is characterized by its distinct structural domains that facilitate its role in RNA processing and regulation. The protein contains three RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains: two N-terminal tandem RRM domains (RRM1 and RRM2) and a C-terminal RRM domain (RRM3) (Chen2021Structural). The N-terminal tandem RRM domains exhibit a typical RRM topology, consisting of a β1-α1-β2-β3-α2-β4 structure, forming an antiparallel four-stranded β-sheet with two helices packed on one side (Chen2021Structural). These domains are pseudo two-fold symmetric and primarily interact through their α2 helices and the interdomain loop, creating potential RNA-binding sites (Chen2021Structural).

The protein also includes a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) at the C-terminus and a linker region between RRM2 and RRM3, known as the homo-oligomer assembly (HOA) domain, which promotes homo-oligomerization (Chen2021Structural). The interaction of RBM45 with RNA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) involves specific aromatic and arginine residues that are critical for binding, with the GAC sequence being a preferred target (Chen2021Structural). These structural features are crucial for understanding the physiological and pathological functions of RBM45, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.

## Function
RBM45 is an RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in RNA processing and regulation within healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in nuclear RNA processing, including splicing, mRNA transport, and regulation of mRNA stability, as well as cytoplasmic RNA translation processes such as translation initiation and termination (Li2016Immunoprecipitation). RBM45 interacts with a network of proteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) and proteins involved in the eIF2 and eIF4 pathways, which are essential for translation regulation (Li2016Immunoprecipitation).

The protein contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that enable it to bind RNA sequences, with a preference for GC-rich sequences (Collins2020RBM45). RBM45's interactions are often RNA-dependent, and its ability to form homo-oligomers through its homooligomerization assembly (HOA) domain is essential for its function in protein interactions (Li2016Immunoprecipitation). This oligomerization is important for RBM45's role in RNA splicing and stability, as well as its potential involvement in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of mRNA (Li2016Immunoprecipitation).

RBM45 is predominantly localized in the nucleus but can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating its involvement in both nuclear and cytoplasmic processes (Chen2021Structural). Its interactions with other RNA-binding proteins, such as TDP-43 and FUS, suggest a role in cellular stress responses and neurodegenerative disease mechanisms (Li2016Immunoprecipitation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RBM45 gene are implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In these conditions, RBM45 is known to form intracellular inclusions in neurons and glial cells, which are associated with chronic cellular stress and may contribute to neurodegeneration through a toxic gain and loss of function mechanism (Collins2020RBM45; Li2015RBM45). 

A specific nonsense mutation, p.Arg183*, in RBM45 has been identified in patients with early-onset dementia, leading to its mislocalization to the cytoplasm and co-aggregation with other RNA-binding proteins into stress granules. This mutation results in a loss of normal RBM45 function and contributes to the formation of toxic TDP-43 immunoreactive inclusions (van2021Familybased). 

RBM45 inclusions are often found in conjunction with TDP-43 and ubiquitin in ALS and FTLD patients, suggesting a shared pathogenic mechanism. The presence of RBM45 in cerebrospinal fluid and its altered levels in ALS patients further indicate its potential role as a biomarker for these diseases (Collins2012The).

## Interactions
RBM45 is known to form interactions with various proteins, particularly those linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). It interacts with ALS-associated proteins like TDP-43, FUS, and Matrin-3, as well as hnRNP-A1 and hnRNP-A2/B1, which are involved in RNA processing and translation (Li2016Immunoprecipitation). These interactions are crucial for RBM45's role in RNA metabolic processes and stress response.

RBM45 forms homo-oligomers, including dimers and higher-order structures, mediated by specific amino acid regions known as the homo-oligomer assembly (HOA) domain (Li2015RBM45). This oligomerization is essential for its interactions with TDP-43 and FUS, with the interaction with TDP-43 being RNA-dependent (Li2015RBM45). The HOA domain is also important for RBM45's incorporation into stress granules, where it co-localizes with TDP-43 under stress conditions (Li2015RBM45).

RBM45 associates with nuclear stress bodies (NSBs) during cellular stress, a process mediated by its nuclear localization sequence and RNA recognition motifs (Collins2020RBM45). This association is RNA-dependent and involves binding to SatIII transcripts, which are G-and C-rich (Collins2020RBM45). These interactions highlight RBM45's role in stress response and its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.
