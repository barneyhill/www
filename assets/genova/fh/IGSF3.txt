# IGSF3

## Overview
The IGSF3 gene encodes the protein immunoglobulin superfamily member 3, which is a part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays a significant role in cell adhesion and signaling. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is predominantly located within tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs) in the plasma membrane. IGSF3 is involved in crucial cellular processes, including the maintenance of sphingolipid and glycolipid metabolism homeostasis, and is essential for the production of gangliosides. It interacts with various proteins, such as tetraspanins and integrins, influencing cell adhesion, mobility, and neuronal morphogenesis. Clinically, mutations in the IGSF3 gene have been associated with diseases like congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function (Schweitzer2020IGSF3; Usardi2016The).

## Function
The IGSF3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily, playing a crucial role in cell adhesion and signaling. In healthy human cells, IGSF3 is involved in maintaining sphingolipid and glycolipid metabolism homeostasis. It is anchored in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs) along with proteins like CD81, CD9, and integrin B1, which are involved in cell signaling. IGSF3 is essential for the production of gangliosides, as its deficiency leads to a marked decrease in glucosyl ceramide synthase (UGCG) and B4GALT6 transcription, resulting in lower levels of GluCer and LacCer (Schweitzer2020IGSF3).

IGSF3 also influences cell adhesion and mobility, with its deficiency leading to increased cell attachment and decreased migration, potentially affecting wound repair and barrier function (Schweitzer2020IGSF3). In the context of lung health, IGSF3 is necessary for maintaining epithelial barrier function, as shown by experiments where reduced IGSF3 expression in Beas2B cells led to a weaker barrier function when exposed to cigarette smoke (Schweitzer2020IGSF3). Overall, IGSF3 is important for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of lung cells, particularly in response to injurious agents like cigarette smoke (Schweitzer2020IGSF3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IGSF3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In a study of a family with NLDO, a novel 1-bp deletion mutation in the IGSF3 gene was identified, suggesting an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This mutation was found in an autozygous region on chromosome 1, and the affected children were homozygous for this variant, while the parents and an unaffected sibling were heterozygous (Foster2013Identification).

In the context of COPD, IGSF3 mutations have been associated with severe emphysema and altered cell function. A chromosomal translocation affecting IGSF3 was identified in a patient with severe COPD, leading to decreased gene expression. This deficiency in IGSF3 affects sphingolipid metabolism, cell adhesion, and wound repair, potentially increasing susceptibility to cigarette smoke-induced lung injury (Schweitzer2020IGSF3). Additionally, specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the IGSF3 locus have been linked to COPD severity, including exacerbation frequency and chronic bronchitis (Schweitzer2020IGSF3). These findings underscore the clinical significance of IGSF3 in respiratory diseases, highlighting its potential role in disease pathogenesis and progression.

## Interactions
IGSF3 interacts with several proteins, particularly within tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs) in the plasma membrane. It is known to associate with tetraspanins such as CD82, CD9, CD81, and TSPAN7, as well as the tetraspanin-interacting protein integrin β1 (ITGB1) (Schweitzer2020IGSF3). Immunoprecipitation studies have confirmed that IGSF3 binds specifically to the tetraspanin CD9, and this interaction remains stable even under cigarette smoke exposure (Schweitzer2020IGSF3). IGSF3 is also found on the cell surface with CD81 and ITGB1, indicating its role in cell adhesion and signaling (Schweitzer2020IGSF3).

In the context of neuronal development, IGSF3 forms a complex with the tetraspanin TSPAN7, which is involved in axonal morphogenesis. This interaction is crucial for regulating the size of TSPAN7 clusters, thereby influencing neuronal morphogenesis (Usardi2016The). IGSF3 does not interact with L1-CAM, highlighting the specificity of its interaction with TSPAN7 (Usardi2016The).

These interactions suggest that IGSF3 plays a significant role in cellular processes such as cell adhesion, signaling, and neuronal morphogenesis through its association with tetraspanins and other proteins.
