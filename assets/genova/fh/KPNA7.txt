# KPNA7

## Overview
KPNA7 is a gene that encodes the protein karyopherin subunit alpha 7, a member of the importin alpha family, which plays a critical role in the nuclear import of proteins. The protein is characterized by its unique structure, including an N-terminal importin beta-binding (IBB) domain and multiple armadillo (ARM) repeats, which facilitate the recognition and binding of nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins (Oostdyk2020An; Kelley2010Karyopherin). KPNA7 is distinct from other importin alpha family members due to its divergent IBB domain and specific NLS binding properties, which contribute to its specialized functions in cellular processes such as embryonic development and RNA processing (Wang2023Karyopherin; Kelley2010Karyopherin). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, where mutations and altered expression levels can lead to severe developmental and pathological outcomes (Vuorinen2018Depletion; Oostdyk2020An).

## Structure
KPNA7 is a member of the importin alpha family, characterized by its unique molecular structure. The protein features an N-terminal importin beta-binding (IBB) domain, which is crucial for its role in nuclear import. This domain is notably divergent from other importin alpha family members, suggesting it has evolved under different selective pressures (Kelley2010Karyopherin). KPNA7's structure includes multiple armadillo (ARM) repeats, which form a superhelical core structure. These ARM repeats are responsible for recognizing and binding nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins (Vuorinen2017Search; Oostdyk2020An).

The ARM repeats in KPNA7 create two main NLS binding grooves: a major groove between ARMs 2-4 and a minor groove between ARMs 6-8. The major groove interacts with both monopartite and bipartite NLS sequences, while the minor groove primarily binds bipartite NLS sequences (Oostdyk2020An). Despite the high degree of structural conservation in the NLS-binding grooves across the importin alpha family, KPNA7 exhibits distinct NLS binding specificity (Kelley2010Karyopherin).

KPNA7 is the most divergent member of the importin alpha family, sharing 55% amino acid identity with its closest relative, KPNA2 (Oostdyk2020An). The protein's structure is essential for its function in nuclear import, as it forms a complex with importin beta to facilitate the translocation of signal-containing proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Oostdyk2020An).

## Function
KPNA7, a member of the importin α family, functions as a nuclear import receptor, facilitating the transport of proteins into the nucleus by recognizing classical nuclear localization signals (cNLS) (Kelley2010Karyopherin). It binds to importin β, forming a complex that translocates through the nuclear pore complex, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression (Kelley2010Karyopherin). KPNA7 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, unlike its closely related family member KPNA2, which is mostly cytoplasmic (Kelley2010Karyopherin).

KPNA7 has been shown to bind and transport specific cNLS-containing proteins, such as those with the retinoblastoma NLS, but not the SV40 NLS, indicating a degree of specificity in its cargo selection (木本千裕2015functional page 3 of 6). It plays a crucial role in early embryonic development, as evidenced by its expression in oocytes and early-stage embryos, and its knockout results in embryonic lethality and developmental abnormalities (Wang2023Karyopherin). KPNA7 is also involved in RNA-related functions, with its binding proteins primarily participating in RNA processing and mRNA metabolic processes (木本千裕2015functional page 5 of 6). These roles underscore its importance in nuclear transport and developmental regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KPNA7 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. In neurodevelopmental contexts, mutations in KPNA7 are associated with severe developmental disabilities, infantile spasms, and epilepsy. Specific mutations, such as c.1030G > C, reduce the binding of CTCF, a protein involved in gene regulation, leading to precocious expression of KPNA7 and contributing to neurodevelopmental defects (Oostdyk2020An). Autosomal recessive mutations in KPNA7 have been identified in patients with infantile spasms and cerebellar malformation, with mutations like Pro339Ala and Glu344Gln reducing nuclear localization signal binding activity, impacting brain development (Paciorkowski2013Autosomal).

In cancer, KPNA7 is overexpressed in certain pancreatic cancer cell lines and is crucial for their growth. Silencing KPNA7 in these cells leads to growth arrest and mitotic defects, suggesting its role in cancer pathogenesis (Vuorinen2018Depletion; Vuorinen2017Search). KPNA7's expression pattern, mainly limited to cancer cells, makes it a potential target for cancer therapies (Vuorinen2018Depletion). Additionally, KPNA7 mutations have been implicated in preimplantation embryo arrest, affecting fertility by disrupting nuclear transport activity (Wang2023Karyopherin).

## Interactions
KPNA7, a member of the importin-α family, is involved in nuclear transport by interacting with various proteins. It forms a complex with importin-β1 (KPNB1), which is crucial for its role in nuclear import. This interaction is dependent on the presence of the IBB domain in KPNA7, as demonstrated by the inability of a mutant KPNA7 lacking this domain to bind KPNB1 (Hu2010Novel). KPNA7 also interacts with MVP and ZNF414, which are identified as novel cargo proteins in pancreatic cancer cell lines. These interactions were confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, and both MVP and ZNF414 contain multiple nuclear localization signals (Vuorinen2017Search).

In porcine tissue, KPNA7 interacts with proteins such as RREB, which localizes to the nucleus in oocytes and embryos, suggesting its role as a nuclear import cargo (Park2012Identification). Additionally, KPNA7 has been shown to facilitate the nuclear transport of egg-specific proteins like Stl3 in rainbow trout, indicating its role in early embryonic development (Wang2014Kpna7). These interactions highlight KPNA7's involvement in various cellular processes, including fertility, embryonic development, and cancer cell growth.
