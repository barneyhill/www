# MAPKAPK3

## Overview
MAPKAPK3 is a gene that encodes the protein MAPK activated protein kinase 3, a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including stress response, inflammation, and autophagy. The protein is activated by the p38 MAP kinase and plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Structurally, MAPK activated protein kinase 3 exhibits a typical bilobal protein kinase fold, with a high degree of sequence homology to MAPKAPK2, particularly in the catalytic domain (Cheng2009High‐resolution). Functionally, it is involved in the phosphorylation of key proteins such as Beclin 1, influencing autophagy and cellular survival mechanisms (Wei2015The). MAPKAPK3 also interacts with various proteins, including those involved in viral propagation and chromatin regulation, underscoring its diverse roles in cellular processes (Ngo2013Modulation; Voncken2005MAPKAP). Clinically, mutations in MAPKAPK3 have been associated with retinal dystrophy and its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in glioma, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ren2021MAPK; Meunier2016A).

## Structure
The MAPKAPK3 protein, also known as MAPK activated protein kinase 3, exhibits a typical bilobal protein kinase fold. Its structure includes an N-terminal lobe with a core 5-stranded β-sheet and a C-terminal lobe primarily composed of α-helices (Cheng2009High‐resolution). The protein is in an active kinase conformation, with catalytic residues Lys73, Glu84, and Asp187 positioned to interact with ATP for phosphate transfer (Cheng2009High‐resolution). The C-terminal autoinhibitory domain, which includes a nuclear export signal (NES), is well-defined and blocks the substrate binding site (Cheng2009High‐resolution).

The high-resolution crystal structure of MAPKAPK3 reveals a deep and narrow ATP binding pocket, with the ligand P4O binding in the ATP binding cleft and forming hydrogen bonds with key residues (Cheng2009High‐resolution). The structure shares high sequence homology with MAPKAPK2, particularly in the catalytic domain, with 78% identity (Cheng2009High‐resolution). Despite slight differences in the ATP binding pockets, such as conservative changes at the hinge region, these do not significantly impact ligand interaction (Cheng2009High‐resolution). The structure provides a basis for designing inhibitors targeting both MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK3 (Cheng2009High‐resolution).

## Function
MAPKAPK3, also known as MAPK activated protein kinase 3, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, particularly in response to stress and inflammation. It is activated by the p38 MAP kinase and plays a significant role in regulating gene expression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, MAPKAPK3 is expressed ubiquitously and is predominantly located in the nucleus, although it can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in response to stress stimuli (Meunier2016A; Cargnello2011Activation).

MAPKAPK3 is involved in the phosphorylation of Beclin 1 at serine 90, a critical event for the activation of autophagy during nutrient starvation. This phosphorylation is essential for Beclin 1's function in autophagy and its tumor suppressor role, highlighting MAPKAPK3's involvement in cellular survival mechanisms under stress conditions (Wei2015The).

Additionally, MAPKAPK3 plays a role in cytokine production and the stabilization of mRNAs containing AU-rich elements, which is crucial for the regulation of inflammatory responses. It shares functional redundancy with MAPKAPK2, and both kinases can influence the stability and translation of mRNAs for inflammatory genes (Cargnello2011Activation; Ronkina2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAPKAPK3 gene have been linked to a novel form of retinal dystrophy known as Martinique Crinkled Retinal Pigment Epitheliopathy (MCRPE). This condition is characterized by alterations in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Bruch's membrane, leading to a phenotype similar to retinitis pigmentosa. The specific mutation, a p.Leu173Pro substitution, affects the p38 signaling pathway, resulting in protein mislocalization and cytoskeletal changes that may inhibit cytokinesis. These alterations can lead to progressive retinal damage and photoreceptor loss (Meunier2016A).

In glioma, MAPKAPK3 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. Its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint markers, suggesting a role in tumor immune escape. This overexpression is linked to poor clinicopathologic features and survival outcomes, indicating that MAPKAPK3 could serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in glioma (Ren2021MAPK).

MAPKAPK3 also plays a role in inflammatory responses, particularly in the regulation of cytokine production and stress responses. Alterations in its expression or function can contribute to inflammatory diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, by affecting cytokine biosynthesis and the renal stress response (Guess2013Crucial; Ronkina2007The).

## Interactions
MAPKAPK3, also known as MAPK activated protein kinase 3, engages in several significant protein interactions. It is part of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and interacts with Beclin 1, a key protein in autophagy regulation. MAPKAPK3 phosphorylates Beclin 1 at serine 90, a modification essential for autophagy activation during amino acid starvation (Wei2015The). This interaction is inhibited by BCL2, a negative regulator of Beclin 1, highlighting a regulatory mechanism in autophagy (Wei2015The).

MAPKAPK3 also interacts with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein, playing a crucial role in HCV propagation. This interaction enhances HCV IRES-mediated translation, facilitating viral protein expression. The interaction is specific to HCV core proteins from genotypes 1b and 2a and is confirmed through in vitro binding and coimmunoprecipitation assays (Ngo2013Modulation).

Additionally, MAPKAPK3 interacts with Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, such as Bmi1, influencing chromatin association and gene repression. Phosphorylation by MAPKAPK3 leads to the dissociation of PcG proteins from chromatin, affecting transcriptional regulation (Voncken2005MAPKAP). These interactions underscore MAPKAPK3's role in various cellular processes, including stress response, autophagy, and viral propagation.
