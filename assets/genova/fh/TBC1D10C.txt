# TBC1D10C

## Overview
TBC1D10C is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 10C, also known as Carabin. This protein is categorized as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and plays a significant role in cellular dynamics by modulating the activity of small GTPases such as Ras and Rab35. TBC1D10C is involved in cytoskeletal and plasma membrane reorganization, which is crucial for processes like cell spreading and phagocytosis, particularly in macrophages. The protein contains intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that facilitate interactions with other proteins, enhancing its role in cytoskeletal dynamics. Additionally, TBC1D10C is implicated in cardiac function, where its expression influences heart rate and exercise capacity, suggesting a role in cardiac conduction and heart rate regulation. The gene's interactions with various signaling pathways highlight its potential significance in both immune and cardiac functions (Villagomez2021TBC1D10C; Volland2016Enhanced).

## Function
The TBC1D10C gene encodes a protein that functions as a cytoskeletal functional linker, playing a crucial role in modulating cell spreading and phagocytosis in macrophages. This protein is involved in cytoskeleton-plasma membrane reorganization and tension, which are essential for cellular processes such as cell spreading and phagocytosis (Villagomez2021TBC1D10C). TBC1D10C contains a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain that inactivates small GTPases like Ras and Rab35, which are important for cellular dynamics (Villagomez2021TBC1D10C). 

The protein also features intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that facilitate interactions with other proteins, contributing to its role in cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane tension (Villagomez2021TBC1D10C). In macrophages, TBC1D10C enhances cell spreading and increases phagocytic activity, particularly in the internalization of bacteria such as Burkholderia cenocepacia (Villagomez2021TBC1D10C). 

TBC1D10C is also implicated in cardiac function, where its enhanced expression in transgenic mice leads to reduced heart rate and improved exercise capacity and survival, suggesting a role in cardiac conduction and heart rate regulation (Volland2016Enhanced).

## Clinical Significance
The TBC1D10C gene, also known as Carabin and EPI64C, has been implicated in various cardiac conditions due to its role in regulating intracellular signaling pathways. Altered expression of TBC1D10C in cardiomyocytes is associated with significant changes in heart function, including reduced heart rate and enhanced exercise capacity, which may contribute to increased survival rates (Volland2016Enhanced). These effects are linked to decreased sympathetic stimulation and altered signal transduction pathways, such as reduced CaMKII and Ras activity, which may lead to cardioprotection by lowering cardiac ATP consumption and oxidative stress (Volland2016Enhanced).

Despite these benefits, TBC1D10C overexpression does not confer protection against cardiac hypertrophy induced by stressors like transverse aortic constriction or angiotensin II treatment, as transgenic mice did not show a reduced hypertrophic response (Volland2016Enhanced). The gene's role in heart rate regulation and cardiac conduction suggests potential therapeutic implications for managing heart rate and rhythm disorders (Volland2016Enhanced). However, the precise mechanisms and broader clinical implications of TBC1D10C in cardiac health and disease require further investigation to fully understand its potential as a therapeutic target (Volland2016Enhanced).

## Interactions
TBC1D10C, also known as Carabin, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It physically interacts with H-Ras and Calcineurin (CaN) in T cells, where it functions as a negative feedback inhibitor of the Ras/MAPK and CaN signaling pathways. These interactions are significant in cardiac hypertrophic signaling, as both pathways are heavily involved in this process (Volland2016Enhanced).

In macrophages, TBC1D10C is associated with cytoskeleton-plasma membrane reorganization, crucial for cell spreading and phagocytosis. It interacts with proteins such as tubulin, plectin, Gapdh, and Rab35, which are involved in cytoskeletal organization. The interaction with Rab35 suggests a specific role for TBC1D10C's GAP activity in these cellular processes, although its GAP domain is not essential for macrophage spreading but is necessary for phagocytosis (Villagomez2021TBC1D10C).

TBC1D10C also interacts with CD14, a pattern recognition receptor involved in the immune response against gram-negative bacteria, indicating its role in modulating immune functions (Villagomez2021TBC1D10C). These interactions highlight TBC1D10C's role as a functional linker between the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane, influencing cellular morphology and activity.
