# ETV3L

## Overview
ETV3L is a gene that encodes the ETS variant transcription factor 3 like, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by their ability to bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate the expression of target genes, playing crucial roles in various biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and development. The ETS variant transcription factor 3 like is involved in modulating gene expression patterns that are essential for normal cellular function and may have implications in pathological conditions when dysregulated. Although specific functions and interactions of ETV3L remain to be fully elucidated, its role as a transcription factor suggests it may participate in complex regulatory networks within the cell. Further research is needed to understand the precise mechanisms by which ETV3L influences cellular pathways and its potential clinical significance.
