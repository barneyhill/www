# EID1

## Overview
EID1, or EP300 interacting inhibitor of differentiation 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional repression and cellular differentiation. The EID1 protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor by interacting with the EP300 protein, a histone acetyltransferase, to inhibit its activity. This interaction plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression, cell differentiation, and maintaining genome stability through ubiquitination processes (Fu2019Transcriptome; Chen2015Protein). EID1 is particularly significant in neural cells, where it modulates protein palmitoylation and influences cell proliferation, especially in neural progenitor cells (Fu2019Transcriptome; Chen2015Protein). The protein's involvement in transcriptional regulation and its interactions with various proteins underscore its importance in cellular processes and organismal development (Yoo2013Expression).

## Function
EID1 (EP300 interacting inhibitor of differentiation 1) is a protein that functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor in healthy human cells. It interacts with the EP300 protein, a histone acetyltransferase, to inhibit its activity, thereby influencing transcription regulation and cell differentiation (Fu2019Transcriptome; Chen2015Protein). EID1 is involved in regulating differentiation, transcription, and acetyltransferase activity, and it plays a significant role in maintaining genome stability through its involvement in ubiquitination processes (Fu2019Transcriptome).

In neural cells, EID1 is crucial for regulating differentiation by modulating protein palmitoylation, a post-translational modification that affects its sub-cellular localization and function (Chen2015Protein). EID1 is also implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, particularly in neural progenitor cells, where its absence leads to reduced proliferation rates (Fu2019Transcriptome). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it modulates gene expression by inhibiting the histone acetylase activity of p300, impacting cellular growth and development (Yoo2013Expression). EID1's role in transcriptional repression and its interactions with other proteins underscore its importance in cellular processes and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EID1 gene have been implicated in several medical conditions. In the context of pregnancy, decreased expression of EID1 is associated with pre-eclampsia, particularly early-onset pre-eclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure and can lead to severe maternal and fetal complications. The downregulation of EID1 in placental tissues is linked to more severe symptoms of pre-eclampsia, higher rates of fetal growth restriction, and increased cell apoptosis in placental tissues. EID1 is thought to play a protective role by promoting the proliferation and invasion of trophoblast cells, which are essential for normal placental development (Li2022EID1).

In the brain, EID1 is involved in the proliferation of neural progenitor cells. Studies using EID1 knockout mice have shown reduced proliferation rates of these cells, suggesting that EID1 is crucial for brain development. Dysregulation of EID1 expression or function may be linked to neurological disorders, although specific diseases are not detailed. EID1 interacts with proteins involved in chromatin regulation, and its altered activity could impact neural differentiation and proliferation, potentially contributing to neurological conditions (Fu2019Transcriptome).

## Interactions
EID1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular differentiation and transcriptional regulation. It is known to inhibit the activity of CBP/p300, which are histone acetyltransferases (HATs), by suppressing their acetyltransferase activity. This interaction is crucial during neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation, where EID1 forms complexes with CBP and p300, affecting transcriptional regulation (Chen2015Protein). EID1 also binds to the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and EP300, inhibiting MYOD1 transactivation, which impacts muscle cell differentiation and nervous system development (Fu2019Transcriptome).

EID1 is involved in ubiquitination processes, interacting with E3 ubiquitin ligases such as MDM2 and FBXO21. The interaction with pRb recruits EID1 to MDM2, leading to its degradation. FBXO21 recognizes a motif in EID1 similar to the MAGE-binding motif, suggesting a protective role during the cell cycle (Fu2019Transcriptome). EID1 also interacts with RET finger proteins, including RFP and TRIM27, which possess E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase domains, further indicating its role in ubiquitination (Fu2019Transcriptome). These interactions highlight EID1's involvement in regulating chromatin and affecting cell proliferation and differentiation.
