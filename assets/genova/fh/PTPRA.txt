# PTPRA

## Overview
PTPRA is a gene that encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type A, a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. This receptor-type PTP is characterized by its extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment, and two tandem intracytoplasmic catalytic domains, which are essential for its function in cellular signaling (Huang2015PTPRA). The protein plays a critical role in dephosphorylating tyrosine residues on target proteins, thereby regulating the activity of Src family kinases and influencing various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, integrin signaling, and neuroinflammation (John2019Rare; Hill2022Does). PTPRA is involved in several protein interactions, including those with neural cell adhesion molecules and focal adhesion kinase, which are crucial for neurite outgrowth and cell migration (Boivin2013Receptor; Bodrikov2004RPTPα). Clinically, mutations and alterations in PTPRA have been associated with diseases such as Parkinson's disease, squamous cell lung cancer, schizophrenia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological and pathological contexts (Gu2017Increased; Aschner2020Protein; John2019Rare; Hill2022Does).

## Structure
The PTPRA gene encodes a protein that is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, characterized by an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment, and two tandem intracytoplasmic catalytic domains (Huang2015PTPRA). The primary structure of PTPRA includes specific amino acid sequences that allow for its function as a receptor-type PTP. The secondary structure involves elements such as an N-terminal helix-turn-helix 'wedge' motif, which plays a role in dimerization by occluding the active site of the opposing molecule (hay2021structure).

PTPRA exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with two main isoforms being identified: a longer isoform with 802 amino acids and a shorter one with 793 amino acids (Huang2015PTPRA). These isoforms differ in their glycosylation patterns, with the 100-kDa protein being exclusively N-glycosylated and the 130-kDa protein containing both N- and O-linked carbohydrates (Daum1994Multiple). The protein undergoes extensive post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which affects its molecular mass and function (Daum1994Multiple).

The quaternary structure of PTPRA involves dimerization, which is mediated by the transmembrane domain and is crucial for its regulatory function (Tertoolen2001Dimerization). This dimerization can lead to the inactivation of PTPRA, as the dimeric form occludes the catalytic sites (Tertoolen2001Dimerization).

## Function
PTPRA encodes a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a significant role in cellular signaling by dephosphorylating tyrosine residues on target proteins. This protein is crucial for regulating the activity of Src family kinases (SFKs), such as Src and Fyn, by dephosphorylating their inhibitory phosphorylated tyrosine residues, thereby promoting kinase activation. This regulation is essential for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, integrin signaling, and neuroinflammation (John2019Rare; Hill2022Does).

In the context of the hypothalamus, PTPRA modulates leptin receptor signaling by dephosphorylating JAK2, a kinase involved in leptin signaling. This action down-regulates leptin receptor signaling, affecting body weight and energy balance. Mice lacking PTPRA exhibit increased sensitivity to leptin, leading to reduced body weight and fat content, particularly in females, indicating its role in maintaining leptin resistance associated with obesity (Cohen‐Sharir2019Protein).

PTPRA is also involved in the regulation of potassium channels and NMDA receptors, contributing to neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. It interacts with neural recognition molecules, playing a role in apical dendrite development and neurite elongation, which are crucial for normal brain function and development (John2019Rare).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PTPRA gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Parkinson's disease (PD), a rare mutation known as p.R223W was identified in a multi-incident family in Queensland, Australia. This mutation is associated with altered proteolytic processing of the RPTPα protein, potentially affecting protein stability and processing, which may contribute to PD pathogenesis (Hill2022Does).

In squamous cell lung cancer (SCC), PTPRA is upregulated, correlating with poorer prognosis, larger tumor size, and advanced clinical stage. PTPRA promotes SCC cell proliferation by modulating Src activation and cell cycle progression, suggesting its oncogenic potential (Gu2017Increased).

PTPRA is also linked to schizophrenia (SZ). Several rare missense variants in PTPRA have been identified in SZ patients, with some variants predicted to be damaging. These variants are involved in neurodevelopmental processes and neurotransmitter signaling pathways relevant to SZ (Hendriks2013Protein; John2019Rare).

In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), PTPRA amplifies TGF-β-dependent profibrotic signaling in lung fibroblasts. Mice deficient in PTPRA are protected from experimental pulmonary fibrosis, indicating its role in fibrogenic signaling pathways (Aschner2020Protein).

## Interactions
PTPRA, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type A, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. PTPRA interacts with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), particularly the NCAM140 isoform, through its intracellular domain. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the p59fyn kinase, a member of the Src family kinases, which is important for neurite outgrowth and neural cell migration (Bodrikov2004RPTPα). The interaction between PTPRA and NCAM is enhanced by calcium-dependent spectrin cytoskeleton-mediated cross-linking, leading to the redistribution of the complex to lipid rafts, which is essential for p59fyn activation (Bodrikov2004RPTPα).

PTPRA also interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the ErbB2 oncoprotein in mammary epithelial cells. This interaction is part of a multiprotein complex involving GRB7 and β1-integrin, which is critical for integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration. The absence of PTPRA leads to hyperphosphorylation of FAK and increased association of β1-integrin and GRB7 with ErbB2, enhancing cell motility (Boivin2013Receptor).

Additionally, PTPRA binds with the growth arrest specific 1 protein (GAS1), which acts as a coreceptor for the RET receptor tyrosine kinase. This interaction is significant in regulating RET signaling pathways, such as Akt and MAPK, and is implicated in cancer progression (Siepe2022Identification).
