# ZSCAN10

## Overview
ZSCAN10 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 10 protein, a member of the C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor family. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs and a SCAN domain, which are crucial for its role as a transcription factor. The zinc finger motifs facilitate DNA binding, while the SCAN domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly dimerization with other SCAN domain-containing proteins (Liang2012Structural; Kraus2014Pleiotropic). ZSCAN10 is primarily expressed in embryonic stem cells, where it plays a pivotal role in maintaining pluripotency by interacting with key pluripotency markers such as OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG (Laugwitz2024ZSCAN10). The protein is also involved in chromatin remodeling and oxidative phosphorylation pathways, highlighting its importance in cellular function and genomic stability (Laugwitz2024ZSCAN10). Mutations in the ZSCAN10 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Laugwitz2024ZSCAN10).

## Structure
ZSCAN10 is a transcription factor characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs and a SCAN domain. The protein belongs to the C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor subfamily and contains 14 zinc fingers, which are crucial for stabilizing protein-DNA interactions (Kraus2014Pleiotropic). The SCAN domain, located at the N-terminal, is essential for protein-protein interactions, particularly for dimerization with other SCAN domain-containing proteins (Liang2012Structural). 

The SCAN domain of ZSCAN10, previously known as Zfp206, forms a domain-swapped antiparallel homodimer, consisting of five alpha helices in each monomer. The dimer interface is primarily hydrophobic, with some polar interactions, contributing to its stability (Liang2012Structural). This domain is also capable of forming heterodimers with other SCAN family members, such as Zfp110, through a similar domain-swapped topology (Liang2012Structural).

ZSCAN10 is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with at least six known splice variants. These isoforms are expressed in undifferentiated human and mouse embryonic stem cells and are downregulated upon differentiation (Kraus2014Pleiotropic). The protein's expression and interaction with pluripotency markers like Sox2 and Oct4 suggest its role in maintaining embryonic stem cell pluripotency (Kraus2014Pleiotropic).

## Function
ZSCAN10, also known as ZFP206, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by interacting with other key pluripotency markers such as OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG (Kraus2014Pleiotropic; Laugwitz2024ZSCAN10). It is part of the C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor family and contains a SCAN domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions and is essential for its function in regulating gene expression (Liang2012Structural). ZSCAN10 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and modulates transcriptional networks critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Laugwitz2024ZSCAN10).

In healthy human cells, ZSCAN10 is involved in the expression of genes related to stem cell pluripotency and differentiation, such as Pou5f1, Sall4, and Meis2 (Laugwitz2024ZSCAN10). It has been proposed as a marker for detecting undifferentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which is useful for quality control in iPSC-derived cell therapy products (Laugwitz2024ZSCAN10). ZSCAN10 also plays a role in chromatin remodeling and oxidative phosphorylation pathways, underscoring its importance in cellular function (Laugwitz2024ZSCAN10). Its expression decreases with age but remains detectable postnatally in the brain, testis, and pituitary gland (Laugwitz2024ZSCAN10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZSCAN10 gene are associated with a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay, behavioral abnormalities, and oto-facial malformations, including facial asymmetry and profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) (Laugwitz2024ZSCAN10). The gene's mutations, particularly protein-truncating variants (PTVs) located in exon 6, can lead to a loss of function by affecting nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) efficiency, resulting in truncated proteins that lack critical zinc finger motifs (Laugwitz2024ZSCAN10). These mutations have been identified in several affected individuals from multiple families, with consistent phenotypic features such as cognitive impairment and, in some cases, microgenitalia and maldescended testis (Laugwitz2024ZSCAN10).

ZSCAN10 is also implicated in maintaining genomic stability in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from aged donors. Its expression influences the DNA damage response and glutathione synthesis pathways, which are crucial for genomic stability (Skamagki2017ZSCAN10). Alterations in ZSCAN10 expression or mutations can lead to various phenotypic abnormalities, including changes in progenitor cell availability, which may affect the development and function of multiple organs (Kraus2014Pleiotropic). These findings underscore the gene's clinical significance in developmental disorders and its potential role in maintaining cellular integrity.

## Interactions
ZSCAN10, also known as Zfp206, is a transcription factor that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to interact with pluripotency markers such as Sox2 and Oct4, which are crucial for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Kraus2014Pleiotropic; Yamane2015Zscan10). ZSCAN10 binds to the enhancer region of Oct3/4, suggesting its integration into the pluripotency network (Yamane2015Zscan10).

ZSCAN10 also forms selective associations with other SCAN domain-containing transcription factors, such as Zscan4 and Zfp110, through its SCAN domain, which is critical for dimerization (Liang2012Structural). These interactions suggest a combinatorial action similar to the Sox-Oct partnerships during lineage commitment (Liang2012Structural).

In the context of genomic stability, ZSCAN10 interacts with key proteins involved in the DNA damage response, including ATM, p53, and PARP, highlighting its role in maintaining genomic stability in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Skamagki2017ZSCAN10). Additionally, ZSCAN10 has been shown to regulate the expression of the haptoglobin gene (Hp) during osteoclast differentiation, potentially forming a transcriptional complex with Stat3 (Yanagihara2019Zscan10).
