# GPT

## Overview
The GPT gene encodes the enzyme glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, also known as alanine aminotransferase, which is a key player in amino acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis. This enzyme, categorized as a transaminase, facilitates the reversible transamination reaction between alanine and 2-oxoglutarate, producing pyruvate and glutamate. Pyruvate is a crucial intermediate in metabolic pathways, particularly in gluconeogenesis, which is vital for maintaining glucose homeostasis, especially in the liver (Karmen1955TRANSAMINASE; Honma2017Insulininduced). While GPT is predominantly active in the liver, it is also present in other tissues such as the heart, kidneys, and muscles, where it contributes to amino acid metabolism and energy production (Karmen1955TRANSAMINASE). The enzyme's activity is integral to cellular metabolism, influencing glucose synthesis and amino acid balance. Elevated blood levels of GPT are often used as a biomarker for liver damage or disease, highlighting its significant role in liver function and overall metabolic health (Karmen1955TRANSAMINASE).

## Structure


## Function
The human gene GPT, also known as glutamic-pyruvic transaminase or alanine aminotransferase, encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in amino acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible transamination reaction between alanine and 2-oxoglutarate, resulting in the production of pyruvate and glutamate (Karmen1955TRANSAMINASE; Honma2017Insulininduced). Pyruvate, a key intermediate in metabolic pathways, is subsequently used as a substrate for gluconeogenesis, a process essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis in the liver (Honma2017Insulininduced).

GPT is primarily active in the liver, where it contributes to the regulation of glucose production, especially during fasting states when gluconeogenesis is upregulated to provide glucose to the body (Honma2017Insulininduced). The enzyme is also present in other tissues, including the heart, kidneys, and muscles, where it participates in amino acid metabolism and energy production (Karmen1955TRANSAMINASE). The activity of GPT is a critical component of cellular metabolism, influencing both the synthesis of glucose and the balance of amino acids within cells. Elevated levels of GPT in the blood can serve as a biomarker for liver damage or disease, reflecting its significant role in liver function and overall metabolic health (Karmen1955TRANSAMINASE).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GPT2 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial enzyme involved in amino acid metabolism, are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. These include intellectual and developmental disability (IDD), microcephaly, and spastic paraplegia. Specific mutations, such as NM_133443:c.[400C>T] and NM_133443:[1435G>A], have been linked to microcephaly and IDD, with some cases also presenting with spastic paraplegia and epilepsy (Kaymakcalan2017Novel). Other mutations, like c.286G>A p.96G>R, are associated with severe nonsyndromic intellectual disability, likely due to impaired enzyme catalytic activity affecting glutamate availability in the brain (LoboPrada2017A).

The clinical phenotypes of GPT2 mutations can vary, with some individuals exhibiting mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, motor delays, and small stature. These mutations often lead to reduced protein stability, loss of enzymatic activity, and decreased mitochondrial localization, significantly impacting GPT2 function (Ouyang2019GPT2). The prevalence of severe GPT2 mutations is estimated to be approximately 1 in 3,991 individuals, with moderate mutations occurring in about 1 in 264 individuals (Ouyang2019GPT2). The gene's role in synapse biology and neurotransmitter metabolism underscores its importance in brain function, with mutations leading to severe developmental and intellectual disabilities (Ouyang2019GPT2).
