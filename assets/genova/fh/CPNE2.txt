# CPNE2

## Overview
CPNE2 is a gene that encodes the protein copine 2, which is a member of the copine family of calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins. Copine 2 is characterized by its structural domains, including two C2 domains and a von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain, which facilitate its role in calcium-mediated cellular processes. The protein is involved in membrane association and protein binding, potentially influencing intracellular signaling pathways and cellular localization (Khvotchev2024Copines; Perestenko2010Copines‐1). CPNE2 has been studied for its implications in various diseases, particularly in cancer, where its expression levels and interactions have been linked to disease progression and prognosis (KałuzińskaKołat2023Antineoplastic; Zhang2022Bioinformatics). As a result, copine 2 is being explored as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target, although further research is necessary to elucidate its comprehensive role in health and disease (Zhang2022Bioinformatics).

## Structure
CPNE2 (copine 2) is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein characterized by a conserved architecture comprising two C2 domains at the N-terminus and a von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain at the C-terminus. The C2 domains, labeled C2A and C2B, are involved in calcium binding, with the C2B domain being critical for calcium-dependent membrane association, while the C2A domain is considered dispensable (Khvotchev2024Copines; Perestenko2010Copines‐1). The VWA domain is similar to that found in integrins and is involved in protein binding, potentially modulating calcium sensitivity and intracellular targeting (Perestenko2010Copines‐1; Khvotchev2024Copines).

The 3D structure of CPNE2 has been predicted to resemble a butterfly-like shape, with the C2A and C2B domains forming the 'wings' and the VWA domain forming the 'body' (Khvotchev2024Copines). The specific domain boundaries for CPNE2 are C2A (C24-E150), C2B (R155-R292), and VWA (Q305-H537) (Khvotchev2024Copines). CPNE2 can exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may influence its function and localization, although the full implications of these variants are not yet fully understood (Khvotchev2024Copines).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
CPNE2 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In neuroblastoma, CPNE2 is significantly down-regulated in high-risk patients, particularly those with segmental chromosomal alterations such as 1p-deletion and 17q-gain, which are associated with poor prognosis. This down-regulation is also observed in stage 4 neuroblastoma and in patients with MYCN amplification, a known marker for disease progression (Zhang2022Bioinformatics). The gene's expression is influenced by DNA methylation, with higher methylation levels correlating with lower expression in high-risk neuroblastoma patients (Zhang2022Bioinformatics).

In glioblastoma, CPNE2 is associated with decreased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) surface abundance, which may contribute to increased tumor proliferation in certain cell lines (KałuzińskaKołat2023Antineoplastic). CPNE2 is also noted for its lower expression in lung cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, although specific roles in lung cancer progression are not detailed (Du2022Integrated).

Overall, CPNE2's involvement in cancer suggests it could serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target, although further research is needed to fully understand its role across different conditions (Zhang2022Bioinformatics).
