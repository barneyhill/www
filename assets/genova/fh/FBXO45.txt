# FBXO45

## Overview
FBXO45 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 45, a member of the F-box protein family, which plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) as a substrate-recognition subunit of E3 ligases. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, including protein degradation, neural development, and synaptic regulation. F-box protein 45 is involved in forming complexes that regulate neurotransmission and synaptic activity, crucial for proper nervous system development and function (Lin2020FBXO45). Additionally, FBXO45 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, particularly cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Lin2021Elevated; von2023Identification). The protein's interactions and regulatory functions underscore its significance in both normal cellular physiology and disease states.

## Function
FBXO45 is a member of the F-box protein family, functioning as a substrate-recognition subunit of E3 ligases within the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). This system is essential for protein degradation, impacting various cellular processes such as transcription, mitosis, cell cycle regulation, proliferation, apoptosis, genomic stability, and signaling pathways (Lin2020FBXO45). In healthy human cells, FBXO45 plays a crucial role in neural development by forming the FBXO45-PAM complex, which regulates neurotransmission through the degradation of Munc13-1, a synaptic vesicle-priming factor. This regulation is vital for controlling synaptic activity and ensuring proper nervous system development (Lin2020FBXO45).

FBXO45 also interacts with N-cadherin, enhancing neuronal differentiation, which is atypical for F-box proteins that usually target substrates for degradation. It regulates synapse maturation and axon degeneration by targeting NMNAT2 for degradation, highlighting its role in maintaining neural health and development (Lin2020FBXO45). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences processes like axon guidance and neural circuit formation, contributing to the maintenance of protein homeostasis in cells (Lin2020FBXO45).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FBXO45 gene have been implicated in various human diseases, particularly cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FBXO45 is frequently overexpressed, promoting tumorigenesis by enhancing the ubiquitination and activation of IGF2BP1, which leads to the upregulation of PLK1. This mechanism is associated with larger tumor size, advanced TNM stage, and poor differentiation, making FBXO45 an independent risk factor for poor overall survival in HCC patients (Lin2021Elevated).

In prostate cancer, high FBXO45 expression is linked to adverse clinicopathological parameters and is associated with biochemical recurrence and progression to distant metastasis. It serves as an independent prognostic marker, particularly in TMPRSS2-ERG-positive prostate cancer, where strong cytoplasmic expression correlates with shortened progression-free survival (von2023Identification).

FBXO45 also plays a role in pancreatic cancer by targeting the tumor suppressor USP49 for degradation, facilitating tumor progression. Higher FBXO45 expression in pancreatic cancer tissues correlates with shorter survival periods, suggesting its potential as a marker for poor prognosis (Wu2022Fbxo45).

Beyond cancer, FBXO45 is involved in nervous system disorders. Its deletion in mice leads to respiratory distress and improper neural development, implicating it in conditions like neuropathic pain and schizophrenia due to its role in synaptic activity (Lin2020FBXO45).

## Interactions
FBXO45, an F-box protein, is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It forms part of an atypical SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with Skp1 and MYCBP2, but not with Cullin1 or Rbx1, indicating a unique multicomponent E3 ligase formation (Chen2014Fbxo45mediated). FBXO45 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein Par-4 (PAWR) through its SPRY domain, leading to Par-4's ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This interaction is crucial for regulating apoptosis in cancer cells, as silencing FBXO45 stabilizes Par-4 and enhances apoptosis (Chen2014Fbxo45mediated).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FBXO45 interacts with the protein IGF2BP1, promoting its polyubiquitination at specific lysine residues (K190 and K450). This interaction enhances IGF2BP1's oncogenic activity and is crucial for the upregulation of PLK1, a key regulator of cell proliferation (Lin2021Elevated). The ubiquitination of IGF2BP1 by FBXO45 involves K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which do not lead to proteasomal degradation but rather enhance IGF2BP1's activity (Lin2021Elevated). These interactions highlight FBXO45's role in promoting liver tumorigenesis through the IGF2BP1-PLK1 axis (Lin2021Elevated).
