# ZNF783

## Overview
ZNF783 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 783, a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which are small protein structural motifs that can bind to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. Zinc finger protein 783 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, by interacting with specific DNA sequences to modulate gene expression. The precise biological functions and pathways involving ZNF783 remain to be fully elucidated, but its role in gene regulation suggests potential implications in developmental processes and disease states. Further research is needed to understand the specific interactions and clinical significance of ZNF783 in human health and disease.
