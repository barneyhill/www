# C9orf85

## Overview
C9orf85 is a gene located on chromosome 9 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 9 open reading frame 85. This protein is currently not well-characterized, and its precise biological functions remain largely unknown. C9orf85 has been identified as significantly downregulated in ZIP8 knockout human cells, suggesting a potential role in cellular processes related to micronutrient uptake and homeostasis (Tan2022Singlegene). The protein has been observed to interact with TMEM30A, although it shows limited interactions with other proteins in specific cellular contexts (Tan2022Singlegene). Despite its unclear functional role, C9orf85 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including potential links to reproductive disorders and cancer pathways (Quimbaya2012Identification; Kobayashi2014Genes). The gene's classification as a protein-coding gene has been debated, with some studies questioning whether it encodes a functional protein (Jungreis2018Nearly). Further research is necessary to elucidate the biological and clinical significance of C9orf85.

## Clinical Significance
C9orf85, located on chromosome 9, has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although its specific role in diseases remains largely uncharacterized. The gene is associated with ZIP8 malfunction, a transmembrane protein involved in the uptake of essential micronutrients. In ZIP8 knockout (KO) cells, C9orf85 is significantly downregulated, suggesting its potential involvement in conditions related to micronutrient dysregulation, such as malnutrition and certain cancers (Tan2022Singlegene).

C9orf85 is also noted as a paternally imprinted gene located near endometriosis-susceptibility genes, indicating a possible link to reproductive disorders (Kobayashi2014Genes). Additionally, the gene has been identified as a putative cancer gene through comparative genomics, with potential roles in ribosome biogenesis and cancer pathways (Quimbaya2012Identification).

Despite these associations, the specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations or expression changes in C9orf85 are not well-documented. The gene's classification as a protein-coding gene has been questioned, with some studies suggesting it may not encode a functional protein (Jungreis2018Nearly). Further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance.

## Interactions
C9orf85, a protein encoded by a gene on chromosome 9, has been identified as significantly downregulated in ZIP8 knockout (ZIP8-KO) human cells. In the context of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, C9orf85 was found to interact with TMEM30A. However, it does not directly interact with any other proteins analyzed in the network of 286 differentially expressed proteins in ZIP8-KO cells (Tan2022Singlegene). Despite being among the top-10 most downregulated proteins in the ZIP8-KO model, C9orf85 showed limited interactions within this subset, indicating a lack of extensive interaction with other proteins in this specific context (Tan2022Singlegene).

The study did not provide specific details on the physical interactions of C9orf85 with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond TMEM30A. The biological function of C9orf85 remains largely uncharacterized, and its role in cellular processes is not well understood (Tan2022Singlegene). The research highlights the need for further investigation to elucidate the potential interactions and functional implications of C9orf85 in human cells, particularly in relation to ZIP8 malfunction and associated diseases (Tan2022Singlegene).
