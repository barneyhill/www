# TMEM126A

## Overview
TMEM126A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 126A, a mitochondrial transmembrane protein integral to the assembly and function of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. This protein is specifically involved in the biogenesis and stability of the ND4-module of complex I, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial energy production and cellular metabolism (Formosa2020Optic; D’Angelo2020Biogenesis). TMEM126A is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains and is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it interacts with various mitochondrial proteins and complexes to facilitate the proper assembly of complex I (Kloth2019Novel; Poerschke2024Investigation). Mutations in the TMEM126A gene are linked to non-syndromic autosomal recessive optic atrophy, a condition marked by progressive vision loss due to optic nerve degeneration, and have been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction and certain cancers (Sun2019Loss; Kloth2019Novel).

## Structure
The TMEM126A protein is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein implicated in non-syndromic autosomal recessive optic atrophy. It is predicted to contain four transmembrane domains, with the first domain formed by amino acid residues 39-57 (Kloth2019Novel). The second transmembrane domain, spanning amino acids 66-85, is crucial for mitochondrial localization (Kloth2019Novel). The N-terminus, comprising amino acids 1-38, is of unknown function but is speculated to potentially act as a mitochondrial targeting leader sequence, although it lacks typical features of mitochondrial presequences (Kloth2019Novel).

Variants in TMEM126A, such as the splice donor variant c.86 + 2 T > C, lead to the skipping of exon 2, resulting in a shorter protein isoform that lacks the first seventy amino acids, including the second transmembrane domain, which is hypothesized to impair mitochondrial localization (Kloth2019Novel). Another variant, p.(S36 L), does not affect mitochondrial localization but may have other pathogenic effects (Kloth2019Novel).

The protein's role in mitochondrial complex I assembly, specifically in the ND4-module, suggests its involvement in maintaining the integrity of this module, although the exact molecular structure beyond the transmembrane domains is not detailed in the available context (Formosa2020Optic; D’Angelo2020Biogenesis).

## Function
TMEM126A is a crucial assembly factor for the ND4-module of mitochondrial complex I, playing a significant role in its biogenesis and stability. In healthy human cells, TMEM126A is involved in the assembly and maturation of complex I by interacting with newly synthesized mtDNA-encoded subunits, particularly ND4, and other complex I subunits and assembly factors (Formosa2020Optic). This protein is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it facilitates the proper assembly and function of complex I, which is essential for mitochondrial energy generation and overall cellular metabolism (Formosa2020Optic).

TMEM126A functions independently of its paralog TMEM126B, which is involved in the assembly of a different module of complex I, indicating a specialized role for TMEM126A in the ND4-module assembly (Formosa2020Optic). The loss of TMEM126A results in decreased levels of complex I, leading to isolated complex I deficiency and associated conditions such as autosomal recessive optic atrophy (Formosa2020Optic). TMEM126A's role in maintaining complex I activity is crucial for the proper function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, impacting cellular energy production and homeostasis (D’Angelo2020Biogenesis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM126A gene are associated with non-syndromic autosomal recessive optic atrophy (arOA), a condition characterized by progressive vision loss due to optic nerve degeneration. This condition often presents with early-onset severe bilateral visual acuity deficiency, optic disc pallor, and central scotoma (Kloth2019Novel; Seo2022Genetic). Pathogenic variants in TMEM126A, such as splice donor site variants and missense mutations, have been identified in diverse populations, indicating its role in arOA across different ethnic groups (Kloth2019Novel; Seo2022Genetic).

TMEM126A mutations can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, specifically affecting the assembly of Complex I (CI) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This results in impaired oxidative phosphorylation and reduced respiratory capacity, which are critical for the energy production required by retinal ganglion cells (D’Angelo2020Biogenesis). In addition to optic atrophy, some individuals with TMEM126A mutations may exhibit mild extra-ocular symptoms, such as auditory neuropathy or sensory-motor axonal neuropathy (Kloth2019Novel).

Alterations in TMEM126A expression have also been linked to cancer. Downregulation of TMEM126A is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, promoting metastasis through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and extracellular matrix remodeling (Sun2019Loss).

## Interactions
TMEM126A is a mitochondrial transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. It interacts with several proteins and complexes within the mitochondria. TMEM126A is known to interact with the ND4-module of complex I, facilitating its assembly and stability (D’Angelo2020Biogenesis). It is also associated with the mitochondrial insertase OXA1L, forming a complex that is essential for the biogenesis of the ND4-module. This interaction is independent of active mitochondrial translation but requires a fully assembled mitochondrial ribosome (Poerschke2024Investigation).

TMEM126A is a component of the OXA1L complex and interacts with newly synthesized mitochondrial-encoded translation products, indicating its broader role in mitochondrial protein synthesis (Poerschke2024Investigation). It also co-purifies with proteins involved in the early assembly steps of complex I, such as NDUFA5, NDUFB10, and NDUFB11 (Poerschke2024Investigation). These interactions highlight TMEM126A's role as a critical assembly factor for complex I and its involvement in mitochondrial ribosome regulation.
