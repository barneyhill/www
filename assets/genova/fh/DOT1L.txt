# DOT1L

## Overview
DOT1L is a gene that encodes the DOT1 like histone lysine methyltransferase, a crucial enzyme involved in the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 79 (H3K79). This enzyme is categorized as a histone methyltransferase and plays a significant role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression. The DOT1L protein is essential for various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA damage repair, and cell cycle progression. It is particularly important in hematopoiesis, where it supports the differentiation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Additionally, DOT1L is involved in cartilage homeostasis by modulating the Wnt signaling pathway. Clinically, DOT1L is implicated in several cancers, including leukemias and solid tumors, making it a target for therapeutic interventions (Alexandrova2022Histone; Nguyen2011The; Monteagudo2017DOT1L).

## Structure
DOT1L, also known as disruptor of telomeric silencing or Kmt4, is a histone methyltransferase responsible for methylating histone H3 at lysine 79 (H3K79). The molecular structure of DOT1L is characterized by a conserved catalytic core region shared with its homologs across various species, including yeast, worm, fly, mouse, and human. This region contains four sequence motifs (I, post I, II, and III) typical of SAM-dependent methyltransferases (Nguyen2011The).

The crystal structure of DOT1L reveals an open alpha/beta structure composed of a seven-stranded beta sheet, which is characteristic of class I SAM-dependent methyltransferases. Despite structural similarities to arginine methyltransferases, DOT1L specifically catalyzes lysine methylation. The tertiary structure is defined by the substrate-binding pocket, which is more similar to that of class I arginine methyltransferases than to lysine methyltransferases like hNSD1 (Nguyen2011The).

DOT1L also contains three coiled-coil domains, which are central to its interaction with the AF10 protein. These domains are evolutionarily conserved and engage in binding with the OM-LZ region of AF10, forming a heterotetramer in solution with a V-shaped architecture (Zhang2018Structural). The interaction between DOT1L and AF10 is crucial for MLL-AF10-associated leukemogenesis (Zhang2018Structural).

## Function
DOT1L (DOT1 like histone lysine methyltransferase) is a crucial enzyme in healthy human cells, primarily responsible for the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 79 (H3K79). This methylation is essential for maintaining proper chromatin structure and regulating gene expression. DOT1L's activity is involved in several key cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA damage repair, and cell cycle progression (Vlaming2016The; Nguyen2011The).

In the context of hematopoiesis, DOT1L is vital for the differentiation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Its enzymatic activity supports the expression of genes necessary for hematopoietic stem cell development and function, and its loss can lead to severe hematological disorders such as anemia and bone marrow failure (Nguyen2011Essential; Arnold2022The).

DOT1L also plays a significant role in cartilage homeostasis by modulating the Wnt signaling pathway. It acts as a negative regulator of Wnt target genes, thereby preventing excessive signaling that could lead to cartilage degradation and osteoarthritis (Monteagudo2017DOT1L).

Overall, DOT1L's methyltransferase activity is crucial for maintaining normal cellular and developmental processes, influencing transcriptional activation and repression within the nucleus (Nguyen2011The).

## Clinical Significance
The DOT1L gene is clinically significant due to its role in various cancers, particularly leukemias and solid tumors. In leukemias, DOT1L is implicated in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) rearrangements, where it is recruited to aberrant target sites by MLL fusion proteins, leading to increased H3K79 methylation and ectopic gene expression. This process is crucial for the upregulation of leukemia-relevant genes such as HOXA9 and MEIS1, contributing to leukemogenesis (Vlaming2016The; Stein2018The; Okada2005hDOT1L). Inhibitors like pinometostat have been developed to target DOT1L's methyltransferase activity, showing potential in treating MLL-rearranged leukemias (Stein2018The).

Beyond hematologic malignancies, DOT1L is associated with several solid tumors, including breast, prostate, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. High DOT1L expression is linked to poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. In breast cancer, DOT1L promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis, particularly in triple-negative subtypes (Alexandrova2022Histone). In prostate cancer, DOT1L is involved in androgen receptor signaling and is associated with poor disease-free survival (Alexandrova2022Histone). These findings highlight DOT1L as a promising target for therapeutic intervention in both hematologic and solid tumors (Alexandrova2022Histone).

## Interactions
DOT1L, a histone methyltransferase, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate its recruitment and activity. It forms part of the DotCom complex, which includes proteins such as AF9, ENL, and AF10. These proteins are crucial for DOT1L's function, with AF9 and ENL being key partners that influence its recruitment to chromatin. AF9, in particular, is essential for recruiting DOT1L to sites where H3K9 is acetylated, such as transcription start sites (Vlaming2016The; Mohan2010Linking).

Mutations in AF9, such as D546R, can disrupt DOT1L recruitment, affecting the methylation states of H3K79 (Vlaming2016The). DOT1L also interacts with MLL fusion proteins, like MLL-AF9, which recruit it to MLL target genes, leading to deregulated H3K79 methylation and enhanced expression of leukemogenic genes (Grigsby2021Elucidating).

The interaction between DOT1L and AF10 is mediated through the OM-LZ region of AF10, which is crucial for MLL-AF10-mediated leukemogenesis (Okada2005hDOT1L). Additionally, DOT1L interacts with the E3 ligase RNF8, which ubiquitinates DOT1L, targeting it for degradation. Acetylation by CBP protects DOT1L from this degradation (Liu2020CBP).
