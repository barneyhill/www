# ZNF281

## Overview
ZNF281 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 281, a transcription factor characterized by its C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and protein interactions. This protein plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response (DDR), particularly in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway, by interacting with key components such as XRCC4 and DNA-PKcs (Nicolai2019ZNF281). Beyond its involvement in DNA repair, zinc finger protein 281 is implicated in the regulation of gene expression related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis, interacting with transcription factors like SNAIL and ZEB1 (Ji2020ZNF281miR543). Clinically, ZNF281 is associated with various cancers, where its expression levels correlate with tumor aggressiveness and patient prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Pieraccioli2018ZNF281; Qian2017ZNF281).

## Structure
ZNF281, also known as zinc finger protein 281, is characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA binding capability (Zhao2023ZNF281). These domains consist of cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate with zinc ions, forming stable tetrahedral structures (guo2024research). The primary structure of ZNF281 includes a sequence rich in these residues, which is typical for zinc finger proteins.

The secondary structure of ZNF281 likely involves alpha helices and beta sheets, common in proteins with zinc finger motifs, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure is stabilized by the coordination of zinc ions, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity required for DNA binding and interaction with other proteins (Nicolai2019ZNF281).

ZNF281 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are important for its function and localization. Specifically, phosphorylation by DDR kinases ATM and ATR at sites S785 and S807 is crucial for its recruitment to DNA damage sites (Nicolai2019ZNF281). ZNF281 can exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function and localization, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the context.

## Function
ZNF281 is a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays a significant role in the DNA damage response (DDR) in healthy human cells. It is rapidly recruited to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and facilitates the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway. ZNF281 interacts with core components of the NHEJ complex, such as XRCC4 and DNA-PKcs, through its zinc-finger domain, which is crucial for these interactions (Nicolai2019ZNF281). The presence of ZNF281 is essential for efficient DNA repair, as its depletion leads to impaired NHEJ repair efficiency and increased levels of γ-H2AX foci, a marker of unrepaired DNA damage (Nicolai2019ZNF281).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, ZNF281 is involved in regulating the expression of genes associated with the DDR. It acts as a transcriptional regulator, controlling the expression of XRCC2 and XRCC4, which are involved in homologous recombination and NHEJ, respectively (Pieraccioli2015ZNF281). ZNF281's activity in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA, is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and cell survival by facilitating the repair of DSBs (Nicolai2019ZNF281).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF281 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer progression. In neuroblastoma, high expression of ZNF281 is associated with aggressive, undifferentiated tumors and poor clinical outcomes. It acts as a transcriptional repressor, inhibiting neuronal differentiation by suppressing genes like GDNF and NRP2, and is regulated by MYCN and TAp73 (Pieraccioli2018ZNF281). In pancreatic cancer, ZNF281 promotes cell growth and invasion through the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, correlating with poor prognosis (Qian2017ZNF281).

ZNF281 also plays a role in DNA repair, particularly in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Its high expression is linked to poor prognosis in patients treated with DNA-damaging therapies, suggesting a role in chemoresistance (Nicolai2019ZNF281). In inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, ZNF281 is up-regulated in inflamed tissues, contributing to inflammation and fibrosis through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Pierdomenico2018Transcription).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, ZNF281 suppresses mitochondrial biogenesis, facilitating cancer metastasis (Zhao2023ZNF281). Its expression is also linked to poor prognosis in several other cancers, including gastric cancer, where it influences chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil (Li2024Identification).

## Interactions
ZNF281 is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with XRCC4, a core component of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway, facilitating XRCC4's recruitment to DNA damage sites. This interaction is crucial for efficient DNA repair and cell viability following DNA damage (Nicolai2019ZNF281). ZNF281 also interacts with DNA-PKcs, another key component of the NHEJ complex, through multiple regions of its structure, while its zinc-finger domain is essential for binding to XRCC4 and Ku proteins (Nicolai2019ZNF281).

In the context of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), ZNF281 interacts with the transcription factors SNAIL and ZEB1, forming a feedback loop with miR-543 that regulates EMT and cancer metastasis (Ji2020ZNF281miR543). ZNF281 also forms a positive feedback loop with SNAIL, stabilizing EMT and affecting the localization and activity of β-catenin, a protein involved in cell adhesion and signaling (Hahn2013SNAIL). Additionally, ZNF281 is recruited by GATA4 to cardiac enhancers, influencing cardiac gene expression and repressing inflammatory signaling through its association with the NuRD complex (Zhou2017ZNF281).
