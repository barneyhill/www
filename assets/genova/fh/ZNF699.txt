# ZNF699

## Overview
ZNF699 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 699, a nuclear protein characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which are typically involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein is categorized as a zinc finger protein, a class known for its role in gene expression modulation through interaction with specific DNA sequences. ZNF699 is implicated in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, although its precise functions in normal human physiology remain largely unexplored. The gene has been associated with several clinical conditions, such as alcohol dependence and DEGCAGS syndrome, and is linked to cancer progression, particularly in oral squamous cell carcinoma with perineural invasion (Riley2006Alcohol; Kuk2024Prognostic; BertoliAvella2021Combining). Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the biological roles and mechanisms of ZNF699 in human health and disease.

## Structure
The ZNF699 gene encodes a large nuclear zinc finger protein, which suggests a role in nucleic acid binding (Biela2022Further). The protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which are typically involved in DNA binding. These domains are rich in cysteine and histidine residues, which coordinate zinc ions to stabilize the protein's structure. The primary structure of ZNF699 includes a KRAB domain, a feature found only in tetrapod vertebrates, indicating a role in transcriptional regulation (Riley2006Alcohol).

The full-length ZNF699 protein consists of 643 amino acids (Biela2022Further). The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, common in zinc finger proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure is stabilized by zinc ions, which are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the zinc finger motifs. The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, although specific partners are not mentioned in the provided context.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination could occur, as these are common in zinc finger proteins, but specific modifications for ZNF699 are not detailed in the context. The protein's role in nucleic acid binding and potential involvement in transcriptional regulation are suggested by its structural features.

## Function
ZNF699 is a zinc finger protein that is believed to play a role in nucleic acid binding, given its structure as a large nuclear zinc-finger protein. This suggests its involvement in transcriptional regulation, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains largely unexplored (BertoliAvella2021Combining). The protein is localized in the nucleus, which is typical for zinc finger proteins that function as transcription factors, influencing gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences (BertoliAvella2021Combining).

ZNF699 has been associated with various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription, as indicated by its clustering under the Gene Ontology (GO) biological process term 'regulation of transcription, DNA-templated' (Kuk2024Prognostic). Despite these associations, the precise molecular activities and pathways involving ZNF699 in normal physiology are not well-documented. The gene has been implicated in several disorders when mutated, suggesting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (BertoliAvella2021Combining).

Research has also linked ZNF699 to alcohol dependence, although this association primarily focuses on its genetic variations rather than its functional role in healthy cells (Riley2006Alcohol). Further studies are needed to elucidate the specific functions and mechanisms of ZNF699 in human biology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZNF699 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. Notably, ZNF699 has been linked to alcohol dependence (AD). Studies have shown that certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the ZNF699 gene are significantly associated with AD, with some markers showing strong evidence of association. These genetic variations are thought to contribute to a predisposition to alcohol dependence, potentially through altered expression levels of ZNF699 in the brain (Riley2006Alcohol).

ZNF699 has also been implicated in a malformation syndrome known as DEGCAGS syndrome, characterized by developmental delay and abnormalities in multiple organ systems, including the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, genitourinary, and skeletal systems. This syndrome is associated with homozygous loss-of-function variants in the ZNF699 gene, leading to severe neurodevelopmental disorders and other systemic abnormalities (Biela2022Further; BertoliAvella2021Combining).

In the context of cancer, ZNF699 mutations have been identified in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) with perineural invasion, where it is associated with a higher risk of poor prognosis. This suggests that ZNF699 may play a role in the progression of certain cancers (Kuk2024Prognostic).
