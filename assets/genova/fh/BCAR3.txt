# BCAR3

## Overview
BCAR3 (Breast Cancer Anti-Estrogen Resistance 3) is a gene that encodes the BCAR3 adaptor protein, a member of the Novel SH2-containing Protein (NSP) family. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a Cdc25-homology domain and an SH2 domain, which facilitate its role as an adaptor protein in various intracellular signaling pathways. The BCAR3 protein is involved in critical cellular processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, primarily through its interactions with phosphorylated proteins like p130Cas and Src kinase. These interactions are essential for modulating signal transduction pathways that influence cell motility and resistance to anti-estrogen therapies, particularly in breast cancer. BCAR3's expression is tissue-specific, with notable presence in the placenta, skeletal muscle, spleen, and lymph nodes, and its dysregulation is implicated in the progression and treatment resistance of several cancer types, including breast cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Moon2024Deciphering; Wallez2014Association; Oh2013Functional).

## Structure
BCAR3 is a protein that features a Cdc25-homology domain, which is structurally characterized by a Ras-type GDP exchange factor architecture. However, it adopts a unique 'closed' conformation that deviates from typical GEF structures, rendering it incapable of classical enzymatic activity (Mace2011NSPCas). This closed conformation is due to the bending of helices αh and αi, with helix αi split into two portions, contributing to the occlusion of the GTPase binding site (Mace2011NSPCas). The C-terminal domain of BCAR3, spanning residues 502-825, was crystallized and solved at a resolution of 2.4 Å, revealing these structural features (Mace2011NSPCas).

BCAR3 contains an SH2 domain, which is crucial for binding to phospho-tyrosine motifs in activated receptor tyrosine kinases, such as Eph and ErbB receptors (Vervoort2007Splice). The protein also includes a serine/proline-rich domain, important for its function in inducing p130Cas phosphorylation (Makkinje2009AND34BCAR3). BCAR3 has several splice variants, including BCAR3α1, BCAR3α2, BCAR3α3, and BCAR3β, which differ in their 5′ untranslated regions and sometimes the beginning of their coding regions (Vervoort2007Splice). These structural adaptations allow BCAR3 to function as an adaptor protein, forming signaling modules that regulate cellular processes (Mace2011NSPCas).

## Function
BCAR3, a member of the Novel SH2-containing Protein (NSP) family, plays a significant role in intracellular signal transduction pathways, particularly those involving growth factors. It is involved in insulin-mediated signaling pathways, contributing to DNA synthesis and membrane ruffling, but not in GLUT4 translocation (Oh2013Functional). BCAR3's function in these pathways is crucial for cell cycle progression and cytoskeletal reorganization in response to insulin signaling (Oh2013Functional).

BCAR3 interacts with phosphorylated proteins such as Cas, p95, and p60, with its SH2 domain being essential for these interactions, particularly in insulin-stimulated pathways (Oh2013Functional). It is also involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and spreading, as demonstrated in human glomerular mesangial cells where it mediates endothelin-1 signaling via the p130Cas/BCAR3 cascade (Rufanova2008Pyk2).

In healthy human cells, BCAR3 is expressed in tissues like the placenta, skeletal muscle, spleen, and lymph nodes, suggesting tissue-specific functions (Oh2013Functional). Its role in cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation is facilitated through interactions with proteins like p130Cas and Crk, contributing to cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular responses to external stimuli (Vervoort2007Splice).

## Clinical Significance
The BCAR3 gene is clinically significant in various cancers due to its role in promoting anti-estrogen resistance and enhancing cell migration and invasion. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), high BCAR3 expression is associated with decreased survival rates and increased tumor aggressiveness (Moon2024Deciphering). BCAR3 overexpression is linked to tamoxifen resistance, a common treatment for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, and facilitates cell migration by interacting with p130Cas, promoting membrane localization and ruffling (Schrecengost2007Breast). 

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), BCAR3 overexpression correlates with enhanced tumor growth and poor survival outcomes (Moon2024Deciphering). Conversely, in multiple myeloma (MM), high BCAR3 expression is associated with a favorable prognosis, indicating its complex role in different cancer types (Zhang2018Prediction). BCAR3 also plays a role in ovarian cancer, where its expression is regulated by tRF5-Glu, with lower levels linked to suppressed cell proliferation (Moon2024Deciphering). 

Alterations in BCAR3 expression or function can significantly impact cancer progression and treatment resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Moon2024Deciphering).

## Interactions
BCAR3, a member of the NSP family, is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence cell signaling pathways, particularly in breast cancer cells. BCAR3 interacts with BCAR1 (also known as p130Cas), forming a complex that is essential for antiestrogen resistance and cell motility. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of BCAR1, enhancing its role in resistance mechanisms (Cross2016Breast; Wallez2014Association). 

BCAR3 also interacts with the Src kinase, augmenting its binding to p130Cas and increasing tyrosine phosphorylation, which is vital for cell motility and adhesion dynamics (Schuh2010BCAR3; Makkinje2012Breast). The BCAR3-SH2 domain specifically binds to phospho-Tyr789 of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase α (PTPα), facilitating the formation of a complex with Cas and Src, which is important for integrin-mediated signaling at focal adhesions (Sun2012Protein).

BCAR3's interaction with HEF1, another Cas family member, is characterized by a stable complex that influences the conformation of BCAR3's GEF domain, although it does not directly bind certain GTPases (Garron2009Structural). These interactions collectively underscore BCAR3's role in modulating protein complexes that drive cancer cell invasion and resistance to therapies.
