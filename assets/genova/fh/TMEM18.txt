# TMEM18

## Overview
TMEM18 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 18, a small protein characterized by its three transmembrane domains and nuclear localization signal. This protein is predominantly alpha-helical and plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation and gene silencing. TMEM18 is known for its ability to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner, particularly favoring the GCT nucleotide triplet, and it can oligomerize to enhance its DNA-binding stability. The protein's expression is widespread across various tissues, including the brain, where it is involved in energy homeostasis and feeding behavior regulation. TMEM18's interactions with nuclear pore proteins and transcription factors suggest its involvement in nuclear transport and chromatin organization. Clinically, variations in the TMEM18 gene have been associated with obesity and metabolic disorders, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Almén2010The; Chermon2023Drinking; Jurvansuu2011Obesity).

## Structure
The TMEM18 protein is a small protein consisting of 140 amino acids and is predicted to be mostly alpha-helical with three transmembrane domains (Jurvansuu2011Obesity). The C-terminal region of TMEM18 contains a nuclear localization signal and is characterized by an array of large hydrophilic amino acids, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability (Jurvansuu2011Obesity). This region is positively charged and extends outward from the membrane, facilitating its interaction with DNA (Jurvansuu2011Obesity).

TMEM18 is capable of binding both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, with a preference for double-stranded DNA, and shows a specific affinity for the GCT nucleotide triplet (Jurvansuu2011Obesity). The protein can oligomerize, a feature common among DNA-binding proteins, and this self-association is facilitated by cysteines in the transmembrane domains, suggesting a role for disulfide bonding (Jurvansuu2011Obesity). TMEM18's dimerization enhances its DNA-binding stability and is thought to occur through its transmembrane parts within the lipid membrane (Jurvansuu2011Obesity).

The protein's small size, approximately 17 kDa, allows it to bind DNA without leaving space for large protein complexes, which may contribute to its role in transcriptional repression (Jurvansuu2011Obesity).

## Function
TMEM18 is a transmembrane protein involved in several cellular processes, including gene silencing and transcriptional regulation. It is a small protein with a nuclear localization signal and three predicted transmembrane helices, suggesting its role in the nucleus and potential involvement in DNA or RNA binding (Almén2010The; Jurvansuu2011Obesity). TMEM18 binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner, particularly favoring the GCT nucleotide triplet, and this binding is facilitated by its positively charged C-terminus (Jurvansuu2011Obesity). The protein can oligomerize, which enhances its DNA binding capability, and it may function as a transcriptional repressor by sequestering transcription factors to the nuclear periphery or directly binding to DNA, leaving no space for large transcription machinery (Jurvansuu2011Obesity).

TMEM18 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, where it is present in most neuronal cells across major brain regions. Its expression is not limited to the hypothalamus, indicating broader functions in the body (Almén2010The). The protein's role in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation suggests it may help maintain genomic stability by keeping chromatin perinuclear (Jurvansuu2011Obesity). TMEM18's involvement in energy homeostasis and its expression in brain regions crucial for regulating energy balance and feeding behavior imply a role in the regulation of consumption and body weight (Almén2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TMEM18 gene have been linked to obesity and related metabolic conditions. Several studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near TMEM18 that are associated with increased body mass index (BMI) and obesity risk. For instance, SNPs such as rs939583 and rs1879523 have been shown to significantly elevate obesity risk, with odds ratios ranging from 1.19 to 1.73 (Chermon2023Drinking). The TMEM18 gene is also implicated in type 2 diabetes, particularly in individuals with certain genotypes, such as CC + CT, which are associated with increased waist circumference, BMI, and other metabolic parameters (Kang2020Obesityrelated).

In children, TMEM18 variants like rs4854344 and rs6548238 are linked to higher BMI and larger waist circumference, suggesting a genetic influence on obesity that is independent of dietary habits (RaskAndersen2011Association). The gene's expression in the brain, particularly in regions like the hypothalamus, may play a role in regulating appetite and body weight, contributing to its association with obesity (Chermon2023Drinking). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TMEM18 in obesity and related metabolic disorders, highlighting the potential for genetic and lifestyle interventions to mitigate these risks.

## Interactions
TMEM18 is known to participate in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It has been identified as a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, with a preference for binding to GCT nucleotide trimers. This binding is facilitated by its ability to form dimers, which enhances its DNA-binding affinity and specificity (Jurvansuu2011Obesity). The C-terminal region of TMEM18, which contains positively charged amino acids, is crucial for its DNA-binding capability. Deletion of these residues abolishes its ability to bind DNA (Jurvansuu2011Obesity).

TMEM18 also interacts with nuclear pore proteins, specifically NDC1 and AAAS, as identified through affinity purification and mass spectrometry. These interactions were confirmed using biomolecular immunofluorescence complementation assays, indicating a high abundance of these proteins in association with TMEM18 (Larder2017Loss). These interactions suggest a role for TMEM18 in the transport of molecules across the nuclear envelope (Larder2017Loss).

Additionally, TMEM18 has been shown to interact with the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1). Overexpression of TMEM18 leads to a decrease in YY1 expression, which may influence the transcription of other genes such as C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) (Jurvansuu2011Obesity).
