# PARPBP

## Overview
PARPBP, or Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase 1 Binding Protein, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of DNA repair processes. The protein, also referred to as PARP1 binding protein, plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by modulating the activity of key DNA repair pathways, including homologous recombination and base excision repair. As a nuclear protein, PARPBP interacts with several other proteins, such as PARP1 and PCNA, to influence DNA replication and cell cycle progression. Its regulatory functions are particularly significant in the context of cancer, where alterations in PARPBP expression have been linked to tumor progression and resistance to chemotherapy. The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in various cancers, including breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Chen2020PARPBP; Piao2010C12orf48; Yu2019Overexpression).

## Function
PARPBP, also known as PARP1 binding protein, plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells by regulating DNA repair processes. It acts as a negative regulator of homologous recombination (HR), a critical DNA repair mechanism that uses the intact sister chromatid as a template to repair DNA strand breaks during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (Yu2019Overexpression). By interacting with and regulating proteins such as PARP1 and PCNA, PARPBP inhibits HR, preventing cells from resorting to more error-prone repair pathways like translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), which can lead to genomic instability (Yu2019Overexpression).

PARPBP is active in the nucleus, where it is involved in DNA replication and cell cycle progression, contributing to cellular homeostasis (Shrestha2022ETV2). It interacts with PARP1 to enhance its activity, which is crucial for the base excision repair pathway, a key component of the DNA damage response (Piao2010C12orf48). This interaction helps facilitate DNA repair and maintain genomic integrity, ensuring proper cell function and survival (Piao2010C12orf48).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PARPBP gene, also known as PARP1 binding protein, have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, PARPBP is significantly upregulated, correlating with poor overall survival and resistance to anthracycline-based chemotherapy. High PARPBP expression is associated with advanced tumor stages and lymph node involvement, suggesting its role in tumor progression and chemoresistance (Chen2020PARPBP; Chen2020PARPBPa).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PARPBP is also upregulated, linked to poor prognosis, tumor progression, and advanced disease characteristics such as vascular invasion and poor differentiation. It serves as an independent predictor of unfavorable overall and recurrence-free survival (Yu2019Overexpression).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), overexpression of PARPBP enhances PARP-1 activity, crucial for DNA repair, and contributes to chemoresistance. Knockdown of PARPBP in PDAC cells reduces growth and increases sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (Piao2010C12orf48).

These findings suggest that PARPBP overexpression contributes to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in these cancers.

## Interactions
PARPBP, also known as PARP1 binding protein, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of DNA repair and replication processes. It directly interacts with Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase-1 (PARP-1), enhancing its poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity, which is crucial for DNA repair. This interaction is significant in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, where PARPBP is overexpressed and contributes to the protection of these cells from DNA damage (Piao2010C12orf48).

PARPBP also interacts with other proteins involved in DNA replication and repair, such as Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) and RAD51. These interactions suggest a role for PARPBP in inhibiting homologous recombination, a critical DNA repair mechanism, by interacting with RAD51 at replication forks (Michels2013Predictive; Yu2019Overexpression). In breast cancer, PARPBP's expression is regulated by the transcription factor FOXM1, which binds directly to the PARPBP promoter, influencing its role in chemotherapy resistance (Chen2020PARPBP). These interactions highlight PARPBP's involvement in cellular responses to DNA damage and its potential impact on cancer cell survival and treatment resistance.
