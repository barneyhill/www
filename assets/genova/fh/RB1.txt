# RB1

## Overview
The RB1 gene is a critical component of the human genome, encoding the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), a pivotal tumor suppressor involved in regulating the cell cycle. As a transcriptional corepressor, pRb plays a fundamental role in controlling cell proliferation by inhibiting the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle through its interaction with E2F transcription factors (Chinnam2011RB1). The protein's structure, characterized by distinct domains including the central pocket domain, facilitates its function in binding to various cellular and viral proteins, thereby influencing numerous cellular processes such as DNA replication, repair, and chromatin organization (Dick2013Molecular; Goodrich2003How). Mutations in the RB1 gene are primarily associated with retinoblastoma, a childhood cancer, and have broader implications in other malignancies, underscoring its significance in cancer biology and genomic stability (Lohmann1999RB1; Di2013RB1).

## Structure
The RB1 gene encodes the retinoblastoma protein (pRB), which is composed of 928 amino acids and is structured into several key domains. The primary structure of pRB includes three main domains: the N-terminal domain, the central pocket domain, and the C-terminal domain (Dick2013Molecular; Goodrich2003How). The pocket domain is crucial for its tumor suppressor function and is divided into two subdomains, A and B, which form a cyclin box fold motif essential for protein-protein interactions (Chinnam2011RB1; Goodrich2003How). This domain is involved in binding to viral oncoproteins and cellular proteins containing an LXCXE motif (Goodrich2003How).

The secondary structure of pRB includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its three-dimensional conformation. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a stable configuration, which is critical for its function as a scaffold for multiple protein interactions (Dick2013Molecular). The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, although the entire protein has not been crystallized, suggesting potential variability in its structural configurations (Goodrich2003How).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating pRB's activity. Phosphorylation occurs at up to 16 different sites and is associated with decreased functional activity and interaction with binding partners (Goodrich2003How). These modifications are crucial for its role in cell cycle regulation, as they influence the protein's ability to arrest the cell cycle in the G1 phase or regulate progression through the S phase (Goodrich2003How).

## Function
The RB1 gene encodes the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), which plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly by controlling the transition from the G1 to the S phase. pRb functions as a negative regulator of cell proliferation by interacting with E2F transcription factors, thereby inhibiting the transcription of genes necessary for S phase entry (Chinnam2011RB1). This regulation is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing uncontrolled cell growth, which can lead to cancer (Chinnam2011RB1).

Beyond its role in cell cycle control, pRb is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and mitosis. It interacts with chromatin-modifying factors to influence chromatin structure and gene expression, acting as an adaptor that links DNA-binding proteins with other proteins affecting chromatin and DNA (Chinnam2011RB1). pRb also plays a role in maintaining genomic stability by organizing chromosome structure during mitosis and interacting with the condensin II complex, which is crucial for proper chromosome condensation and segregation (Chinnam2011RB1).

In addition to its cell cycle and genomic stability functions, pRb is involved in cellular differentiation and senescence. It interacts with tissue-specific transcription factors to promote differentiation in various tissues and helps organize chromatin into senescence-associated heterochromatin foci, contributing to the stability of the non-proliferative state (Chinnam2011RB1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the RB1 gene are primarily associated with retinoblastoma, a childhood eye tumor. Retinoblastoma development requires mutations in both alleles of the RB1 gene, which can be inherited or occur de novo in sporadic cases (Lohmann1999RB1). These mutations often include small base substitutions and deletions, leading to loss of heterozygosity and other chromosomal alterations (Zhang2008Patterns; AyariJeridi2015Mutation).

Beyond retinoblastoma, RB1 mutations are linked to an increased risk of second primary neoplasms, such as bone and soft tissue sarcomas, malignant melanoma, and brain neoplasms (Lohmann1999RB1). In genetically engineered mouse models, RB1 inactivation has been shown to progress from epithelial proliferation to carcinoma, indicating its role in various cancer stages (Di2013RB1).

RB1 gene alterations are also implicated in aggressive adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs), where they are associated with poor outcomes and loss of pRb expression (Ragazzon2014Massarray). The RB1 gene's role in maintaining genomic stability is crucial, and its inactivation can lead to unchecked cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Di2013RB1).

## Interactions
The RB1 protein, also known as the retinoblastoma protein, is a crucial regulator of cell cycle progression and interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids. One of its primary interactions is with the E2F family of transcription factors, particularly E2F1. RB1 binds to E2F1, inhibiting its transcriptional activity and thereby controlling the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle (e2013Comparative). This interaction is mediated through the formation of hydrogen bonds involving specific residues such as Glu864, Ser567, Asp36, and Arg861 (e2013Comparative).

RB1 also plays a role in DNA repair processes. It cooperates with E2F1 at DNA double-strand breaks to enhance DNA end-resection and homologous recombination repair, indicating its involvement in genome maintenance beyond its traditional role in transcription regulation (Manickavinayaham2020The). In the context of cancer, particularly castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the loss of RB1 leads to a reprogramming of E2F1 binding sites, expanding its cistrome and altering gene expression profiles. This reprogramming is associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes and distinct transcriptional networks (McNair2017Differential). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of RB1 in cellular processes and its significance in cancer biology.
