# VPS50

## Overview
VPS50 is a gene that encodes a protein known as the VPS50 subunit of the endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) and Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complexes. This protein is integral to intracellular transport processes, particularly in the recycling of transferrin receptors and the acidification of synaptic and dense-core vesicles. As a component of the EARP complex, VPS50 is involved in the regulation of synaptic activity and neurotransmitter filling, playing a crucial role in maintaining synaptic transmission integrity (AhumadaMarchant2024Deletion; Paquin2016The). The protein's interactions with other components of the V-ATPase complex underscore its importance in vesicle acidification, a process vital for normal neuronal function (Shi2019The). Mutations in the VPS50 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and neural tube defects, highlighting its clinical significance (AhumadaMarchant2024Deletion; Shi2019The).

## Function
The VPS50 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) complex and the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex. In healthy human cells, VPS50 plays a significant role in the regulation of synaptic and dense-core vesicle acidification, which is essential for neurotransmitter filling and synaptic activity (AhumadaMarchant2024Deletion; Paquin2016The). VPS50 is involved in the assembly or sorting of the V-ATPase complex, a key player in acidifying cellular compartments, particularly in neurons (Paquin2016The). This protein is active in the endosomal and Golgi compartments, contributing to intracellular transport pathways by facilitating the recycling of internalized transferrin receptors to the cell surface and the maturation of dense-core vesicles (Shi2019The).

VPS50 is also associated with the cytosolic face of endosomes marked by the small GTPase Rab4, promoting the recycling of transferrin receptors from endosomes to the plasma membrane (Shi2019The). The proper functioning of the EARP complex, which includes VPS50, is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal cellular physiology (Shi2019The). In neurons, VPS50 facilitates the recruitment of the V-ATPase pump to synaptic vesicles, enabling vesicle acidification and modulating vesicle content, which is crucial for maintaining synaptic transmission integrity (AhumadaMarchant2024Deletion).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the VPS50 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. In humans, mutations in VPS50 are associated with severe developmental delays, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) (AhumadaMarchant2024Deletion). A specific deletion involving the human homolog of VPS50 and another gene, CALCR, has been reported in an autistic patient, suggesting a potential link between VPS50 and ASD-related phenotypes (Paquin2016The). 

Research using mouse models has shown that deletion of VPS50 leads to cognitive impairments, such as deficits in working and spatial memory, which are phenotypes also observed in ASD patients (AhumadaMarchant2024Deletion). These findings suggest that mutations in the VPS50 gene can impair synaptic vesicle acidification and synaptic transmission, contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD (AhumadaMarchant2024Deletion).

Additionally, a rare missense mutation in VPS50, p. Gly169Val, has been associated with human neural tube defects (NTDs). This mutation disrupts the normal function of VPS50, affecting protein interactions and cellular processes, and has been identified in individuals with NTDs (Shi2019The). These studies highlight the clinical significance of VPS50 in various neurological conditions.

## Interactions
The VPS50 protein is a component of the endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) complex, which includes VPS51, VPS52, and VPS53. It replaces VPS54 in this complex, differentiating it from the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex (Shi2019The). VPS50 interacts with VPS53, and this interaction is crucial for the function of the EARP complex. A missense mutation in VPS50, p. Gly169Val, has been shown to impair its interaction with VPS53, affecting the recycling of transferrin receptors (Shi2019The).

VPS50 also interacts with VHA-15, a component of the V-ATPase complex, which is essential for acidifying synaptic and dense-core vesicles. This interaction suggests that VPS50 plays a role in the recruitment of the V-ATPase V1 domain to synaptic vesicles, facilitating their acidification (AhumadaMarchant2024Deletion; Paquin2016The). In murine neurons, VPS50's interaction with ATP6V1H, another V-ATPase subunit, is critical for the proper assembly of the V-ATPase complex on synaptic vesicles (AhumadaMarchant2024Deletion). These interactions highlight VPS50's role in vesicle acidification and its potential impact on synaptic function and behavior.
