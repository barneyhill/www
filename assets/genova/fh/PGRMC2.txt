# PGRMC2

## Overview
PGRMC2, or progesterone receptor membrane component 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of steroid hormone signaling. The PGRMC2 protein is categorized as a non-classical progesterone receptor and is characterized by a cytochrome b5-like heme/steroid-binding domain, which facilitates its interaction with steroid hormones such as progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol (Chen2010Cloning; Wendler2013PGRMC2). This protein is integral to maintaining immune homeostasis and structural integrity at the maternal-fetal membrane interface, playing a significant role in regulating inflammation and immune responses (Lintao2024PGRMC2). PGRMC2 is also involved in various signaling pathways through its interactions with other proteins, such as PGRMC1 and G3BP2, influencing cell cycle regulation and protein synthesis (Peluso2014Progesterone; Peluso2019Progesterone). Its expression and function have clinical implications in cancer, reproductive health, and genetic disorders like triple A syndrome (Jühlen2018Triple; Wendler2013PGRMC2).

## Structure
The PGRMC2 protein is characterized by a cytochrome b5-like heme/steroid-binding domain, which is highly conserved and crucial for its function. This domain is involved in binding several steroid hormones, including progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol, suggesting a role in modulating steroid effects in reproduction (Chen2010Cloning; Wendler2013PGRMC2). The protein structure includes an N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a larger cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic domain contains regions for ERK binding, Lck/Abl tyrosine kinase binding, and a putative SH2 target sequence, indicating its involvement in various signaling pathways (Wendler2013PGRMC2).

PGRMC2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as ubiquinylation, which can regulate its function (Wendler2013PGRMC2). The protein exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the longer variant including a 23 amino acid transmembrane domain and the shorter variant having a signal peptide of 18 amino acids (Chen2010Cloning). These structural features suggest that PGRMC2 may interact with distinct proteins and participate in various cellular processes. The protein is conserved across several mammals, indicating its evolutionary significance (Wendler2013PGRMC2).

## Function
PGRMC2 (progesterone receptor membrane component 2) is a non-classical progesterone receptor involved in maintaining immune homeostasis and structural integrity at the maternal-fetal membrane interface. It plays a crucial role in regulating inflammation and immune responses, particularly in chorion trophoblast cells (CTCs) at the chorio-decidual interface (CDi). PGRMC2 acts as an upstream regulator of HLA-G expression, which is essential for modulating inflammation and maintaining the barrier function of CTCs. The absence of PGRMC2 leads to the activation of pathways that degrade the extracellular matrix and disrupt physical barriers, promoting a transition to a mesenchymal phenotype, which compromises fetal membrane integrity and increases immune cell infiltration (Lintao2024PGRMC2).

PGRMC2 is also involved in mediating the effects of progesterone, which is crucial for maintaining the epithelioid phenotype of CTCs and preventing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This function is important for preserving the barrier function of the chorion, protecting against excessive inflammation and premature labor. PGRMC2 is downregulated during the onset of labor, suggesting its role in maintaining pregnancy (Lintao2024PGRMC2).

## Clinical Significance
PGRMC2 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression or interactions. In cancer, PGRMC2 is suggested to act as a tumor suppressor. Its loss is associated with increased metastasis rates in endocervical adenocarcinomas, while higher levels in ovarian cancer cells correlate with reduced migration rates (Wendler2013PGRMC2). In non-small cell lung cancer, PGRMC2 expression is upregulated in erlotinib-resistant cells, and its knockdown enhances sensitivity to the drug, indicating a role in drug resistance (Lin2020Progesterone).

In reproductive health, PGRMC2 is upregulated during preterm and term labor, though its specific function remains unclear (Wendler2013PGRMC2). It is also involved in the regulation of granulosa/luteal cells, where its expression affects cell cycle entry and follicle development (Sueldo2015Progestin).

In triple A syndrome, PGRMC2 is overexpressed in patient fibroblasts, potentially contributing to mitotic defects due to its interaction with the nucleoporin ALADIN (Jühlen2018Triple). This interaction is crucial for proper mitotic spindle assembly, and its disruption may lead to cellular defects observed in the syndrome (Jühlen2018Triple).

## Interactions
PGRMC2 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It primarily localizes to the cytoplasm, where it interacts with Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component 1 (PGRMC1) to regulate cell cycle entry in granulosa cells. This interaction is essential for suppressing inappropriate cell cycle progression and preventing mitotic arrest and apoptosis (Peluso2014Progesterone). PGRMC2 also forms a complex with GTPase Activating Protein Binding Protein 2 (G3BP2), which is involved in maintaining the cytoplasmic localization of the IκBα:NFκB complex, thereby inhibiting NFκB transcriptional activity (Peluso2019Progesterone).

In addition to its interaction with PGRMC1 and G3BP2, PGRMC2 is known to interact with PAQR7 in the cytoplasm, contributing to the suppression of cell cycle entry in human granulosa/luteal cells (Sueldo2015Progestin). PGRMC2 also associates with ribosomal proteins and translation initiation and elongation factors, suggesting a role in organizing ribosomal complexes that influence mRNA translation (Peluso2022Progesterone). These interactions highlight PGRMC2's involvement in regulating cell cycle entry and protein synthesis through its interactions with other proteins and complexes.
