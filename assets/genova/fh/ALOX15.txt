# ALOX15

## Overview
The ALOX15 gene encodes the enzyme arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase, a member of the lipoxygenase family of enzymes, which are non-heme iron-containing dioxygenases. This enzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids, converting arachidonic acid into bioactive lipid mediators that play significant roles in inflammation resolution and tissue repair (Snodgrass2019Regulation; Ivanov2015Structural). ALOX15 is expressed in various cell types, including immature red blood cells and macrophages, where its expression can be modulated by cytokines and other factors (Snodgrass2019Regulation; Ivanov2015Structural). The enzyme's activity is characterized by its dual positional specificity and is subject to regulation through interactions with other proteins and genetic variations (Snodgrass2019Regulation; Ivanov2015Structural). Clinically, ALOX15 has been implicated in several diseases, including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Hua2024A; Singh2019Emerging).

## Structure
The ALOX15 protein is composed of a single polypeptide chain with 662 amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately 75 kDa. It contains 11 cysteine residues but lacks disulfide bridges (Ivanov2015Structural). The protein folds into a two-domain structure: a small N-terminal β-barrel domain and a larger catalytic domain. The N-terminal domain consists of 110 amino acids and is composed of 8 β-sheets, similar to the C-terminal β-barrel domains of mammalian lipases, which are involved in membrane binding (Ivanov2015Structural). The catalytic domain, spanning residues 114-663, consists of 21 helices interrupted by a small β-sheet subdomain. This domain includes two long helices that carry four of the five protein iron ligands (Ivanov2015Structural).

The tertiary structure involves a non-heme iron, crucial for its function as a fatty acid dioxygenase. The primary iron ligands include four histidines and the C-terminal Ile, forming a distorted octahedral ligand sphere (Ivanov2015Structural). ALOX15 can form dimers, with dimerization influenced by factors such as protein concentration, ionic strength, pH, and ligand presence (Ivanov2015Structural). The protein's structure is stabilized by non-covalent interactions, allowing specific fatty acid oxygenation despite proteolysis (Ivanov2015Structural).

## Function
The ALOX15 gene encodes the enzyme arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenase-1, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly in the conversion of arachidonic acid to 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE) (Ivanov2015Structural). This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of bioactive lipid mediators, including lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins, which are essential for resolving inflammation and promoting tissue repair (Snodgrass2019Regulation).

ALOX15 is constitutively expressed at high levels in immature red blood cells, eosinophils, and airway epithelial cells, and at lower levels in various other cell types, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes and alveolar macrophages (Ivanov2015Structural). In macrophages, ALOX15 expression is upregulated by Th2 cytokines such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, which enhance its role in anti-inflammatory processes and tissue repair (Snodgrass2019Regulation).

The enzyme's activity is characterized by its dual positional specificity and is influenced by genetic variations, with some mutations leading to catalytically inactive forms (Ivanov2015Structural). ALOX15 is also involved in membrane lipid oxygenation, and its activity can be modulated by membrane binding (Ivanov2015Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ALOX15 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In diabetes, ALOX15 is linked to the regulation of insulin secretion and β-cell apoptosis. Its metabolites, such as 12(S)-HETE, can decrease islet viability and insulin secretion, contributing to diabetic complications like retinopathy and nephropathy (Kuhn2015Mammalian; Singh2019Emerging). In Alzheimer's disease, ALOX15 expression is increased in affected brain regions, influencing amyloid plaque production and synaptic pathology, with potential therapeutic benefits observed upon its disruption (Kuhn2015Mammalian; Singh2019Emerging).

In cancer, ALOX15 expression varies across different types. It is down-regulated in cancers such as breast invasive carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, but up-regulated in esophageal carcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma. These expression changes are associated with immune cell infiltration and patient prognosis, suggesting ALOX15 as a potential biomarker for cancer (Hua2024A). Additionally, a specific SNP in ALOX15, resulting in a threonine to methionine substitution, significantly reduces the enzyme's catalytic activity, potentially influencing the risk of coronary artery disease (Assimes2008A). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in oxidative stress and inflammation-related pathologies.

## Interactions
ALOX15 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in its regulation and function. In human erythroid cells, ALOX15 mRNA translation is regulated by the binding of hnRNP K and hnRNP E1 to the differentiation control element (DICE) in the 3'-UTR of the mRNA. This interaction prevents translation by inhibiting 80S ribosome assembly (Ivanov2015Structural). In the erythroid cell line K562, DEAD-box RNA helicase 6 (DDX6) interacts with hnRNP K/E1 in a DICE-dependent manner, localizing ALOX15 mRNA to P-body-like RNP granules, suggesting a mechanism of translational silencing (Ivanov2015Structural).

In macrophages, ALOX15 forms complexes with phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1), which modulates its substrate specificity and activity. PEBP1 enhances the oxidation of esterified arachidonic acid-phosphatidylethanolamine (AA-PE) by ALOX15, while reducing the availability of free arachidonic acid for oxygenation (Snodgrass2019Regulation).

Additionally, the interaction between hnRNP K and ribosomal protein RPS19 is crucial for the repression of ALOX15 mRNA translation in erythropoiesis. This interaction is enhanced by PRMT1-dependent methylation of hnRNP K, which interferes with 80S ribosome formation (Naarmann-de2021Methylated).
