# TRIM11

## Overview
TRIM11 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 11, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins. This protein is characterized by a RING domain, B-box domains, a coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal PRY-SPRY domain, which collectively contribute to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Niikura2003A; Tuoc2008Trim11). TRIM11 is involved in various cellular processes, including protein homeostasis, by facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of misfolded proteins (Chen2018TRIM11). It also acts as a molecular chaperone, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, by preventing the aggregation of tau proteins (Zhang2023TRIM11). Additionally, TRIM11 plays a role in neurogenesis and cellular signaling pathways, with implications in diseases such as Alzheimer's and cancer, where its expression levels and interactions are altered (Zhang2020TRIM11; Tuoc2008Trim11).

## Structure
TRIM11 is a protein characterized by a tripartite motif (TRIM) that includes several distinct domains: a RING domain, one or two B-box domains, a coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal PRY-SPRY (B30.2) domain (Chen2018TRIM11; Niikura2003A; Tuoc2008Trim11). The RING domain is crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins, which is essential for protein degradation (Chen2018TRIM11; Zhang2020Emerging). The coiled-coil domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and is necessary for the interaction with other proteins such as Humanin (HN) (Niikura2003A). The B30.2 domain plays a role in targeting insoluble proteins for degradation and is involved in interactions with proteasome subunits and ubiquitin (Tuoc2008Trim11).

TRIM11 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which may influence its function and interactions (Zhang2020Emerging). The protein also has several splice variant isoforms, which can affect its functional properties and interactions with other proteins (Niikura2003A). These structural features enable TRIM11 to participate in various cellular processes, including protein quality control and degradation pathways.

## Function
TRIM11 is a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis in healthy human cells. It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of specific substrates, including misfolded and insoluble proteins (Chen2018TRIM11; Tuoc2008Trim11). TRIM11 interacts with the proteasome and the deubiquitinating enzyme USP14, modulating proteasome activity by preventing USP14's association with the proteasome, thereby enhancing proteolytic activity and increasing the degradation rate of proteins (Chen2018TRIM11).

TRIM11 also acts as a molecular chaperone and disaggregase, particularly in the context of tau proteins, preventing their misfolding and aggregation, which are associated with tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (Zhang2023TRIM11). It operates independently of ATP to maintain tau in a soluble form, thus protecting against neurotoxicity (Zhang2023TRIM11).

In the developing cortex, TRIM11 regulates the neurogenic transcription factor Pax6 by promoting its degradation, which is essential for normal neurogenesis and maintaining Pax6 protein levels (Tuoc2008Trim11). TRIM11 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates various cellular processes and stress responses (Tuoc2008Trim11).

## Clinical Significance
TRIM11 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), TRIM11 is down-regulated, which correlates with increased tau aggregation, a hallmark of the disease. TRIM11 interacts with tau proteins, promoting their degradation and reducing tau pathology. Its reduced expression in AD brains suggests a potential protective role against tau aggregation, and alterations in TRIM11 expression could have clinical significance in tauopathies (Zhang2023TRIM11).

In cancer, TRIM11 is associated with tumor progression and chemoresistance. It is overexpressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), where it facilitates drug resistance by activating the β-catenin/ABCC9 axis, contributing to the efflux of chemotherapeutic agents. This upregulation is mediated by m6A modifications, enhancing TRIM11 mRNA stability (Zhang2020TRIM11). In anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), TRIM11 stabilizes YAP, a key component of the Hippo pathway, promoting cell proliferation and chemoresistance (Tang2021SOX13TRIM11YAP). High TRIM11 expression is also linked to poor prognosis in liver hepatocellular carcinoma patients with TP53 mutations (Vu2023Comprehensive). These findings highlight TRIM11's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
TRIM11 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in protein degradation and cellular processes. It binds to the proteasome subunits PSMD1 and PSMD2, with the interaction with PSMD2 being particularly important as it also interacts with the proteasome regulator USP14 (Chen2018TRIM11). TRIM11 inhibits the recruitment of USP14 to the proteasome, thereby enhancing proteasomal activity by preventing USP14's inhibitory effects on the proteasome (Chen2018TRIM11). This interaction is mediated by the RING domain of TRIM11 and the UBL domain of USP14 (Chen2018TRIM11).

TRIM11 also interacts with the neurogenic transcription factor Pax6, promoting its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This interaction requires the B-box and coiled-coil domains of TRIM11 and results in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Pax6 (Tuoc2008Trim11). In the context of cancer, TRIM11 interacts with DUSP6, enhancing its ubiquitination and regulating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which is implicated in tumorigenesis (Wang2021Tripartite). These interactions highlight TRIM11's role in modulating protein stability and cellular signaling pathways.
