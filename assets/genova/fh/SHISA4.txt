# SHISA4

## Overview
SHISA4 is a gene that encodes the protein shisa family member 4, which is part of the Shisa family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by a single transmembrane domain and a cysteine-rich N-terminal domain, which are crucial for their structural integrity and function (Pei2012Unexpected). The SHISA4 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination and degradation, due to its interactions with NEDD4 family proteins facilitated by PY motifs in its C-terminal region (Liu2023Characteristics). Evolutionarily, SHISA4 is closely related to Shisa5, suggesting shared structural and functional characteristics (Pei2012Unexpected). The gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as premature ovarian insufficiency and colorectal cancer, where it plays a role in chemoresistance and signaling pathways (Fekete2023New; Wu2024Transcriptomic). These associations highlight the potential of SHISA4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Structure
The SHISA4 protein is a member of the Shisa family, characterized by a single transmembrane domain and a cysteine-rich N-terminal domain. This domain contains a specific cysteine pattern, 'C*C*CC*C*CC*C', which is crucial for its identification and function (Pei2012Unexpected). The protein also features a proline-rich C-terminal region, which is common among Shisa proteins and is believed to reside in the cytosol (Pei2012Unexpected). 

In zebrafish, the Shisa4 protein is noted for having a proline-rich domain, which is unique among the Shisa family members (Liu2023Characteristics). The presence of PY motifs in the C-terminal region suggests potential interactions with NEDD4 family proteins, indicating a role in ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins (Liu2023Characteristics). 

The evolutionary history of Shisa4 places it in a clade with Shisa5, suggesting a shared evolutionary background and possibly similar structural features (Pei2012Unexpected). While specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of SHISA4 are not provided, the conserved cysteine-rich domain is likely to form disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Pei2012Unexpected).

## Clinical Significance
SHISA4 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its altered expression or involvement in specific pathways. In women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), SHISA4 is one of the top five genes with significant expression changes, suggesting its potential role in the development of this condition. The study highlights the need for further investigation into SHISA4's role in ovarian function and its clinical implications in POI (Wu2024Transcriptomic).

In colorectal cancer, SHISA4 has been associated with resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5FU), a common chemotherapeutic agent. The gene's involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway is linked to 5FU resistance, indicating its potential as a biomarker for predicting tumor response to treatment (Fekete2023New).

SHISA4 is also mentioned in the context of congenital cataracts, where it is identified as a target of miR-1224 in Tdrd7-deficient lenses. This suggests its involvement in the regulatory networks affected by Tdrd7 deficiency, which could contribute to lens defects (Anand2021Genome-Wide).

These findings underscore the importance of SHISA4 in various diseases, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions and as a biomarker for disease prognosis.
