# SIGIRR

## Overview
The SIGIRR gene encodes the single immunoglobulin interleukin-1 receptor-related protein, also known as TIR8, which is a transmembrane protein involved in the negative regulation of immune responses. This protein is characterized by its extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. SIGIRR plays a crucial role in modulating signaling pathways mediated by interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), thereby maintaining immune homeostasis by dampening inflammatory responses. It achieves this by interacting with key signaling components such as MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6, inhibiting the recruitment of these molecules and reducing the activation of downstream signaling pathways like NF-κB and JNK. The protein's regulatory function is essential for preventing hyperactivation of immune responses, which can lead to autoimmune diseases (Gulen2010The; Qin2005SIGIRR).

## Structure
The SIGIRR protein, also known as TIR8, is composed of 410 amino acids and features several distinct domains. It includes an extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, followed by a unique C-terminal tail of 95 amino acids (Qin2005SIGIRR; Riva2012TIR8SIGIRR). The Ig domain is located between amino acids 1-118, while the TIR domain spans amino acids 161-313 (Qin2005SIGIRR). 

The TIR domain is crucial for SIGIRR's function, particularly the BB-loop, which plays a significant role in its inhibitory interactions with TLRs (GuvenMaiorov2015A). SIGIRR is extensively N- and O-glycosylated, with five potential N-glycosylation sites identified in humans (Riva2012TIR8SIGIRR). 

The protein can form heterodimers with TLR4 and interacts with other TIR domain-containing proteins, interfering with the organization of the TIR domain signalosome (GuvenMaiorov2015A). SIGIRR's structure and expression are conserved among vertebrates, with human and mouse SIGIRR proteins being 82% identical (Riva2012TIR8SIGIRR). The regulation of SIGIRR expression is influenced by inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS, which can downregulate its expression (Riva2012TIR8SIGIRR).

## Function
The SIGIRR gene encodes a protein that functions as a negative regulator in the immune system by modulating signaling pathways mediated by the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). In healthy human cells, SIGIRR is involved in dampening inflammatory responses, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis. It achieves this by interacting with components of the IL-1R and TLR4 complexes, such as MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6, in a ligand-dependent manner, which inhibits the recruitment of receptor-proximal signaling components and reduces the activation of downstream signaling molecules like NF-κB and JNK (Qin2005SIGIRR).

The protein contains an extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and an intracellular Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, both crucial for its inhibitory function. The Ig domain interferes with the heterodimerization of IL-1R and IL-1RAcP, while the TIR domain attenuates the recruitment of signaling components, specifically inhibiting LPS signaling (Qin2005SIGIRR). SIGIRR is expressed at high levels in primary kidney and intestinal epithelial cells, contributing to immune tolerance and preventing excessive inflammation (Qin2005SIGIRR). Its regulatory role is essential for preventing hyperactivation of immune responses, which can lead to autoimmune diseases (Gulen2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SIGIRR gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cystic fibrosis, a splice switch in SIGIRR leads to a defect in IL-37-dependent anti-inflammatory activity, contributing to the hyperinflammatory phenotype observed in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells (UenoShuto2022A). In rheumatoid arthritis, SIGIRR expression is significantly reduced in memory CD4 T cells, correlating with increased disease activity and enhanced TNF-α production. This deficiency contributes to increased susceptibility to arthritis by facilitating the IL-1/C/EBPβ/TNF-α signaling axis (Teng2022SIGIRR).

SIGIRR also plays a role in cancer-related inflammation. In colitis-associated cancer, SIGIRR deficiency leads to increased susceptibility to intestinal carcinogenesis, associated with increased permeability and local production of pro-inflammatory mediators (Riva2012TIR8SIGIRR). In the context of bladder epithelial cells, downregulation of SIGIRR following lipopolysaccharide stimulation is associated with an increased inflammatory response, suggesting its role in regulating inflammation in epithelial tissues (Li2015SIGIRR). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SIGIRR in modulating immune responses and its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

## Interactions
SIGIRR, also known as single immunoglobulin interleukin-1 receptor-related protein, participates in several key interactions within the immune signaling pathways. It acts as a negative regulator by interacting with components of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) pathways. SIGIRR interacts with IL-1RI, MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6 upon IL-1 stimulation, forming a complex that inhibits IL-1 signaling by preventing the recruitment of these signaling components (Qin2005SIGIRR). The extracellular Ig domain of SIGIRR is crucial for inhibiting IL-1 signaling by preventing the heterodimerization of IL-1RI and IL-1RAcP, while the intracellular TIR domain is essential for attenuating the recruitment of receptor-proximal signaling components (Qin2005SIGIRR).

SIGIRR also interacts with the TLR4 receptor complex upon LPS stimulation, where it inhibits signaling by reducing the recruitment of MyD88 and IRAK to TLR4 (Qin2005SIGIRR). The TIR domain of SIGIRR is necessary for these interactions, highlighting its role in modulating the innate immune response (Wald2003SIGIRR). SIGIRR's interaction with TRAF6 is specific and involves the regulation of TRAF6 ubiquitination, which affects NF-κB activity and cytokine secretion (Tian2020Negative).
