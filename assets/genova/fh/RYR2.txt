# RYR2

## Overview
The RYR2 gene encodes the ryanodine receptor 2, a critical transmembrane calcium release channel predominantly expressed in cardiac muscle cells. This receptor plays a pivotal role in the process of excitation-contraction coupling by facilitating calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is essential for cardiac muscle contraction. The ryanodine receptor 2 is a homotetrameric protein, meaning it forms a complex of four identical subunits, each contributing to the formation of a functional channel. The structure of the protein includes distinct domains that are crucial for its function, including a large N-terminal domain, a central domain that transduces conformational changes, and a C-terminal transmembrane region that forms the channel pore. The activity of ryanodine receptor 2 is modulated by various factors, including phosphorylation and interactions with proteins such as FKBP12.6 and calmodulin, which influence its open and closed states. Mutations in the RYR2 gene are linked to several cardiac and neurological disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (BauerováHlinková2020Structure; Kobayashi2022Molecular; Starnes2024RYR2).

## Structure
The RYR2 gene encodes the ryanodine receptor 2, a large calcium release channel primarily found in cardiac muscle cells. The protein is a homotetramer, meaning it forms a complex of four identical subunits, each consisting of approximately 5000 amino acids (Kobayashi2022Molecular). The structure includes a large N-terminal domain, a central domain, and a C-terminal transmembrane region. The N-terminal domain is composed of three subdomains: A and B are β-trefoil domains, while subdomain C is an all α-helical domain, with the central helix crucial for stability (BauerováHlinková2020Structure).

The central domain acts as the primary transducer of conformational changes that control the channel's gating, integrating signals from cytoplasmic sensors to the central pore (Peng2016Structural). The transmembrane domain is involved in forming the channel pore, with key interactions in the S4-S5 linker and U-motif regions playing a critical role in channel gating (Kobayashi2022Molecular).

RYR2 undergoes various post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity. The protein's structure is also modulated by interactions with small molecules and associated proteins, including FKBP12.6 and calmodulin, which influence its open and closed states (Chi2019Molecular).

## Function
The RYR2 gene encodes the ryanodine receptor 2, a critical calcium release channel located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiac muscle cells. This receptor plays a vital role in excitation-contraction coupling by mediating calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), which is essential for cardiac muscle contraction. During membrane depolarization, a small influx of calcium through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels triggers the opening of RYR2, leading to a larger release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. This calcium binds to troponin C, facilitating muscle contraction (BauerováHlinková2020Structure; Starnes2024RYR2).

RYR2 is regulated by various factors, including cytosolic calcium concentration, calmodulin, and FKBP12.6, which stabilizes the closed state of the channel. Phosphorylation by protein kinase A can increase the channel's open probability, enhancing its sensitivity to calcium (Fatima2011&lt; In; Fowler2022Molecular; i&gt). Proper functioning of RYR2 is crucial for maintaining normal cardiac rhythm and function, as it ensures effective calcium cycling necessary for muscle contraction and relaxation (Walweel2017Ryanodine; Fowler2022Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RYR2 gene are associated with several cardiac and neurological conditions. One of the primary disorders linked to RYR2 mutations is catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), a condition characterized by stress-induced ventricular arrhythmias that can lead to syncope or sudden cardiac death, particularly during physical exertion or emotional stress (Priori2001Mutations; MedeirosDomingo2009The). RYR2 mutations are also implicated in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 2 (ARVD2), which involves the progressive degeneration of the right ventricle and shares clinical features with CPVT (Fowler2022Molecular).

In addition to cardiac conditions, RYR2 mutations have been associated with neurological disorders such as benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), with or without arrhythmia. This suggests a potential neurocardiac calcium channelopathy, where the same mutation can manifest as either a cardiac or neurological disorder depending on the tissue affected (Yap2019Ryanodine; Ma2021RYR2).

The presence of RYR2 mutations can also increase the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) due to the coexistence of epilepsy and heart disease, highlighting the need for careful monitoring and management of affected individuals (Ma2021RYR2).

## Interactions
The RYR2 gene encodes the ryanodine receptor 2, a crucial calcium release channel in cardiac muscle cells. RYR2 interacts with several proteins that modulate its function, including FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) such as FKBP12 and FKBP12.6. These interactions are significant for cardiac function, with FKBP12.6 being particularly important for stabilizing the closed conformation of the RyR2 channels during diastole. Mutations in the RYR2 gene can affect these interactions, leading to cardiac dysfunction (Zissimopoulos2012Disparate; Tiso2002The).

The association between RyR2 and FKBPs varies across species. In mouse and pig hearts, RyR2 complexes with both FKBP12 and FKBP12.6, while in rat hearts, it predominantly associates with FKBP12.6. In rabbit hearts, RyR2 associates only with FKBP12 (Zissimopoulos2012Disparate). The interaction between RyR2 and FKBP12.6 is sub-stoichiometric, with FKBP12 being the predominant isoform associated with cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum in most mammals (Zissimopoulos2012Disparate).

RYR2 also interacts with connexin 43 (Cx43) in cardiomyocytes, regulating Cx43 hemichannel activity in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction involves the P1 domain of RyR2 and the C-terminal domain of Cx43, mediated by electrostatic interactions (Lissoni2019RyR2).
