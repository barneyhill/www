# CSF1R

## Overview
The CSF1R gene encodes the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, a class III receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of macrophage biology. This receptor is integral to the differentiation, proliferation, and survival of myeloid lineage cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and osteoclasts, through its interaction with ligands such as CSF-1 and IL-34 (Lenzo2011Control; Hume2012Therapeutic). The CSF1R protein is characterized by its complex structure, featuring an extracellular domain with five immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain, which undergoes dimerization and phosphorylation upon ligand binding (Felix2013Human; Stanley2014CSF1). This receptor is crucial for maintaining macrophage homeostasis and is involved in various physiological processes, including tissue repair, immune response modulation, and bone resorption (Hume2012Therapeutic). Mutations in the CSF1R gene are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its importance in neurological health (Konno2018CSF1R; Guo2021From).

## Structure
The CSF1R protein is a class III receptor tyrosine kinase with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming several distinct domains. The extracellular region is composed of five immunoglobulin-like domains (D1-D5), which are crucial for ligand binding and receptor activation (Felix2013Human; Stanley2014CSF1). The D2 and D3 domains form the cytokine binding site, while the D4 domain is involved in receptor dimerization (Felix2013Human; Stanley2014CSF1).

The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, particularly within the kinase domain, which is divided into N and C lobes. The N lobe contains a five-stranded beta sheet and an alpha helix, while the C lobe has seven alpha helices and two beta strands (Stanley2014CSF1).

The tertiary structure of CSF1R features a transmembrane domain and an intracellular kinase domain, which includes a juxtamembrane domain, a kinase insert, and an activation loop (Stanley2014CSF1). The quaternary structure involves dimerization upon ligand binding, facilitated by homotypic interactions between D4 domains (Felix2013Human).

Post-translational modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, play a critical role in receptor activation and signaling (Stanley2014CSF1). The CSF1R gene also has splice variant isoforms, which may influence its function and localization (Stanley2014CSF1).

## Function
The CSF1R gene encodes the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, a critical component in the regulation of macrophage production, differentiation, and function. CSF1R is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, upon binding with its ligands CSF-1 and IL-34, activates signaling pathways essential for the differentiation of myeloid progenitors into monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and osteoclasts (Lenzo2011Control; Hume2012Therapeutic). This receptor is primarily active in the cell membrane of monocytes and macrophages, where it plays a significant role in their proliferation, survival, and migration (Hume2012Therapeutic).

In healthy human cells, CSF1R signaling is crucial for maintaining macrophage homeostasis, influencing their recruitment and polarization towards an M2-like phenotype, which is associated with tissue repair and anti-inflammatory responses (Hume2012Therapeutic). The receptor is also involved in the regulation of proteolytic enzymes, contributing to fibrinolytic activity, and is essential for bone resorption through its expression on osteoclasts (Hume2012Therapeutic). CSF1R's role extends to the regulation of macrophage-mediated processes, including organ regeneration and resolution of inflammatory injury (Alikhan2011ColonyStimulating).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CSF1R gene are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders. Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by monoallelic mutations in CSF1R. This condition is characterized by cognitive decline, motor changes, and cerebral white matter abnormalities, often resembling frontotemporal dementia (Konno2018CSF1R; Guo2021From). The mutations primarily affect the tyrosine kinase domain, leading to impaired CSF1-dependent signaling and microglial dysfunction (Rademakers2011Mutations; Kraya2019Functional).

Bi-allelic mutations in CSF1R result in a more severe condition known as brain abnormalities, neurodegeneration, and dysosteosclerosis (BANDDOS). This autosomal recessive disorder presents with early-onset leukoencephalopathy, brain malformations, and skeletal dysplasia (Chitu2021Modeling; Guo2021From). The phenotypic expression of CSF1R mutations can vary widely, influenced by the type of mutation and other genetic factors (Chitu2021Modeling).

CSF1R mutations also contribute to microglial encephalopathy, characterized by diffuse white matter destruction and axonal loss. These mutations lead to partial loss of CSF1R function, affecting microglial activity and contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Jiang2022Two). The expanding spectrum of disorders associated with CSF1R mutations highlights the gene's critical role in maintaining neurological health (Guo2021From).

## Interactions
The colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that participates in various protein interactions crucial for its signaling functions. Upon binding with its ligand, CSF-1, CSF1R undergoes dimerization and phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues, creating docking sites for cytoplasmic effector proteins. These include proteins with src homology-2 (SH2) motifs such as phospholipase C-γ1 (PLCγ1), GTPase activating protein (GAP), src family kinases (e.g., src, fyn), the sem5/GRB2 adaptor protein, SHC, and the 85 kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (Roussel1994Signal). The phosphorylation of Tyr809 and Tyr561 is essential for the binding and activation of src family kinases, which are critical for CSF-1-induced proliferation (Roussel1994Signal).

CSF1R also interacts with the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2). This interaction involves the transmembrane domains of both proteins and suggests a mutual modulation of their expression. TREM2 is not necessary for CSF1/CSF1R-mediated microglial survival, but their interaction may influence each other's functions, potentially through a complex involving the adaptor protein DAP12 (Cheng2021Triggering). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein interactions that CSF1R engages in to regulate cell survival, proliferation, and function.
