# CPB2

## Overview
Carboxypeptidase B2 (CPB2) is a gene that encodes the enzyme carboxypeptidase B2, also known as thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). This enzyme is a zinc-dependent metallocarboxypeptidase that plays a critical role in the regulation of fibrinolysis and inflammation. CPB2 is activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, which shifts its function from pro-coagulant to anticoagulant, thereby stabilizing fibrin clots and modulating the inflammatory response (d’Alessandro2020ThromboInflammation; Morser2018Carboxypeptidase). The enzyme's activity is characterized by its ability to remove C-terminal lysine residues from fibrin, reducing plasminogen binding and slowing clot degradation. Additionally, CPB2 inactivates pro-inflammatory mediators, contributing to immune homeostasis (Leung2018Carboxypeptidase). Genetic variations in the CPB2 gene can influence the enzyme's stability and activity, impacting conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular diseases (Claesen2021Carboxypeptidase; Leung2018Carboxypeptidase).

## Structure
Carboxypeptidase B2 (CPB2), also known as thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), is a zinc-dependent metallocarboxypeptidase. The primary structure of CPB2 consists of a single polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its compact globular tertiary structure (Leung2018Carboxypeptidase). CPB2 is typically monomeric in its quaternary structure.

The protein contains a catalytic domain and a pro-peptide region, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The catalytic domain involves a central zinc ion that interacts with specific histidine and glutamate residues, similar to other carboxypeptidases (khamsehnejad2018Identification). This zinc ion coordination is essential for the enzyme's function.

CPB2 undergoes common post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may affect its stability and activity (Leung2018Carboxypeptidase). Splice variant isoforms of CPB2 may exist, potentially influencing its activity and stability (Leung2018Carboxypeptidase).

The structure of CPB2 is significant for its role in the inactivation of bioactive peptides and proteins by removing C-terminal basic amino acids, which is important in various physiological processes, including the complement cascade and coagulation (Leung2018Carboxypeptidase).

## Function
Carboxypeptidase B2 (CPB2), also known as thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), is a plasma enzyme that plays a crucial role in maintaining hemostatic balance by regulating fibrinolysis and inflammation. In healthy human cells, CPB2 is activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, which shifts thrombin's activity from pro-coagulant to anticoagulant (d’Alessandro2020ThromboInflammation). Once activated, CPB2 stabilizes fibrin clots by removing C-terminal lysine residues from fibrin, reducing plasminogen binding, and slowing down clot degradation (Morser2018Carboxypeptidase).

CPB2 also exhibits significant anti-inflammatory properties. It inactivates pro-inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin, anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, and thrombin-cleaved osteopontin, thereby modulating the inflammatory response and preventing excessive tissue damage (d’Alessandro2020ThromboInflammation; Leung2018Carboxypeptidase). This regulatory function is essential for controlling complement activation and maintaining immune homeostasis (Morser2018Carboxypeptidase).

The enzyme's activity is characterized by thermal instability, with a half-life of approximately 10 minutes, and is influenced by genetic variations such as a single nucleotide polymorphism at nucleotide 1040, which affects its half-life and is associated with a reduced risk of severe rheumatoid arthritis (Leung2018Carboxypeptidase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CPB2 gene, which encodes carboxypeptidase B2 (CPB2), have significant clinical implications. CPB2 is involved in the regulation of fibrinolysis, and its expression is linked to various thromboembolic and cardiovascular conditions. Elevated CPB2 levels are associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) (Claesen2021Carboxypeptidase). The Thr325Ile polymorphism in the CPB2 gene has been linked to a decreased risk of VTE in European populations, although its association with arterial thrombosis remains inconclusive (Claesen2021Carboxypeptidase; Zwingerman2017Sexspecific).

In inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), CPB2 expression is higher and correlates with lymphovascular invasion, suggesting a role in metastasis. This expression is influenced by interleukin 10 (IL-10) and macrophage infiltration, contributing to the aggressive nature of IBC (Mohamed2018IL10). CPB2 is also implicated in coronary artery disease (CAD), with increased proCPU activity linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular events (Claesen2021Carboxypeptidase). Additionally, CPB2 inhibitors have shown potential therapeutic benefits in conditions like sepsis and thrombosis by enhancing fibrinolysis and improving outcomes without causing excessive bleeding (Leung2018Carboxypeptidase).

## Interactions
Carboxypeptidase B2 (CPB2), also known as thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), interacts with several proteins involved in coagulation and inflammation. CPB2 is activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, which is a key physiological activator. This activation allows CPB2 to modulate fibrinolysis by removing C-terminal lysine residues from fibrin, thereby reducing plasminogen binding and plasmin generation (Leung2018Carboxypeptidase; Morser2018Carboxypeptidase).

CPB2 also interacts with components of the complement system, particularly C3a and C5a, which are potent inflammatory mediators. CPB2 inactivates these anaphylatoxins by cleaving their C-terminal arginine residues, thus reducing their activity and limiting neutrophil activation and infiltration (Leung2018Carboxypeptidase; Morser2018Carboxypeptidase). This interaction plays a significant role in modulating inflammatory responses in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (Song2011Plasma; Morser2018Carboxypeptidase).

In the context of COVID-19, recombinant CPB, a stable homolog of CPB2, has been shown to degrade C3a and C5a, reducing neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and protecting vascular endothelial cells from damage (Zhang2021Carboxypeptidase). This suggests a potential therapeutic role for CPB2 in mitigating inflammation and disease severity in COVID-19 patients.
