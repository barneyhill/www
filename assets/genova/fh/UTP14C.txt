# UTP14C

## Overview
UTP14C is a gene that encodes the UTP14C small subunit processome component, a protein integral to ribosome biogenesis. This protein is a part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, a complex involved in the early stages of ribosomal RNA processing and assembly. UTP14C interacts with various proteins and RNA molecules, playing a crucial role in the maturation of the 18S rRNA, a component of the small ribosomal subunit. Notably, UTP14C forms a complex with the RNA helicase Dhr1, facilitating the unwinding of U3 snoRNA from the preribosome, a critical step in ribosome assembly (Zhu2016Utp14). The gene's mutations have been associated with male infertility and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhao2017Exome; Sondalle2014Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UTP14C gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, primarily affecting male fertility. A specific mutation, Y738X, in the UTP14C gene results in a truncated protein product and has been associated with male infertility in three unrelated Caucasian patients. This mutation is thought to exert a dominant negative effect, similar to a mutation in the mouse Utp14b gene that causes infertility in the juvenile spermatogonial depletion (jsd) mouse model (Sondalle2014Human). 

UTP14C has also been implicated in nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA), a condition of male infertility. Studies have identified recessive variants of UTP14C in individuals with idiopathic NOA, which were absent in fertile controls, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of this condition (Fakhro2018Pointofcare). 

Additionally, UTP14C may play a role in neurodevelopmental disorders. De novo variants in UTP14C have been identified in patients with intellectual disability and other neurodevelopmental disorders, with high pathogenicity scores indicating potential involvement in these conditions (Zhao2017Exome). 

The expression of UTP14C in the ovary might also influence cancer risk, as it could lead to decreased levels of p53, potentially predisposing individuals to ovarian cancer (Sondalle2014Human).

## Interactions
UTP14C is a component of the small subunit (SSU) processome and plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis through its interactions with various proteins and RNA molecules. UTP14C interacts with the RNA helicase Dhr1, forming a 1:1 complex that is essential for the unwinding of U3 snoRNA from the preribosome, a critical step in ribosome assembly (Zhu2016Utp14). This interaction stimulates Dhr1's helicase activity without affecting its ATPase activity, distinguishing UTP14C from typical G-patch proteins (Zhu2016Utp14). 

UTP14C also interacts with other proteins such as Bud23, which is necessary for the stable association of Dhr1 with the preribosome. Mutations in UTP14C can suppress defects caused by the absence of Bud23, indicating a cooperative role in ribosome assembly (Zhu2016Utp14). Within the SSU processome, UTP14C binds to multiple RNA elements, including U3 snoRNA and snR30, with primary binding sites at helix 26 and helix 45/D-site (Black2018Utp14). The N-terminal portion of UTP14C interacts with proteins Utp22 and Rps1, while the C-terminal portion interacts with Pno1, highlighting the importance of specific regions of UTP14C in mediating its interactions within the SSU processome (Black2018Utp14).
