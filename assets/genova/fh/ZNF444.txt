# ZNF444

## Overview
ZNF444 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 444, a member of the SCAN family of zinc finger transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. The SCAN domain within ZNF444 is essential for its ability to form dimers and interact with other proteins, which is vital for its function as a transcription factor (Collins2005The). Zinc finger protein 444 is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, development, and differentiation, particularly in endothelial cells and osteoblastic differentiation (Vaquerizas2009A; Johnson2015Genetic). The protein's involvement in epigenetic regulation and its interactions with other molecular entities underscore its significance in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions (Ware2023Integrated; Moody2020Epigenetic).

## Structure
ZNF444, also known as EZF-2, is a member of the SCAN family of zinc finger transcription factors. It contains four zinc finger domains, which are typically involved in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (Collins2005The). The SCAN domain, a conserved protein interaction motif, is present in ZNF444 and is known for mediating self-association or selective association with other proteins (Collins2005The). This domain is crucial for the protein's ability to form dimers, which is a key aspect of its quaternary structure (Collins2005The).

The SCAN domain in ZNF444 may also include a novel N-terminal motif that fits the consensus for a SUMO acceptor site, suggesting potential post-translational modification through SUMOylation. This modification can influence the protein's stability, interactions, and localization (Collins2005The). While specific details on the secondary and tertiary structures of ZNF444 are not provided, the presence of zinc finger motifs suggests a modular structure that facilitates its function as a transcription factor. The protein's role in targeting the scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells indicates its involvement in specific gene regulation pathways (Collins2005The).

## Function
ZNF444, or zinc finger protein 444, is a transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression through its zinc finger domains, which bind to specific DNA sequences. This protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including development, differentiation, and cellular response to external stimuli. In healthy human cells, ZNF444 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates the expression of genes critical for maintaining normal cellular functions (Vaquerizas2009A).

ZNF444 is a member of the SCAN domain-containing zinc finger transcription factors, which are involved in transcriptional regulation. It specifically targets the scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells, suggesting a role in regulating genes associated with endothelial cell function (Collins2005The). The protein is also involved in the degradation of acetylated low-density lipoprotein, promoting osteoblastic differentiation, which is crucial for bone integrity (Johnson2015Genetic).

In the context of epigenetic regulation, ZNF444 has been identified as hypomethylated in the promoter region within 200 base pairs of the transcription start site, indicating its potential role in transcriptional regulation (Moody2020Epigenetic). This hypomethylation suggests that ZNF444 may be actively involved in gene expression regulation in healthy cells.

## Interactions
ZNF444, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions that influence its function as a transcription factor. It has been identified as a transcription activator that interacts with the promoter region of the C19MC miRNA cluster in bladder cancer, suggesting a role in enhancer-mediated regulation (Ware2023Integrated). ZNF444 is also noted for its involvement in gene fusions, such as the EWSR1-ZNF444 fusion found in thoracic myoepithelial tumors, which may contribute to the aggressive behavior of these tumors (Leduc2016Thoracic).

In the context of puberty regulation in goats, ZNF444 is a target of the long noncoding RNA XLOC_910648, indicating a potential regulatory role in the onset of puberty (Gao2017Screening). Additionally, ZNF444 has been associated with the transcriptional regulation of a scavenger receptor gene involved in lipid metabolism, which is relevant to its function in multiple myeloma bone disease (Johnson2015Genetic). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of ZNF444 in transcriptional regulation and its potential impact on various biological processes.
