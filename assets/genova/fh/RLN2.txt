# RLN2

## Overview
The RLN2 gene encodes the peptide hormone relaxin 2, which is a member of the relaxin family of proteins and is structurally related to insulin. Relaxin 2 is primarily recognized for its role in reproductive biology, particularly in facilitating childbirth by promoting the relaxation of pelvic ligaments and the cervix. Beyond its reproductive functions, relaxin 2 is involved in various physiological processes, including cardiovascular and renal health, by promoting vasodilation and increasing renal blood flow. The hormone exerts its effects through interaction with the relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which activates signaling pathways that influence cell viability, proliferation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. These interactions underscore relaxin 2's potential therapeutic applications in conditions such as fibrosis and cancer, where it modulates connective tissue metabolism and cellular responses (Thanasupawat2019Emerging; Ivell2017Relaxin‐like; Bathgate2013Relaxin).

## Structure
The RLN2 gene encodes the relaxin-2 peptide hormone, which is structurally related to insulin. The primary structure of relaxin-2 consists of two peptide chains, A and B, linked by three disulfide bonds. The B-chain contains a conserved RxxRxxI/V motif crucial for receptor binding, with arginine residues forming the receptor binding site (Bathgate2013Relaxin). The secondary structure includes an α-helix in the B-chain, which is one helix turn longer than that of human relaxin-3, causing the tryptophan at position 27 to be solvent-exposed (Bathgate2013Relaxin). 

The tertiary structure of relaxin-2 forms an insulin-like fold, characterized by the arrangement of the A and B chains and the presence of disulfide bonds (Bathgate2013Relaxin). The quaternary structure is a heterodimeric peptide, with two disulfide bonds between the A- and B-chains and an additional intra-A-chain bond (Bathgate2013Relaxin). 

Post-translational modifications include the cleavage of a signal peptide and the formation of disulfide bonds, which are essential for its biological activity (Alieva2023Relaxin). The mature peptide is formed by removing the signal peptide and C-peptide, resulting in the active hormone (Bathgate2013Relaxin).

## Function
Relaxin 2 (RLN2) is a peptide hormone that plays a significant role in various physiological processes, particularly in reproductive biology. It is primarily involved in facilitating childbirth by relaxing the pelvic ligaments and cervix. RLN2 exerts its effects through the relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1), which is characterized by large extracellular domains and primarily signals through the Gs protein to activate adenylyl cyclase (Ivell2017Relaxin‐like).

In healthy human cells, RLN2 influences cell viability, proliferation, adhesion, and migration. It enhances cell survival by increasing the BCL2/BAX mRNA expression ratio, a marker for cell survival, and affects the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP-9, which are involved in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix (Domińska2016A). RLN2 also modulates the expression of NF-κB family members, which are involved in various cellular processes, including inflammation and carcinogenesis (Domińska2017Regulation).

RLN2 is active in tissues such as the uterus, heart, and kidneys, where it promotes vasodilation and increases renal blood flow, contributing to cardiovascular and renal health. Its activity in these tissues underscores its importance in maintaining physiological homeostasis (Ivell2017Relaxin‐like).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RLN2 gene, which encodes the hormone relaxin, have been implicated in various cancers. In prostate cancer, RLN2 expression is significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and this overexpression is associated with aggressive disease characteristics, such as increased tumor growth, cell proliferation, and invasiveness. Targeting RLN2 signaling has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy, as its suppression can reduce these cancer cell characteristics and increase apoptosis (Feng2007Relaxin).

In ovarian cancer, RLN2 is identified as a transcriptional target of inflammatory cytokines, contributing to tumor progression and chemoresistance. The relaxin/RXFP1 signaling loop is essential for ovarian cancer cell survival and is activated by cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-α, creating a feedback loop that promotes a tumor-supportive microenvironment. Inhibition of this signaling pathway has been shown to increase the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to chemotherapy, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Burston2021Inhibition).

Overall, the RLN2 gene plays a significant role in cancer progression and resistance to therapy, making it a potential target for cancer treatment (Thanasupawat2019Emerging).

## Interactions
Relaxin 2 (RLN2) primarily interacts with its receptor, RXFP1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates its effects through various signaling pathways. The interaction involves high-affinity binding between the relaxin B-chain and the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of RXFP1, as well as lower affinity interactions with the transmembrane exoloops (Bathgate2018The; Bathgate2013Relaxin). The LDLa module of RXFP1 is crucial for receptor activation, acting as a tethered agonist necessary for signaling, although it does not influence peptide hormone binding (Bathgate2018The).

RLN2 also interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor and the human C1q-tumor necrosis factor-related protein 8 (CTRP8), although the physiological significance of these interactions is not fully understood (Bathgate2018The). In addition, RLN2 can modulate signaling pathways involving nitric oxide (NO), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, which contribute to its antifibrotic effects (Valkovic2019Understanding; Bathgate2013Relaxin). These interactions highlight RLN2's role in connective tissue metabolism and its potential therapeutic applications in conditions like fibrosis and cancer (Thanasupawat2019Emerging; Bathgate2013Relaxin).
