# ISG15

## Overview
ISG15 is a gene that encodes the ISG15 ubiquitin-like modifier, a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in immune responses. The ISG15 protein is categorized as a ubiquitin-like protein, which means it shares structural and functional similarities with ubiquitin, a small regulatory protein found in most tissues. ISG15 is primarily known for its role in the ISGylation process, a post-translational modification similar to ubiquitination, where ISG15 is conjugated to target proteins, influencing their stability and function. This modification is crucial in antiviral defense mechanisms, as ISG15 is strongly induced by type I interferons and viral infections, thereby impairing viral replication and modulating immune signaling pathways (Kim2003ISG15; Jeon2010ISG15). Additionally, ISG15 interacts with various cellular and viral proteins, highlighting its significance in both innate immunity and potential clinical implications, such as susceptibility to infections and cancer (Kang2022The; Langley2019Structure).

## Structure
ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier protein composed of two ubiquitin-like (UbL) domains connected by a flexible linker. The N-terminal and C-terminal domains of ISG15 share approximately 33% and 32% similarity with ubiquitin, respectively (Chang2008Different). The C-terminal domain contains a classical conjugating motif, LRLRGG, which is essential for its function in forming thioester bonds with the activating enzyme UBE1L and the conjugating enzyme UbcH8 (Chang2008Different). This domain is crucial for binding to USP18, interacting extensively with its palm and thumb domains (Basters2017Structural).

The N-terminal domain, while not essential for the initial activation steps, plays a significant role in the ligation process, enhancing the E3-mediated transfer of ISG15 to substrates (Chang2008Different). The Influenza B virus NS1 protein can bind specifically to the N-terminal domain, inhibiting ISG15 conjugation by competing with E3 ligases (Chang2008Different).

ISG15 undergoes post-translational modification through a process called ISGylation, which is similar to ubiquitination. This involves the conjugation of ISG15 to a wide array of cellular proteins, playing roles in antiviral responses and other cellular processes (Chang2008Different).

## Function
ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like protein that plays a significant role in immune responses and cellular processes in human cells. It is synthesized in various cell types and can be secreted from human monocytes and lymphocytes, acting as a cytokine to modulate immune responses by inducing the synthesis and secretion of IFNγ from lymphocytes (Jeon2010ISG15). ISG15 is involved in the ISGylation process, where it is conjugated to target proteins, affecting various cellular pathways. This process is facilitated by a cascade of enzymes, including UBE1L, UbcH8, and E3 ligases such as EFP and HERC5 (Jeon2010ISG15).

ISG15 is strongly induced by type I interferons and viral infections, playing a crucial role in antiviral defense by impairing viral replication (Jeon2010ISG15). It interacts with key proteins in IFN signaling, such as JAK1 and STAT1, suggesting its involvement in innate immune responses (Jeon2010ISG15). ISG15 also modulates the type I interferon/JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is important for host defense and cellular homeostasis (Kim2003ISG15). Despite its significant role in immune regulation, the specific biological significance of ISGylation in healthy human cells remains largely unknown (Jeon2010ISG15).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ISG15 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. ISG15 deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder, leads to increased susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases, known as Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD). This condition is characterized by impaired IFN-γ immunity, which is crucial for defense against mycobacterial infections (Perng2018ISG15; Bogunovic2012Mycobacterial). Patients with ISG15 deficiency may also exhibit symptoms similar to Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, including seizures and intracranial calcifications, due to elevated type I interferon levels (Perng2018ISG15).

ISG15 is also implicated in cancer, where its expression is often altered. It is upregulated in various cancers, including melanoma, lung, breast, prostate, and hepatocellular cancers, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis and the tumor microenvironment (Kang2022The). In breast cancer, ISG15 is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and radiation, as part of the IFN-related DNA damage resistance signature (IRDS) (Kang2022The). Conversely, in certain cancers like high-grade serous ovarian cancer, ISG15 upregulation is linked to improved survival by increasing tumor-infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes (Kang2022The).

## Interactions
ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein, engages in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in immune responses. It can conjugate to substrate proteins through a process called ISGylation, mediated by enzymes such as UBE1L, UBCH8, and HERC5, affecting the stability and function of these proteins (Thery2021Ring). ISG15 interacts noncovalently with USP18, a deconjugating protease, which is a negative regulator of type I interferon signaling. This interaction involves the C-terminal Ubl domain of ISG15, which is necessary for binding to USP18, inducing conformational changes in USP18 that are crucial for its catalytic activity (Basters2017Structural).

ISG15 also interacts with viral proteins, such as the SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PL pro), which engages with both domains of ISG15. This interaction is enthalpically favored and crucial for ISG15's engagement with viral proteins (Langley2019Structure). Additionally, ISG15 interacts with RNF213, a sensor for ISGylated proteins, which oligomerizes on lipid droplets to form a binding platform for ISG15 and other ISGylated proteins (Thery2021Ring). These interactions highlight ISG15's role in modulating antiviral responses and its involvement in various cellular pathways.
