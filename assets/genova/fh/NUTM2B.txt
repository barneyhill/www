# NUTM2B

## Overview
NUTM2B is a gene that encodes the protein NUT family member 2B, which is involved in various cellular processes. The NUTM2B gene is notable for its role in the formation of fusion genes, particularly in certain types of sarcomas. The protein encoded by NUTM2B is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but it plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of specific cancers through its involvement in fusion events. These fusion genes, such as YWHAE-NUTM2B, are implicated in the development and progression of soft tissue undifferentiated round cell sarcoma and clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, where they contribute to distinct histological and clinical features (Karlsson2015BCOR; Kao2016Recurrent). The presence of these fusions is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis, underscoring the importance of NUTM2B in cancer biology (He2022Case).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
NUTM2B is implicated in various sarcomas through its involvement in fusion genes, particularly the YWHAE-NUTM2B fusion. This genetic alteration is observed in soft tissue undifferentiated round cell sarcoma (URCS) of infancy and clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK). In URCS, the YWHAE-NUTM2B fusion is a rare event, identified in a small percentage of cases, and is associated with specific histological features such as a branching vascular network (Kao2016Recurrent). In CCSK, the YWHAE-NUTM2B fusion is mutually exclusive with BCOR internal tandem duplications, suggesting distinct subtypes within this tumor type (Karlsson2015BCOR). 

The presence of the YWHAE-NUTM2B fusion in these sarcomas is linked to aggressive clinical behavior and poor prognosis, as seen in a case of a 14-year-old girl with a pelvic soft tissue sarcoma characterized by this fusion (He2022Case). The fusion is also associated with higher tumor cellularity and advanced disease stages (He2022Case). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NUTM2B in the pathogenesis and progression of certain pediatric and adolescent sarcomas.
