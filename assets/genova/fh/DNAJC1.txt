# DNAJC1

## Overview
DNAJC1 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C1, which functions as a molecular chaperone. This protein is integral to the cellular machinery responsible for protein folding and stabilization, primarily operating within the endoplasmic reticulum. As a member of the Hsp40 family, it collaborates with Hsp70 proteins to ensure the proper folding of nascent polypeptides and to prevent protein aggregation, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular function (Deo2023Identification). The gene's expression and regulation have significant implications in various diseases, including cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and prognosis (Zhang2024DNAJC1). Additionally, DNAJC1 has been studied in the context of genetic disorders, such as syndromic congenital microphthalmia in canine models, highlighting its potential relevance to human health (Murgiano2024A).

## Function
DNAJC1, a member of the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40), functions as a molecular chaperone involved in protein folding and stabilization. It plays a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis by assisting in the proper folding of nascent polypeptides and preventing protein aggregation. DNAJC1 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is involved in regulating protein secretion and cellular stress responses (Deo2023Identification). 

In healthy human cells, DNAJC1 contributes to the quality control of proteins by working in conjunction with Hsp70 to solubilize protein aggregates and facilitate their proper folding. This activity is essential for maintaining cellular function and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which can lead to cellular stress and disease (Deo2023Identification). 

The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and stress response mechanisms. By ensuring the correct folding and maturation of proteins, DNAJC1 helps maintain the integrity of cellular functions and supports the organism's overall health. Its role in the endoplasmic reticulum highlights its significance in the secretory pathway and protein quality control systems (Deo2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DNAJC1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), DNAJC1 is significantly upregulated, correlating with tumor progression and poor prognosis. High DNAJC1 expression is associated with reduced overall survival and increased macrophage infiltration, contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This makes DNAJC1 a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in GBM (Zhang2024DNAJC1).

In breast cancer, DNAJC1 exhibits copy number variations (CNVs), specifically amplification CNVs, which are associated with certain molecular subtypes, such as the Basal subtype. These CNVs correlate with altered mRNA expression levels, suggesting a role in breast cancer progression and subtype differentiation (Zoppino2018Comprehensive; FernandezMuñoz2024Mutational).

In a naturally occurring canine model, a mutation in the DNAJC1 gene is linked to syndromic congenital microphthalmia, characterized by eye malformations and hematopoietic defects. This model suggests potential parallels in human conditions, although direct associations with human diseases are not explicitly detailed (Murgiano2024A).
