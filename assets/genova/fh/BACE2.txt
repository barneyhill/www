# BACE2

## Overview
BACE2 (Beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 2) is a gene that encodes the protein beta-secretase 2, an aspartic protease involved in the non-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Unlike its homolog BACE1, which contributes to the formation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides implicated in Alzheimer's disease, BACE2 cleaves APP within the Aβ domain, thereby reducing the production of amyloidogenic peptides and potentially offering a protective role against Aβ accumulation (Fluhrer2002A; Sun2005Distinct). The BACE2 protein is characterized as a type 1 integral membrane protein with a transmembrane domain, and it is predominantly active in acidic cellular compartments such as lysosomes (AbdulHay2012Identification; Chou2004Insights). BACE2 is expressed in various cell types, including neurons and astrocytes, and is involved in diverse biological processes, such as the modulation of amyloidogenic pathways and cellular signaling (Voytyuk2018BACE2). The gene's location on chromosome 21 also implicates it in conditions like Down syndrome, where its overexpression may influence amyloid processing (Fluhrer2002A; Yeap2023BACE2:).

## Structure
The BACE2 protein is composed of 518 amino acids and functions as an aspartic protease. Its primary structure includes a signal peptide at residues 1-20, two aspartic protease motifs at residues 107-118 and 300-311, and two N-glycosylation sites at residues 170 and 366 (Solans2000A). The secondary structure features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its bilobal tertiary structure, which is characteristic of aspartic proteases (Chou2004Insights). The tertiary structure also includes a transmembrane region at residues 474-494 and a cytoplasmic domain at residues 495-518 (Chou2004Insights).

BACE2 contains specific domains such as the peptidase A1 domain and is predicted to be a type 1 integral membrane protein due to its transmembrane segment and cysteine residues capable of forming disulfide bonds (Solans2000A). Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which is common in aspartic proteases (Solans2000A). BACE2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different transcript variants that contribute to its functional diversity (Solans2000A). The protein's quaternary structure may involve homodimer formation, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
BACE2 (beta-secretase 2) is an aspartic protease enzyme that plays a significant role in the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in healthy human cells. Unlike its homolog BACE1, which is involved in the amyloidogenic pathway leading to amyloid-beta (Aβ) production, BACE2 cleaves APP within the Aβ domain, specifically between Phe19 and Phe20, promoting a non-amyloidogenic pathway. This cleavage results in the production of p3 peptides and reduces the generation of amyloidogenic Aβ species, suggesting a protective role against Aβ accumulation (Fluhrer2002A; Sun2005Distinct).

BACE2 is highly efficient in degrading Aβ, achieving a significant reduction in Aβ levels, which is about 150-fold more efficient than BACE1. This activity is pH-dependent and occurs primarily in acidic compartments such as lysosomes, indicating its role in intracellular Aβ degradation (AbdulHay2012Identification). BACE2 also exhibits θ-secretase activity, cleaving APP and β-secretase-derived APP-CTF within the Aβ sequence, further diverting APP from the amyloidogenic pathway (AbdulHay2012Identification).

In the central nervous system, BACE2 is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, where it processes specific substrates like VCAM1 and DNER, potentially influencing cellular communication and signaling (Voytyuk2018BACE2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BACE2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, most notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome. In Alzheimer's disease, BACE2 is involved in the processing of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) and can function as an amyloid-β-degrading protease. Increased BACE2 expression and enzymatic activity have been observed in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, preclinical AD, and AD. However, BACE2 protein levels inversely correlate with higher Braak stages, suggesting that lower BACE2 levels are associated with more severe AD (Yeap2023BACE2:). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the BACE2 gene, such as rs2252576 and rs2012050, have been linked to altered AD risk and earlier dementia onset, particularly in APOE4 non-carriers (Huentelman2019Common; Yeap2023BACE2:).

In Down syndrome, individuals have an extra copy of chromosome 21, where BACE2 is located. This triplication can lead to increased BACE2 activity, which may influence amyloid processing and contribute to the higher propensity for developing AD in this population (Fluhrer2002A; Yeap2023BACE2:). However, not all individuals with Down syndrome develop AD, indicating that other genetic factors may modulate this risk (Yeap2023BACE2:).

## Interactions
BACE2, a beta-secretase enzyme, participates in several interactions with other proteins, influencing various biological processes. It is involved in the cleavage of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), where it cleaves at specific phenylalanine residues, impacting fibril formation and degradation. This interaction suggests a role for BACE2 in modulating amyloidogenic processes, which are relevant in conditions like type 2 diabetes (Rulifson2016Identification).

BACE2 also interacts with the plasma membrane protein Tmem27, which is involved in cellular proliferation and insulin production. Inhibition of BACE2 has been shown to enhance beta-cell survival and increase beta-cell mass in insulin-resistant mice, indicating its regulatory role in beta-cell function (Ghosh2019Highly).

In the context of melanosome biogenesis, BACE2 cleaves PMEL, a protein crucial for melanosome formation in pigment cells. This cleavage releases the PMEL luminal domain, generating the amyloidogenic Mα fragment necessary for normal PMEL processing (Rochin2013BACE2).

Additionally, BACE2 is involved in the shedding of VCAM1, a process up-regulated during inflammation. This interaction is significant in inflammatory response pathways, as evidenced by increased VCAM1 shedding in inflammatory conditions (Voytyuk2018BACE2).
