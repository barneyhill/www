# LDLR

## Overview
The LDLR gene encodes the low-density lipoprotein receptor, a critical transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cholesterol metabolism and homeostasis. This receptor is primarily responsible for mediating the endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the bloodstream. By binding to apolipoprotein B or E on LDL particles, the receptor facilitates their internalization and subsequent degradation in lysosomes, releasing cholesterol for cellular functions such as membrane synthesis and hormone production (Lindgren1985Human; Schneider1982Purification). The LDL receptor is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it plays a vital role in clearing circulating LDL, thus preventing hypercholesterolemia and reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases (Goldstein1984Progress). Mutations in the LDLR gene can lead to familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic disorder characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol levels and an increased risk of coronary artery disease (Hobbs1992Molecular).

## Structure
The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is a modular type 1 transmembrane protein composed of 839 amino acids, playing a critical role in cholesterol homeostasis (Jeon2005STRUCTURE). The extracellular domain of LDLR includes seven contiguous cysteine-rich repeats known as LDL receptor type A (LA) repeats, which are crucial for ligand binding. Each LA module is approximately 40 residues long and features six cysteines forming three disulfide bonds, with calcium ions essential for proper folding and structural integrity (Jeon2005STRUCTURE; Fass1997Molecular).

The receptor also contains a region homologous to the epidermal growth factor precursor (EGFP), which includes EGF-like repeats and a YWTD β-propeller domain. This domain is involved in ligand release at low pH, facilitating receptor recycling (Jeon2005STRUCTURE; Rudenko2002Structure). The cytoplasmic tail of LDLR contains an NPxY sequence that directs the receptor to clathrin-coated pits (Jeon2005STRUCTURE).

Post-translational modifications include O-linked glycosylation in a 58-residue sequence rich in serine and threonine residues (Jeon2005STRUCTURE). Mutations in the LDLR gene can lead to familial hypercholesterolemia, affecting the receptor's function and cholesterol regulation (Rudenko2002Structure).

## Function
The LDLR gene encodes the low-density lipoprotein receptor, a crucial cell surface glycoprotein involved in cholesterol metabolism. In healthy human cells, the LDL receptor binds to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which contain cholesterol, through apoprotein B or E. This binding initiates receptor-mediated endocytosis, where the LDL-receptor complex is internalized via coated pits and transported to lysosomes. In the lysosomes, LDL is degraded, releasing cholesterol for cellular use (Lindgren1985Human; Schneider1982Purification).

The LDL receptor plays a significant role in maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis by regulating the uptake of cholesterol from the bloodstream. This process is essential for the biosynthesis of plasma membranes, bile acids, lipoproteins, and steroid hormones, while preventing excessive cholesterol accumulation (Lindgren1985Human). The receptor is particularly active in the liver, where it facilitates the clearance of circulating LDL, thus preventing hypercholesterolemia and associated cardiovascular diseases (Goldstein1984Progress).

In addition to its role in cholesterol uptake, the LDL receptor is involved in the recycling process, where it dissociates from its ligands within the cell and returns to the cell surface to continue LDL uptake (Beisiegel1981Monoclonal). This recycling is crucial for the continuous regulation of cholesterol levels in the body.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LDLR gene are primarily responsible for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a common autosomal dominant disorder characterized by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the blood. This condition leads to an increased risk of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) and other cardiovascular complications (Villéger2002The; Hobbs1992Molecular). FH manifests in two forms: heterozygotes, who have one mutant allele, experience a 2- to 3-fold increase in plasma LDL-C, while homozygotes, with two mutant alleles, have a 6- to 8-fold increase, often resulting in early-onset myocardial infarctions (Hobbs1992Molecular).

The clinical severity of FH can vary depending on the specific mutations in the LDLR gene. Mutations are categorized into different classes based on their impact on the receptor's function, such as transport-defective or binding-defective alleles (Hobbs1992Molecular). Receptor-negative mutations, which result in a complete lack of functional receptors, are associated with more severe lipid profiles and a higher prevalence of CAD compared to receptor-defective mutations (Bertolini2000Clinical).

In some cases, mutations in other genes, such as PCSK9, can exacerbate the clinical phenotype of FH, leading to even higher LDL-C levels and more severe cardiovascular disease (Pisciotta2006Additive).

## Interactions
The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) interacts with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which binds to the epidermal growth factor-like repeat A (EGF-A) domain of LDLR. This interaction is highly specific and calcium-dependent, involving a conserved leucine residue (Leu318) in the EGF-A domain. The binding of PCSK9 to LDLR decreases the receptor's recycling and increases its degradation, affecting cholesterol metabolism by reducing the availability of LDLR on the cell surface (Zhang2007Binding).

The interaction between LDLR and PCSK9 is influenced by pH levels, with increased binding observed at acidic pH, which is typical of endosomal environments. This ensures that PCSK9 remains bound to LDLR during endosomal acidification, leading to the receptor's degradation in the lysosome rather than recycling to the cell surface (Tveten2011Interaction).

LDLR also interacts with the COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 (CCC) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homologue (WASH) complexes, which are crucial for its endosomal sorting and proper functioning. Mutations in components of these complexes can lead to mislocalization and increased lysosomal degradation of LDLR, contributing to hypercholesterolemia (Bartuzi2016CCC).
