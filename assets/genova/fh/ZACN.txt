# ZACN

## Overview
The ZACN gene encodes the Zinc-Activated Channel (ZAC), a member of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) family, which is part of the larger Cys-loop receptor superfamily. This gene is located on chromosome 17q23 and is evolutionarily related to nicotinic acetylcholine and 5-HT3 receptor genes (Madjroh2021Delineation). The ZAC protein is a transmembrane ion channel that is primarily activated by zinc ions (Zn2+), but it can also respond to copper ions (Cu2+) and protons (H+), indicating a potential role in pH sensing and regulation (Jensen2023Evolutionary). Structurally, ZAC forms homomeric cation-selective channels with distinct properties, including spontaneous activity and slow kinetics, which differentiate it from other classical pLGICs (Jensen2023Evolutionary). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the fetal brain and spinal cord, suggesting its involvement in neuronal communication and muscle contraction (Davies2003A). Despite its established role in ion homeostasis and cellular signaling, the full physiological functions of ZACN in humans remain to be fully elucidated (Davies2003A).

## Structure
The ZACN gene encodes the Zinc-Activated Channel (ZAC), a member of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) found exclusively in mammals. ZAC exhibits low sequence homology with other members of the Cys-loop receptor superfamily, with less than 20% amino acid sequence identity to other pLGICs, yet retains most structural hallmarks of a pLGIC subunit (Jensen2023Evolutionary). The ZAC protein consists of 411 amino acids and features a signal sequence, a Cys-Cys motif, and four predicted transmembrane domains, which are characteristic of the Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel superfamily (Davies2003A).

The primary structure of ZAC includes specific residues such as Glu 136, Glu 162, Glu 235, and Asp 397, which are potential candidates for studies on proton-mediated gating (Jensen2023Evolutionary). The tertiary structure forms homomeric cation-selective channels that are gated by zinc (Zn2+), copper (Cu2+), and protons (H+) (Jensen2023Evolutionary). ZAC channels display distinct properties, including substantial spontaneous activity and slow activation and desensitization kinetics, differing from classical pLGICs (Jensen2023Evolutionary). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of ZAC into pentameric complexes, which are essential for its functionality (Madjroh2021Delineation). The ZACN gene is located on chromosome 17q23 and shares an ancestral origin with nicotinic acetylcholine and 5-HT3 receptor genes (Madjroh2021Delineation).

## Function
The ZACN gene encodes a zinc-activated ion channel that is part of the Cys-loop receptor family, which includes ligand-gated ion channels. This channel is primarily activated by zinc ions (Zn2+), but it can also be activated by protons (H+), suggesting a role in pH sensing or regulation (Davies2003A; Jensen2023Evolutionary). The human ZACN protein forms homomeric complexes on the cell surface, facilitating the flow of ions such as calcium and sodium across the plasma membrane, which is crucial for cellular signaling and maintaining ion homeostasis (Madjroh2019Pharmacological; Jensen2023Evolutionary).

In healthy human cells, ZACN is expressed in various tissues, including the fetal brain, spinal cord, and other neuroendocrine cells, indicating its potential involvement in neuronal communication and muscle contraction (Davies2003A). The channel's activation by zinc ions is concentration-dependent, with an EC50 value of 0.71 mM, highlighting its sensitivity to zinc as an agonist (Jensen2023Evolutionary). The presence of ZACN in specific tissues and its activation by zinc suggest it plays a significant role in cell signaling processes, although its precise physiological functions in humans are not fully understood (Davies2003A).

## Interactions
The ZACN protein, a zinc-activated ion channel, is known to form homomeric channels and has the potential to assemble into heteromeric complexes with other proteins. Studies have shown that ZACN can co-assemble with its variant forms, such as ZAC Thr128 and ZAC Ala128, into pentameric complexes. These complexes can be a heterogeneous mixture of homomeric and heteromeric assemblies, indicating that the presence of different subunits does not significantly impact the assembly process (Madjroh2021Delineation).

The ability of ZACN to form functional receptor complexes in expression systems suggests that it may interact with other proteins to fulfill specific physiological roles. However, the principal endogenous agonists for ZACN have not been confirmed, leaving open the possibility of other interactions and functions (Jensen2023Evolutionary). The ZACN protein is part of the Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel superfamily, which is known for its potential to interact with various ligands and modulators, although specific interactions for ZACN remain to be fully elucidated (Davies2003A; Koniuszewski2022Molecular).
