# CEP41

## Overview
CEP41 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 41, a crucial component involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and ciliary function. The protein is characterized by its rhodanese-like domain and coiled-coil motifs, which facilitate its interaction with microtubules, promoting their assembly and stability. This interaction is vital for cellular processes such as mitosis and cytokinesis, where CEP41 localizes to spindle poles and the midbody (Prassanawar2023CEP41). Additionally, centrosomal protein 41 plays a significant role in ciliogenesis by recruiting tubulin glutamylase TTLL6 to the ciliary axoneme, a process essential for proper ciliary function (Lee2012CEP41). Mutations in the CEP41 gene have been linked to Joubert syndrome, a ciliopathy with neurological and multiorgan manifestations, and have also been associated with autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its importance in neurodevelopmental processes (Lee2012CEP41; Patowary2019Familybased).

## Function
CEP41, a centrosomal protein, plays a critical role in microtubule assembly and cell proliferation. It is involved in the stabilization and organization of microtubules, essential for maintaining the microtubule network within cells. CEP41 interacts with microtubules through its rhodanese-like domain and coiled-coil motifs, promoting their assembly and stabilizing them against disassembly (Prassanawar2023CEP41). This interaction is crucial for processes such as mitosis and cytokinesis, where CEP41 localizes to spindle poles and the midbody, indicating its involvement in cell division (Prassanawar2023CEP41).

CEP41 is also essential for ciliogenesis and cilia function, as it recruits tubulin glutamylase TTLL6 to the ciliary axoneme, facilitating tubulin glutamylation, a posttranslational modification important for ciliary function (Prassanawar2023CEP41; Lee2012CEP41). In zebrafish embryos, CEP41 knockdown results in developmental defects due to impaired ciliary functions, highlighting its role in organismal development (Prassanawar2023CEP41).

The protein's activity is primarily localized at centrosomes and microtubules, where it contributes to microtubule nucleation and organization, impacting cell morphology and proliferation (Prassanawar2023CEP41). Overall, CEP41 is a key regulator of microtubule dynamics, crucial for cell proliferation and maintaining cellular structure.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP41 gene are associated with Joubert syndrome (JBTS), a ciliopathy characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia, neurological features such as ataxia, psychomotor delay, and oculomotor apraxia, along with a distinctive 'molar tooth sign' on brain imaging. JBTS often presents with multiorgan symptoms including retinal dystrophy, nephronophthisis, liver fibrosis, and polydactyly (Lee2012CEP41). Mutations in CEP41, particularly splice site mutations, lead to defects in tubulin glutamylation, resulting in abnormal ciliary axonemal structure and impaired ciliary motility, which are critical for proper ciliary function (Lee2012CEP41).

CEP41 has also been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies have identified a statistically significant association between rare protein-altering variants in CEP41 and ASD, with specific variants affecting axonal tract development and social behavior in zebrafish models (Patowary2019Familybased). These findings suggest that CEP41 variants may contribute to ASD by impacting neurodevelopmental processes (Patowary2019Familybased).

CEP41 is also involved in angiogenesis through its role in ciliary tubulin glutamylation, which is necessary for cilia disassembly and endothelial cell dynamics. This function is crucial for processes such as migration and tubulogenesis, and its disruption can inhibit angiogenesis (Ki2019CEP41‐mediated).

## Interactions
CEP41 is a centrosomal protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in microtubule dynamics and ciliary function. It directly binds to microtubules through its rhodanese-like domain and coiled-coil motifs, as demonstrated by co-sedimentation and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Prassanawar2023CEP41). CEP41 is also involved in recruiting tubulin glutamylase TTLL6 to the ciliary axoneme, facilitating tubulin glutamylation, a post-translational modification essential for ciliary stability (Lee2012CEP41). 

CEP41 interacts with TTLL6, forming a complex that is crucial for the localization of TTLL6 to the cilium, which is necessary for proper ciliary function (Lee2012CEP41). In endothelial cells, CEP41 is involved in mechanotransduction and angiogenesis, interacting with proteins such as AURKA and HIF1a. These interactions are important for processes like cilia disassembly and the regulation of angiogenic factors under hypoxic conditions (Ki2019CEP41‐mediated). CEP41 also interacts with CCP5, where their reciprocal inhibition affects ciliary glutamylation, highlighting its role in maintaining ciliary function and structure (Ki2019CEP41‐mediated).
