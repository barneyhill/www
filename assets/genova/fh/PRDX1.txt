# PRDX1

## Overview
The PRDX1 gene encodes the protein peroxiredoxin 1, a member of the peroxiredoxin family of antioxidant enzymes. Peroxiredoxin 1 plays a critical role in cellular defense against oxidative stress by reducing hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides to water and alcohol, respectively. This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting cells from oxidative damage (Ledgerwood2017The; Chu2013Regulation). Structurally, peroxiredoxin 1 is characterized by a thioredoxin fold and functions primarily as a homodimer, although it can form higher-order structures under certain conditions (Bertoldi2015Human; Dalla2018Differential). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, through its role in modulating reactive oxygen species levels and interacting with key signaling pathways (Neumann2009Peroxiredoxin; Jarvis2012Peroxiredoxin). Additionally, PRDX1 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and a proto-oncogene, depending on the context (Neumann2003Essential; Ding2016Peroxiredoxin).

## Structure
Peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) is a member of the peroxiredoxin family, characterized by its role as an antioxidant enzyme. The primary structure of PRDX1 includes a conserved cysteine residue essential for its peroxidase activity, which is typically located near the N-terminus (Bertoldi2015Human). The secondary structure of PRDX1 features a thioredoxin fold, consisting of a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices, which is common among peroxiredoxins (Dalla2018Differential).

PRDX1 functions as a homodimer, with each monomer comprising approximately 199 amino acids. In its reduced state, PRDX1 forms decamers, which are pentamers of dimers, while in the oxidized state, it exists as dimers. The dimeric structure is stabilized by a monomer-to-monomer interface, and the decameric structure relies on dimer-to-dimer interactions through α-helix motifs (Bertoldi2015Human).

Post-translational modifications of PRDX1 include phosphorylation and overoxidation, which can affect its activity and function. PRDX1 may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Dalla2018Differential). The protein's structure and modifications are crucial for its role in cellular redox signaling and peroxide detoxification.

## Function
Peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) is a crucial antioxidant enzyme involved in reducing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and organic hydroperoxides to water and alcohol, respectively, using reducing equivalents from thioredoxin. This activity is essential for protecting cells from oxidative stress and maintaining cellular redox balance (Ledgerwood2017The; Chu2013Regulation). PRDX1 plays a significant role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (Neumann2009Peroxiredoxin).

In healthy human cells, PRDX1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it functions as a signal peroxidase. It is involved in receiving, transducing, and transmitting peroxide signals, which are crucial for activating signaling pathways such as the ASK1/p38 MAPK pathway in response to oxidative stress (Ledgerwood2017The; Jarvis2012Peroxiredoxin). PRDX1 also interacts with various proteins, forming transient disulfide-linked intermediates that facilitate the oxidation and activation of target proteins, thereby influencing cellular signaling processes (Jarvis2012Peroxiredoxin).

The regulation of PRDX1's peroxidase activity is mediated by phosphorylation and interaction with proteins like Pin1, which facilitates its dephosphorylation and reactivation, highlighting its role in detoxifying ROS and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Chu2013Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PRDX1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. PRDX1 can function as both a tumor suppressor and a proto-oncogene. In mice, the absence of PRDX1 leads to severe hemolytic anemia and an increased incidence of malignancies, highlighting its role in tumor suppression (Neumann2003Essential). However, in human cancers, PRDX1 is often overexpressed, suggesting a potential oncogenic role. This overexpression is observed in lung adenocarcinomas, colorectal cancer, and soft tissue sarcomas, often associated with chromosome 1q amplification (Ding2016Peroxiredoxin).

In breast cancer, PRDX1 is frequently overexpressed, which may correlate with higher tumor grades and increased recurrence risk after radiotherapy. It can enhance NF-kB activity in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells, contributing to drug resistance (Ding2016Peroxiredoxin). PRDX1 also interacts with the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway, where its loss can lead to increased PTEN oxidation and promote tumorigenesis (Cao2009Prdx1).

PRDX1 is also involved in epi-cblC disease, an inborn error of cobalamin metabolism. A specific splicing variant, PRDX1:c.515-1G > T, leads to a more severe clinical phenotype due to its impact on oxidative stress defense (Cavicchi2021PRDX1).

## Interactions
Peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. PRDX1 interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) in a redox-dependent manner, particularly upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This interaction is crucial for the activation of ASK1, which is involved in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase pathways, important for apoptosis and inflammation regulation. The interaction occurs through a redox-relay mechanism, forming a mixed disulfide with ASK1, and does not require a scaffolding protein, although thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) may facilitate the interaction (Vo2021Prdx1; Jarvis2012Peroxiredoxin).

PRDX1 also interacts with the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx), negatively regulating hepatitis B virus (HBV) propagation by promoting HBV RNA decay. This interaction involves the exosome component 5 (Exosc5) and is crucial for the degradation of HBV RNA, highlighting PRDX1's role in host defense mechanisms against HBV infection (Deng2019Peroxiredoxin).

Additionally, PRDX1 interacts with Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, which regulates PRDX1's peroxidase activity. This interaction is mediated through the phospho-Thr 90 -Pro 91 motif of PRDX1 and involves PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation, influencing reactive oxygen species levels in cells (Chu2013Regulation).
