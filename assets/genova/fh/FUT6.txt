# FUT6

## Overview
The FUT6 gene encodes the enzyme fucosyltransferase 6, which is a member of the glycosyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the fucosylation process, a critical post-translational modification where fucose, a hexose sugar, is added to glycoproteins and glycolipids. Fucosyltransferase 6 specifically catalyzes the transfer of fucose to N-acetyllactosamine and 3′-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine, forming structures such as Lewis X and sialyl Lewis X, which are essential for cell-cell interactions, particularly in immune response and inflammation regulation (Zhang2019A). The gene is expressed predominantly in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a vital role in leukocyte trafficking and immune modulation (Zhang2019A). Alterations in FUT6 expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including cancer, inflammatory disorders, and metabolic conditions, underscoring its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Zhang2019A; Zhao2016The).

## Function
Fucosyltransferase 6 (FUT6) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the process of fucosylation, which involves the transfer of fucose, a sugar moiety, to glycoproteins and glycolipids. This modification is essential for various cellular functions, including cell-cell recognition, signaling, and immune responses. FUT6 specifically catalyzes the transfer of fucose from GDP-fucose to N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) or 3′-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine (3′-SLN), resulting in the formation of the Lewis X trisaccharide or sialyl Lewis X tetrasaccharide, respectively (Zhang2019A). These structures are important for leukocyte trafficking and inflammation regulation, as they facilitate interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix.

FUT6 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it influences the synthesis of sialyl Lewis X, a molecule involved in leukocyte homing and immune response modulation (Zhang2019A). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining normal cellular processes and organismal homeostasis. Misregulation of FUT6 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its importance in both health and disease (Zhang2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FUT6 gene are associated with plasma alpha(1,3)-fucosyltransferase deficiency, which affects the expression of Lewis blood group antigens. This deficiency is particularly noted in individuals homozygous for certain mutations, such as the M2 missense mutation (Glu-247 to Lys) and the M4 nonsense mutation (Tyr-315 to stop), leading to a loss of enzyme activity and a Lewis negative phenotype (Mollicone1994Molecular). The deficiency is prevalent in certain populations, such as those in Indonesia, where a high frequency of the Le(a-b-) phenotype is observed (Mollicone1994Molecular).

FUT6 deficiency also impacts immune cell function, particularly in basophils, by disrupting the expression of sialyl-Lewis x (sLe x), which is crucial for cell migration and allergic responses. This results in reduced basophil extravasation, increased blood basophil counts, and diminished allergic reactions, such as reduced itch sensitivity and lower allergen-specific IgE levels (Puan2021FUT6). The deficiency is linked to specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and null alleles, affecting a significant portion of the population with varying frequencies across different ethnic groups (Puan2021FUT6).

Additionally, genetic variants in FUT6, such as rs3760776, have been investigated for their potential role in type 2 diabetes mellitus susceptibility, particularly in the Uyghur population, suggesting a broader impact of FUT6 on metabolic conditions (Zhao2016The).
