# ACTL8

## Overview
ACTL8 is a gene that encodes the actin-like protein 8, which is part of the actin family of proteins. These proteins are known for their role in various cellular processes, including maintaining cell shape, enabling cell movement, and facilitating intracellular transport. Actin-like protein 8, in particular, has been categorized as a cytoskeletal protein due to its structural similarities to actin. The expression of ACTL8 is notably altered in certain cancer types, where it has been associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Research indicates that ACTL8 may influence cancer cell proliferation and survival through its involvement in key signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Li2018High; Ma2019Knockdown).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ACTL8 (actin-like protein 8) has been implicated in the progression of several cancers due to its altered expression levels. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), high expression of ACTL8 is associated with poor prognosis, increased cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. This suggests that ACTL8 plays a significant role in tumor progression. Knockdown of ACTL8 in HNSCC cell models results in decreased cell viability and reduced activity in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival (Li2018High). 

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ACTL8 is also highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal lung tissues. Its knockdown in LUAD cell lines leads to a significant decrease in cell proliferation, indicating its potential oncogenic role. The knockdown affects the expression of several key proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as FOXM1, STMN1, PLK1, and BIRC5, and activates pathways related to cell death and apoptosis (Ma2019Knockdown). 

These findings suggest that ACTL8 could serve as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in these cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in oncology (Li2018High).
