# RPS25

## Overview
RPS25 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein S25, a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, which is integral to the process of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. As a ribosomal protein, S25 plays a pivotal role in the assembly and function of ribosomes, facilitating mRNA translation and contributing to cellular growth and proliferation. Beyond its fundamental role in protein synthesis, ribosomal protein S25 is involved in the regulation of the MDM2-p53 pathway, acting as a tumor suppressor by modulating the interaction between MDM2 and p53, which is crucial for cellular stress responses and apoptosis (Zhang2012Identification). Additionally, RPS25 interacts with viral internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), highlighting its involvement in IRES-mediated translation initiation (Nishiyama2007Eukaryotic). The gene's expression and mutations have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer biology, where it is associated with tumor suppression and prognosis (Azevedo2022Comprehensive; Wang2014Ribosomal).

## Function
RPS25 encodes a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, playing a crucial role in protein synthesis by facilitating mRNA translation. It is involved in the assembly and function of ribosomes, essential for cellular growth and proliferation. RPS25 is active in the cytoplasm, where ribosomes are located, contributing to overall cellular and organismal protein production.

RPS25 is a ribosomal protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of the MDM2-p53 pathway, which is crucial for cellular response to stress. It interacts with MDM2, inhibiting its E3 ligase activity, which reduces MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination, leading to the stabilization and activation of p53. This interaction forms a ternary complex with MDM2 and p53 following ribosomal stress (Zhang2012Identification). RPS25 is also a transcriptional target of p53, suggesting a feedback loop that regulates p53 activity (Zhang2012Identification). The protein is involved in the cellular response to ribosomal stress, acting as a tumor suppressor by regulating the MDM2-p53 interaction, which can lead to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis (Zhang2012Identification). RPS25's role in stabilizing p53 is crucial for maintaining the balance of p53 activity, which is important for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Zhang2012Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RPS25 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, RPS25 is often downregulated, and this downregulation is associated with lymph node positivity, suggesting its potential as a marker for metastasis risk. Low mRNA expression of RPS25 is linked to poor prognosis, with specific implications for different breast cancer subtypes. Mutations in RPS25, including missense and truncating mutations, are associated with poor overall and relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients (Azevedo2022Comprehensive).

RPS25 also plays a role in the regulation of the MDM2-p53 pathway, which is crucial for tumor suppression. It interacts with MDM2, inhibiting its activity and leading to the stabilization and activation of p53. This interaction forms part of a feedback loop where RPS25 is a transcriptional target of p53, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. Disruption of this regulatory loop can contribute to cancer development and progression (Zhang2012Identification).

RPS25's involvement in these pathways highlights its significance in cancer biology, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating its expression or interactions (Wang2014Ribosomal).

## Interactions
Ribosomal protein S25 (RPS25) is involved in several significant interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with MDM2, a key regulator of the tumor suppressor protein p53, forming a ternary complex with MDM2 and p53. This interaction inhibits MDM2's E3 ligase activity, reducing p53 ubiquitination and leading to p53 stabilization and activation (Zhang2012Identification). RPS25 also stabilizes MDMX, which cooperates with RPS25 to inhibit MDM2, further contributing to p53 activation (Zhang2012Identification).

RPS25 is a transcriptional target of p53, creating a feedback loop where p53 can suppress RPS25 expression (Zhang2012Identification). This regulatory loop is crucial for cellular responses to ribosomal stress and has implications for cancer biology (Zhang2012Identification).

In addition to its role in the MDM2-p53 pathway, RPS25 interacts with the intergenic internal ribosome entry site (IGR-IRES) of dicistroviruses. It binds to specific uridine residues within the IRES, facilitating the docking of the IRES on the 40S ribosomal subunit, which is essential for IRES-mediated translation initiation (Nishiyama2007Eukaryotic).
