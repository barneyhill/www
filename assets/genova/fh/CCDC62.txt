# CCDC62

## Overview
CCDC62 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 62 protein, which plays a significant role in male reproductive physiology, particularly in spermatogenesis and acrosome formation. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains and LXXLL motifs, which facilitate interactions with nuclear receptors and other proteins. CCDC62 is primarily localized in the nucleus and is expressed in various human cell lines, with notable expression in the testis. Functionally, the protein is involved in acrosome biogenesis, interacting specifically with the acrosomal protein GOPC, which is crucial for normal sperm development. Mutations in the CCDC62 gene can lead to male infertility due to defects in spermiogenesis. Additionally, CCDC62 has been identified as a cancer/testis antigen, with aberrant expression in several tumors, and is associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease in certain populations (Li2017A; Lu2016Possible; Chen2009CCDC62ERAP75; Domae2009Identification).

## Structure
The CCDC62 protein is encoded by a cDNA sequence that translates into an open reading frame of 684 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 75 kDa (Chen2009CCDC62ERAP75). The protein contains two conserved LXXLL motifs in its C-terminal region, which are crucial for interaction with estrogen receptor beta (ERb) (Chen2009CCDC62ERAP75). These motifs are necessary for binding to liganded nuclear receptors, although only the first motif is essential for interaction with ERb (Chen2009CCDC62ERAP75).

In terms of secondary structure, CCDC62 features two putative coiled-coil domains located in the N-terminus, spanning amino acids 16-163 and 199-255 (Chen2009CCDC62ERAP75). These domains are known to facilitate protein-protein interactions, DNA-protein interactions, and dimerization (Chen2009CCDC62ERAP75). The coiled-coil domain is not necessary for interaction with ERb but may assist in interactions with p160 coactivators (Chen2009CCDC62ERAP75).

The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining in LNCaP cells (Chen2009CCDC62ERAP75). The expression of CCDC62 is detected in various human cell lines and mouse tissues, with strong expression in the testis (Li2017A). The protein's molecular structure details focus on the presence of coiled-coil domains and motifs, but specific information on tertiary or quaternary structures is not provided.

## Function
CCDC62 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical processes related to male reproductive physiology, particularly in spermatogenesis and acrosome formation. In healthy human cells, the CCDC62 protein is localized in the acrosome of sperm cells. During spermatogenesis, it initially localizes to the Golgi apparatus and subsequently forms a cap-like structure over the nuclei in round spermatids. As spermatids elongate and mature, CCDC62 assumes a crescent moon-shaped structure, which is essential for proper acrosome formation (Li2017A).

The protein's role in acrosome biogenesis is further supported by its interaction with the acrosomal protein GOPC, although it does not interact with PICK1. This suggests that CCDC62 is involved in acrosome formation through specific protein-protein interactions (Li2017A). The absence of CCDC62, as observed in certain mouse models, leads to defects in spermiogenesis and results in male infertility, highlighting its crucial role in normal sperm development and function (Li2017A). The expression of CCDC62 is testis-specific, with the highest levels observed during testicular development, indicating its specialized function in reproductive biology (Li2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCDC62 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In mice, a nonsense mutation in the CCDC62 gene leads to spermiogenesis defects and male infertility. This mutation results in a loss-of-function, causing male-specific sterility due to impaired acrosome formation, which is crucial for sperm development (Li2017A). The mutation affects sperm morphology, count, and motility, highlighting the gene's critical role in male reproductive health (Li2017A).

CCDC62 has also been identified as a cancer/testis antigen, specifically its variant CCDC62-2, which is expressed in various tumors, including colon, liver, lung, prostate, and stomach cancers. This variant is typically restricted to the testis in normal tissues but is aberrantly expressed in malignant tissues, making it a potential target for cancer immunotherapy (Domae2009Identification). The immunogenicity of CCDC62-2 has been demonstrated, with antibodies detected in cancer patients, suggesting its relevance in cancer immunology (Domae2009Identification).

Additionally, the CCDC62 gene polymorphism rs12817488 has been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease in the Chinese population, with some gender-specific differences in the strength of this association (Lu2016Possible). However, other studies have not found a significant association between this polymorphism and Parkinson's disease susceptibility (Li2013Genetic).

## Interactions
CCDC62 is involved in protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in acrosome formation during spermiogenesis. The protein interacts specifically with Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif-containing protein (GOPC), which is important for acrosome biogenesis. This interaction was demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation assays, which showed that CCDC62 can bind to GOPC but not to PICK1, another protein involved in acrosome formation (Li2017A). The interaction between CCDC62 and GOPC suggests a mechanism by which CCDC62 influences the development of the acrosome, a critical structure in sperm cells (Li2017A).

The study of CCDC62 in repro29/repro29 mice, which carry a nonsense mutation in the Ccdc62 gene, further supports the importance of this interaction. These mice exhibit defects in acrosome formation and male infertility, highlighting the functional significance of CCDC62's interaction with GOPC in normal spermiogenesis (Li2017A). The absence of CCDC62 in these mutant mice underscores its essential role in the proper formation of the acrosome, likely mediated through its interaction with GOPC (Li2017A).
