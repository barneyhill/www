# CTBS

## Overview
The CTBS gene encodes the enzyme di-N-acetylchitobiase, a member of the glycosyl hydrolase family 18, which is primarily involved in the lysosomal degradation of N-linked glycans. This enzyme is crucial for the hydrolysis of N-acetylglucosamine residues, facilitating the breakdown and recycling of glycoproteins within lysosomes (Persichetti2012Lysosomal). The chitobiase protein, characterized by an (α/β)8 barrel structure, is directed to the lysosome by a signal peptide and undergoes post-translational modifications that are essential for its stability and function (Liu1999Structure; Balducci2008Molecular). While the CTBS gene is expressed in various human tissues, including the liver and spleen, its deficiency has not been directly linked to any specific lysosomal storage disease, although it may contribute to the accumulation of oligosaccharides (Persichetti2012Lysosomal).

## Structure
The human chitobiase protein, encoded by the CTBS gene, consists of 385 amino acids and includes a signal peptide of 38 amino acids, which directs the protein to the lysosome (Fisher1992Cloning; Balducci2008Molecular). The primary structure of the protein shows a high degree of sequence identity with chitobiase proteins from other species, such as 83% identity with the rat chitobiase (Fisher1992Cloning; Balducci2008Molecular).

The secondary structure of chitobiase includes several conserved regions that form β-strands in the (α/β)8 barrel, a common fold in family 18 chitinases (Liu1999Structure). This structure is crucial for the enzyme's function, with the catalytic acid donor E143 playing a key role in enzymatic activity (Liu1999Structure).

Post-translational modifications of the human chitobiase protein include potential Asn-linked glycosylation at four conserved sites, which are important for the protein's stability and function (Fisher1992Cloning). The presence of multiple polyadenylation signals in the 3′UTR of the cDNA may lead to the production of several mRNA species of different lengths, potentially resulting in splice variant isoforms (Balducci2008Molecular).

## Function
The CTBS gene encodes the enzyme di-N-acetylchitobiase, which plays a crucial role in the catabolic pathway of N-linked glycans in healthy human cells. This enzyme is responsible for hydrolyzing the N-acetylglucosamine residue at the reducing end of the N,N′ diacetylchitobiose core of oligosaccharides. This step is essential for the degradation of glycoproteins with asparagine-linked carbohydrates, facilitating the breakdown and recycling of complex carbohydrates within lysosomes (Balducci2008Molecular; Persichetti2012Lysosomal).

Chitobiase activity is vital for the function of core-specific α1-6mannosidase, which further degrades the glycan core structure resulting from the catabolism of N-linked oligosaccharides. This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper metabolic function (Persichetti2012Lysosomal). In humans, the CTBS gene is expressed in various tissues, including the liver and spleen, and is part of the glycosyl hydrolase family 18 (Balducci2008Molecular).

The absence or deficiency of chitobiase activity can lead to the accumulation of specific oligosaccharides, potentially resulting in lysosomal storage diseases, although no specific disease has been identified for chitobiase deficiency in humans (Persichetti2012Lysosomal).
