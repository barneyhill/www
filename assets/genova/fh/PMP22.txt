# PMP22

## Overview
The PMP22 gene encodes the peripheral myelin protein 22, a crucial component of the myelin sheath in the peripheral nervous system. This protein is categorized as an integral membrane glycoprotein with a tetraspan topology, playing a significant role in the formation and maintenance of myelin, which is essential for proper nerve function (Mobley2007Purification; Li2012The). PMP22 is primarily expressed by Schwann cells and is involved in regulating their proliferation and differentiation, contributing to the structural integrity and function of myelinated nerves (Naef1998Many). Alterations in the PMP22 gene, such as duplications, deletions, or point mutations, are associated with several inherited peripheral neuropathies, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A and Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies, underscoring its clinical significance (van2014PMP22; Boutary2021Treating).

## Structure
The peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) is an integral membrane protein with a tetraspan topology, consisting of four transmembrane helices (TM1-TM4) (Mobley2007Purification; Li2012The). The protein is highly helical, with approximately 65% helix content, and forms a stable tertiary structure in certain detergents (Mobley2007Purification). PMP22's structure includes two major hydrophilic regions located extracellularly, with the N and C termini positioned on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane (D’Urso1997Ins).

PMP22 is a glycoprotein with a single N-linked glycosylation site at Asn 41, located in its first extracellular loop (D’Urso1997Ins). This glycosylation is important for its function and may play a role in intercellular recognition and adhesion (Naef1998Many). The protein tends to dimerize, forming disulfide-linked dimers under oxidizing conditions, which is significant for its role in peripheral neuropathies (Mobley2007Purification).

The protein's intracellular domain is minimal, and its extracellular loops may mediate interactions with other proteins, such as myelin protein zero (Li2012The). PMP22's ability to form myelin-like assemblies in lipid bilayers suggests its role in organizing membrane architecture (Mittendorf2017Peripheral).

## Function
Peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) is a critical component of the myelin sheath in the peripheral nervous system, primarily expressed by Schwann cells. It plays a significant role in myelination, the stability of myelin, and the maintenance of axons (Naef1998Many). PMP22 is an integral membrane glycoprotein that constitutes approximately 2-5% of the total myelin proteins in the peripheral nervous system, contributing to the formation of the myelin sheath and reducing the capacitance of the internode, which is essential for the functional integrity of peripheral nerves (Li2012The).

PMP22 is involved in regulating Schwann cell proliferation and differentiation, with its expression being tightly controlled through transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms (Naef1998Many). The protein is primarily localized to the compact portion of the myelin sheath, and its expression pattern during peripheral nervous system development is similar to other myelin proteins (Snipes1992Characterization). PMP22 also plays a role in cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, with its expression levels affecting these processes differently in vitro and in vivo (Li2012The). The regulation of PMP22 expression is crucial for maintaining the balance of myelin protein levels, as deviations can lead to inherited neuropathies (Li2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PMP22 gene are linked to several inherited peripheral neuropathies. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is caused by a duplication of the PMP22 gene, leading to its overexpression. This results in demyelination and affects motor and sensory functions, making CMT1A the most common subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (van2014PMP22; Boutary2021Treating). Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) is due to a deletion of one copy of the PMP22 gene, causing episodes of numbness and weakness (van2014PMP22; Boutary2021Treating). CMT1E results from point mutations in PMP22, leading to misfolding and cellular stress (Boutary2021Treating).

The T118M mutation in PMP22 is associated with a partial loss of function, leading to neuropathies similar to HNPP. This mutation can cause severe axonal degeneration in the homozygous state and may mitigate the effects of a CMT1A duplication (Shy2006T118M). Dejerine-Sottas syndrome, another demyelinating neuropathy, can also be caused by mutations in PMP22 (Boutary2021Treating). These conditions highlight the critical role of PMP22 gene dosage and function in maintaining peripheral nerve integrity.

## Interactions
Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22) is involved in several critical interactions within the peripheral nervous system. PMP22 forms a complex with α6β4 integrin and laminin, which is essential for the structural integrity and function of myelinating peripheral nerves. This interaction is crucial for stabilizing axon-Schwann cell contacts and initiating myelination. The absence of PMP22 leads to reduced β4 integrin levels, indicating that PMP22 is necessary for the proper expression and stabilization of β4 integrin (Amici2006Peripheral).

PMP22 also interacts with Myelin Protein Zero (MPZ), forming a strong and specific complex mediated by their transmembrane domains. This interaction is significant for normal myelination, and disruptions can lead to peripheral neuropathy. The PMP22~MPZ complex is suggested to occur in cis within the same membrane, and its formation is crucial for PMP22's function in myelin (Pashkova2023Disrupting).

Additionally, PMP22 engages in both homophilic and heterophilic interactions with P0, another myelin protein. These interactions are important for maintaining the stability of peripheral myelin, and mutations in P0 can impair these interactions, affecting myelin stability (Hasse2004Peripheral).
