# SYT2

## Overview
The SYT2 gene encodes the protein synaptotagmin 2, which is a critical component of the synaptic vesicle machinery involved in neurotransmitter release. Synaptotagmin 2 functions as a calcium sensor, playing a pivotal role in the rapid and synchronous release of neurotransmitters at synapses, particularly within the central nervous system and neuromuscular junctions. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its N-terminal transmembrane region, and it contains two C-terminal C2 domains that are essential for calcium binding and subsequent synaptic vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane (Pang2006Synaptotagmin2; Herrmann2014Synaptotagmin). The precise interactions of synaptotagmin 2 with SNARE complexes and its ability to form calcium-sensitive oligomers underscore its multifaceted role in synaptic transmission (Zanetti2016Ringlike; Young2009Synaptotagmin). Mutations in the SYT2 gene have been linked to various neuromuscular disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining proper synaptic function and organismal viability (Maselli2020Recessive; Herrmann2014Synaptotagmin).

## Structure
Synaptotagmin 2 (SYT2) is a synaptic vesicle protein that functions as a calcium sensor for neurotransmitter release. The protein structure includes an N-terminal transmembrane region, a linker sequence, and two C-terminal C2 domains, C2A and C2B, which are responsible for calcium binding (Pang2006Synaptotagmin2). The C2B domain is particularly crucial for calcium binding, with specific residues such as Asp307 playing a key role in coordinating calcium ions (Herrmann2014Synaptotagmin). 

The C2B domain is also involved in interactions with other proteins, such as AP2, which may influence synaptic vesicle pool replenishment (Chen2017Synaptotagmin). The linker between the C2A and C2B domains contains three amino acid differences that are critical for synaptotagmin function, with the presence of glycine residues potentially increasing flexibility (Chen2017Synaptotagmin). 

SYT2 is associated with Ca2+ channel alpha subunits, which may facilitate tighter coupling with calcium channels, enhancing its role in fast synaptic transmission (Chen2017Synaptotagmin). The C terminus of synaptotagmins is highly divergent, which may regulate coupling distance and endocytosis rate (Chen2017Synaptotagmin).

## Function
Synaptotagmin 2 (SYT2) is a protein that plays a critical role in neurotransmitter release at synapses by functioning as a calcium sensor. It is essential for the rapid release of neurotransmitters, facilitating synaptic vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane in response to calcium influx. SYT2 is primarily active in the central nervous system and neuromuscular junctions, where it contributes to fast, synchronous neurotransmitter release during action potentials (Pang2006Synaptotagmin2; Young2009Synaptotagmin).

In the nervous system, SYT2 is expressed in a subset of forebrain neurons and is prevalent in brainstem and spinal cord neurons, including both excitatory and inhibitory types. It is particularly associated with inhibitory neurons in the forebrain and cerebellum (Pang2006Synaptotagmin2). SYT2's role extends to synaptic vesicle positioning, where it ensures that vesicles are correctly positioned near calcium channels, which is crucial for the rapid response required for synchronous release (Young2009Synaptotagmin).

The absence of SYT2 leads to severe motor dysfunction and early death in knockout mice, highlighting its critical role in survival and normal motor function (Pang2006Synaptotagmin2). This underscores its importance in maintaining proper synaptic transmission dynamics and organismal viability.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SYT2 gene are associated with several neuromuscular disorders, primarily affecting the presynaptic neuromuscular junction. Heterozygous missense mutations in the C2B calcium-binding domain of SYT2 have been linked to peripheral motor neuron syndromes, such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and hereditary motor neuropathy. For instance, the c.920A>C mutation, resulting in an Asp307Ala change, leads to a disorder resembling LEMS, while the c.923C>T (p.Pro308Leu) mutation causes presynaptic neuromuscular junction defects (Herrmann2014Synaptotagmin; Whittaker2015Electrophysiologic).

A novel de novo missense mutation, c.917C>T (p.Ser306Leu), has been associated with distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN), characterized by foot deformities and muscle weakness (Mironovich2020Identification). Recessive mutations, such as the c.1191delG, p.Arg397Serfs*37, result in severe congenital myasthenic syndrome with symptoms like hypotonia and profound weakness from birth (Donkervoort2020Biallelic; Maselli2020Recessive).

These mutations disrupt synaptic vesicle exocytosis, impairing neurotransmitter release and leading to clinical manifestations such as limb weakness, muscle fatigue, and reduced deep tendon reflexes (Herrmann2014Synaptotagmin; MontesChinea2018Identification). Treatment options, including pyridostigmine, have shown variable effectiveness in improving muscle strength and stamina (Donkervoort2020Biallelic).

## Interactions
Synaptotagmin 2 (SYT2) is involved in several key interactions that facilitate its role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. SYT2 interacts with SNARE complexes, which are essential for vesicle docking and positioning at the active zone. This interaction is crucial for the precise timing of neurotransmitter release. The R399,400Q mutation in SYT2 has been shown to interfere with its ability to bind SNARE complexes, leading to increased synaptic delay and altered kinetics of synchronous release, suggesting a role in vesicle positioning (Young2009Synaptotagmin).

SYT2 also forms ring-like oligomers on lipid monolayers, a structural feature shared with other synaptotagmin isoforms. These oligomers are sensitive to calcium, and their disruption upon calcium influx may play a role in synchronizing neurotransmitter release (Zanetti2016Ringlike). The oligomerization of SYT2 and its interaction with SNARE complexes highlight its multifaceted role in synaptic transmission.

Additionally, SYT2 has been shown to rescue the synaptotagmin-1 knockout phenotype, restoring fast synchronous neurotransmitter release, which underscores its functional similarity and interaction with other synaptotagmin isoforms in the exocytosis process (Xu2007Synaptotagmin1).
