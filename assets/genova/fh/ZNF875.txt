# ZNF875

## Overview
ZNF875 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 875, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins, including ZNF875, typically function as transcription factors that bind to DNA and modulate the expression of target genes, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Campagna2023Parity). The expression and methylation status of ZNF875 have been implicated in several physiological and pathological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and certain cancers (dugge2021tumor; Campagna2023Parity; Xiong2022Rare). The gene's methylation patterns are also associated with environmental factors, such as arsenic exposure, highlighting its potential role in the body's response to external stimuli (Bozack2021Exposure).

## Function
ZNF875, also known as HKR1, is a zinc finger protein involved in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins typically function as transcription factors, binding to DNA and influencing the expression of target genes. In healthy human cells, ZNF875 plays a role in modulating gene expression, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Campagna2023Parity).

The methylation status of ZNF875 is associated with several physiological and pathological conditions. Hypomethylation of ZNF875 has been observed in parous women with multiple sclerosis, suggesting a potential link to reduced neurodegeneration in the central nervous system, although this remains speculative and requires further research (Campagna2023Parity). Additionally, ZNF875 is associated with aging, and its methylation level is significantly correlated with the burden of phosphorylated tau deposits, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease pathology (Xiong2022Rare).

In the context of cancer, ZNF875 shows decreased expression and increased methylation in long-course gastric marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type, indicating that DNA methylation may influence its gene expression regulation (dugge2021tumor). These findings highlight the importance of ZNF875 in various biological processes and its potential implications in disease states.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF875, also known as HKR1, is implicated in several diseases through alterations in its DNA methylation and expression levels. In women with multiple sclerosis (MS), hypomethylation of ZNF875 is associated with parity, suggesting a potential link to reduced neurodegeneration in the central nervous system, although this remains speculative and requires further research (Campagna2023Parity). This hypomethylation is not confounded by maternal smoking, which has been previously linked to ZNF875 hypomethylation (Campagna2023Parity).

In the context of arsenic exposure, ZNF875 has been identified as differentially methylated among adults with arsenicosis, indicating its potential role in the body's response to environmental toxins (Bozack2021Exposure). Additionally, in gastric marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type, ZNF875 shows decreased expression and increased methylation in long-course cases, suggesting a regulatory role in tumor progression (dugge2021tumor).

While ZNF875 has been analyzed in Alzheimer's disease studies, its association with the disease is less significant compared to other genes, with a lower Bayes factor and posterior probability, indicating a less direct involvement (Xiong2022Rare).
