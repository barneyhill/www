# XYLT1

## Overview
The XYLT1 gene encodes the enzyme xylosyltransferase 1, a type II transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), essential components of the extracellular matrix. This enzyme is characterized by its unique structural domains, including a catalytic GT-A domain and a non-catalytic Xylo_C domain, which facilitate its function in transferring xylose from UDP-xylose to serine residues on proteoglycan core proteins (Briggs2018Structural). The activity of xylosyltransferase 1 is crucial for the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, and dermatan sulfate, which are vital for cellular communication, growth, and migration (Götting2000Molecular). Mutations in the XYLT1 gene are linked to several genetic disorders, including Desbuquois dysplasia type 2 and Baratela-Scott syndrome, underscoring its importance in skeletal development and connective tissue integrity (Mizumoto2021Congenital; Bui2014XYLT1).

## Structure
Human xylosyltransferase 1 (XYLT1) is a type II transmembrane protein involved in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. The protein is characterized by a two-lobed structure, comprising a catalytic GT-A domain and a non-catalytic Xylo_C domain. The GT-A domain is similar to that of leukocyte-type core 2 b1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase but features unique elements such as the path of the N-terminal extension and an active-site entrance covered by a flap (Briggs2018Structural). The Xylo_C domain includes a cystatin-like fold, an immunoglobulin-like fold, and an a-helical region, forming a single domain due to a continuous hydrophobic core (Briggs2018Structural).

The UDP-xylose binding site in XYLT1 is distinct in that it does not involve the typical metal-ion-dependent DXD motif. Instead, the UDP diphosphate moiety interacts with two positively charged residues, R598 and K599 (Briggs2018Structural). The enzyme's structure suggests a catalytically competent conformation, with a preference for serine residues in peptide acceptors and a requirement for a small amino acid following the modified serine (Briggs2018Structural). XYLT1 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its structural and functional properties (Briggs2018Structural).

## Function
Xylosyltransferase 1 (XYLT1) is a crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are vital components of the extracellular matrix. In healthy human cells, XYLT1 initiates the formation of GAG chains by transferring xylose from UDP-xylose to specific serine residues on proteoglycan core proteins. This process is essential for the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, and dermatan sulfate, which play significant roles in cell signaling, growth, and migration (Briggs2018Structural; Götting2000Molecular).

XYLT1 is predominantly active in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the proper assembly of proteoglycans, impacting cellular communication and structural integrity (Schreml2013The). The enzyme is a type II transmembrane protein with a catalytic GT-A domain and a unique Xylo_C domain, which contribute to its function in GAG biosynthesis (Briggs2018Structural). The specificity of XYLT1 for UDP-xylose as a donor is stringent, while its specificity for peptide acceptors is more relaxed, with a preference for serine residues (Briggs2018Structural).

Mutations in the XYLT1 gene can lead to skeletal abnormalities, highlighting its importance in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues (Briggs2018Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the XYLT1 gene are associated with several genetic disorders, primarily affecting skeletal development. Desbuquois dysplasia type 2 (DBQD2) is a severe skeletal disorder characterized by short stature, joint laxity, and advanced ossification, caused by mutations in XYLT1. These mutations lead to a reduction in proteoglycan synthesis, crucial for normal skeletal development (Bui2014XYLT1). DBQD2 is distinct from type 1, which involves hand abnormalities and is caused by CANT1 mutations (Rajabi2022Novel).

Another condition linked to XYLT1 mutations is an autosomal recessive short stature syndrome, characterized by short stature, intellectual disability, and distinct facial features. This syndrome is caused by a hypofunctional mutation in XYLT1, leading to altered dermatan sulfate proteoglycan synthesis and mislocalization of the XT1 protein in fibroblasts (Schreml2013The).

Baratela-Scott syndrome, also associated with XYLT1 mutations, presents with short stature, skeletal abnormalities, and facial features. This syndrome can result from homozygous mutations in XYLT1 or hypermethylation of exon 1 due to a GGC repeat expansion in the promoter region (Mizumoto2021Congenital). These conditions highlight the critical role of XYLT1 in skeletal and connective tissue integrity.

## Interactions
XYLT1, or xylosyltransferase 1, is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and interacts with various proteins essential for proteoglycan assembly. It plays a crucial role in the initial step of GAG chain synthesis by transferring xylose to serine residues on proteoglycan core proteins. This process is vital for the formation of the extracellular matrix (Bui2014XYLT1).

XYLT1 is known to interact with enzymes involved in the assembly of the common linker region of proteoglycans, such as GalT-I, GalT-II, and GlcAT-I. These interactions are essential for the synthesis of chondroitin-sulfate/dermatan-sulfate and heparan-sulfate/heparin chains (Bui2014XYLT1). The enzyme's activity is also influenced by its structural domains, including the glycosyltransferase family 14 domain and the xylosyltransferase domain, which are crucial for its function in proteoglycan biosynthesis (Bui2014XYLT1).

The Xylo_C domain of XT1, although not directly involved in catalysis, may assist in recruiting other enzymes necessary for subsequent steps in GAG biosynthesis, suggesting a role in forming multiprotein complexes (Briggs2018Structural). These interactions highlight the importance of XYLT1 in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix.
