# TCN2

## Overview
The TCN2 gene encodes the protein transcobalamin II (TC II), a crucial transporter of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) in the human body. This protein is categorized as a transport protein and is essential for the delivery of vitamin B12 to cells, where it plays a vital role in metabolic processes such as DNA synthesis and red blood cell formation. The TCN2 gene is located on chromosome 22q12-13 and exhibits genetic variability, which can influence the efficiency of vitamin B12 transport. Transcobalamin II interacts with the CD320 receptor on cell surfaces, facilitating the uptake of vitamin B12 through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Mutations in the TCN2 gene can lead to transcobalamin deficiency, a condition characterized by impaired vitamin B12 transport and associated clinical manifestations, including megaloblastic anemia and neurological abnormalities (Quadros2013Cellular; Banerjee2009The; Castro2010The).

## Structure
The TCN2 gene encodes the protein transcobalamin II (TC II), which is involved in the transport of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) in the bloodstream. The primary structure of TC II includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains. The protein is composed of two main domains, α and β, connected by a flexible linker. The N-terminal α-domain consists of twelve α-helices, while the C-terminal β-domain comprises a five and a three-stranded β-sheet and one α-helix (furger2012structural).

The tertiary structure of TC II is stabilized by three disulfide bonds formed by six conserved cysteine residues: C3-C249, C98-C291, and C147-C187. These disulfide bonds are crucial for the protein's stability and function, with C98-C291 and C147-C187 being particularly important for maintaining structural integrity and cobalamin binding (Kalra2003Function). The protein does not undergo post-translational modifications other than disulfide bond formation (Kalra2003Function).

TC II binds cobalamin with high affinity, capturing it at the interface of its domains through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The binding occurs in the 'base-on' state, with the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole moiety coordinated to the cobalt ion (furger2012structural).

## Function
The TCN2 gene encodes the protein transcobalamin II (TC), which plays a crucial role in the transport of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) within the human body. This protein binds vitamin B12 and facilitates its delivery to cells, where it is essential for various metabolic processes. Vitamin B12 acts as a coenzyme in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine and the isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, both of which are vital for DNA synthesis and red blood cell formation (Castro2010The).

Transcobalamin II binds cobalamin in the bloodstream and forms a complex with the transcobalamin receptor (TCR) on cell surfaces. This complex is internalized into cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, where transcobalamin II is degraded in lysosomes, releasing vitamin B12 for cellular use (Banerjee2009The). The TCN2 gene is located on chromosome 22q12-13 and exhibits genetic variability, including the common c.776C>G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which affects the levels of holotranscobalamin, the active form of vitamin B12 delivered to tissues (Castro2010The).

The function of TCN2 is significant because it influences the binding characteristics of vitamin B12 to transcobalamin II and the recognition of the holo-transcobalamin complex by cellular receptors, impacting vitamin B12's intracellular availability (Castro2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TCN2 gene, which encodes the transcobalamin II protein, are associated with transcobalamin deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition results in impaired transport of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) into cells, leading to intracellular cobalamin depletion. Clinical manifestations include megaloblastic anemia, pancytopenia, diarrhea, failure to thrive, and neurological abnormalities if treatment is delayed (Zhan2020Identification; Luo2022Case). The deficiency can also cause immunodeficiency and increased susceptibility to infections due to hypogammaglobulinemia (Luo2022Case).

Various mutations in the TCN2 gene, such as deletions, missense, and nonsense mutations, have been identified as causes of this deficiency. These mutations can lead to the production of truncated or non-functional transcobalamin proteins, resulting in elevated homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels (Yildirim2017Seven; Martino2021Longterm). Early diagnosis and treatment with vitamin B12, typically through intramuscular injections, are crucial for managing the condition and preventing long-term complications (Yildirim2017Seven; Pongphitcha2022A). Despite treatment, some patients may experience persistent neurological deficits (Yildirim2017Seven).

## Interactions
Transcobalamin 2 (TCN2) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the transport of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) into cells. It interacts with the CD320 receptor on cell surfaces, facilitating the cellular uptake of the vitamin B12-transcobalamin complex through receptor-mediated endocytosis (Quadros2013Cellular; Bloch2017Structure). This interaction is essential for vitamin B12 metabolism and cellular function.

The structure of TCN2 includes specific domains that are involved in its binding interactions. The beta domain of transcobalamin, for instance, has been studied in various substrate-bound states to understand its interaction with cobalamin and other ligands (Bloch2017Structure). The assembly of the holo-transcobalamin complex is dependent on the presence of cobalamin, which facilitates the interaction between the alpha and beta domains of the protein (Bloch2017Structure).

Mutations in the TCN2 gene can affect these interactions. For example, a novel mutation, c.855T > A, results in an amino acid substitution that alters the conformation of a cavity in the TC protein, impacting its interaction with cobalamin and potentially leading to false low holotranscobalamin levels in diagnostic assays (Keller2016False).
