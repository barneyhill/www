# LMO4

## Overview
LMO4 (LIM domain only 4) is a gene that encodes a transcriptional regulator protein characterized by the presence of two LIM domains, which are zinc finger-like structures facilitating protein-protein interactions. The LMO4 protein does not bind DNA directly but acts as a molecular adaptor, forming complexes with other proteins to influence transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. It plays a significant role in calcium-dependent transcription in neurons, contributing to synaptic activity and plasticity, and is involved in the patterning of thalamocortical connections in the developing cortex. Additionally, LMO4 is implicated in various cancers, including breast and lung cancer, where it is often overexpressed, suggesting a role in oncogenesis through its interactions with tumor suppressors like BRCA1 (Holik2015The; Kashani2006Calcium; Sutherland2003Mutational).

## Structure
LMO4 is a protein characterized by the presence of two LIM domains, which are zinc finger-like structures that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Zheng2007The). These LIM domains are crucial for the protein's function as they allow LMO4 to form complexes with other proteins, such as BRCA1, CtIP, and LDB1, influencing transcriptional regulation and cellular processes (Mizunuma2003The; Zheng2007The). The LIM domains are typically 50-60 amino acids long and contain two zinc finger motifs, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure (Zheng2007The).

LMO4 lacks a DNA-binding domain, which means it functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator through its interactions with other proteins (Deng2006Differential). The protein is involved in forming multimeric transcription regulatory complexes, often competing with other LIM domain proteins for binding to cofactors like Ldb/NLI (Deng2006Differential).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, affecting LMO4's function and interactions. Additionally, alternative splicing can result in different isoforms of LMO4, potentially altering its interaction capabilities and functional roles. However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures beyond the LIM domains are not provided in the available context.

## Function
LMO4 (LIM domain only 4) is a transcriptional regulator that plays a significant role in calcium-dependent transcription in neurons. It is activated by calcium influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs) and NMDA receptors (NMDARs), which are essential for synaptic activity and plasticity. LMO4 interacts with the transcription factor CREB and coactivators CLIM1 and CLIM2, forming a complex necessary for calcium-dependent transcriptional activation, highlighting its role in neuronal gene expression and synaptic plasticity (Kashani2006Calcium).

In the developing cortex, LMO4 is crucial for calcium-dependent transcriptional regulation, with its activity being dependent on the integrity of its LIM domains. These domains facilitate interactions with other proteins, influencing transcriptional activity (Kashani2006Calcium). LMO4 is also involved in the patterning of thalamocortical connections, contributing to the organization of cortical structures (Kashani2006Calcium).

In lung epithelial cells, LMO4 contributes to cell proliferation and repair following injury, although it is not essential for normal lung development or function. It interacts with Smad proteins to enhance TGFβ signaling, indicating its role in modulating epithelial cell growth (Holik2015The).

## Clinical Significance
The LMO4 gene is implicated in several cancers due to its role in transcriptional regulation and protein interactions. In breast cancer, LMO4 is overexpressed in more than 50% of sporadic cases, suggesting a significant role in oncogenesis. It interacts with the tumor suppressor BRCA1, repressing its transcriptional activity, which may contribute to cancer progression (Sutherland2003Mutational). Although somatic mutations in LMO4 are rare, a truncation mutation has been identified in a breast cancer case, indicating that overexpression rather than mutation is a common mechanism of deregulation (Lewis2005Mutation).

LMO4 is also overexpressed in oral squamous cell carcinomas and is associated with several other malignancies, including pancreatic, non-small cell lung, and head and neck cancers (Xue2021Research). In lung cancer, LMO4 is highly expressed in squamous cell carcinoma compared to adenocarcinoma, suggesting a role in early-stage pathology (Holik2015The). In papillary thyroid carcinoma, LMO4 expression is regulated by circ_0058124 and miR-370-3p, influencing tumor progression (Liu2020&lt; p&gt; Circ0058124). These findings highlight LMO4's involvement in various cancers through altered expression and interactions.

## Interactions
LMO4 (LIM domain only 4) is a transcriptional regulator that participates in various protein-protein interactions, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It does not bind DNA directly but interacts with other DNA-binding proteins through its LIM domains, facilitating chromatin interactions (Joseph2014The). LMO4 interacts with the transcription factor DEAF1, LIM domain binding protein 1 (LDB1), and C-terminal binding protein interacting protein (CtIP/RBBP8) (Joseph2014The). The interaction with DEAF1 is particularly notable, as DEAF1 binds to both LIM domains of LMO4, with a preference for the LIM2 domain (Joseph2014The). This interaction is mediated by hydrophobic interactions and a salt bridge, with DEAF1 adopting an extended conformation upon binding (Joseph2014The).

LMO4 also interacts with the breast/ovarian tumor suppressor BRCA1, forming a multiprotein complex with CtIP in breast epithelium (Sutherland2003Mutational). This complex is involved in transcriptional regulation, where LMO4 acts as a molecular adaptor, providing a scaffold for protein-protein interactions (Sutherland2003Mutational). The interaction with BRCA1 is mediated by the C-terminal BRCT motifs of BRCA1, which are crucial for its tumor suppressor function (Sutherland2003Mutational).
