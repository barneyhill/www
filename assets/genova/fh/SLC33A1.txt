# SLC33A1

## Overview
The SLC33A1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 33 member 1, also known as the acetyl-CoA transporter AT-1, which is a critical component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein is categorized as a multiple transmembrane transporter, featuring 11 or 12 transmembrane domains, and is essential for the transport of acetyl-CoA into the ER lumen (Hirabayashi2013The). The acetyl-CoA transporter plays a pivotal role in Nε-lysine acetylation, a post-translational modification necessary for protein homeostasis and autophagy (Farrugia2018Nεlysine). Mutations in SLC33A1 have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Huppke-Brendel syndrome and hereditary spastic paraplegia type 42, underscoring its importance in cellular function and human health (Mao2015Identification; Huppke2012Mutations).

## Structure
The SLC33A1 gene encodes the acetyl-CoA transporter protein, which is a multiple transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Hirabayashi2013The). The protein is predicted to have 11 or 12 transmembrane spanning domains, as suggested by the TMHMM and SOSUI programs (Hirabayashi2013The). It contains a leucine zipper motif in transmembrane domain III, which is significant for its structural integrity (Lin2008A). The protein consists of 549 amino acids and is tightly membrane-bound, making it unstable and challenging to purify (Hirabayashi2013The).

A missense mutation, c.339T/G, in exon 1 of SLC33A1 results in a serine to arginine substitution at codon 113 (p. S113R), which disrupts the second transmembrane domain and alters the orientation of subsequent domains, likely rendering the protein nonfunctional (Lin2008A). This mutation affects the protein's topology and potentially its function as an acetyl-CoA transporter (Lin2008A). The S113 residue is highly conserved among vertebrates, indicating its importance in the protein's function (Lin2008A). The protein's localization to the ER membrane has been confirmed through immunofluorescence analysis (Hirabayashi2013The).

## Function
The SLC33A1 gene encodes the acetyl-CoA transporter AT-1, which is essential for transporting acetyl-CoA into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in healthy human cells. This transport is crucial for Nε-lysine acetylation, a post-translational modification that plays a significant role in maintaining protein homeostasis and autophagy (Dieterich2021AcetylCoA; Farrugia2018Nεlysine). The acetyl-CoA transported by AT-1 is utilized by ER-resident lysine acetyltransferases, ATase1 and ATase2, to acetylate proteins within the ER. This process is vital for the stability and trafficking of nascent polypeptides, such as the β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme (BACE1) (Farrugia2018Nεlysine).

AT-1's function is necessary for the organization and engagement of the secretory pathway, affecting the trafficking of proteins from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and the modification of N-glycans (Dieterich2021AcetylCoA). Proper functioning of AT-1 ensures the efficient operation of the secretory pathway and the maintenance of cellular structures like the ER, ERGIC, and Golgi apparatus (Dieterich2021AcetylCoA). In healthy cells, AT-1 is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing neurodegenerative conditions (Farrugia2018Nεlysine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC33A1 gene are associated with several distinct clinical conditions. One such condition is Huppke-Brendel syndrome, a lethal autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by congenital cataracts, hearing loss, severe developmental delay, and low serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels. Patients with this syndrome often experience severe psychomotor retardation and premature death, with MRI findings indicating cerebellar hypoplasia and hypomyelination (Šikić2022Abnormal; Huppke2012Mutations).

Another condition linked to SLC33A1 mutations is hereditary spastic paraplegia type 42 (SPG42), an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. The p.Ser113Arg variant in SLC33A1 is implicated in SPG42, acting in a dominant-negative manner and disrupting normal BMP signaling, which is upregulated in this condition (Mao2015Identification; Lin2008A; Liu2016S113R).

These mutations in SLC33A1 lead to functional impairments in the acetyl-CoA transporter, affecting protein acetylation processes crucial for normal cellular function. The gene's role in copper metabolism and neurodegenerative processes highlights its clinical significance in these disorders (Mao2015Identification; Šikić2022Abnormal).

## Interactions
SLC33A1, also known as AT-1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It plays a role in the regulation of autophagy through interactions with the IRE1/XBP1 pathway. This interaction is significant in the context of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses, where SLC33A1 is implicated in maintaining ER homeostasis by modulating autophagy (Pehar2012SLC33A1AT1).

In the context of lung adenocarcinomas with Keap1 mutations, SLC33A1 is part of a co-essential gene cluster with NRF2, SUCO, and TAPT1, all associated with endomembrane functions. This suggests that SLC33A1 interacts closely with these genes, particularly in pathways involving ER oxidation and protein folding (Romero2020Keap1). The dependency of Keap1-mutant cells on SLC33A1 can be alleviated by the loss of certain genes involved in the integrated stress response network, such as Ero1l, P4hb, Serp1, and Yipf5, indicating potential interactions with these genes in managing ER stress (Romero2020Keap1).

Increased expression of SLC33A1 in mice has been linked to changes in the acetylation profile of ER proteins, affecting synaptic plasticity and neuronal structure. This suggests interactions with proteins involved in synaptic processes, potentially influencing protein synthesis and synaptic activity (Hullinger2016Increased).
