# FAM168A

## Overview
FAM168A is a gene that encodes the protein family with sequence similarity 168 member A, also known as tongue cancer resistance-associated protein (TCRP1). This protein is involved in various cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the context of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and inflammatory conditions. FAM168A interacts with key proteins such as BCR-ABL1 and AKT1, playing a regulatory role in the BCR-ABL1/AKT1/NFκB signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Liu2019FAM168A). The protein's involvement in these pathways suggests its potential as a therapeutic target, particularly in CML, where it has been shown to affect phosphorylation events and protein levels that are critical for disease progression (Liu2019FAM168A; Sahoo2022Differential).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
FAM168A has been implicated in the development of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) through its interaction with the BCR-ABL1/AKT1/NFκB signaling pathway. Studies have shown that FAM168A expression is significantly higher in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CML patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting its involvement in CML pathogenesis (Liu2019FAM168A). Interference with FAM168A in CML cell lines results in decreased phosphorylation of AKT1, increased levels of IκB-α, and reduced nuclear NFκB protein levels, indicating its role in cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways critical to CML (Liu2019FAM168A).

In a mouse model, interference with FAM168A prolonged survival and reduced tumor formation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for CML (Liu2019FAM168A). Clinical specimens from CML patients showed increased levels of phosphorylated AKT1 and decreased levels of IκB-α and Cyclin B1, supporting the involvement of FAM168A in the AKT1/NFκB signaling pathway and cell cycle regulation (Liu2019FAM168A).

FAM168A is also involved in inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where it operates via the PI3K/AKT/NFKB signaling pathway to protect cells against apoptosis (Sahoo2022Differential).

## Interactions
FAM168A, also known as tongue cancer resistance-associated protein (TCRP1), is involved in significant protein interactions that play a role in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It directly interacts with the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein and AKT1, which are crucial components of the BCR-ABL1/AKT1/NFκB signaling pathway. This interaction was confirmed through immunoprecipitation techniques, where BCR-ABL1 and AKT1 were detected in the immunoprecipitate using a FAM168A antibody, and FAM168A was detected using antibodies against c-ABL1 and AKT1 (Liu2019FAM168A).

FAM168A does not alter the expression levels of AKT1 but significantly decreases its phosphorylation, which is a critical step in the signaling pathway. This interaction also leads to increased levels of IκB-α and reduced nuclear NFκB protein levels, indicating its regulatory role in the pathway (Liu2019FAM168A). Bioinformatics analysis suggests that FAM168A may physically interact with ABL1 kinase, as it contains multiple ABL1 kinase and ABL1 SH3 motifs, further supporting its involvement in the signaling pathway (Liu2019FAM168A). These interactions highlight FAM168A's potential as a therapeutic target in CML.
