# KRT2

## Overview
Keratin 2 (KRT2) is a gene that encodes a type II cytokeratin protein, which is integral to the structural framework of epithelial cells. The protein, keratin 2, is predominantly expressed in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis, where it forms heterodimers with type I keratins, such as keratin 10, to create intermediate filaments. These filaments are essential for maintaining the mechanical resilience and integrity of the skin, particularly in areas subjected to mechanical stress, such as the palms and soles (Fischer2014Loss; Fischer2016Keratins). Mutations in the KRT2 gene are linked to skin disorders like Ichthyosis Bullosa of Siemens and Superficial Epidermolytic Ichthyosis, which are characterized by epidermal fragility and hyperkeratosis (Diociaiuti2020First; Chamcheu2011Keratin). The study of KRT2 and its encoded protein is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying skin barrier function and related pathologies.

## Structure
Keratin 2 (KRT2) is a type II cytokeratin that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells. The primary structure of KRT2 consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This rod domain is organized in a heptad repeat pattern, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers, which are essential for the protein's function (Ho2022Update).

The secondary structure of KRT2 is characterized by these coiled-coil motifs, which are critical for the dimerization process. The tertiary structure involves the assembly of these dimers into intermediate filaments, providing mechanical strength to the cells. The quaternary structure of KRT2 includes heterodimerization with type I keratins, forming antiparallel tetramers that serve as the basic building blocks for higher-order filament assembly (Ho2022Update).

KRT2 undergoes common post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can impact its function and interactions within the cell (Knöbel2015Keratins). These modifications are important for the regulation of keratin's structural and non-mechanical roles, including cell growth and migration.

## Function
Keratin 2 (KRT2) is a type II cytokeratin that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of the epidermis. It is primarily expressed in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis, where it forms heterodimers with type I keratin K10. This interaction is essential for the formation of intermediate filaments, which provide mechanical support and contribute to the skin's barrier function (Fischer2014Loss).

KRT2 is particularly abundant in areas of the skin that are subject to mechanical stress, such as palmoplantar regions. Its expression in these areas suggests a role in enhancing the epidermis's ability to withstand physical stress (Fischer2014Loss). The absence of KRT2 leads to the aggregation of K10, resulting in hyperkeratosis and inflammation, indicating its importance in maintaining normal epidermal morphology and preventing skin disorders (Fischer2014Loss).

In addition to its structural role, KRT2 is involved in keratinocyte differentiation. Its absence results in altered keratinocyte differentiation and increased expression of other keratins, such as K1 and K16, as a compensatory mechanism, although this is insufficient to maintain normal epidermal stratification (Fischer2016Keratins).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT2 gene are associated with several skin disorders, primarily Ichthyosis Bullosa of Siemens (IBS) and Superficial Epidermolytic Ichthyosis (SEI). IBS is an autosomal dominant keratinization disorder characterized by superficial epidermal fragility, desquamation, and localized hyperkeratosis, often in flexural areas. It is caused by mutations in the KRT2 gene, particularly in the helix termination motif (HTM) and the 1A and 2B domains, with p.Glu487Lys identified as a mutational hotspot (Kremer1994Ichthyosis; BASARAB1999Ichthyosis; Chamcheu2011Keratin). SEI, previously known as IBS, is also linked to KRT2 mutations, presenting with mild epidermal hyperkeratosis and superficial blistering. The p.Glu487Lys mutation is recurrent in SEI cases, indicating its significance in the disease's pathogenesis (Diociaiuti2020First; Suzuki2022Deep).

These mutations disrupt the structural integrity of keratin filaments, leading to the clinical manifestations observed in these conditions. The genetic variability and clinical spectrum associated with KRT2 mutations highlight the importance of molecular analysis for accurate diagnosis and differentiation from similar disorders like Epidermolytic Ichthyosis (Diociaiuti2020First; Chamcheu2011Keratin).

## Interactions
Keratin 2 (KRT2) is a type II cytokeratin that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells by forming intermediate filaments. KRT2 primarily interacts with keratin 10 (KRT10) to form heterodimers in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis, contributing to a resilient cytoskeleton in regions such as the soles of mice (Fischer2016Keratins). In the absence of KRT2 and KRT10, other keratins like K1 and K16 are upregulated and may form compensatory heterodimers, although they do not fully replicate the function of KRT2 and KRT10 (Fischer2016Keratins).

KRT2 does not have a retinoic acid response element, indicating that its regulation by retinoids is likely indirect, possibly involving interactions with signaling pathways such as AP-1 and NFκB (Törmä2011Regulation). The absence of KRT2, along with KRT10, leads to significant epidermal abnormalities, suggesting that these keratins have a synergistic role in maintaining epidermal integrity (Fischer2016Keratins). While specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, KRT2's role in forming intermediate filaments suggests potential interactions with proteins involved in skin barrier function and keratinocyte differentiation.
