# DNAJB1

## Overview
DNAJB1 is a gene that encodes the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B1, a molecular chaperone involved in various cellular processes, including protein folding, degradation, and stress response. As a member of the Hsp40 family, the protein plays a critical role as a co-chaperone to Hsp70, enhancing its ATPase activity and facilitating the maintenance of protein homeostasis. DNAJB1 is characterized by its J-domain, which is essential for protein-protein interactions, and a G/F-rich domain that contributes to its chaperone activity. The protein is implicated in the regulation of immune responses and viral replication, highlighting its diverse functional roles within the cell (Batra2016Human; Takashima2017DNAJB1HSP40). Clinically, DNAJB1 is significant due to its involvement in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) through the formation of a fusion gene with PRKACA, which is a key event in the pathogenesis of this rare liver cancer (Graham2015DNAJB1PRKACA; Kastenhuber2017DNAJB1–PRKACA).

## Structure
DNAJB1 is a member of the Hsp40 family, characterized by its J-domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions. The primary structure of DNAJB1 includes a conserved histidine-proline-aspartate (HPD) motif, which is essential for its function (Ayala2022Identification). The secondary structure of DNAJB1 typically features alpha helices, as seen in the J-domain, which forms four helices with the terminal helix contiguous with the A-helix (Lu2020Structural).

The tertiary structure of DNAJB1 involves the J-domain and a C-terminal domain, which are important for its chaperone activity. The J-domain is involved in binding to the regulatory subunit of PKA in the DnaJB1-PKAc fusion protein, highlighting its role in structural dynamics and flexibility (Lu2020Structural). DNAJB1 can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure that may serve as a storage form, disassembling upon activation (Ayala2022Identification).

DNAJB1 contains specific domains such as the G/F-rich domain, which is critical for its activity in suppressing HTTExon1Q 48 aggregation (Ayala2022Identification). The protein also features a huntingtin binding motif (HBM) located in the hinge region between its C-terminal domains, crucial for its interaction with HTT (Ayala2022Identification). The presence of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, is common in proteins of this family, although specific modifications for DNAJB1 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
DNAJB1, a member of the Hsp40 family, functions as a co-chaperone to Hsp70 proteins, playing a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular health. It assists in protein folding, prevents aggregation, and facilitates the degradation of misfolded proteins, which is essential for cellular stress responses (Dilliott2022DnaJC7; Takashima2017DNAJB1HSP40). DNAJB1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other proteins to modulate their functions. For instance, it negatively regulates the MDA5-MAVS signaling pathway, which is crucial for antiviral defense, by disrupting the formation of MDA5 multimers. This action results in the attenuation of type I interferon induction, preventing excessive immune responses that could lead to inflammation or autoimmune conditions (Takashima2017DNAJB1HSP40).

In addition to its role in immune regulation, DNAJB1 is involved in the nuclear import of viral ribonucleoproteins, facilitating efficient viral replication. This function highlights its broader role in cellular processes beyond stress response, as it also participates in protein translation, folding, degradation, and intracellular trafficking (Batra2016Human). DNAJB1's interaction with Hsp70 enhances the latter's ATPase activity, which is vital for the chaperone's function in protein folding and maintenance (Takashima2017DNAJB1HSP40).

## Clinical Significance
The DNAJB1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC), a rare type of liver cancer. This condition is characterized by the presence of a DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion gene, resulting from a recurrent somatic intrachromosomal deletion on chromosome 19. This fusion leads to the production of a chimeric protein with upregulated protein kinase activity, which plays a crucial role in the tumorigenesis of FL-HCC (Graham2015DNAJB1PRKACA; Kastenhuber2017DNAJB1–PRKACA). The DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion is considered a defining genetic event in FL-HCC and is highly specific to this cancer type, not found in other primary liver carcinomas (Graham2015DNAJB1PRKACA; Graham2018Molecular).

Recent studies have also identified DNAJB1-PRKACA fusions in oncocytic pancreatic and biliary neoplasms, suggesting that this fusion is not exclusive to FL-HCC and may occur in other neoplasms with oncocytic features (Vyas2020DNAJB1PRKACA). These findings indicate a potential shared oncogenic mechanism between these neoplasms and FL-HCC, with implications for targeted therapeutic strategies (Vyas2020DNAJB1PRKACA).

## Interactions
DNAJB1, a member of the Hsp40 family, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a co-chaperone. It interacts with the Huntingtin protein (HTT), specifically binding to the proline-rich domain (PRD) of HTTExon1, particularly the second proline stretch (P2). This interaction is essential for suppressing and disaggregating HTT aggregates, with the histidine residue at position 244 (H244) in DNAJB1 playing a critical role in this process (Ayala2022Identification). DNAJB1 forms a trimeric chaperone complex with Hsc70 and Apg2, facilitating the suppression and reversal of HTT aggregation (Ayala2022Identification).

DNAJB1 also interacts with melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), playing a role in antiviral signaling pathways. It colocalizes with MDA5 in the cytoplasm and inhibits MDA5- and MAVS-mediated induction of interferon-beta (IFN-β) (Takashima2017DNAJB1HSP40). The interaction between DNAJB1 and HSP70 is crucial for regulating MDA5 multimer formation and function, as the DNAJB1-HSP70 complex negatively regulates the MDA5-MAVS pathway (Takashima2017DNAJB1HSP40).
