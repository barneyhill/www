# ACACB

## Overview
The ACACB gene encodes the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta (ACC2), which is a crucial regulator of fatty acid metabolism. As a carboxylase, ACC2 catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, a key step in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation and synthesis. This enzyme is predominantly located near the mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a significant role in determining the balance between fatty acid storage and oxidation, particularly in the liver. The activity of ACC2 is modulated by various factors, including phosphorylation by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which inhibits its function, thereby influencing energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism (Maeda2010A; Im2009Sterol). The gene's expression is regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, with SREBP-1a being a more potent activator than SREBP-1c (Im2009Sterol). Given its central role in metabolic pathways, ACACB is implicated in several metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, highlighting its clinical significance (Maeda2010A; Riancho2011Association).

## Structure


## Function
The ACACB gene encodes acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta (ACC2), an enzyme that plays a critical role in fatty acid metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. This reaction is crucial for regulating fatty acid oxidation, as malonyl-CoA inhibits carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT-1), the enzyme responsible for transporting long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation (Maeda2010A; Im2009Sterol). ACC2 is primarily active near the mitochondrial membrane, where it influences the balance between fatty acid storage and oxidation, particularly in the liver (Im2009Sterol).

In healthy human cells, ACC2 is involved in determining whether fatty acids are stored as triglycerides or oxidized in mitochondria, a decision that is especially important during fasting when fatty acids are mobilized from adipose tissue to the liver (Im2009Sterol). The expression of ACC2 is regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1a (SREBP-1a), which is more effective than SREBP-1c in activating ACC2 due to its stronger interaction with coactivators (Im2009Sterol). This regulation is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism in cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the ACACB gene have been associated with several metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and diabetic nephropathy. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2268388 within the ACACB gene has been linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes. The T allele of this SNP is associated with higher enhancer activity, potentially leading to increased expression of the gene, which may contribute to the development of proteinuria and diabetic nephropathy (Maeda2010A).

In various populations, the T allele of rs2268388 has been found to be more frequent among individuals with type 2 diabetes and proteinuria, suggesting a role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy (Maeda2010A). The ACACB gene is also implicated in obesity, with the T allele being more prevalent in women with severe obesity (Riancho2011Association). Additionally, the gene's involvement in fatty acid metabolism suggests that its dysregulation can lead to insulin resistance, a precursor for type 2 diabetes (Zain2017Association). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ACACB gene mutations in metabolic diseases.

## Interactions
ACACB (acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta) is involved in fatty acid metabolism and interacts with various proteins that regulate its activity. One significant interaction is with AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), which phosphorylates and inhibits ACACB, thereby playing a crucial role in regulating energy balance and lipid metabolism. This phosphorylation event is a key mechanism by which AMPK exerts its effects on metabolic pathways, particularly under conditions of energy stress.

The study by Shao et al. identified ACACB as a direct molecular target of the environmental pollutant perfluorooctanoate (PFOA). PFOA binding to ACACB was shown to decrease the protein's labeling and abundance, suggesting a direct interaction that affects its function. This interaction was confirmed through thermal shift assays, which demonstrated increased thermal stability of ACACB upon PFOA binding. The binding of PFOA to ACACB is associated with alterations in fatty acid metabolism, including decreased malonyl-CoA levels and increased acetyl-CoA levels, indicating a disruption in fatty acid synthesis and an increase in fatty acid oxidation (Shao2018Integrative).

These interactions highlight the role of ACACB in metabolic regulation and its potential involvement in environmental pollutant-induced toxicity.
