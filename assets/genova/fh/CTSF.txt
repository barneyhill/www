# CTSF

## Overview
CTSF is a gene that encodes the protein cathepsin F, a lysosomal cysteine protease involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation and immune response regulation. As a member of the cysteine protease family, cathepsin F is characterized by its papain-like fold and catalytic triad, which are essential for its proteolytic activity (Zdravkova2024Unveiling; Gao2017The). The protein is primarily localized in the lysosomes, where it plays a crucial role in the breakdown of proteins into peptides and amino acids, contributing to cellular protein turnover and antigen presentation (Zdravkova2024Unveiling; Shi2000Role). Cathepsin F is particularly significant in the immune system, where it facilitates the maturation and peptide loading of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, thus playing a vital role in adaptive immunity (Turk2012Cysteine; Shi2000Role). The expression and activity of CTSF are regulated by various factors, and its dysregulation has been implicated in diseases such as type B Kufs disease and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Zdravkova2024Unveiling; Ketterer2017Inherited).

## Structure
The CTSF gene encodes a polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 53 kDa, consisting of 484 amino acids and featuring five N-glycosylation sites (Zdravkova2024Unveiling). The primary structure includes an N-terminal segment that resembles cysteine protease inhibitors (Zdravkova2024Unveiling). The secondary structure of CTSF comprises 10 β-sheets, 2 beta hairpins, 8 strands, 9 α-helices, 17 beta turns, and 2 γ-turns (Gao2017The). The tertiary structure forms a papain-like fold, which is common among cysteine proteases, and includes three disulfide bonds that are conserved among these enzymes (Zdravkova2024Unveiling; Gao2017The). 

CTSF contains several functional domains, including the CY domain, Inhibitor_I29 domain, and Pept_C1 domains, which are characteristic of cysteine proteases (Gao2017The). The active site of CTSF includes conserved cysteine, histidine, and asparagine residues, forming a catalytic triad essential for its proteolytic activity (Gao2017The). The protein is delivered to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment through glycosylation recognized by the mannose-6-phosphate receptor, which mediates its targeting to lysosomes (Zdravkova2024Unveiling).

## Function
Cathepsin F (CTSF) is a lysosomal cysteine protease involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, CTSF plays a significant role in protein degradation and processing within the lysosome, contributing to cellular protein turnover. It is involved in the breakdown of proteins into peptides and amino acids, which are then recycled or presented on the cell surface for immune surveillance (Zdravkova2024Unveiling).

CTSF is particularly important in the context of antigen presentation. It participates in the degradation of the invariant chain (Ii) associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, facilitating the generation of class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP). This process is crucial for the maturation and peptide loading of MHC class II molecules, which are essential for the presentation of antigens to CD4+ T cells, thereby playing a vital role in adaptive immunity (Turk2012Cysteine; Shi2000Role).

CTSF is expressed in various tissues, with notable activity in macrophages, where it contributes to immune response regulation by modulating antigen processing and presentation (Shi2000Role). Its activity is regulated by factors such as pH and the presence of specific inhibitors, which influence its proteolytic functions (Shi2000Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CTSF gene have been implicated in several diseases. In type B Kufs disease, an adult-onset form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN), mutations in the CTSF gene, including missense and frameshift mutations, lead to symptoms such as mental and motor deterioration. These mutations are thought to impair gene activity due to conformational changes in the protein structure, although this has not been confirmed in vitro or in vivo (Ketterer2017Inherited).

In cancer, CTSF expression levels are associated with tumor progression and prognosis. In gastric cancer, lower expression of CTSF mRNA is linked to increased proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and enhanced tumor invasion and metastasis. Upregulating CTSF can suppress these malignant behaviors (Zdravkova2024Unveiling). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CTSF is downregulated in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and higher expression is associated with better overall survival, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Song2021Expression).

CTSF is also involved in immune responses in NSCLC, where its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and is associated with various immune markers and immunomodulators (Song2021Expression). In pre-eclampsia, CTSF is downregulated in placental tissues, indicating a potential link between altered CTSF expression and the condition (Varanou2006The).

## Interactions
Cathepsin F (CTSF) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in immune response and cancer biology. CTSF interacts with several proteins involved in antigen processing and presentation, particularly through the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II pathway. It has been shown to interact with HLA class II subunits and CD74, which are crucial for antigen processing and presentation (Song2021Expression). These interactions suggest that CTSF may contribute to the regulation of immune responses by facilitating the degradation of the MHC class II-associated invariant chain, a process essential for MHC class II maturation and peptide loading (Zdravkova2024Unveiling).

In addition to its role in immune regulation, CTSF is involved in proteolytic reactions that mediate interactions between immune and cancer cells. It is expressed in monocyte-derived macrophages and contributes to extracellular matrix remodeling, which is important for immune cell infiltration and tumor microenvironment modulation (Zdravkova2024Unveiling). The protein-protein interaction network analysis using STRING has identified CTSF's interactions with other proteins, highlighting its functional similarity with 20 other genes, which further underscores its involvement in complex cellular processes (Song2021Expression).
