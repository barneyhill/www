# GDF7

## Overview
GDF7, or growth differentiation factor 7, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, which is part of the larger transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. The protein encoded by GDF7 is a secreted signaling molecule that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including the differentiation of neural crest cells and osteogenic differentiation. It is particularly significant in promoting sensory neuron fate during neural development by influencing the lineage decisions of neural crest cells. Additionally, GDF7 is involved in bone regeneration and tissue differentiation, as well as the maintenance of regulatory T cells, highlighting its diverse functional roles in cellular signaling and development (Lo2005Lateemigrating; Ding2021Secretome; Zhou2021The).

## Function
GDF7, also known as growth differentiation factor 7, is a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, which is part of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. In healthy human cells, GDF7 plays a significant role in the differentiation of neural crest cells, particularly in promoting a sensory neuron fate. It is expressed in the roof plate of the neural tube, where it biases neural crest cells towards a sensory lineage, preventing them from adopting an autonomic fate. This is achieved through its unique ability to promote sensory neurogenesis, distinguishing it from other BMP family members that can induce both sensory and autonomic neurogenesis depending on their concentration (Lo2005Lateemigrating).

GDF7 is also involved in the osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs). It counteracts the suppressive effects of miR-204-5p on osteogenic differentiation, promoting the expression of osteogenic markers such as RUNX2, ALP, and OCN. This process involves the activation of the AKT and P38 signaling pathways, highlighting GDF7's role in bone regeneration and tissue differentiation (Zhou2021The). Additionally, GDF7 contributes to the maintenance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) by increasing the expression of FOXP3 and CTLA4, which are crucial for Treg stability and function (Ding2021Secretome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GDF7 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In cats, a 7 bp deletion in the GDF7 gene is associated with a heritable forebrain commissural malformation, which is concurrent with ventriculomegaly and interhemispheric cysts. This mutation results in a truncated protein, leading to significant structural brain malformations (Yu2020A). In mice, GDF7-null mutants exhibit hydrocephalus, a condition characterized by an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, which is linked to defects in choroid plexus development (Lee1998Neuronal).

In humans, polymorphisms near the GDF7 gene have been associated with an increased risk of Barrett's esophagus, a condition that can lead to esophageal adenocarcinoma. The SNP rs3072, located near GDF7, is implicated in this risk, although the exact mechanism by which it influences the condition remains unclear (Palles2015Polymorphisms). Additionally, GDF7 is involved in the osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells, where it interacts with miR-204-5p. Alterations in this interaction can affect bone formation and mineralization, suggesting a role in bone-related conditions (Zhou2021The).

## Interactions
GDF7 interacts with several proteins and receptors, primarily within the TGF-beta superfamily signaling pathways. It binds to type I receptors such as ALK3 (BMPR1A) and ALK6 (BMPR1B), and type II receptors like BMPRII and ActRIIA, forming heterotetrameric complexes that activate downstream Smad signaling pathways (Mazerbourg2005Identification). These interactions lead to the phosphorylation of Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8, which are crucial for transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus (Mazerbourg2005Identification).

In the context of liver fibrosis, GDF7 acts in an autocrine manner, binding to BMPR1A and BMPR1B on hepatocytes to promote liver progenitor cell proliferation (Kong2023Growth). In trabecular meshwork cells, GDF7 interacts with BMPR2, activating the BMPR2/Smad signaling pathway, which contributes to fibrosis and is implicated in the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma (Wan2021TETdependent).

GDF7 also interacts with microRNA miR-204-5p, where it impairs the suppressive effect of miR-204-5p on osteogenic differentiation, highlighting a regulatory interaction that influences the expression of osteogenic markers (Zhou2021The).
