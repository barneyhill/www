# MED30

## Overview
MED30 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 30, a crucial component of the Mediator complex involved in the regulation of transcription in eukaryotic cells. The Mediator complex serves as a bridge between transcriptional activators and RNA polymerase II, facilitating the initiation of transcription. MED30, specifically, is part of the Tail module of the Mediator complex, where it plays a significant role in maintaining the stability and integrity of the complex by anchoring the Head and Tail modules. This structural role is essential for the proper regulation of transcription networks, particularly in specialized cells such as cardiomyocytes, where MED30 is vital for cardiac development and function (Tan2021Mediator). Beyond its structural and functional roles, MED30 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and response to cellular stress, and is associated with several diseases, including congenital heart defects and certain cancers (Shukla2020HIF1α; Liu2020The).

## Structure
The MED30 protein is a metazoan-specific subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex, playing a crucial role in transcription regulation. Structurally, MED30 is part of the upper Tail module of the Mediator complex, where it forms a double bracket-like structure with other subunits such as MED27, MED28, and MED29. These subunits are each 180-200 amino acids long and contribute to the formation of a 6-helix bundle through interdigitating interactions, particularly between MED28 and MED30 (Zhao2021Structure). The C-terminal helices of MED28 and MED30 extend towards the Head jaws, forming a 4-helix bundle with the C-terminal helices of MED11 and MED22, stabilized by extensive hydrophobic interactions (Zhao2021Structure).

MED30's involvement in the Mediator complex is significant for maintaining the integrity and conformation of the complex, as it anchors the Head and Tail modules, influencing the stability of the Mediator core (Tan2021Mediator). Despite its structural insights, the precise role of MED30 in maintaining the Mediator complex's integrity and its interactions with other subunits remain to be fully understood (Tan2021Mediator).

## Function
MED30 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, which is essential for transcription regulation in eukaryotic cells. It functions as a bridge between transcriptional activators and RNA polymerase II, facilitating the initiation of transcription. MED30 is part of the proximal Tail module of the Mediator complex, playing a critical role in maintaining the stability of the Mediator core by anchoring the Head and Tail modules (Tan2021Mediator). This stability is crucial for the proper regulation of transcription networks, particularly in cardiomyocytes, where MED30 is vital for cardiac development and function (Tan2021Mediator).

In cardiomyocytes, MED30 is involved in regulating genes associated with muscle structure, contractility, and mitochondrial function, which are essential for maintaining normal cardiac function and development (Tan2021Mediator). The deletion of MED30 in these cells leads to significant transcriptional dysregulation, resulting in severe cardiac defects and conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy (Tan2021Mediator).

MED30's role extends beyond cardiac cells, as it is also implicated in broader cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and cell viability, by controlling a common group of genes across different developmental stages (Tan2021Mediator).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MED30 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of cardiac health, mutations in MED30 are associated with congenital heart defects, as seen in Langer-Giedion syndrome Type II and Cornelia de Lange syndrome-4. These mutations can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and postnatal lethality in mice, highlighting MED30's critical role in cardiac development and function (Tan2021Mediator). A specific mutation, the Med30 zg allele, results in a DCM phenotype in mice, affecting mitochondrial gene expression and contributing to the disease (Tan2021Mediator).

In cancer, MED30 is frequently overexpressed in pancreatic and gastric cancers, correlating with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. In pancreatic cancer, MED30 overexpression is linked to enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic target (Liu2020The). Similarly, in gastric cancer, MED30 overexpression promotes cancer cell proliferation and motility, indicating its role in cancer progression (Lee2015MED30).

In bladder cancer, MED30 expression shows a complex role, with alterations potentially serving as a predictive marker for favorable outcomes, although its exact impact on survival is not statistically significant (Unknownauthors2017TheContrastingRoleoftheMediatorSubunitMED30intheProgressionofBladderCancer).

## Interactions
MED30, a subunit of the Mediator complex, plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with various proteins and transcription factors. It is part of the head module of the Mediator complex, which is essential for transcription by RNA polymerase II, acting as a transcriptional co-activator (Shukla2020HIF1α). MED30 is regulated by the transcription factors p53 and HIF1α, with binding sites for these factors identified in its promoter region. This regulation suggests that MED30 is involved in transcriptional responses to cellular stress and hypoxia, conditions often present in tumor microenvironments (Shukla2020HIF1α).

In glioblastoma (GBM), MED30 is overexpressed and its expression correlates positively with p53 and HIF1α levels, indicating a regulatory feedback loop between these proteins (Shukla2020HIF1α). MED30's interaction with p53 is particularly significant, as it modulates p53 levels and influences cell sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug temozolomide (TMZ), enhancing apoptosis in GBM cells (Shukla2020HIF1α). These interactions highlight MED30's role in mediating transcriptional responses and its potential impact on cancer pathogenesis and treatment resistance. However, specific protein-protein interactions involving MED30 within the Mediator complex or with other transcriptional regulators are not detailed in the provided context.
