# SRC

## Overview
The SRC gene encodes the SRC proto-oncogene, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell growth, differentiation, and survival. As a member of the Src family kinases (SFKs), the SRC protein is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, cytoskeletal organization, and cell adhesion, interacting with integrin signaling pathways to influence focal adhesion formation and cell migration (Taylor1996Src; Parsons2004Src). The protein's activity is tightly regulated through phosphorylation and interactions with other proteins, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which are crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways (Thomas1997CELLULAR; Schwartzberg1998The). Dysregulation of SRC activity is associated with various human cancers, making it a significant target for therapeutic intervention (Ishizawar2006cSrc; Wheeler2009The).

## Structure
The SRC proto-oncogene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase with a complex molecular structure. The protein is organized from the N- to C-terminus, featuring several distinct domains: an N-terminal myristoyl group, a unique domain, an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, an SH2-kinase linker, a protein-tyrosine kinase domain (SH1), and a C-terminal regulatory segment (Roskoski2004Src; Roskoski2015Src). The myristoylation at the N-terminus is crucial for membrane attachment, which is essential for its cellular function (Roskoski2004Src).

The SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences, while the SH2 domain binds to phosphotyrosine-containing sequences, playing a role in regulating Src activity (Roskoski2004Src; Roskoski2015Src). The kinase domain is characterized by a bilobed structure, with a small amino-terminal lobe and a large carboxy-terminal lobe, forming a cleft for ATP binding (Roskoski2004Src; Roskoski2015Src). The activation loop within the kinase domain undergoes phosphorylation at Tyr419, stabilizing the active conformation (Roskoski2015Src).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at Tyr530, regulate the kinase's activity by maintaining an inactive state through intramolecular interactions (Roskoski2015Src). The protein's structure allows for regulation through competition between intramolecular interactions and external ligands, with the SH2 and SH3 domains playing key roles in this process (Roskoski2004Src).

## Function
The SRC gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell growth, differentiation, and survival. In healthy human cells, SRC is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly during the G2/M transition, by modulating protein interactions and phosphorylation events during mitosis (Taylor1996Src). SRC is also crucial for cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion, interacting with integrin signaling pathways to affect focal adhesion formation and cell migration (Parsons2004Src).

SRC's kinase activity is regulated through intramolecular interactions involving its SH2 and SH3 domains, which mediate protein-protein interactions. The phosphorylation of tyrosine 527 (Y527) is a key regulatory mechanism that maintains SRC in an inactive state, while dephosphorylation leads to its activation (Schwartzberg1998The). SRC is activated through interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and participates in signaling pathways that promote DNA synthesis, receptor turnover, and cytoskeleton rearrangements (Parsons2004Src).

In osteoclasts, SRC is essential for bone resorption, and its disruption leads to osteopetrosis, highlighting its role in bone remodeling (Soriano1991Targeted). Despite its broad expression, SRC's primary phenotype in knockout models is related to bone density, indicating its specific functional importance in osteoclasts (Cooper1993The).

## Clinical Significance
The SRC proto-oncogene, encoding a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, plays a significant role in the progression of various human cancers. Overexpression and increased activity of SRC are associated with malignancy and poor prognosis in cancers such as breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Wheeler2009The). In breast cancer, SRC interacts with the ErbB2/ErbB3 heterocomplex, enhancing oncogenic signaling and promoting cellular motility and growth (Ishizawar2006cSrc). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SRC family kinases (SFKs) are activated and contribute to the survival of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent cells, suggesting that targeting SRC could enhance the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors (Zhang2007SrcFamily).

SRC is also implicated in drug resistance, as its inhibition can restore sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic agents in cancers like colorectal and pancreatic cancer (Wheeler2009The). The regulation of SRC by microRNAs and its involvement in signaling pathways such as RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and STAT further underscore its role in tumor progression and metastasis (Simatou2020Historical). These findings highlight SRC as a promising therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
The SRC proto-oncogene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that participates in various protein interactions, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. SRC interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), enhancing its tumorigenic potential. This interaction involves the phosphorylation of EGFR at specific sites, which are not typical autophosphorylation sites, leading to enhanced signaling pathways that promote oncogenesis (Maa1995Potentiation; Ishizawar2004cSrc).

SRC also forms complexes with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is essential for cellular adhesion and motility. This interaction enhances FAK's kinase activity and recruits other signaling molecules, influencing pathways such as ERK, JNK, and Rho, which are important for cell motility and invasion (Thomas1997CELLULAR; Ishizawar2004cSrc).

The adapter protein p130 CAS (CAS) is another significant binding partner of SRC. CAS binds to SRC through its SH2 and SH3 domains, potentially activating the kinase. This interaction is crucial for SRC-mediated cellular transformation and the phosphorylation of proteins like cortactin and paxillin, which are involved in cell proliferation and survival (Burnham2000Regulation; Schuh2010BCAR3).

SRC also interacts with integrins, facilitating cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. This interaction is involved in the phosphorylation of integrin-associated proteins, which is crucial for focal adhesion dynamics and cellular signaling pathways (Thomas1997CELLULAR).
