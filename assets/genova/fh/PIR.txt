# PIR

## Overview
PIR is a gene that encodes the protein pirin, a member of the cupin superfamily, characterized by its conserved β-barrel domains. Pirin is a nuclear protein that functions primarily as a transcriptional co-regulator, influencing various cellular processes such as myeloid differentiation, inflammation, and stress response. It plays a significant role in the regulation of NF-κB-dependent transcription by interacting with key proteins like RelA, BCL3, and NF-κB1, thereby modulating inflammatory responses and cellular homeostasis (Brzóska2014Basal; Ahsan2023Role). Pirin's activity is influenced by its redox state, with its iron cofactor playing a crucial role in its conformational dynamics and protein interactions (Ahsan2023Role). Clinically, PIR is implicated in various cancers, including melanoma and breast cancer, where it contributes to tumor progression and metastasis (Suleman2021Mutational; PerezDominguez2021Role). Additionally, pirin is involved in pathways related to oxidative stress and inflammation, highlighting its importance in both normal physiological and pathological conditions (Ahsan2023Role).

## Structure
Pirin, encoded by the PIR gene, is a highly conserved nuclear protein consisting of 290 amino acids and weighing approximately 32 kDa. It belongs to the cupin superfamily, characterized by two antiparallel β-barrel domains, which are part of its secondary structure (Ahsan2023Role). The protein's structure includes an iron cofactor located within the N-terminal domain, crucial for its function. Pirin can exist in two different conformations depending on the oxidation state of the bound iron (Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺), which affects its R-shaped surface area (Ahsan2023Role). 

The quaternary structure of Pirin typically involves forming a homodimer, a common feature in its functional state (Ahsan2023Role). The protein's structural homology suggests functional similarities to quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase, an enzyme that uses quercetin flavonoid as a substrate (Ahsan2023Role). Pirin's interaction with other proteins, such as BCL3, involves the ankyrin repeat domains, which are crucial for its interaction (Ahsan2023Role). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context (Ahsan2023Role).

## Function
Pirin (PIR) is a transcriptional co-regulator involved in various cellular processes, including myeloid differentiation, inflammation, and stress response. In healthy human cells, PIR expression is upregulated during the myeloid differentiation of hematopoietic cells, suggesting its role in promoting myeloid maturation. This is evidenced by increased PIR levels during the differentiation of human CD34+ cells into myelomonocytic cells and murine Lin- cells into mature myeloid cells (Licciulli2009Pirin).

Pirin functions as a transcriptional coactivator, influencing NF-κB-dependent transcription. It interacts with proteins such as RelA (p65), BCL3, and NF-κB1 (p50), facilitating the binding of NF-κB proteins to target sequences, which is crucial for regulating inflammatory responses (Brzóska2014Basal). PIR expression is regulated by the NRF2 transcription factor through an antioxidant response element (ARE) in its promoter, indicating its involvement in oxidative stress responses (Brzóska2014Basal).

Pirin is also implicated in the regulation of actin dynamics and B cell receptor signaling, as well as in pathways related to cell proliferation, survival, and migration (Ahsan2023Role). It is active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression and cellular homeostasis (Ahsan2023Role).

## Clinical Significance
The PIR gene, encoding the protein Pirin, plays a significant role in various diseases, particularly cancer. In melanoma, high Pirin expression is linked to cell migration and cancer progression, with its interaction with BCL-3 being a potential target for inhibiting metastasis (PerezDominguez2021Role). In breast cancer, Pirin promotes cell proliferation and tumor growth by upregulating E2F1 expression, contributing to local metastasis (Suleman2021Mutational). Mutations such as V257A, I28T, and I264S in the PIR gene can destabilize the protein structure, potentially accelerating breast cancer pathways (Suleman2021Mutational).

Pirin is also implicated in oral and cervical cancers, where its expression is increased in HPV-positive cases, facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration through EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathways (Carrillo2017Upregulation). In lung cancer, Pirin is upregulated by cigarette smoke, leading to apoptosis in airway epithelial cells (Gelbman2007Upregulation; PerezDominguez2021Role).

Beyond cancer, Pirin is involved in inflammation and oxidative stress responses, with its role in the NF-κB pathway being crucial for pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Variants in the PIR gene can influence its expression, potentially affecting the prevalence of Pirin-mediated conditions across different populations (Ahsan2023Role).

## Interactions
Pirin (PIR) is a human protein that engages in various protein-protein interactions, playing a significant role in several cellular pathways. It directly interacts with BCL3, NFKBIA (also known as IκBα), NFIX, and SMAD9, as identified through the Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H) system (Ahsan2023Role). These interactions are crucial in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Pirin enhances the DNA binding activity of the p50-BCL3 complex by interacting with the ankyrin repeat domains of BCL3, forming a quaternary complex (Ahsan2023Role). 

Pirin's interaction with NFKBIA is involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling, potentially contributing to the proteasomal degradation of IκBα, which releases NF-κB dimers to translocate into the nucleus and initiate transcription (Ahsan2023Role). The protein also interacts with NFIX and SMAD9, with SMAD9 being a transcriptional repressor involved in bone morphogenetic protein signaling (Ahsan2023Role). 

Pirin's interactions are influenced by its redox state, with a higher affinity for its partners when bound to Fe2+ compared to Fe3+ (Ahsan2023Role). These interactions suggest Pirin's involvement in inflammation, tumor invasion, and other cellular processes.
