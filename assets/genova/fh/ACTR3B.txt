# ACTR3B

## Overview
ACTR3B is a gene that encodes the actin-related protein 3B, a critical component of the ARP2/3 complex, which is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. The protein actin-related protein 3B is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein and plays a significant role in the nucleation of new actin filaments, thereby influencing cell shape, motility, and division. ACTR3B is implicated in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which modulate its expression and function. Notably, ACTR3B has been associated with cancer biology, where it exhibits dual roles depending on the cancer type, acting as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer and a promoter of tumor progression in colorectal cancer (Galloni2020MICAL2; Wu2020LncRNA; Yu2019LncRNA).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ACTR3B gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) AC009022.1 enhances the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells by promoting ACTR3B expression through the suppression of miR-497-5p. This interaction is associated with poor prognosis, larger tumor size, and advanced disease stages in CRC patients (Yu2019LncRNA). 

In pancreatic cancer (PC), the lncRNA KCNK15-AS1 inhibits cancer progression by promoting ACTR3B expression. KCNK15-AS1 overexpression leads to decreased cell viability and tumor growth, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role for ACTR3B in PC. The knockdown of ACTR3B reverses the inhibitory effects of KCNK15-AS1, indicating that ACTR3B is crucial for the tumor-suppressive function of KCNK15-AS1 (Wu2020LncRNA).

These findings highlight the dual role of ACTR3B in different cancer types, acting as a promoter of tumor progression in CRC while serving a suppressive function in PC. The regulation of ACTR3B by specific lncRNAs and microRNAs underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in these malignancies.

## Interactions
ACTR3B, a component of the ARP2/3 complex, participates in several interactions that influence actin network dynamics. It interacts with the methionine monooxygenase MICAL2, which regulates the disassembly of branched actin networks by oxidizing Met293 in ACTR3B. This interaction is facilitated by the recruitment of MICAL2 to actin tails by coronin-1C, a process essential for the enhanced disassembly of actin networks (Galloni2020MICAL2). The presence of coronin-1C is crucial, as its depletion results in the loss of MICAL2 recruitment and suppresses the short actin tail phenotype induced by ACTR3B (Galloni2020MICAL2).

ACTR3B also interacts with the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) KCNK15-AS1 in the context of pancreatic cancer. KCNK15-AS1 binds to ACTR3B, promoting its expression by enhancing its promoter activity and inhibiting its ubiquitination. This interaction plays a role in inhibiting pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, with the tumor suppressive effects of KCNK15-AS1 being dependent on ACTR3B (Wu2020LncRNA). RNA pulldown and RNA immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the physical binding between KCNK15-AS1 and ACTR3B, highlighting the significance of this interaction in cancer biology (Wu2020LncRNA).
