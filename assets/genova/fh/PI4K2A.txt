# PI4K2A

## Overview
Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type 2 alpha (PI4K2A) is a gene that encodes a lipid kinase enzyme involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), a key signaling molecule in cellular processes. The PI4K2A protein is categorized as a kinase and is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus and endosomes, where it plays a crucial role in membrane trafficking and signal transduction. Structurally, the protein features a unique kinase fold with distinct N- and C-lobes, and its activity is regulated by interactions with various proteins, including the adaptor protein complex AP-3 and the SNARE protein VAMP3. PI4K2A is implicated in several physiological processes, such as endosomal-lysosomal trafficking and autophagy, and its dysregulation is associated with diseases like metabolic cutis laxa, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and certain cancers (Baumlova2014The; Simons2009Loss; Mohamed2020Novel).

## Structure
The phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type 2 alpha (PI4K2A) protein is characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes distinct domains and features essential for its function. The protein has a non-typical kinase fold divided into N- and C-lobes, with the ATP binding groove located between them (Baumlova2014The). The N-lobe resembles protein kinases, while the C-lobe is similar to other lipid kinases (BAUMLOVA2016The). The ATP binding groove is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with residues such as K152, S137, and D346, which are crucial for catalytic activity (Baumlova2014The).

PI4K2A's membrane binding is facilitated by several regions, including helices H5 and H7, a lateral hydrophobic pocket, and a flexible segment containing palmitoylated cysteine residues (Baumlova2014The). The palmitoylation insertion, featuring an amphipathic helix, is critical for anchoring the protein to the membrane and forming the PI-binding pocket (Zhou2014Molecular). The R275 residue plays a role in maintaining the enzyme's association with anionic membrane lipids, and mutations at this site can significantly affect kinase activity (Mohamed2020Novel).

The protein's structure also includes a proline-rich N-terminus, which contains binding sites for ubiquitin ligase Itch and clathrin adaptor complex 3, although it is predicted to be disordered and does not affect kinase activity (Baumlova2014The).

## Function
Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type 2 alpha (PI4K2A) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), a lipid signaling molecule essential for various cellular processes. PI4K2A is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus and endosomes, where it influences membrane trafficking and signal transduction (Boura2015Phosphatidylinositol; Mohamed2020Novel).

In healthy human cells, PI4K2A is involved in endosomal-lysosomal trafficking, endosomal exocytosis, and the regulation of sphingomyelin synthesis at the trans-Golgi network. It also plays a role in the trafficking of lysosomal enzymes, such as glucocerebrosidase, to the lysosome (Mohamed2020Novel). PI4K2A is crucial for the appearance of VAMP3 on the plasma membrane, affecting endocytic recycling processes and SNARE complex formation (Jović2014Endosomal).

The enzyme's activity is regulated by its interaction with the adaptor protein complex AP-3, which is necessary for its proper localization and function in endosomal trafficking. PI4K2A contains a dileucine motif that is essential for its interaction with AP-3, facilitating the sorting and trafficking of proteins within endosomes (Craige2008Phosphatidylinositol4Kinase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PI4K2A gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. A notable mutation, R275W, in the PI4K2A gene is linked to metabolic cutis laxa, a disorder characterized by loose, inelastic skin and premature aging. This mutation significantly reduces the enzyme's catalytic activity, affecting phosphoinositide lipid synthesis, which is crucial for intracellular signaling and trafficking (Mohamed2020Novel).

In the context of neurological disorders, PI4K2A deficiency in mice leads to late-onset degeneration of spinal cord axons, resembling hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). This condition is marked by progressive lower-limb spasticity and weakness, with PI4K2A playing a role in axonal transport and membrane trafficking (Simons2009Loss). PI4K2A is also implicated in autophagic lysosome reformation, with its dysregulation contributing to the pathophysiology of HSP forms SPG11 and SPG15 (Khundadze2021Mouse).

In cancer, high expression levels of PI4K2A are associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. The gene is part of a lysosome network critical for misfolded protein clearance, and targeting this network can lead to cancer cell death without affecting normal cells (Pataer2019Therapeutic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PI4K2A in various diseases.

## Interactions
PI4K2A (phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type 2 alpha) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with the adaptor protein complex AP-3, which is essential for its targeting to endosomal compartments. This interaction is mediated by a conserved dileucine motif within PI4K2A, and mutations in this motif disrupt the interaction, highlighting its importance for endosome traffic (Craige2008Phosphatidylinositol4Kinase).

PI4K2A also interacts with clathrin and the AP-3 cargo ZnT3, but not with the transferrin receptor or AP-1, indicating specificity in its interactions (Craige2008Phosphatidylinositol4Kinase). It is associated with the WASH complex, an actin-regulatory complex, suggesting a role in actin polymerization and membrane scission on early endosomes (Ryder2013The).

In the context of autophagy, PI4K2A binds to GABARAP, facilitating its recruitment to autophagosomes, which is crucial for autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Albanesi2015GABARAPmediated; Chen2018Comobility). PI4K2A also interacts with the SNARE protein VAMP3, affecting its trafficking and sorting, which is important for endocytic recycling (Jović2014Endosomal). These interactions underscore PI4K2A's role in membrane trafficking and cellular signaling pathways.
