# PLA2G12A

## Overview
The PLA2G12A gene encodes the protein phospholipase A2 group XIIA, which is a member of the phospholipase A2 superfamily. This protein is involved in the hydrolysis of phospholipids, playing a crucial role in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling pathways. Phospholipase A2 group XIIA is categorized as a secreted enzyme and is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including inflammation and cancer. The gene's expression and the activity of its encoded protein have been linked to significant clinical outcomes, particularly in diseases such as colorectal cancer and atherosclerosis, where it may function as a tumor suppressor and an atheroprotective agent, respectively (Parisi2023PLA2G12A; Nicolaou2017Quantitative).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PLA2G12A gene have been associated with several diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC) and atherosclerosis. In colorectal cancer, low expression of PLA2G12A is linked to poor clinical outcomes, such as increased risk of recurrence and death. This gene is considered a potential tumor suppressor, as its deficiency is associated with enhanced tumor growth, migration, and invasion, particularly through mechanisms involving epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways (Parisi2023PLA2G12A).

In the context of atherosclerosis, PLA2G12A acts as an atheroprotective gene. Its expression is inversely correlated with atherosclerotic lesion size, suggesting that higher levels of PLA2G12A may protect against the development of atherosclerosis. The gene is thought to limit leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, a critical step in atherogenesis. Downregulation of PLA2G12A has been associated with increased cell adhesion and larger atherosclerotic lesions, particularly in female mice (Nicolaou2017Quantitative).

PLA2G12A has also been identified as a potential diagnostic biomarker for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), with its downregulation in AMI samples suggesting a protective role by reducing vascular adhesion (Liu2023ACSL1).
