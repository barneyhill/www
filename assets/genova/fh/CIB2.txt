# CIB2

## Overview
CIB2 is a gene that encodes the protein calcium and integrin binding family member 2, which is a crucial component of cellular signaling pathways. This protein is categorized as a calcium-binding protein due to its EF-hand domains, which facilitate calcium ion binding and are essential for its function in various cellular processes (Riazuddin2012Alterations). CIB2 plays a significant role in auditory and visual functions, acting as a negative regulator of mTORC1 signaling and participating in the mechanoelectrical transduction process in cochlear hair cells (Giese2017CIB2; Sethna2021CIB2). Mutations in the CIB2 gene are linked to auditory conditions such as nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB48) and Usher syndrome type 1J (USH1J), highlighting its clinical significance (Jacoszek2016Advances; Wang2017Loss). The protein's ability to interact with integrins and other cellular components underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Dal2022Calcium).

## Structure
CIB2 is a member of the calcium and integrin-binding protein family, characterized by four EF-hand domains that undergo conformational changes upon binding calcium ions (Ca2+) (Riazuddin2012Alterations). The primary structure of CIB2 includes conserved residues such as p.Glu64, p.Phe91, and p.Cys99, which are crucial for its interaction with the C-terminal tail of αIIβ integrin (Riazuddin2012Alterations). The secondary structure involves EF-hand domains, which are common motifs for calcium binding (Riazuddin2012Alterations).

The tertiary structure of CIB2 has been modeled using the crystal and NMR structures of CIB1, a protein with 38% identity and 59% similarity to CIB2. This modeling suggests that mutations like p.Glu64Asp, p.Phe91Ser, and p.Cys99Trp can alter the protein's binding affinity and kinetics with integrin, as well as its calcium-binding properties (Riazuddin2012Alterations). CIB2 is monomeric under all tested conditions, contrary to previous beliefs that it might form dimers (Dal2019Oligomeric). However, it can appear dimeric due to its hydrophobic surface, which may lead to misinterpretation of its oligomeric state (Dal2019Oligomeric).

CIB2 encodes three alternatively spliced isoforms, each affected by specific mutations associated with Usher syndrome type 1J (USH1J) and nonsyndromic deafness DFNB48 (Riazuddin2012Alterations). The protein's interaction with integrin and its role in calcium signaling are critical for its function, and mutations can lead to deafness or deaf-blindness (Riazuddin2012Alterations).

## Function
CIB2 (calcium and integrin binding family member 2) is a protein that plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, particularly in regulating mTORC1 signaling, autophagy, and visual function. In healthy human cells, CIB2 acts as a negative regulator of mTORC1 by preferentially binding to the inactive form of Rheb, a small GTPase that activates mTORC1. This regulation is essential for maintaining proper autophagy levels, especially in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which is vital for visual health (Sethna2021CIB2).

CIB2 is also involved in the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) process in cochlear hair cells, which is critical for hearing. It interacts with TMC1 and TMC2, components of the MET channels, and is necessary for their proper localization and function. This interaction is crucial for converting sound waves into electrical signals, highlighting CIB2's role in auditory function (Dal2022Calcium; Giese2017CIB2).

Additionally, CIB2 functions as a calcium sensor, undergoing conformational changes upon binding with calcium ions, which is important for its role in various signaling pathways. This structural flexibility allows CIB2 to interact with different cellular components, influencing processes like cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction (Dal2022Calcium).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CIB2 gene are associated with several auditory conditions, primarily nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB48) and Usher syndrome type 1J (USH1J). Usher syndrome is characterized by hearing loss, vision impairment, and sometimes balance issues, with USH1J being one of its most severe forms (Jacoszek2016Advances; Wang2017Loss). Mutations such as c.192G>C, c.272T>C, and c.297C>G in CIB2 can lead to early onset, bilateral, moderate to profound hearing impairment, often following a recessive inheritance pattern (Jacoszek2016Advances). These mutations affect protein conformation, integrin binding, and calcium-binding properties, which are crucial for auditory function (Dal2022Calcium).

CIB2 mutations have been identified in diverse populations, including Turkish, Palestinian Arabian, and Iranian families, indicating a broad genetic impact (Dal2022Calcium). The c.272T>C mutation, resulting in the p.(Phe91Ser) variant, is particularly prevalent in Pakistani families, suggesting a founder effect (Shaikh2017Genetic). In CIB2-deficient mice, the absence of CIB2 leads to profound hearing loss due to the disruption of mechanoelectrical transduction in auditory hair cells, while vestibular and retinal functions remain unaffected (Michel2017CIB2).

## Interactions
CIB2 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in mechanotransduction in auditory hair cells. It acts as an auxiliary subunit of the mechanotransduction (MET) channel, interacting with TMC1 and TMC2 proteins. These interactions are essential for the proper localization and function of the MET channel in hair cells, and mutations in CIB2 can disrupt these interactions, leading to hearing impairments (Giese2017CIB2; Liang2021CIB2). CIB2 binds to TMC1 through a conserved binding pocket, and specific mutations in CIB2, such as Asn68Gln and Val152Phe, can disrupt this interaction, affecting mechanotransduction (Liang2021CIB2).

CIB2 also interacts with BAIAP2L2, a component of the Row2-3 protein complex, which is localized on the tips of stereocilia. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization of BAIAP2L2, and mutations in CIB2 can affect its binding to TMC1, impacting the MET channel's function (Dal2022Calcium). Additionally, CIB2 is part of the Usher interactome, interacting with proteins such as ADGRV1, whirlin, and myosin VIIa, suggesting its involvement in the periciliary membrane complex important for cargo transport in photoreceptor cells (Linnert2023Usher).
