# SERPINA5

## Overview
SERPINA5 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family A member 5, also known as protein C inhibitor (PCI), which is a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. This protein plays a critical role in regulating various physiological processes, including blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and immune response. As a serine protease inhibitor, serpin family A member 5 functions by forming stable complexes with target proteases, thereby inhibiting their enzymatic activity (Gettins2016Inhibitory). The protein is expressed in multiple tissues, such as the liver, kidney, and reproductive tracts, and is present in various body fluids (ÖZKAN2020Analysis). Beyond its role in hemostasis, SERPINA5 has been implicated in tumor suppression, antimicrobial activity, and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its diverse biological significance (Crist2020Leveraging; Yang2017Cell).

## Structure
SERPINA5, also known as protein C inhibitor, is a member of the serpin superfamily characterized by a conserved serpin fold. The primary structure of SERPINA5 consists of a single polypeptide chain, which includes a reactive center loop (RCL) crucial for its inhibitory function (Gettins2016Inhibitory). The secondary structure of SERPINA5 features alpha-helices and beta-sheets typical of serpins, with the RCL playing a key role in the protein's inhibitory mechanism (Silverman2001The).

The tertiary structure of SERPINA5 includes a large hydrophobic pocket known as the helix A gap, which is suggested to be the binding site for retinoic acid (Yang2017Cell). This structural feature is important for the interaction with non-protein ligands. The protein's metastable conformation is essential for its function as a proteinase inhibitor, allowing it to form stable complexes with target proteases (Gettins2016Inhibitory).

Post-translational modifications of SERPINA5 may include glycosylation, which can affect its activity and interactions (ÖZKAN2020Analysis). There are known splice variant isoforms of SERPINA5 that can influence its function and localization, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
SERPINA5, also known as protein C inhibitor (PCI), is a serine protease inhibitor with a broad range of functions in healthy human cells. It primarily inhibits activated protein C and plasminogen activators, playing a crucial role in regulating blood coagulation and fibrinolysis (Yang2017Cell; ÖZKAN2020Analysis). SERPINA5 acts as both a procoagulant and anticoagulant, depending on the conditions, and is involved in hemostasis (Yang2017Cell). It is highly expressed in the male reproductive tract, where it contributes to spermatogenesis and male fertility, as evidenced by infertility in serpinA5-deficient mice (Yang2017Cell).

In addition to its role in coagulation, SERPINA5 has been linked to tumor suppression and antimicrobial activity. It exhibits protective effects against tumor development and metastasis, with its expression associated with less aggressive tumor behavior (Yang2017Cell). SERPINA5 also demonstrates antimicrobial activity, particularly against HIV, with high concentrations found in the cervicovaginal fluid of women resistant to HIV infection (Yang2017Cell). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, skin, heart, and reproductive tracts, and is present in most body fluids and secretions (ÖZKAN2020Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SERPINA5 gene, also known as protein C inhibitor, have been implicated in several diseases. In preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related condition, elevated SERPINA5 levels are associated with increased blood pressure and proteinuria, exacerbating the condition by promoting coagulation cascade activation. Reducing SERPINA5 expression in a rat model of preeclampsia alleviated these symptoms, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zeng2023Improvement).

In Alzheimer's disease, a rare missense variant of SERPINA5, p.E228Q, has been identified. This variant is associated with a younger age of onset and longer disease duration. Carriers of this variant exhibit a lower SERPINA5 burden, which affects tau pathology and may influence disease progression (Matchett2021Genetic).

SERPINA5 also plays a role in cancer, particularly in ovarian tumors. Its downregulation is linked to more aggressive forms of epithelial ovarian carcinoma, while its expression is associated with the benign behavior of serous borderline tumors. This suggests that SERPINA5 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting serine proteases involved in tumor metastasis (Sieben2005Differential). 

In pulmonary arterial hypertension, SERPINA5 provides protective effects through its anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant activities, reducing proinflammatory cytokines and potentially serving as a therapeutic target (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative).

## Interactions
SERPINA5, also known as protein C inhibitor (PCI), is involved in various protein interactions, primarily as a serine protease inhibitor. It forms stable, enzymatically inactive 1:1 complexes with its target proteases, acting in a suicide substrate-like manner. This includes interactions with proteases involved in blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and other processes, such as activated protein C, thrombin, and factor Xa (Crist2020Leveraging; Yang2017Cell).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, SERPINA5 has been identified as a novel tau binding partner. It interacts with tau protein, forming a complex that is specific to Alzheimer's disease brain tissue. This interaction is associated with neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, hallmark features of Alzheimer's pathology (Crist2020Leveraging).

SERPINA5 also interacts with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine, which facilitates its internalization into cells and potential translocation to the nucleus. This interaction is crucial for its role in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and activated platelets (Rieger2014Protein; Yang2015A+Helix). The protein's interaction with heparin and other glycosaminoglycans can modulate its inhibitory activity and specificity (Pratt1992Heparin).
