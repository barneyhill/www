# VMAC

## Overview
The VMAC gene encodes the vimentin type intermediate filament associated coiled-coil protein, which plays a crucial role in the structural organization and stability of intermediate filaments within the cytoskeleton. This protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its involvement in maintaining cell integrity and facilitating intracellular transport. The VMAC gene is expressed in various cell types, contributing to cellular processes such as migration, division, and signaling. Its interaction with other cytoskeletal components underscores its importance in cellular architecture and function. Mutations or dysregulation of the VMAC gene have been implicated in several pathological conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
