# XIRP1

## Overview
XIRP1, or Xin actin-binding repeat-containing protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structural and functional integrity of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. The protein, categorized as an actin-binding protein, is predominantly expressed in these muscle tissues, where it localizes to critical sites such as myotendinous junctions and intercalated discs. XIRP1 plays a vital role in the assembly and repair of myofibrils, essential for muscle contraction, by binding to actin filaments and interacting with other structural proteins. Additionally, it is involved in maintaining the electrophysiological functions of the heart, contributing to the integrity of intercalated discs and the regulation of ion channels. Mutations or altered expression of XIRP1 are linked to various cardiac conditions, including cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiac health (Holt2020An; Molt2014Aciculin; Huang2018Critical).

## Function
The XIRP1 gene encodes proteins that are integral to the structural integrity and function of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. In healthy human cells, XIRP1 proteins, including XinA, XinB, and XinC, are primarily expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles, where they localize to myotendinous junctions in skeletal muscle and intercalated discs in the heart (Molt2014Aciculin). These proteins play a crucial role in the assembly and repair of myofibrils, which are essential for muscle contraction. They achieve this by binding to actin filaments through their Xin-repeats, which are similar to nebulin repeats, and interacting with various other proteins such as filamin C and Ena/VASP proteins (Molt2014Aciculin).

XIRP1 is also involved in maintaining the electrophysiological functions of the heart. It is necessary for the integrity of intercalated discs and the surface expression of transient outward and delayed rectifier K+ channels. The loss of XIRP1 in ventricular cardiomyocytes can lead to reduced K+ currents, resulting in prolonged action potential duration and increased incidence of early afterdepolarization, which may underlie cardiac conduction defects (Huang2018Critical). XIRP1 interacts with proteins such as KChIP2 and cortactin, which are essential for maintaining ion channel function and density (Huang2018Critical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the XIRP1 gene are associated with several cardiac conditions, including cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. XIRP1 is crucial for maintaining the integrity of intercalated discs in cardiac muscle, which are essential for proper electrical and mechanical coupling between heart cells. Disruptions in XIRP1 can lead to severe cardiac conduction defects and arrhythmias, as seen in conditions like Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome (SUNDS) and Brugada Syndrome (BrS) (Huang2018Critical). 

Mutations in XIRP1 have been linked to pathological cardiac arrhythmias and conduction defects, with some variants predicted to be deleterious (Holt2020An; Huang2018Critical). These mutations can disrupt interactions with ion channel complexes, affecting cardiac electrophysiology and leading to prolonged action potential duration and altered ionic currents (Huang2018Critical). 

Alterations in XIRP1 expression are also significant in the context of myocardial infarction. After ischemic injury, XIRP1 expression initially increases but is quickly downregulated, remaining low in heart failure patients. This downregulation can be partially mitigated by ischemic preconditioning, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Williams2020miR125).

## Interactions
XIRP1, also known as Xin actin-binding repeat-containing protein 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in muscle development and repair. XIRP1 interacts with the heart disease-associated proteins POPDC1 and POPDC2, primarily at intercalated discs and transverse tubules in cardiac and skeletal muscles. These interactions are significant for cardiac conduction and muscle function, as mutations in these proteins are linked to cardiac arrhythmias (Holt2020An).

XIRP1 also interacts with actin and annexin A5, forming part of a larger protein complex that may include other proteins like Connexin-43, which is involved in electromechanical coupling between cardiomyocytes (Holt2020An). In macrophages, XIRP1 is associated with the actin-binding protein VASP and Filamin C, contributing to the structural integrity of podosomes, which are actin-rich adhesion structures (Urbano2022Human).

During Listeria monocytogenes infection, XIRP1 is recruited to the actin network, facilitating bacterial motility. This interaction is mediated by the bacterial protein ActA, which recruits host proteins for actin polymerization (Urbano2022Human). These interactions highlight XIRP1's role in both muscle cell architecture and immune cell function.
