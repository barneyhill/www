# PANO1

## Overview
PANO1 is a gene that encodes the proapoptotic nucleolar protein 1, which is involved in the regulation of apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein encoded by PANO1 is categorized as a nucleolar protein, indicating its localization and potential role in ribosomal biogenesis and cellular stress responses. Research suggests that proapoptotic nucleolar protein 1 may interact with various cellular pathways to influence apoptotic mechanisms, although the precise molecular interactions and pathways remain to be fully elucidated (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and regulation of PANO1 is significant for its potential implications in diseases where apoptosis is dysregulated, such as cancer.
