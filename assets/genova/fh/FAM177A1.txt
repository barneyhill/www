# FAM177A1

## Overview
FAM177A1 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 177 member A1. This protein is primarily localized in the Golgi complex, where it plays a critical role in maintaining Golgi structure and function. Despite being a disordered protein, FAM177A1 contains two α-helices and a short β-sheet hairpin, allowing it to interact with membranes without possessing transmembrane regions (Ugur2023VPS13B). It colocalizes with VPS13B, a protein involved in lipid transport, suggesting a collaborative role in phospholipid transfer between Golgi membranes (Ugur2023VPS13B). The gene's significance is further highlighted by its association with a neurodevelopmental disorder resembling Cohen syndrome, underscoring its importance in cellular and organismal development (Ugur2023VPS13B).

## Function
FAM177A1 is a protein localized in the Golgi complex, where it plays a role in maintaining Golgi structure and function. It is primarily a disordered protein with two α-helices and a short β-sheet hairpin, and it interacts with membranes despite lacking transmembrane regions (Ugur2023VPS13B). FAM177A1 colocalizes with VPS13B, a protein involved in lipid transport, at the cis-trans Golgi complex interface, suggesting a functional partnership in phospholipid transfer between Golgi membranes (Ugur2023VPS13B).

The protein's localization to the Golgi complex is attributed to Helix 1, as constructs lacking this helix show diffuse cytosolic localization (Ugur2023VPS13B). FAM177A1's role in Golgi dynamics is highlighted by its involvement in the reformation of the Golgi complex after disruption by Brefeldin A, a process that is delayed in cells lacking FAM177A1. This delay can be rescued by the expression of FAM177A1, indicating its importance in Golgi recovery (Ugur2023VPS13B). In zebrafish, the absence of FAM177A1 leads to developmental delays, further supporting its role in cellular and organismal development (Ugur2023VPS13B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FAM177A1 gene are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder that resembles Cohen syndrome. This disorder is characterized by developmental delays and neurological issues, which are observed in both human and zebrafish models lacking FAM177A1 (Ugur2023VPS13B). The gene's role in maintaining Golgi complex structure and function is crucial, as its loss leads to a delay in Golgi complex reformation after treatment with Brefeldin A, a compound that disrupts Golgi function. This delay is more pronounced when both FAM177A1 and its functional partner VPS13B are absent, indicating a synergistic effect (Ugur2023VPS13B).

FAM177A1's interaction with VPS13B suggests its involvement in lipid transport and Golgi membrane dynamics, which are essential for normal cellular function. The absence of FAM177A1 homologs in zebrafish results in developmental delays and increased sensitivity to Golgi-disrupting agents, further supporting its role in neurodevelopment (Ugur2023VPS13B). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its potential involvement in diseases related to Golgi dysfunction, highlighting the importance of understanding its interactions and functions in cellular processes (Ugur2023VPS13B).

## Interactions
FAM177A1 is a protein that interacts functionally with VPS13B, particularly in the context of the Golgi complex. Although direct physical interactions between FAM177A1 and other proteins or nucleic acids have not been explicitly detailed, FAM177A1 is identified as a potential interactor of VPS13B. This interaction is suggested by their co-localization at the Golgi complex, where FAM177A1 colocalizes with tagged-VPS13B. The interaction between these proteins is implicated in the reformation of the Golgi complex after disruption by Brefeldin A, with a synergistic effect observed when both proteins are absent (Ugur2023VPS13B).

FAM177A1 is not an intrinsic membrane protein but associates with membranes, as shown by its membrane-associated fraction in cell lysate fractionation experiments. Its localization to the Golgi complex is attributed to a specific structural feature, Helix 1, as constructs lacking this helix show diffuse cytosolic localization (Ugur2023VPS13B). Despite the lack of detailed evidence on direct physical interactions, FAM177A1's functional partnership with VPS13B suggests a role in Golgi complex dynamics and potentially in lipid transport processes (Ugur2023VPS13B).
