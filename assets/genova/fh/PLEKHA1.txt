# PLEKHA1

## Overview
PLEKHA1 is a gene located on chromosome 10q26 that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology domain containing A1, also known as TAPP1. This protein is characterized by its pleckstrin homology domain, which is involved in phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways. TAPP1 plays a role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of lymphocyte activation and cellular localization of proteins. The gene has been studied for its involvement in several diseases, most notably age-related maculopathy (ARM), where it is thought to contribute to disease susceptibility through its genetic variants (Jakobsdottir2005Susceptibility). PLEKHA1's interactions and regulatory mechanisms highlight its importance in cellular signaling and metabolic pathways, making it a significant focus of research in understanding its broader biological and clinical implications (Thalappilly2008Identification; Ji2021Effect).

## Clinical Significance
PLEKHA1 has been implicated in age-related maculopathy (ARM), a leading cause of central blindness in the elderly. Studies have identified a significant association between ARM and the PLEKHA1/LOC387715 region on chromosome 10q26, with PLEKHA1 SNPs likely contributing to the linkage signal (Jakobsdottir2005Susceptibility). The high-risk allele within this locus accounts for an odds ratio of 5.0 and an attributable risk of 57% for ARM, suggesting a substantial role in disease susceptibility (Jakobsdottir2005Susceptibility). The gene's protein product, TAPP1, is involved in phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways and may act as a negative regulator of lymphocyte activation, which is relevant to ARM's inflammatory nature (Jakobsdottir2005Susceptibility).

Despite these findings, the association of PLEKHA1 with ARM is not consistent across all populations. For instance, a study on Indian patients found no significant association between PLEKHA1 polymorphisms and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a condition related to ARM (Gupta2014Study). Additionally, while PLEKHA1 was significantly associated with ARM in the AREDS cohort, this was not observed in the CHS cohort, indicating variability in its clinical significance (Conley2007CFH).

## Interactions
PLEKHA1 is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), PLEKHA1 interacts with the adaptor protein SH3BP4, which may facilitate the localization of SH3BP4 to the plasma membrane. This interaction is part of a broader network of protein interactions that regulate cell proliferation and signaling pathways (Thalappilly2008Identification). The study also identified PLEKHA1 interactions using a yeast two-hybrid system, highlighting its involvement in the cytoplasmic localization of proteins, which is crucial for accurate interaction detection (Thalappilly2008Identification).

In glioma cells, PLEKHA1 expression is regulated by the transcription factor MYC, which binds to its promoter. This regulation is influenced by the long non-coding RNA LINC00320, which recruits MYC to the PLEKHA1 promoter, affecting its expression and subsequently influencing glioma cell behavior (Ji2021Effect). 

In the context of diabetic nephropathy and metabolic syndrome, PLEKHA1 is associated with immune cells and metabolic pathways, particularly oxidative phosphorylation, indicating its role in metabolic abnormalities (Zhang2023Common). These interactions and regulatory mechanisms underscore the multifaceted role of PLEKHA1 in various cellular contexts.
