# BOLA2B

## Overview
BOLA2B is a gene that encodes the protein bolA family member 2B, which is part of the bolA-like protein family. This protein plays a significant role in the assembly and maturation of cytosolic iron-sulfur ([2Fe-2S]) clusters, which are vital for various cellular processes, including iron homeostasis and the function of numerous enzymes. BOLA2B primarily operates in the cytoplasm, where it forms complexes with other proteins such as glutaredoxin 3 (GLRX3) and PCBP1, acting as a chaperone to facilitate the transfer of [2Fe-2S] clusters. These interactions are crucial for maintaining normal iron levels and preventing conditions like anemia. Additionally, BOLA2B has been implicated in cancer biology, with its expression levels serving as potential biomarkers for prognosis in several types of cancer (Giannuzzi2019The; Liang2023Integrative; Patel2019A).

## Function
The BOLA2B gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly and maturation of cytosolic iron-sulfur ([2Fe-2S]) clusters, which are essential for various cellular processes. In human cells, BOLA2B interacts with glutaredoxin 3 (GLRX3) to form a [2Fe-2S]-bridged heterotrimeric complex. This complex functions as a chaperone, facilitating the transfer of [2Fe-2S] clusters to CIAPIN1 (anamorsin), a key component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly (CIA) system (Giannuzzi2019The; Patel2019A). The BOLA2B protein is involved in iron homeostasis, and its activity is linked to maintaining normal iron levels and preventing anemia. Reduced dosage of BOLA2B is associated with phenotypes such as anemia, microcytosis, and low serum iron, indicating its role in systemic iron regulation (Giannuzzi2019The).

BOLA2B is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it forms complexes with other proteins like PCBP1, which are involved in the early steps of cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly. The PCBP1-BOLA2B complex acts as an iron chaperone, linking the cytosolic labile iron pool to the Fe-S cluster assembly process (Patel2019A). This activity is crucial for the function of various cellular proteins that require iron-sulfur clusters for their activity.

## Clinical Significance
BOLA2B is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels serving as a potential biomarker for prognosis. High expression of BOLA2B is associated with poor overall survival in several cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), uveal melanoma (UVM), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) (Liang2023Integrative). In breast cancer, BOLA2B knockdown results in reduced cell proliferation and G2/M cell cycle arrest, indicating its role in cancer cell growth (Liang2023Integrative). The gene is also linked to iron homeostasis, with its expression affecting pathways related to iron-sulfur cluster formation and mTOR-mediated autophagy (Liang2023Integrative).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), BOLA2B is overexpressed and associated with higher tumor stages and worse survival outcomes. It is linked to tumor hemorrhage and oxidative stress markers, suggesting its role in promoting tumor growth and metastasis (Luo2019BolA). BOLA2B's involvement in iron metabolism is further highlighted by its association with anemia predisposition in individuals with 16p11.2 chromosomal variations, which can lead to iron deficiency anemia (Giannuzzi2019The). These findings underscore BOLA2B's clinical significance in cancer prognosis and iron-related disorders.

## Interactions
The BOLA2B protein, a member of the bolA-like family, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly and cellular iron homeostasis. BOLA2B forms a heterotrimeric complex with human glutaredoxin-3 (GRX3), consisting of two BOLA2 molecules and one GRX3 molecule. This complex can bind two [2Fe-2S] clusters, which are essential for transferring these clusters to apo anamorsin, facilitating its maturation into the holo state (Banci2015Elucidating). 

In mammalian cells, BOLA2B interacts with PCBP1, forming a complex that is enhanced by iron supplementation. This interaction is specific and independent of GRX3, as GRX3 competes with PCBP1 for binding to BOLA2B. PCBP1 is crucial for iron binding to BOLA2B, and the presence of iron and glutathione (GSH) is necessary for the stability of the PCBP1-BOLA2B complex (Patel2019A). 

BOLA2B also forms a complex with GRX3 in the presence of [2Fe-2S] clusters, which is essential for the cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly machinery. This complex acts as a chaperone, facilitating the incorporation of Fe-S clusters into proteins like Ciapin1 (Frey2016A).
