# IPO8

## Overview
The IPO8 gene encodes the protein importin 8, a member of the importin-β family, which is integral to the nucleocytoplasmic transport system. Importin 8 functions as a nuclear transport receptor, facilitating the movement of various molecular cargoes, including proteins, RNAs, and ribonucleoprotein complexes, across the nuclear envelope in a RanGTP-dependent manner. This protein is characterized by its solenoid tertiary structure and the presence of HEAT repeats, which are crucial for its interactions with other proteins and its role in nuclear transport. Importin 8 is ubiquitously expressed in human cells, underscoring its essential role in cellular processes such as gene expression regulation and signal transduction pathways, including the TGF-β signaling pathway. Dysregulation of IPO8 has been linked to developmental abnormalities and diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Wei2014Importin; Van2023Generation; Xiong2016RUNX2).

## Structure
Importin 8 (IPO8) is a protein encoded by the IPO8 gene, which is part of the importin-β family involved in nuclear transport. The primary structure of IPO8 consists of a sequence of 1,037 amino acids (Xiong2016RUNX2). The secondary structure of IPO8 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common features in proteins of the importin-β family. The tertiary structure of IPO8 forms a solenoid shape, typical of importin-β proteins, facilitating its role in nuclear transport. This structure is characterized by the presence of HEAT repeats, which are specific domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Xiong2016RUNX2).

IPO8 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions with other proteins. The protein can form complexes with other proteins, indicating a quaternary structure, although specific details on these complexes are not provided in the context. The presence of HEAT repeats is significant as they contribute to the protein's ability to interact with various cargo molecules during the nuclear import process (Xiong2016RUNX2).

## Function
Importin 8 (IPO8) is a nuclear transport receptor that is part of the importin-β family, playing a crucial role in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of various cargoes, including proteins, RNAs, and ribonucleoprotein complexes, in a RanGTP-dependent manner (Van2023Generation). IPO8 is ubiquitously expressed in human cells, indicating its fundamental role in cellular function (Van2023Generation). It is involved in the transport of mature microRNAs (miRNAs) into the cell nucleus by interacting with the Argonaute 2 (Ago2) complex, which is essential for miRNA-guided gene silencing and regulation of gene expression (Wei2014Importin).

In addition to miRNAs, IPO8 has a high affinity for specific cargoes such as phosphorylated SMADs, which are involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway, a critical pathway for cellular processes like proliferation and differentiation (Van2023Generation). The proper functioning of IPO8 is essential for maintaining normal cellular activities and organismal development, as evidenced by its involvement in cardiovascular development and function (Van2023Generation). Dysregulation or deficiency of IPO8 can lead to significant developmental abnormalities and diseases, highlighting its importance in healthy human cells (Van2023Generation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IPO8 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of breast cancer, overexpression of IPO8 has been associated with better patient survival, suggesting a potential protective role in cancer prognosis (Mehmood2021Molecular). This indicates that IPO8 may play a role in modulating cancer progression, possibly through its involvement in nuclear transport processes.

In the realm of genetic disorders, six different homozygous loss-of-function variants in the IPO8 gene have been identified in patients exhibiting features reminiscent of connective tissue diseases, such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. These patients presented with dysmorphic features, hypotonia, and other connective tissue-related symptoms, suggesting a potential link between IPO8 mutations and these disorders (BertoliAvella2021Combining).

In glioma, IPO8 has been identified as part of a gene set used to construct a model for evaluating patient risks, indicating its potential significance in understanding glioma patient outcomes (Hsu2019Identification). The gene's expression levels were found to be higher in glioblastoma multiforme compared to lower-grade glioma, suggesting its role as a biomarker for glioma survival (Hsu2019Identification).

## Interactions
Importin 8 (IPO8) is involved in several physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in nuclear transport processes. IPO8 interacts with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E, facilitating its nuclear import. This interaction is significant as eIF4E is involved in the nuclear export and cytoplasmic translation of certain mRNAs, many of which are oncogenes. Silencing IPO8 leads to the nuclear accumulation of eIF4E mRNA export targets, such as c-Myc and Mcl-1, reducing their protein levels (Nachmias2020Targeting).

IPO8 is also a target gene of the transcription factor RUNX2, which positively regulates its transcription. RUNX2 binds to the IPO8 promoter region, and this interaction is crucial for maximal promoter activity. Mutation of the RUNX2 binding site significantly reduces IPO8 expression, highlighting the importance of this interaction in transcriptional regulation (Xiong2016RUNX2).

Additionally, IPO8 interacts with Argonaute (AGO) proteins in an RNA-dependent manner, which is involved in microRNA processing and function. Knockdown of IPO8 results in the redistribution of AGO2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, suggesting a role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and miRNA processing (Xiong2016RUNX2).
