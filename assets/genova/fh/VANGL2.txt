# VANGL2

## Overview
VANGL2 is a gene that encodes the VANGL planar cell polarity protein 2, a transmembrane protein integral to the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. This protein is characterized by its four transmembrane domains and is involved in the regulation of cellular orientation and arrangement within tissues. VANGL2 plays a pivotal role in various developmental processes, including neural tube closure, gastrulation, and the orientation of cochlear hair cells. It is also crucial for neuronal development, influencing neuronal migration, dendritic branching, and synapse formation. The protein's function is modulated by its interactions with other proteins, such as integrin αv and Prickle2, which affect its stability and localization at the plasma membrane. Mutations in the VANGL2 gene have been linked to neural tube defects and other developmental abnormalities, highlighting its clinical significance (Dreyer2022Vangl; Torban2004Independent; Jessen2019VANGL2).

## Structure
The VANGL2 protein is a transmembrane protein involved in planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling. It consists of four transmembrane domains located in its N-terminal half, with both the N- and C-terminal regions exposed to the cytosol (Bailly2018The; Torban2004Independent). The C-terminal region is particularly significant, containing several interaction domains crucial for its function. These include a PDZ-binding motif (PBM), a basolateral-sorting motif (YXXF), a p97/VCP-interacting motif (VIM), and a Prickle binding domain (PkBD) (Dreyer2022Vangl; Guo2013A). The PDZ-binding motif is essential for interactions with PDZ domain-containing proteins, facilitating the assembly of multiprotein complexes necessary for PCP signaling (Dreyer2022Vangl).

VANGL2 can form homo- and hetero-oligomers, although this does not require the N- or C-terminal cytoplasmic regions (Hatakeyama2014Vangl1). The protein's trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane is regulated by a conserved plasma membrane-targeting motif in the C-terminal domain (Hatakeyama2014Vangl1). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating VANGL2's function and localization (Torban2012An). Mutations in the C-terminal region, such as those found in the Looptail (Lp) mouse, can disrupt protein trafficking and lead to neural tube defects (Hatakeyama2014Vangl1; Torban2004Independent).

## Function
The VANGL2 gene encodes a four-pass transmembrane protein that is a crucial component of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, which regulates the orientation and arrangement of cells within the plane of a tissue. VANGL2 is involved in several key developmental processes, including neural tube closure, gastrulation, and cochlear hair cell orientation (Yates2010The; Jessen2019VANGL2). It plays a significant role in cell migration and invasion by affecting cell adhesion and interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM), influencing the assembly of fibrillar fibronectin ECM and the activation of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) (Jessen2019VANGL2).

In neuronal development, VANGL2 is essential for processes such as neuronal migration, dendritic branching, axonal growth and guidance, and synaptogenesis. It mediates neuronal migration through downstream effectors like JNK and ROCK and influences dendritic branching by interacting with Ap2m1 (Dreyer2022Vangl). VANGL2 also plays a role in synapse formation by binding to N-Cadherin and PSD-95, facilitating the assembly of multiprotein signaling complexes (Dreyer2022Vangl).

VANGL2's function is regulated by its stability and localization at the plasma membrane, which is influenced by interactions with integrin αv and the ECM. These interactions are crucial for maintaining VANGL2 protein stability and function (Jessen2019VANGL2). Proper localization of VANGL2 within the cell membrane is essential for its function, as mis-localization can lead to developmental defects (Dreyer2022Vangl).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VANGL2 gene are associated with several neural tube defects (NTDs), including craniorachischisis, a severe condition characterized by the failure of the neural tube to close properly. In mice, specific mutations such as S464N and D255E impair the interaction between VANGL2 and Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins, which are crucial for planar cell polarity (PCP) and convergent extension during embryogenesis, leading to these defects (Torban2004Independent). In humans, novel missense mutations like S84F, R353C, and F437S have been identified in fetuses with cranial neural-tube defects, including anencephaly and spina bifida. These mutations disrupt interactions with Dvl proteins, potentially leading to lethal effects during development (Lei2010VANGL2Mutations).

VANGL2 mutations also affect other developmental processes. In the kidney, VANGL2 is essential for normal branching morphogenesis and glomerular maturation. Mutations can lead to impaired ureteric tree arborization and glomerular defects, suggesting a link between VANGL2 mutations and kidney malformations in individuals with NTDs (Yates2010The). Altered VANGL2 expression has been implicated in cancer progression, affecting cellular migratory and invasive behavior (Hatakeyama2014Vangl1).

## Interactions
VANGL2, a key component of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, engages in several critical protein interactions that influence its function and stability. It interacts with integrin αv, which is essential for maintaining VANGL2 protein levels at the plasma membrane. This interaction is crucial for cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, and integrin αv knockdown leads to reduced VANGL2 protein levels, particularly at the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments (Jessen2019VANGL2). Integrin αvβ5 heterodimers are suggested to promote VANGL2 stability, while integrin β3 may decrease its expression (Jessen2019VANGL2).

VANGL2 also interacts with Prickle2, a PCP protein, facilitating its proteasomal degradation through a Cullin-1-dependent mechanism. This interaction is important for regulating Prickle2 levels and maintaining proper PCP signaling (Nagaoka2019Vangl2). Additionally, VANGL2 forms a complex with PSD-95 and Prickle2 at the postsynaptic density, influencing synaptic development and plasticity (Nagaoka2015PDZ).

The protein also associates with Scribble, a polarity protein, through its PDZ domains. This interaction is part of the molecular mechanisms that organize the intracellular face of the lateral plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells (Kallay2006Scribble). These interactions highlight VANGL2's role in cellular orientation and tissue organization.
