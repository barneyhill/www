# SLCO1C1

## Overview
The SLCO1C1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1C1 (OATP1C1), which is a critical component of the solute carrier organic anion transporter family. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and is primarily involved in the transport of thyroid hormones, such as thyroxine (T4) and reverse triiodothyronine (rT3), across cell membranes, particularly at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Groeneweg2019Thyroid; Hagenbuch2013The). OATP1C1 is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains, a structural feature that facilitates its role in transporting these hormones into the brain, where they are essential for neurological function and development (Groeneweg2019Thyroid). The protein's expression is regulated by thyroid hormone levels, and it is predominantly found in brain regions such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, as well as in the choroid plexus and astrocytes (Roberts2008Expression; Schäfer2021Expression). Mutations in SLCO1C1 can lead to significant clinical implications, including brain-specific hypothyroidism and neurodegenerative conditions (Strømme2018Mutated).

## Structure
The SLCO1C1 gene encodes the OATP1C1 protein, which is part of the solute carrier organic anion transporter family. This protein is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains, a common feature of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) to which it belongs (Groeneweg2019Thyroid; Hagenbuch2013The). The structure of OATP1C1 has not been fully resolved, but homology modeling has been used to develop a chimeric structural model based on the E. coli multidrug transporter MdfA. This model aids in understanding the substrate translocation mechanism and the protein's high affinity for thyroid hormones like T4 and rT3 (Groeneweg2019Thyroid).

Key residues, such as Arg601 in transmembrane domain 11, have been identified as crucial for substrate selectivity and T4 affinity, suggesting a specialized substrate channel within the protein (Groeneweg2019Thyroid). The protein's tertiary structure likely includes specific binding sites for substrates, and charged residues along the substrate channel are important for balancing the charged groups of thyroid hormone molecules (Groeneweg2019Thyroid). While specific post-translational modifications are not detailed, glycosylation is a common modification in this protein family, potentially affecting protein stability and function. The protein's role in thyroid hormone transport is critical, particularly in the brain, where it is expressed in various regions (Groeneweg2019Thyroid).

## Function
The SLCO1C1 gene encodes the OATP1C1 protein, a member of the solute carrier organic anion transporter family, which plays a critical role in the transport of thyroid hormones, particularly thyroxine (T4), across cell membranes. OATP1C1 is highly selective for T4 and reverse triiodothyronine (rT3), facilitating their transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and into the brain, where it is crucial for maintaining thyroid hormone homeostasis (Groeneweg2019Thyroid; lang2008transgenic). 

In humans, OATP1C1 is expressed in various regions of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, amygdala, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and putamen, and is involved in the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (Groeneweg2019Thyroid). It is primarily localized in astrocytes and the choroid plexus, with low expression in the microvessels of the BBB (Schäfer2021Expression). The transporter's function is essential for the uptake of T4 into the brain, which is then converted to triiodothyronine (T3), the active form of the hormone, necessary for normal neurological function and development (Roberts2008Expression). 

OATP1C1's expression is regulated by thyroid hormone levels, with higher expression in hypothyroid conditions, indicating its role in adjusting hormone transport based on physiological needs (lang2008transgenic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLCO1C1 gene, which encodes the thyroid hormone transporter OATP1C1, have been linked to severe brain hypometabolism and juvenile neurodegeneration. A notable case involves a homozygous missense mutation (D252N) that impairs the transporter's function, leading to brain-specific hypothyroidism. This condition manifests as dementia, spasticity, and cold intolerance in affected individuals, as observed in a 15.5-year-old patient. Brain imaging in such cases typically reveals degeneration and severe glucose hypometabolism. Treatment with the thyroid hormone analog triiodothyroacetic acid (Triac) has shown clinical improvement, suggesting potential therapeutic benefits for patients with OATP1C1 deficiency (Strømme2018Mutated).

Alterations in SLCO1C1 expression, influenced by specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 12p12, can affect thyroid hormone regulation in the brain. These SNPs are associated with changes in the expression of genes sensitive to thyroid hormone treatment, potentially impacting astrocytic gene expression and contributing to neurological conditions (Nelson2016Genomics).

The expression of SLCO1C1 at the blood-brain barrier is crucial for thyroid hormone transport. Differences in its expression between species may explain variations in the severity of neurological conditions related to thyroid hormone transport deficiencies (Roberts2008Expression).

## Interactions
SLCO1C1, also known as organic anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1), is involved in the transport of thyroid hormones across the blood-brain barrier. While specific protein-protein interactions involving SLCO1C1 are not extensively detailed, some studies suggest potential interactions and co-localizations. OATP1C1 is expressed in microvessels and tanycytes in various brain regions, where it may function alongside other transporters like monocarboxylate transporter-8 (MCT8) to facilitate thyroid hormone transport into the brain. MCT8 is primarily involved in transporting hormones from the blood into endothelial cells, while OATP1C1 is responsible for efflux into the brain, indicating a complementary role in hormone transport (Roberts2008Expression).

In the choroid plexus, OATP1C1 is present on both apical and basal surfaces, suggesting a role in transporting thyroid hormones from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid. The study also notes the colocalization of OATP1C1 with Mrp4 and Pgp, indicating potential interactions or co-localization with these proteins, although specific interactions are not detailed (Roberts2008Expression). These interactions highlight the importance of OATP1C1 in maintaining thyroid hormone homeostasis in the brain.
