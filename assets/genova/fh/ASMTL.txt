# ASMTL

## Overview
The ASMTL gene encodes the acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase-like protein, which is a member of the methyltransferase family. This gene is notable for its evolutionary history, involving a fusion of the ASMT and maf genes, and is characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes domains from both gene families (Levy2008The; Zhang2017A). Unlike other ASMT family members that are primarily involved in the serotonin/melatonin biosynthesis pathway, ASMTL is expressed widely across various tissues, suggesting a broader functional role beyond melatonin synthesis (Zhang2017A). The protein retains a domain necessary for methyltransferase activity, indicating potential involvement in diverse cellular methylation processes (Levy2008The). Despite its structural similarities to other ASMT proteins, ASMTL's distinct binding site characteristics may confer unique substrate selectivity and functional roles (Zhang2017A).

## Structure
The ASMTL protein is a member of the ASMT family and is characterized by its unique molecular structure, which includes a fusion of domains from the maf and ASMT genes. The C-terminal region of ASMTL is homologous to the full length of ASMT1 and ASMT2, suggesting a gene fusion and duplication event in its evolutionary history (Zhang2017A). This region retains the necessary domain for potential methyltransferase activity, although its exact function remains unclear (Levy2008The).

ASMTL has a distinct difference at the NAS binding sites compared to other ASMT proteins, which may indicate new functions in substrate selectivity (Zhang2017A). The protein's structure includes conserved residues around the SAM binding site, crucial for maintaining hydrogen bonds, which are essential for its activity (Zhang2017A). Variations in these residues can affect the protein's function.

The ASMTL gene is expressed widely across peripheral tissues, and its expression pattern suggests it may have roles beyond melatonin biosynthesis (Zhang2017A). The protein's evolutionary divergence is highlighted by its clustering outside the mammalian clade in phylogenetic analyses (Levy2008The).

## Function
The ASMTL gene in humans is a product of the duplication of the PAR1 gene Asmt, which then fused with the bacterial orfE/maf gene. Unlike other ASMT genes that are involved in the serotonin/N-acetylserotonin/melatonin pathway and are specifically expressed in the brain, pineal gland, and retina, ASMTL has a broader expression pattern, suggesting it may not participate in the serotonin pathway. Despite this, ASMTL retains a domain necessary for methyltransferase activity, indicating it might still function in methylation processes (Levy2008The).

The ASMTL protein is involved in cellular processes beyond the serotonin pathway, potentially due to its methyltransferase activity. It is expressed widely across different tissues, which implies a role in various cellular functions. The exact function of ASMTL in healthy human cells remains unclear, but its expression pattern and retained catalytic domain suggest it could have a broader role in cellular methylation processes (Levy2008The).

In fish, ASMTL is noted for its wide tissue distribution, suggesting a role distinct from melatonin biosynthesis, possibly involving substrate selectivity and methyltransferase activity (Zhang2017A). However, specific functions in humans are yet to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression levels of the ASMTL gene have been associated with various human diseases. In rats, lower hypothalamic Asmtl mRNA levels are observed in aggressive compared to tame rats, which is linked to human conditions such as neurodevelopmental disorders, autism, depression, brain injury, developmental abnormalities, cancer, infertility, and asthma. Specifically, ASMT deficiency is noted as a molecular marker for autism and is associated with aggressive behavior in children (Chadaeva2023RatDEGdb:).

The ASMTL gene, along with its paralog ASMT, plays a significant role in regulating molecular and genetic processes related to aggression, depression, and aging. Deficiencies in these genes are suggested as molecular markers for a range of diseases, indicating their involvement in the predisposition to aggressive behavior and other conditions (Chadaeva2023RatDEGdb:).

In the context of cancer, the long non-coding RNA ASMTL-AS1, which is related to ASMTL, has been implicated in various cancers. It has been shown to contribute to malignant phenotypes in hepatocellular carcinoma, particularly after insufficient radiofrequency ablation, by promoting proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Ma2020Exosome‐transferred). In contrast, ASMTL-AS1 acts as a tumor suppressor in triple-negative breast cancer by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Sun2021A).
