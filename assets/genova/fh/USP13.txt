# USP13

## Overview
USP13 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 13, a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in the regulation of various cellular processes. As a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, USP13 plays a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis by removing ubiquitin moieties from target proteins, thereby preventing their degradation via the proteasome. The protein is characterized by a complex structure that includes a catalytic domain with an N-terminal Cys-box and a C-terminal His-box, as well as zinc finger and ubiquitin-associated domains, which facilitate its interaction with ubiquitin and other proteins (Tao2023Roles; Zhang2011Domain). USP13 is implicated in several cellular pathways, including cell cycle regulation, DNA damage repair, autophagy, and immune response modulation (Kim2021USP13; Wang2022Role). Its dysregulation is associated with various diseases, notably cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2022Role; Ma2023USP13).

## Structure
USP13 is a deubiquitinating enzyme characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein consists of 863 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 97,327 Da (Tao2023Roles). Its primary structure includes a catalytic domain with an N-terminal Cys-box and a C-terminal His-box, which are typical features of ubiquitin-specific proteases (Shin2022USP13).

The secondary and tertiary structures of USP13 feature a zinc finger (ZnF) domain, which coordinates with the peptide chain in a C3H pattern, forming a zinc core (Tao2023Roles). The ZnF domain, however, does not bind ubiquitin, which differentiates it from its ortholog USP5 (Zhang2011Domain). The solution structure of USP13 includes a β-sheet of five strands flanked by two α-helices, forming an α/β sandwich fold (Tao2023Roles).

USP13 also contains two ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains, which are crucial for its interaction with ubiquitin. These domains have a canonical three-helix bundle fold and show a preference for binding K63-linked diubiquitin (Zhang2011Domain). The UBA domains play a significant role in the enzyme's function by acting as ubiquitin receptors (Tao2023Roles). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect USP13's activity, and alternative splicing may lead to different isoforms, potentially altering its structure and function (Wang2022Role).

## Function
USP13 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 13) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by removing ubiquitin from substrates, thereby preventing their degradation by the proteasome. In healthy human cells, USP13 is involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA damage repair, myoblast differentiation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control, and autophagy (Wang2022Role). It stabilizes the expression of specific substrates such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and is involved in the hydrolysis of K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which are associated with DNA repair, endocytosis, immune response, and lysosomal degradation (Tao2023Roles).

USP13 regulates the cell cycle by stabilizing the mitotic kinase Aurora B, crucial for chromosome segregation and cytokinesis (Tao2023Roles). It also interacts with TopBP1, a DNA replication repair protein, to regulate its stability and activate the ATR signaling pathway during replication stress (Kim2021USP13). USP13 is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) process by interacting with gp78, an E3 ligase, and modulating the ubiquitination of proteins involved in ERAD (Tao2023Roles). It also plays a role in autophagy by forming a complex with NEDD4 to regulate the ubiquitination of PIK3C3, promoting the degradation of damaged cellular organelles and maintaining cellular stability (Tao2023Roles).

## Clinical Significance
USP13 plays a significant role in various diseases, particularly cancers and neurodegenerative disorders, due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In cancer, USP13 exhibits a dual role, acting as both a tumor promoter and suppressor depending on the context. It is upregulated in cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, and glioblastoma, where it stabilizes oncogenic proteins like MCL-1 and c-Myc, promoting tumor growth (Wang2022Role; Tao2023Roles). Conversely, USP13 downregulation in breast carcinoma and bladder cancer suggests a tumor-suppressive role by stabilizing PTEN (Wang2022Role).

In gastric cancer, USP13 is upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis and promoting cell cycle progression by stabilizing cyclin D1 (Ma2023USP13). In ovarian cancer, USP13 amplification is linked to chemoresistance, affecting DNA repair and metabolic pathways (Han2016Amplification; Li2017USP13).

USP13 is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, where its increased expression is associated with pathological protein accumulation. Knockdown of USP13 in models reduces amyloid plaques and tau in Alzheimer's and improves motor performance in Parkinson's, suggesting potential therapeutic targets (Wang2022Role).

## Interactions
USP13 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. It is known to interact with Beclin1 and USP10, which is crucial for the stability of Vps34 complexes involved in autophagy and intracellular vesicular trafficking (Liu2011Beclin1). USP13 also interacts with the RAP80-BRCA1 complex, essential for the DNA damage response. It deubiquitinates RAP80, specifically removing K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which is crucial for RAP80's function in DNA repair (Li2017USP13).

USP13 is involved in the regulation of the transcription factor MITF by deubiquitinating it, thus preventing its degradation and stabilizing its protein levels (Zhao2011Regulation). It also interacts with STING, an adaptor protein for antiviral immunity, by removing K27-linked polyubiquitin chains, thereby modulating immune responses (Sun2017USP13).

USP13 forms a complex with NEDD4-1, which is essential for the deubiquitination and stabilization of VPS34, a key player in autophagy regulation (Xie2020Autoubiquitination). These interactions highlight USP13's role in various cellular pathways, including autophagy, DNA damage response, and immune regulation.
