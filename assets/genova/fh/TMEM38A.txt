# TMEM38A

## Overview
TMEM38A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 38A (TRIC-A), which is a trimeric intracellular cation channel-associated protein. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a pivotal role in ion channeling within the sarcoplasmic reticulum, particularly in excitable tissues such as skeletal muscle and brain. TRIC-A is essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis, facilitating the movement of potassium ions to balance calcium movements, which is crucial for processes like excitation-contraction coupling in muscle cells. Beyond its role in ion transport, TMEM38A is involved in gene regulation during myogenesis by repositioning specific gene loci to the nuclear envelope, thereby influencing muscle differentiation and function. The gene's expression is most prominent in skeletal muscle, with significant levels also found in the brain and heart, underscoring its importance in these tissues (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics; Kang2024Transmembrane; Todorow2023Nuclear).

## Structure
TMEM38A is a trimeric intracellular cation-selective channel, part of the TMEM38 family, which includes TMEM38A and TMEM38B. The protein forms a symmetrical homotrimeric complex, with each protomer containing an hourglass-shaped pore composed of seven transmembrane helices. The structure is organized into two domains, each with three helices (TM1-3 and TM4-6), arranged antiparallel to each other. Despite low sequence homology, the structure features lateral fenestrations that allow lipid molecules to enter the protein structure. Highly conserved glycine residues within TM2 and TM5 create kinks in the middle of the pore region, potentially affecting channel activity. Eukaryotic TMEM38A channels have specific structural features, such as lipid molecule binding sites and a calcium-binding site in the lumen, which are absent in prokaryotic TMEM38 channels. The voltage dependency of channel opening in eukaryotic TMEM38 relies on conserved lysine and arginine residues in the TM4 domain (Kang2024Transmembrane). TMEM38A is expressed in excitable tissues such as muscle and brain, localizing to the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane (Kang2024Transmembrane).

## Function
TMEM38A encodes a protein known as TRIC-A, which functions as a trimeric intracellular cation channel-associated protein. This protein is primarily involved in ion channeling within the sarcoplasmic reticulum, playing a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis in cells. TMEM38A is particularly important in excitable tissues such as skeletal muscle, where it facilitates the movement of potassium ions to balance calcium movements, essential for excitation-contraction coupling (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics).

In healthy cells, TMEM38A is also involved in gene regulation during myogenesis by repositioning specific gene loci to the nuclear envelope, enhancing their repression. This function is critical for proper muscle differentiation, as seen in its role in repositioning the DDR2 gene locus (Meinke2019A). TMEM38A is expressed at the nuclear envelope and is associated with the regulation of genes involved in signaling, cell communication, and metabolic processes (Todorow2023Nuclear).

The protein is expressed at moderately low levels in most tissues but shows the highest expression in skeletal muscle, with significant expression in the brain and heart, indicating its importance in these tissues (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM38A gene have been implicated in Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD), a condition characterized by muscle weakness and contractures. Specifically, mutations such as p.N260D and p.N260del disrupt the gene's role in repositioning the DDR2 gene locus to the nuclear envelope for repression during myogenesis, leading to misregulation of myogenic gene expression, which is a primary cause of EDMD pathology (Meinke2020A; Meinke2019A). TMEM38A, along with other nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins (NETs), is involved in gene regulation by directing gene repositioning during muscle development, and its mislocalization in EDMD muscle cells supports its role in the disease (Meinke2019A).

Alterations in TMEM38A expression have also been linked to other conditions. In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), TMEM38A expression is downregulated, correlating with muscle weakness, and is involved in regulating genes associated with muscle function (Todorow2023Nuclear). Additionally, TMEM38A expression is inversely correlated with disease severity in Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), suggesting its role in genome organization and gene expression regulation in this condition (Schätzl2024Metaanalysis). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TMEM38A in various muscular dystrophies and its potential impact on muscle gene expression and pathology.
