# GOLGA6L4

## Overview
GOLGA6L4 is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A6 family like 4, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. These proteins are typically involved in the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids in the cell. While the specific functions of golgin A6 family like 4 remain to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in various cellular processes, including those related to ovarian function and cancer pathogenesis. Mutations and dysregulation of GOLGA6L4 have been associated with several diseases, such as diminished ovarian reserve, cervical adenocarcinoma, and metastatic colon cancer, highlighting its potential role in both reproductive health and oncogenesis (Li2023Whole; Li2021Genomic; Lv2023Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GOLGA6L4 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) in young women, a study identified a frameshift deletion variant in GOLGA6L4 in 15% of the samples analyzed. This suggests a potential role for GOLGA6L4 in ovarian function, as the gene was among the top 20 mutated genes associated with DOR (Li2023Whole).

GOLGA6L4 has also been identified as a significantly mutated gene in cervical adenocarcinoma, particularly in cases associated with HPV integration. The mutation frequency of GOLGA6L4 in this context was noted to be over 10%, indicating its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of this cancer type (Li2021Genomic).

In metastatic colon cancer, GOLGA6L4 is part of a group of genes that exhibit transcriptional dysregulation, despite not being differentially expressed in original datasets. This dysregulation, captured by mqTrans values, suggests that GOLGA6L4 may play a role in cancer progression through altered gene expression patterns (Lv2023Transcriptional).

Additionally, GOLGA6L4 expression is up-regulated in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes treated with HAPLN1, indicating its potential involvement in inflammatory processes and cancer-like cell behavior (Chen2022HAPLN1).
