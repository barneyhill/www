# SCGB1D4

## Overview
SCGB1D4 is a gene that encodes the protein secretoglobin family 1D member 4, which is part of the secretoglobin family known for its involvement in various immunological and inflammatory processes. The protein is categorized as a small secreted protein and is implicated in the regulation of chemotactic migration and immune response modulation. It is expressed in several tissues, including the lymph nodes, tonsils, and ovaries, and is inducible by cytokines such as interferon-gamma, highlighting its role in immune system processes (Jackson2011Update). SCGB1D4 has been studied in the context of chronic rhinosinusitis and certain cancers, where its expression levels are altered, suggesting its potential involvement in disease pathogenesis and progression (Chang2019Genomic; Lu2011The).

## Function
SCGB1D4, a member of the secretoglobin family, is involved in various immunological functions, particularly in the regulation of chemotactic migration and invasion. It is widely expressed in the body, with notable presence in the lymph node, tonsil, cultured lymphoblasts, and ovary, suggesting a role in immune system processes (Jackson2011Update). The protein is inducible by interferon-gamma in lymphoblast cells, indicating its involvement in immune response modulation (Jackson2011Update).

In the context of chronic rhinosinusitis, SCGB1D4 expression is increased, especially in cases with nasal polyps, suggesting a role in inflammatory processes in the nasal mucosa (Lu2011The). Cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ have been shown to increase SCGB1D4 expression, while IL-4 and IL-13 decrease it, highlighting its regulation by inflammatory signals (Lu2011The). Although the specific functions of SCGB1D4 in healthy human cells are not fully understood, its expression patterns and inducibility by cytokines suggest it plays a role in maintaining immune homeostasis and responding to inflammatory stimuli (Lu2011The).

## Clinical Significance
The SCGB1D4 gene, part of the secretoglobin family, has been implicated in various clinical contexts due to its role in immune response modulation and chemotactic migration. In the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SCGB1D4 expression is notably down-regulated in African American populations, suggesting a potential link to the aggressive nature of TNBC in this group (Chang2019Genomic). This down-regulation may contribute to racial disparities observed in TNBC outcomes.

In breast cancer, SCGB1D4 expression is negatively regulated by the transcription factor HOXB7. When HOXB7 is depleted, SCGB1D4 is highly upregulated, indicating that its expression is suppressed by HOXB7. This suggests that alterations in SCGB1D4 expression could be involved in breast cancer pathogenesis, potentially affecting tumor progression and response to treatment (Heinonen2015Identification).

Additionally, SCGB1D4 is part of genomic regions enriched with secretoglobin family proteins in HBV-driven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These proteins, including SCGB1D4, are associated with immune response modulation, which may influence the progression of HCC in the context of HBV infection (Wang2021HBV). However, specific clinical implications of SCGB1D4 mutations or expression changes in HCC remain to be fully elucidated.
