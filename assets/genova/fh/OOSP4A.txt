# OOSP4A

## Overview
The OOSP4A gene encodes the oocyte secreted protein family member 4A, which is a member of a family of proteins involved in reproductive processes. This protein is primarily expressed in oocytes and plays a crucial role in the development and maturation of oocytes, as well as in fertilization. OOSP4A is categorized as a secreted protein, indicating its role in cell signaling and communication within the reproductive system. The precise mechanisms by which OOSP4A influences these processes are still under investigation, but its expression pattern suggests a significant function in female fertility and reproductive health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
