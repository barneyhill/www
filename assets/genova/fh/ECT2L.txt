# ECT2L

## Overview
The ECT2L gene encodes the protein epithelial cell transforming 2 like, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and cytoskeletal organization. ECT2L is a member of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) family, which are critical for activating Rho GTPases, thereby influencing cell morphology and movement. The protein's role in modulating the actin cytoskeleton makes it significant in processes such as cell division and migration. Dysregulation of ECT2L has been implicated in oncogenic pathways, suggesting its potential involvement in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Qiu2020aarFDC).
