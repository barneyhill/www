# TADA2A

## Overview
TADA2A is a gene that encodes the transcriptional adaptor 2A protein, a critical component of the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) and ATAC (ADA-Two-A-Containing) complexes, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. The protein functions as an adaptor subunit within these complexes, facilitating histone acetylation and thereby influencing gene expression. TADA2A is characterized by the presence of a SANT domain, which is essential for chromatin interaction and transcriptional activation. The protein's role in the PCAF and ATAC histone acetylase complexes underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability, regulating the cell cycle, and responding to cellular stress. Additionally, TADA2A's involvement in these complexes highlights its significance in cellular differentiation and homeostasis (Caburet2015Combined; Fischer2021The; Arede2021Buffering).

## Structure
TADA2A (transcriptional adaptor 2A) is a component of the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation. The protein structure of TADA2A includes several domains, notably the SANT domain, which is involved in chromatin interaction. This domain is essential for the protein's function in modulating chromatin structure and facilitating transcriptional activation. TADA2A may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions within the SAGA complex. The presence of different isoforms of TADA2A, resulting from alternative splicing, suggests a level of functional diversity, allowing the protein to participate in various regulatory pathways. These structural features and modifications enable TADA2A to effectively contribute to the dynamic regulation of gene expression through its role in the SAGA complex.

## Function
The TADA2A gene encodes an adaptor subunit of the PCAF and ATAC histone acetylase complexes, playing a crucial role in chromatin modification and transcription regulation in healthy human cells. Within the PCAF complex, TADA2A is essential for DNA-damage-induced acetylation of p53, a process necessary for promoting cell cycle arrest and cell survival following DNA damage. This function highlights TADA2A's role in maintaining genomic stability and promoting apoptosis in response to cellular stress (Caburet2015Combined).

TADA2A is also a component of the ATAC complex, where it participates in acetylating histones H3 and H4, influencing transcriptional regulation by modifying chromatin structure. The ATAC complex, which includes TADA2A, is involved in general regulatory cell processes and has distinct chromatin targets (Arede2021Buffering). TADA2A's activity in the nucleus is crucial for transcriptional activation, as it facilitates the recruitment of transcription machinery to active gene promoters and enhancers, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular differentiation (Fischer2021The).

Overall, TADA2A's involvement in these complexes underscores its importance in regulating cell cycle, stress response, and transcriptional stability, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the TADA2A gene, which encodes a component of the SAGA complex involved in chromatin remodeling, have been implicated in various diseases. In osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, the circular RNA derived from TADA2A, known as circTADA2A, is highly expressed and contributes to cancer progression and metastasis. CircTADA2A acts as a molecular sponge for miR-203a-3p, leading to the upregulation of CREB3, a gene that promotes osteosarcoma malignancy. This interaction enhances the migration, invasion, and proliferation of osteosarcoma cells, suggesting that circTADA2A plays a significant role in the disease's progression (Wu2019Circular).

In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), circTADA2A is downregulated in lung fibroblasts. Its reduced expression is associated with increased fibroblast proliferation and activation, contributing to the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix characteristic of IPF. Overexpression of circTADA2A has been shown to inhibit these processes, indicating its potential therapeutic role in managing IPF by modulating fibroblast activity (Li2020CircRNA). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TADA2A and its derived circRNA in both cancer and fibrotic diseases.

## Interactions
TADA2A, a component of the ATAC (ADA-Two-A-Containing) complex, plays a crucial role in transcription regulation through its interactions with various proteins. Within the ATAC complex, TADA2A is part of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) module, which includes GCN5, ADA3, and SGF29. This module is essential for the acetylation of histones, a key process in chromatin remodeling and gene expression (Helmlinger2021What; Yayli2023ATAC).

TADA2A specifically anchors the HAT module within the ATAC complex, distinguishing it from its paralog TADA2B, which is part of the SAGA complex. This specificity is crucial for the distinct functions of the ATAC complex in transcription regulation and cellular homeostasis (Arede2021Buffering; Fischer2021The).

The interactions of TADA2A within the ATAC complex are vital for its function. For instance, the SANT domain of TADA2A interacts with the GCN5 acetyltransferase domain, enhancing its activity by facilitating acetyl-CoA binding, which is necessary for effective histone acetylation (Helmlinger2021What; Espinola-Lopez2021The). These interactions underscore the importance of TADA2A in the assembly and function of the ATAC complex, contributing to its role in transcriptional regulation.
