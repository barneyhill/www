# CASS4

## Overview
CASS4, or Cas scaffold protein family member 4, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular signaling pathways, particularly those related to cell adhesion and migration. The CASS4 protein is a member of the CAS protein family, characterized by its role as a scaffold protein that facilitates interactions between various signaling molecules. It contains several conserved domains, including an N-terminal Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain, which is crucial for binding to proline-rich motifs, and a substrate domain with multiple YxxP sequences that serve as phosphorylation sites for SRC family kinases. These features enable CASS4 to participate in integrin-dependent signaling at focal adhesions, influencing the actin cytoskeleton and cellular motility. The protein is expressed in various tissues, with notable levels in the lung and spleen, and is implicated in several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and certain cancers, due to its involvement in key signaling pathways (Hassan2018Exploring; Deneka2015Embryonal; Tikhmyanova2009CAS).

## Structure
The CASS4 protein, encoded by the CASS4 gene, is a member of the CAS protein family and is characterized by several conserved domains. It contains an N-terminal Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain, which is crucial for binding to proline-rich motif-containing proteins and is 87.3% identical between murine and human CASS4 (Deneka2015Embryonal). The SH3 domain consists of 63 residues and is involved in activating various signaling proteins (Hassan2018Exploring). Following the SH3 domain is the substrate domain, which contains multiple YxxP sequences phosphorylated by SRC or SRC-related kinases, creating binding motifs for SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins. CASS4 has an estimated 10 potential SH2 binding sites (Deneka2015Embryonal).

The serine-rich domain contains a 4 α-helix bundle, predicted to have a conserved fold, although direct interacting partners have not been identified (Deneka2015Embryonal). The C-terminal domain is involved in interactions with SRC and Fyn kinase (Deneka2015Embryonal). CASS4 lacks the YDYVHL sequence found in other CAS proteins, which is typically phosphorylated to create a binding site for SRC-family proteins (Deneka2015Embryonal). The protein consists of 786 amino acids and includes several important domains, with the C-terminus region containing 357 residues known for its strong interaction with the SRC protein (Hassan2018Exploring). Molecular modeling suggests that CASS4 shares a similar fold with p130CAS/BCAR1, particularly within the SH3 domain and residues 432-591 (Deneka2015Embryonal).

## Function
CASS4 (Cas scaffold protein family member 4) is a member of the CAS protein family, which functions as a scaffold in cellular signaling pathways. It plays a crucial role in integrin-dependent signaling at focal adhesions, where it associates with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and SRC family kinases to regulate the actin cytoskeleton. This regulation is essential for processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and cytoskeletal organization (Deneka2015Embryonal; Tikhmyanova2009CAS).

CASS4 contains a highly conserved SH3 domain that binds to proline-rich motif-containing proteins, facilitating integrin-dependent cell adhesion. It also has a substrate domain with YxxP motifs phosphorylated by SRC kinases, creating binding sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins, which are crucial for cellular motility and migration (Deneka2015Embryonal). Despite lacking the YDYVHL site for Src SH2 domain docking, CASS4 undergoes attachment-induced Src phosphorylation, suggesting alternative interactions with FAK and Src (Deneka2015Embryonal).

CASS4 is expressed in various tissues, with the highest levels in the lung and spleen, and is involved in specialized cellular functions, potentially acting as an intracellular mechanoreceptor mediating responses to mechanical forces (Deneka2015Embryonal; Tikhmyanova2009CAS).

## Clinical Significance
CASS4 (Cas scaffold protein family member 4) has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. Genetic studies have linked CASS4 to Alzheimer's disease (AD), identifying a locus associated with lower susceptibility to AD at the CASS4 gene location. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CASS4 have been associated with AD susceptibility, suggesting a role in axonal transport and influence on amyloid precursor and tau proteins (Deneka2015Embryonal; Beck2014Adaptors). CASS4 is also considered a potential target for AD treatment due to its involvement in the formation of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and synaptic dysfunctions (Hassan2018Exploring).

In cancer, CASS4 is frequently amplified in tumors with genomic instability and is part of a common amplicon with the AURKA oncogene. Elevated CASS4 expression has been correlated with lymph node metastasis and high TNM stage in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Deneka2015Embryonal). In colorectal cancers, CASS4 is associated with chromosomal instability in BRAF mutant/MSS cancers (Deneka2015Embryonal).

Altered expression of CASS4 has also been linked to cystic fibrosis severity and progression, with a genome-wide association study identifying modifier loci for lung disease severity that include CASS4 (Deneka2015Embryonal).

## Interactions
CASS4 (Cas scaffold protein family member 4) is involved in several important protein interactions that play a role in cellular signaling pathways. The SH3 domain of CASS4 interacts with Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), a relationship demonstrated using a yeast two-hybrid approach (Deneka2015Embryonal). This interaction is crucial for cell attachment and movement, as CASS4 colocalizes with paxillin within focal adhesions in HOP-62 cells (Deneka2015Embryonal). Despite lacking the YDYVHL site for Src SH2 domain docking, CASS4 undergoes Src phosphorylation upon cell attachment, indicating that its interactions with FAK and Src are sufficient for this modification (Deneka2015Embryonal).

The substrate domain of CASS4 contains multiple YxxP sequences phosphorylated by SRC or SRC-related kinases, creating binding motifs for SH2 domain-containing proteins like Crk1/2 and Crk-L, which are involved in cellular motility and migration (Deneka2015Embryonal). CASS4 also directly binds with CRKL, promoting actin cytoskeleton reorganization (Deneka2015Embryonal). The C-terminal domain of CASS4 interacts with SRC and Fyn kinase, although direct partners for this region have not been fully identified (Deneka2015Embryonal). In the context of Alzheimer's disease, CASS4 interacts with protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2), also known as FAK, through its SH3 domain, influencing downstream signaling pathways (Hassan2018Exploring).
