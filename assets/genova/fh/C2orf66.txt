# C2orf66

## Overview
C2orf66 is a gene located on chromosome 2 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 2 open reading frame 66. This protein is categorized as a non-kinase, non-receptor protein, and its specific biological functions remain largely uncharacterized. Preliminary studies suggest that C2orf66 may play a role in cellular processes, although its exact mechanisms and interactions within the cell are not yet fully understood. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest in genomic studies due to their potential involvement in various cellular pathways and their implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
