# TEKTL1

## Overview
TEKTL1 (tektin like 1) is a gene that encodes a tektin-like protein involved in the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella, which are essential for cell motility and signaling. The protein, also known as CCDC105, is primarily active in the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, where it contributes to their stability and movement. TEKTL1 forms filaments in the cleft between protofilaments and interacts with several core and sperm-specific microtubule inner proteins, playing a role in stabilizing the outer junction of the axoneme (Nguyen2024Genedeficient). Despite its structural role, studies have shown that TEKTL1 is not critical for fertility, as mice deficient in this gene exhibit normal spermatogenesis and fertility, suggesting compensatory mechanisms by other proteins (Nguyen2024Genedeficient). The protein's function is similar to other tektin proteins, which are known to reinforce the tubulin wall of microtubule doublets, providing structural stability crucial for cellular processes like locomotion and sensory reception (Tai2023Incell).

## Function
TEKTL1 (tektin like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella, which are essential for cell motility and signaling. The protein is primarily active in the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, where it contributes to their stability and movement. TEKTL1 is a tektin-like sperm-microtubule inner protein that forms a filament in the cleft between protofilaments and binds several core and sperm-microtubule inner proteins, potentially stabilizing the outer junction of the axoneme (Nguyen2024Genedeficient). Despite its expected role in sperm structure, studies have shown that mice deficient in TEKTL1 exhibit normal spermatogenesis, sperm morphology, and in vivo fertility, suggesting that TEKTL1 may not be critical for fertility due to compensatory mechanisms by other proteins (Nguyen2024Genedeficient). The structural role of TEKTL1 is similar to that of other tektin proteins, which are known to reinforce the tubulin wall of microtubule doublets, providing structural stability to the axoneme (Tai2023Incell). This stability is crucial for processes like cellular locomotion and sensory reception.

## Interactions
TEKTL1, also known as CCDC105, is a tektin-like protein involved in the structural stability of sperm axonemal doublet microtubules (DMTs). It forms filaments in the cleft between protofilaments and binds several core and sperm-specific microtubule inner proteins (MIPs), contributing to the stabilization of the outer junction in sperm flagella (Nguyen2024Genedeficient). TEKTL1 interacts with other proteins such as TEX43 and CFAP77, which help stabilize its filamentous structure within the B-tubule of the sperm axoneme (Tai2023Incell). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the axoneme, which is essential for sperm motility.

Despite its involvement in sperm structure, studies using gene-deficient mouse models have shown that the absence of TEKTL1 does not impair fertility, suggesting that other proteins may compensate for its function (Nguyen2024Genedeficient). This indicates that while TEKTL1 plays a role in the structural framework of sperm, its interactions are not critical for fertility, highlighting the complexity of protein interactions in reproductive biology. The structural and functional similarities of TEKTL1 to other tektin-like proteins suggest a conserved role in reinforcing microtubule stability across different species (Zhou2024Structures).
