# EIF3L

## Overview
The EIF3L gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit L, a component of the eIF3 complex, which is integral to the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The eIF3 complex, including EIF3L, plays a pivotal role in the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex, facilitating the recruitment of mRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit and thus influencing translation initiation rates (Herrmannová2019Adapted). EIF3L is categorized as a translation initiation factor and is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of specific mRNA recruitment and cellular stress responses (Cattie2016Mutations). Its interactions with viral proteins, such as those from the yellow fever virus, suggest a role in modulating viral replication (Morais2013The). Additionally, EIF3L has been implicated in cancer and aging, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Cattie2016Mutations; Valášek2017Embraced).

## Function
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit L (EIF3L) is a component of the eIF3 complex, which plays a critical role in the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. EIF3L is involved in the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC), a crucial step in translation initiation. It aids in the recruitment of mRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit, facilitating the translation process (Herrmannová2019Adapted). EIF3L, along with other subunits like eIF3k, acts as a negative regulator of mRNA loading onto the 43S PIC, as its knockdown results in more efficient mRNA recruitment and increased initiation rates (Herrmannová2019Adapted).

EIF3L is also implicated in the regulation of specific mRNA recruitment, potentially interacting with the mRNA's 5' cap to mediate this process independently of other factors like eIF4E (Herrmannová2019Adapted). In the context of cellular stress and aging, loss-of-function mutations in EIF3L have been associated with increased lifespan and enhanced resistance to endoplasmic reticulum stress in model organisms, suggesting a broader regulatory role in cellular stress responses (Cattie2016Mutations). EIF3L is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of translation, impacting cell growth and proliferation.

## Clinical Significance
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit L (EIF3L) is implicated in various diseases through its altered expression and interactions. In cancer, deregulation of EIF3L expression has been associated with malignancies such as breast and prostate cancer, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis by affecting the expression of other eIF3 subunits (Valášek2017Embraced). The knockdown of EIF3L, along with other subunits like eIF3k, has been linked to changes in apoptotic responses and caspase 3 activity, which may influence cancer progression (Valášek2017Embraced).

In the context of viral infections, EIF3L interacts with the NS5 protein of the yellow fever virus (YFV), a member of the Flavivirus genus. This interaction may modulate viral replication, as overexpression of EIF3L has been shown to slightly inhibit YFV replication, although the exact physiological role remains unclear (Morais2013The). The interaction is mapped to a specific 80-amino acid region, with mutations in the FWELV motif abolishing this interaction, suggesting a potential mechanism for the virus to evade the host immune system (Morais2013The).

In Caenorhabditis elegans, loss-of-function mutations in EIF3L result in a 40% extension in lifespan and enhanced resistance to endoplasmic reticulum stress, indicating a role in aging and stress response pathways (Cattie2016Mutations). These findings suggest that EIF3L may have broader implications in cellular stress responses and longevity.

## Interactions
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit L (eIF3L) is involved in several protein interactions, primarily as part of the eIF3 complex, which is crucial for the initiation of translation. eIF3L interacts with the NS5 protein of the yellow fever virus (YFV) and other flaviviruses. This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed through in vitro binding and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays. The interaction domain was mapped to an 80-amino acid region of the NS5 protein, with specific residues in the FWELV motif being critical for the interaction (Morais2013The).

eIF3L also interacts with the M protein of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. This interaction suggests a potential role for eIF3L in inhibiting PEDV replication (Wang2020Identification).

Within the eIF3 complex, eIF3L is involved in the assembly of the 43S and 48S pre-initiation complexes. It is located more centrally in the eIF3 complex compared to other subunits and acts as a negative regulator of mRNA recruitment to the 43S PICs, influencing translation initiation rates (Herrmannová2019Adapted).
