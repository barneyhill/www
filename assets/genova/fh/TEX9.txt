# TEX9

## Overview
TEX9 is a gene that encodes the protein testis expressed 9, which is categorized as a cancer/testis antigen. This protein is predominantly expressed in the testis and various cancer types, but it is typically absent in normal somatic tissues, highlighting its potential significance in cancer biology (Jamin2021Combined). The TEX9 protein has been implicated in several cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, particularly in the context of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and keloid disorder. Its interaction with other proteins, such as eIF3b, suggests a role in the activation of signaling pathways like AKT, which are crucial for cancer progression (Xu2019TEX9). The differential expression of TEX9 in pathological conditions compared to normal tissues underscores its potential as a therapeutic target and a biomarker for certain diseases (Huang2022Combined).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The TEX9 gene has been implicated in the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Its expression is positively correlated with the expression of eIF3b, a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, which is known to promote ESCC progression. TEX9 and eIF3b synergistically enhance the proliferation and migration of ESCC cells while inhibiting apoptosis, primarily through the activation of the AKT signaling pathway. This suggests that alterations in TEX9 expression could contribute to the aggressiveness of ESCC and may serve as a potential therapeutic target (Xu2019TEX9).

In the context of keloid disorder, TEX9 has been shown to be downregulated in keloid lesions according to immunohistochemistry but unexpectedly upregulated in Western blot analysis. This discrepancy is attributed to potential differences in protein conformation in different experimental conditions. Overexpression of TEX9, along with other RNAs, can inhibit keloid fibroblast proliferation, alter cell cycle distribution, and promote apoptosis, indicating a potential role in the pathogenesis of keloid disorder (Huang2022Combined).

TEX9 is also identified as a cancer/testis gene, expressed in testis and various cancer types but not in normal somatic tissues, suggesting its potential role in cancer biology (Jamin2021Combined).
