# LRRFIP1

## Overview
The LRRFIP1 gene encodes the LRR binding FLII interacting protein 1, a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which facilitates its interaction with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and signal transduction pathways. As a transcriptional repressor, LRRFIP1 binds to GC-rich elements of growth factor genes, influencing cellular proliferation and differentiation (Takimoto2019Multidisciplinary). It is also a key player in the Wnt signaling pathway, modulating both canonical and noncanonical pathways, and acts as a cytosolic sensor for nucleic acids, thereby participating in immune responses (Takimoto2019Multidisciplinary). Clinically, alterations in LRRFIP1 expression are associated with various pathologies, including ischemic brain damage, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Goodall2010Transcription; DeGregorioRocasolano2020Comparative).

## Structure
The LRRFIP1 protein features a coiled-coil domain (LRRFIP1-CC) that forms a classic parallel, homodimeric coiled coil structure. This domain is characterized by ten heptad repeats and 22 helical turns, with a left-handed superhelical twist, and measures 122 Å in length (Nguyen2012Crystal). The coiled-coil domain is highly conserved across mammalian species and is necessary for interaction with the leucine-rich repeat domain of FLI (Nguyen2012Crystal). The dimeric structure is stable, as indicated by a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of Cα positions between the four chains in the asymmetric unit ranging from 0.33 to 0.87 Å (Nguyen2012Crystal).

The molecular surface of LRRFIP1-CC has a patch with negative electrostatic potential due to several acidic residues. Biophysical data confirm that LRRFIP1-CC is a dimer in solution, and the circular dichroism spectrum indicates an entirely α-helical secondary structure (Nguyen2012Crystal). The DNA-binding domain (DBD) of LRRFIP1, when isolated, is mostly unfolded or elongated but can bind DNA in an extended conformation, forming higher-order oligomers upon DNA binding (Nguyen2012Crystal). The coiled-coil domain plays a role in the oligomerization of LRRFIP1, particularly in the context of the DNA-binding domain (Nguyen2012Crystal).

## Function
LRRFIP1 (Leucine-rich repeat (in FLII) interacting protein 1) is involved in several critical molecular processes within healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the Wnt signaling pathway, participating in both the β-catenin dependent canonical pathway and the β-catenin independent noncanonical pathway. In the canonical pathway, LRRFIP1 enhances the transcription of genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1, while in the noncanonical pathway, it regulates the cytoskeletal system through interactions with RhoA and LARG (Takimoto2019Multidisciplinary). 

LRRFIP1 also functions as a cytosolic sensor for nucleic acids, activating β-catenin and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. This activation leads to the phosphorylation of β-catenin, which enhances its interaction with transcription activators, thereby increasing the transcription of type 1 interferon genes (Takimoto2019Multidisciplinary). 

In platelets, LRRFIP1 is implicated in thrombus formation and platelet function. It interacts with proteins involved in actin binding and remodeling, suggesting a role in regulating the platelet cytoskeleton. This regulation impacts platelet activation and thrombus formation, as evidenced by its correlation with fibrinogen binding to αIIb-β3 in response to ADP (Goodall2010Transcription).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LRRFIP1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In ischemic brain damage, LRRFIP1 is upregulated in response to oxygen and glucose deprivation, a model for ischemic conditions, and is associated with excitotoxic neuronal death. Its increased expression is linked to impaired glutamate uptake, potentially worsening neurological outcomes in stroke (DeGregorioRocasolano2020Comparative). In cancer, LRRFIP1 is involved in chromosomal translocations that can lead to myeloproliferative syndromes and is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it acts as a tumor-associated antigen. Its expression influences tumor growth, metastasis, and chemotherapy response, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis and treatment response (Takimoto2019Multidisciplinary).

LRRFIP1 also plays a role in platelet function and thrombus formation. Alterations in its expression can affect platelet activation and agglutination, impacting conditions like myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. Specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LRRFIP1 have been associated with increased risk of these cardiovascular diseases (Goodall2010Transcription; Yin2019LRRFIP1). In dyskeratosis congenita, gene fusions involving LRRFIP1 can disrupt platelet hemostasis, leading to bone marrow failure and increased cancer risk (Güllülü2024Linking).

## Interactions
LRRFIP1, also known as LRR binding FLII interacting protein 1, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It acts as a transcriptional repressor by binding to GC-rich elements of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and other growth factor/receptor genes, such as insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) and tumor growth factor-α (TGF-α) (Takimoto2019Multidisciplinary). LRRFIP1 interacts with non-coding RNAs upstream of the TNF-α gene, requiring other repressor proteins like EHZ2 and SUZ12 for genomic DNA binding (Takimoto2019Multidisciplinary).

The protein also binds to double-stranded RNA, acting as a TAR RNA interacting protein (TRIP) with HIV-1 dsRNA (Takimoto2019Multidisciplinary). It interacts with proteins such as MyD88, LARG, β-catenin, GRIP1, and p300, although the specific binding domains for these interactions have not been identified (Takimoto2019Multidisciplinary). LRRFIP1 is involved in the Wnt/canonical signaling pathway by enhancing β-catenin interactions with transcriptional activators and coactivators (Takimoto2019Multidisciplinary).

In the context of ischemic conditions, LRRFIP1 interacts with Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), with increased interaction observed under oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions (DeGregorioRocasolano2020Comparative). This interaction suggests a role in the cellular response to ischemic stress.
