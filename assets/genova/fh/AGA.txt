# AGA

## Overview
The AGA gene encodes the enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase, a lysosomal hydrolase that plays a critical role in the degradation of glycoproteins. This enzyme is part of the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolase superfamily and is essential for cleaving the N-glycosidic bond between L-asparagine and N-acetylglucosamine in glycoproteins, facilitating their breakdown and recycling within lysosomes (Tikkanen1996Functional; Arvio2016Aspartylglycosaminuria:). The AGA gene is located on chromosome 4q34 and mutations in this gene can lead to aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU), a rare lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of glycoasparagines, resulting in a range of clinical symptoms including developmental delays and intellectual disabilities (Goodspeed2021Aspartylglucosaminuria:; Roine2022Topological). The enzyme is synthesized as an inactive precursor that undergoes proteolytic cleavage to form active subunits, a process crucial for its function and stability (Saarela2001Molecular; Ikonen1993Lysosomal).

## Structure
Aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA) is a lysosomal enzyme involved in glycoprotein degradation. The primary structure of AGA is encoded by the AGA gene, resulting in a precursor polypeptide of 346 amino acids. This precursor undergoes co-translational cleavage of the signal peptide in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Saarela2001Molecular). The secondary structure of AGA includes a four-layer αββα-fold, characteristic of the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolase superfamily (SAARELA2004Autoproteolytic).

The tertiary structure of AGA reveals a stable enzyme with a deep funnel-shaped active site cleft formed by both subunits, with key catalytic residues such as Thr206 and Trp34 (Tikkanen1996Functional). The quaternary structure of AGA is a heterotetramer composed of two α and two β subunits, formed after the precursor is cleaved into 27 kDa pro-α and 17 kDa β subunits (Saarela1998Activation). These subunits are glycosylated, and the enzyme is transported to lysosomes via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor pathway (Saarela2001Molecular).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, as evidenced by the conversion of subunits into smaller bands upon treatment with N-glycosidase F (Halila1991Human). The enzyme's structure is crucial for its function, with mutations leading to aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) affecting its folding, dimerization, and transport (Saarela2001Molecular).

## Function
Aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA) is a lysosomal enzyme crucial for the degradation of glycoproteins in human cells. It specifically cleaves the N-glycosidic bond between the amino acid L-asparagine and the monosaccharide N-acetylglucosamine in glycoproteins, facilitating the breakdown and recycling of these molecules (Arvio2016Aspartylglycosaminuria:). AGA is synthesized as an inactive precursor polypeptide, which undergoes proteolytic cleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum to form two subunits: a 24 kDa amino-terminal subunit and a 17 kDa carboxy-terminal subunit. These subunits are non-covalently bound and necessary for the enzyme's activity (Enomaa1993Expression; Ikonen1993Lysosomal).

The enzyme functions primarily within lysosomes, where it ensures the proper degradation of glycoproteins, preventing the accumulation of undegraded glycoasparagines, which can lead to cellular dysfunction (Halila1991Human; Uusitalo1997Expression). AGA's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing lysosomal storage disorders such as aspartylglucosaminuria, which results from AGA deficiency (Arvio2016Aspartylglycosaminuria:). The enzyme's catalytic mechanism involves a novel process where the N-terminal residue acts as a nucleophile, similar to Ser proteinases, highlighting its unique role in cellular metabolism (Tikkanen1996Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AGA gene lead to aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU), a rare lysosomal storage disorder. AGU is characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase, resulting in the accumulation of glycoasparagines in tissues, which affects the entire body, including the central nervous system (Goodspeed2021Aspartylglucosaminuria:; Roine2022Topological). Clinical manifestations include developmental delays, intellectual disability, autistic features, skeletal abnormalities, and seizures, often leading to premature death (Goodspeed2021Aspartylglucosaminuria:; Uusitalo1999Toward).

The disease is more prevalent in the Finnish population due to a founder effect, with the AGU Fin major variant accounting for the majority of cases in Finland (Goodspeed2021Aspartylglucosaminuria:). Various mutations, including missense mutations, deletions, and splicing mutations, have been identified in different populations, affecting the enzyme's processing and function (Banning2016Identification; Ikonen1991Spectrum). Some mutations, such as the Ser72Pro, prevent proper proteolytic activation of the enzyme, leading to its accumulation in lysosomes (Peltola1996Ser72Pro). Despite ongoing research, no curative therapies exist, though enzyme replacement and gene therapy are being explored (Roine2022Topological).
