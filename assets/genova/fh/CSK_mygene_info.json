including the regulation of Src family kinases. It plays an important role in T-cell activation through its association with the protein encoded by the protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) gene. This protein also phosphorylates C-terminal tyrosine residues on multiple substrates, including the protein encoded by the SRC proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosine kinase gene. Phosphorylation suppresses the kinase activity of the Src family tyrosine kinases. An intronic polymorphism (rs34933034) in this gene has been found to affect B-cell activation and is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
