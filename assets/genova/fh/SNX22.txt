# SNX22

## Overview
The SNX22 gene encodes the protein sorting nexin 22, which is a member of the sorting nexin family involved in intracellular protein trafficking. Sorting nexins are characterized by the presence of a phox homology (PX) domain, which facilitates binding to phosphoinositides and association with cellular membranes. This interaction is essential for SNX22's role in endosomal sorting and signaling pathways, impacting processes such as receptor recycling and degradation. SNX22, along with other sorting nexins, targets phosphoinositide-rich membranes, contributing to the endosomal transport pathway and influencing cellular homeostasis and signaling (Chandra2019Classification; Yang2020Sorting).

## Function
Sorting nexin 22 (SNX22) is a member of the sorting nexin family, which is involved in intracellular protein trafficking. SNX22 contains a phox homology (PX) domain that binds phosphoinositides, aiding in its association with cellular membranes. This binding is crucial for its role in endosomal sorting and signaling pathways, which influence cellular processes such as receptor recycling and degradation, thereby impacting cellular homeostasis and signaling (Yang2020Sorting).

SNX22 is part of a group of proteins that target phosphoinositide-rich membranes, playing a role in the endosomal transport pathway. It is grouped with other sorting nexins like SNX3, SNX10, SNX11, SNX12, SNX23, and SNX24, which are involved in similar processes (Yang2020Sorting). The specific phosphoinositide binding preference of SNX22 is for PtdIns(3,4)P2, although the functional role of this preference is not fully understood (Chandra2019Classification).

While the precise functions of SNX22 in healthy human cells are not extensively detailed, its involvement in endosomal transport suggests a role in the regulation of membrane dynamics and protein sorting, which are essential for maintaining cellular function and signaling pathways (Yang2020Sorting).
