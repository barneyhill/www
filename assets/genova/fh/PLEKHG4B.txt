# PLEKHG4B

## Overview
PLEKHG4B is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology and RhoGEF domain containing G4B, which is a Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rho-GEF). This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal remodeling, particularly during the formation and maturation of epithelial cell-cell junctions. It functions by activating Cdc42, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, which is crucial for maintaining tissue architecture and homeostasis. The protein's activity is modulated through interactions with other proteins, such as ARHGEF11, ARHGEF12, and annexin A2 (ANXA2), which facilitate its localization to cell-cell junctions and enhance its role in actin dynamics. PLEKHG4B's involvement in these cellular processes underscores its significance in epithelial development and its potential implications in pathological conditions such as cancer metastasis (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B; Müller2018Spatial).

## Structure
PLEKHG4B is a protein involved in actin cytoskeletal remodeling, particularly during epithelial cell-cell junction formation. The protein is structurally related to Solo (ARHGEF40) and PLEKHG4 (puratrophin-1), sharing a common domain structure that includes a CRAL/TRIO domain, spectrin repeats in the medial region, and a C-terminal DH-PH domain. Unlike PLEKHG4, PLEKHG4B contains an N-terminal Solo domain (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B). The DH-PH domain is crucial for its function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), specifically activating Cdc42, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases (Müller2018Spatial).

PLEKHG4B interacts with other proteins such as ARHGEF11 and ARHGEF12, which modulate its activity and contribute to its role in Rho GTPase signaling pathways. This interaction is mediated by the N-termini of these proteins and can relieve autoinhibition of PLEKHG4B, enhancing its Cdc42 GEF activity (Müller2018Spatial). The protein's localization to cell-cell junctions is facilitated by its interaction with annexin A2 (ANXA2), which is essential for its function in actin cytoskeletal remodeling (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B). The specific molecular structure details, such as secondary or tertiary structures, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
PLEKHG4B is a Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rho-GEF) involved in actin cytoskeletal remodeling during the formation and maturation of epithelial cell-cell junctions. It plays a crucial role in regulating myosin activity, which is essential for the maturation of these junctions, thereby maintaining tissue architecture, development, and homeostasis (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B). PLEKHG4B specifically activates Cdc42, a Rho GTPase, and is involved in the transition from open to closed junctions by promoting actin bundle packing and β-catenin accumulation at cell-cell junctions (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B).

The protein localizes to cell-cell junctions and the nucleus, and its overexpression results in wider F-actin organization at the basal side of junctions (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B). PLEKHG4B suppresses the activation of RhoA-targeting GEFs, such as LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF, which are involved in the RhoA-ROCK pathway, thereby modulating myosin activity and facilitating junction maturation (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B). The protein interacts with annexin A2 (ANXA2), which is necessary for its localization to cell-cell adhesions, further supporting its role in epithelial junction integrity (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B).

## Interactions
PLEKHG4B interacts with several proteins that play crucial roles in actin cytoskeletal remodeling and cell-cell junction formation. A significant interaction is with annexin A2 (ANXA2), a phospholipid and actin-binding protein. ANXA2 is essential for the localization of PLEKHG4B to cell-cell adhesions. This interaction was confirmed through co-precipitation assays, which demonstrated that both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of ANXA2 are necessary for full binding activity. Knockdown of ANXA2 reduces the localization of PLEKHG4B to cell-cell adhesions and affects epithelial junction integrity, similar to the effects observed with PLEKHG4B knockdown (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B).

PLEKHG4B also interacts with RhoA-targeting guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), specifically LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF. These interactions are involved in the RhoA-ROCK pathway, which is crucial for junction maturation by decreasing myosin activity. PLEKHG4B suppresses the activation of these GEFs, thereby influencing the formation and maturation of cell-cell junctions (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B).

These interactions highlight PLEKHG4B's role in modulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics and its involvement in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion processes, with implications for epithelial development and cancer metastasis (Ninomiya2021PLEKHG4B).
