# KAZN

## Overview
KAZN, also known as kazrin, periplakin interacting protein, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion. The protein kazrin, categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein, plays a pivotal role in maintaining cell structure and integrity by interacting with periplakin and other proteins. It is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, contributing to the maintenance of skin barrier function and the differentiation of keratinocytes, which are essential for tissue development and repair (HernandezPerez2021Kazrin). In pathological contexts, such as oral squamous cell carcinoma, KAZN has been implicated in oncogenic processes, where its overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation and migration, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yan2021Silencing).

## Structure


## Function
KAZN (kazrin, periplakin interacting protein) is involved in several cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion. It interacts with periplakin and other proteins to maintain cell structure and integrity, playing a crucial role in the stability and function of the cytoskeleton. KAZN is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, contributing to the maintenance of skin barrier function and the differentiation of keratinocytes, which are essential for tissue development and repair. These activities are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial tissues and ensuring proper cellular responses to environmental changes.

In the context of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), KAZN has been identified as having an oncogenic role, where its overexpression promotes cell proliferation and migration, while inhibiting apoptosis. This is mediated through its interaction with the long non-coding RNA LINC00284 and the RNA-binding protein FUS, which increases the stability of KAZN mRNA, thereby enhancing its expression in cancer cells (Yan2021Silencing). However, the specific functions of KAZN in healthy human cells, beyond its role in cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion, are not detailed in the provided context.

## Clinical Significance
The KAZN gene, known for its role in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In ovarian cancer, KAZN mRNA expression is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, as demonstrated by analyses of TCGA, GTEx, and GEO datasets. This upregulation is associated with poorer overall survival in patients, suggesting that KAZN acts as a risk factor and potential diagnostic marker for ovarian cancer (Zhu2022KAZN). The study also highlights that specific methylation patterns of KAZN, particularly at CpG sites, correlate with different stages of ovarian cancer, indicating its potential as a diagnostic marker (Zhu2022KAZN).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), KAZN mRNA stability is enhanced by the interaction with the long non-coding RNA LINC00284 and the RNA-binding protein FUS. This stabilization promotes malignant behaviors such as increased cell proliferation and migration, underscoring KAZN's oncogenic role in OSCC (Yan2021Silencing). These findings suggest that KAZN's altered expression and interactions contribute to cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
Kazrin (KAZN) is known to participate in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It acts as an endosomal adaptor for the dynein/dynactin complex, facilitating the transport of early endosomes (EEs) to recycling endosomes (REs). The C-terminal domain of kazrin C, an isoform of KAZN, interacts with components of EEs, such as EHD proteins, clathrin, and γ-adaptin, which are involved in endosomal trafficking (HernandezPerez2021Kazrin). Kazrin C also interacts directly with the dynactin complex, including p150-glued, and with kinesin-1, a motor protein associated with EEs (HernandezPerez2021Kazrin). These interactions are not mediated by microtubules, as shown by the lack of co-immunoprecipitation with tubulin (HernandezPerez2021Kazrin).

Kazrin is also associated with desmosomes and adherens junction components, interacting with p120-catenin family members and the desmosomal component periplakin (HernandezPerez2021Kazrin). In the context of cancer, KAZN interacts with the RNA-binding protein FUS, which stabilizes KAZN mRNA in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells (Yan2021Silencing). These interactions highlight KAZN's role in cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and cancer progression.
