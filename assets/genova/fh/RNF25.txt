# RNF25

## Overview
RNF25 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 25, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination and degradation. The protein plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the degradation of specific proteins, particularly under conditions of cellular stress. It is involved in the quality control of protein synthesis by mediating the ubiquitination of elongation factor-1α and ribosomal proteins during ribosome stalling events, thus facilitating the resumption of translation (Oltion2022An). Additionally, ring finger protein 25 is implicated in signal transduction pathways, such as NF-kappaB-mediated transcription, and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Gurzeler2023Druginduced; Ding2008EGF). The protein's interactions and modifications, such as phosphorylation by protein kinase A, further underscore its role in cellular responses to oxidative stress and its involvement in cancer progression and drug resistance (Huang2022Oxidative; Cho2018RNF25).

## Structure


## Function
RNF25, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination and degradation of specific proteins, particularly in response to cellular stress and drug treatments. In healthy human cells, RNF25 is involved in the degradation of elongation factor-1α (eEF1A) and certain ribosomal proteins during ribosome stalling events. This process is part of a quality control mechanism that ensures proper protein synthesis by clearing stalled ribosomes, allowing translation to resume (Oltion2022An). RNF25 interacts with GCN1 and RNF14 to mediate these ubiquitination events, highlighting its role in translation elongation and termination processes (Oltion2022An).

RNF25 also supports NF-kappaB-mediated transcription by interacting with its p65 subunit, indicating its involvement in signal transduction pathways (Gurzeler2023Druginduced). Additionally, RNF25 is implicated in the ubiquitination of the 40S ribosomal protein RPS27A, which may act as a signal for ribosome stalling (Oltion2022An). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it regulates protein turnover and cellular responses to stress (Ding2008EGF).

## Clinical Significance
RNF25 has been implicated in the progression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overexpression of RNF25 is associated with increased metastasis and poor prognosis in HCC patients. It acts as an E3 ligase for E-cadherin (ECAD), promoting its degradation, which in turn activates the YAP signaling pathway. This activation leads to enhanced cell migration, invasion, and metastasis, contributing to the aggressive nature of HCC. High RNF25 expression correlates with poor overall survival in HCC patients, making it a potential prognostic marker (Huang2022Oxidative).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RNF25 is involved in resistance to gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in treating EGFR-mutant NSCLC. RNF25 contributes to drug resistance by reactivating the ERK signaling pathway through NF-κB-mediated mechanisms. This reactivation provides pro-survival signals that help cancer cells evade the effects of gefitinib. Depletion of RNF25 has been shown to increase sensitivity to gefitinib, suggesting that targeting RNF25 could be a strategy to overcome drug resistance in NSCLC (Cho2018RNF25).

## Interactions
RNF25, a RING finger protein, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for E-cadherin (ECAD), promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is enhanced under oxidative stress conditions, contributing to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells (Huang2022Oxidative). RNF25 also interacts with the Yes-associated protein (YAP), forming a positive feedback loop that enhances YAP transcriptional activity and promotes HCC metastasis (Huang2022Oxidative).

RNF25 is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA), specifically the PRKACB isoform, which enhances its ability to mediate ECAD degradation. This phosphorylation is influenced by oxidative stress, indicating a role for RNF25 in redox-sensitive signaling pathways (Huang2022Oxidative). Additionally, RNF25 interacts with the p65 subunit of NF-κB, enhancing NF-κB-mediated transcription and contributing to drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (Cho2018RNF25).

Structurally, RNF25 interacts with E2 enzymes UBE2D2 and UBE2E3 through a specialized helix, D2E3BR, which binds to the UBC backside of these E2s. This interaction suggests dual specificity, as RNF25 can modulate ubiquitination processivity depending on the E2 enzyme involved (Gundogdu2019Structural).
