# SPC24

## Overview
SPC24 is a gene that encodes a protein component of the NDC80 kinetochore complex, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. The SPC24 protein, categorized as a structural component of the kinetochore, plays a critical role in ensuring accurate kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which are vital for the fidelity of the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC) and successful cell division. The SPC24 protein, in conjunction with SPC25, forms a subcomplex that anchors the NDC80 complex to the kinetochore, facilitating stable microtubule attachment and tension necessary for chromosome alignment and segregation (Wei2006Structure; Kim2024Coregulation). Disruption of SPC24 function can lead to significant mitotic defects, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability. Additionally, SPC24 has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with disease progression and poor clinical outcomes, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Chen2021Increased; Gao2020Development).

## Function
SPC24 is a critical component of the NDC80 complex, which plays a vital role in mitosis by ensuring proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments. This complex is essential for the fidelity of the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC) and accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. SPC24, along with SPC25, forms a subcomplex that anchors the NDC80 complex to the kinetochore, facilitating stable microtubule attachment and tension necessary for chromosome alignment and segregation (Wei2006Structure; Kim2024Coregulation).

The depletion of SPC24 leads to significant mitotic defects, including mitotic arrest, slippage, and cell death, due to the destabilization of other NDC80 complex subunits. This indicates that SPC24 is crucial for maintaining the stability and function of the entire complex (Kim2024Coregulation). SPC24 is also involved in maintaining interkinetochore and intercentrosomal distances, which are important for accurate chromosome segregation (Kim2024Coregulation).

SPC24's role in the SAC is highlighted by its involvement in the transient activation of the checkpoint, as evidenced by the enrichment of MAD2 at kinetochores upon SPC24 depletion. This suggests that SPC24 is essential for preventing premature anaphase onset and ensuring proper mitotic progression (Kim2024Coregulation).

## Clinical Significance
SPC24, a component of the NDC80 kinetochore complex, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in chromosome segregation during mitosis. Alterations in SPC24 expression have been linked to prostate cancer (PCa), where high expression levels are associated with increased age, higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values, lymph node metastasis, and negative clinical outcomes. SPC24's expression is also elevated in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatitis, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic marker for prostatic diseases (Chen2021Increased).

In breast cancer, particularly Her2-positive subtypes, SPC24 is overexpressed and contributes to tumorigenesis by activating the EGFR/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Its expression levels correlate with copy number variations (CNVs), which may drive cancer progression and impact prognosis (Gao2020Development).

SPC24 is also implicated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), where it is upregulated and associated with cell cycle regulation and DNA repair pathways, indicating its role in disease progression (Lan2022FAT1). In prostate cancer, SPC24 is part of a prognostic model that predicts recurrence-free survival, highlighting its clinical significance in assessing patient outcomes (Liu2022Comprehensive). These findings underscore SPC24's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer.

## Interactions
SPC24 is a component of the NDC80 kinetochore complex, which plays a crucial role in chromosome segregation during mitosis. It interacts with other subunits of the NDC80 complex, including SPC25, NDC80, and NUF2, forming a stable structure essential for kinetochore-microtubule attachment and spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) function (Kim2024Coregulation). The SPC24-SPC25 subcomplex is particularly important for the stability and function of the entire NDC80 complex, although it alone is insufficient to maintain SAC activation without the presence of NDC80 and NUF2 (Kim2024Coregulation).

The interaction between SPC24 and SPC25 is characterized by a strong association, with the SPC24-SPC25 heterodimer forming a unique structure with an antiparallel beta sheet sandwiched between two helices, creating a butterfly-like shape. This interaction is crucial for the stability of SPC25, which is partially unfolded in the absence of SPC24 (Wei2006Structure).

SPC24 also interacts with other proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as BUB1, and is implicated in various cancers, including prostate cancer, where it is associated with increased expression and poor clinical outcomes (Chen2021Increased). In hepatocellular carcinoma, SPC24 is targeted by hsa-mir-7-5p, which negatively regulates its expression, highlighting a potential therapeutic interaction (Wang2021hsamiR75p).
