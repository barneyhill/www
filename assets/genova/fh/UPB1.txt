# UPB1

## Overview
The UPB1 gene encodes the enzyme beta-ureidopropionase 1, a member of the nitrilase superfamily, which is crucial for the pyrimidine degradation pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the final step in the breakdown of pyrimidine bases, converting N-carbamyl-β-alanine and N-carbamyl-β-aminoisobutyric acid into β-alanine and β-aminoisobutyric acid, respectively. These reactions are vital for preventing the accumulation of toxic intermediates that can lead to neurological and developmental issues (van2004βUreidopropionase; Nakajima2014Clinical). The enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, where it helps maintain the homeostasis of β-amino acids, which is important for normal neurological function (van2004βUreidopropionase). Mutations in the UPB1 gene can lead to beta-ureidopropionase deficiency, a rare metabolic disorder with variable clinical manifestations, including neurological abnormalities (Lee2014A; van2012ßUreidopropionase).

## Structure
The UPB1 gene encodes the enzyme beta-ureidopropionase, which is involved in the pyrimidine degradation pathway. The enzyme consists of 384 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 43,158 Da (van2012ßUreidopropionase). It belongs to the nitrilase superfamily and shares 63% sequence identity with the beta-ureidopropionase from Drosophila melanogaster, whose crystal structure has been determined (van2012ßUreidopropionase).

The core structure of beta-ureidopropionase is an αββα-sandwich, which is a common fold within the nitrilase superfamily (Cederfelt2023The). The enzyme's structure includes a central β-sandwich flanked by α-helices, and it is extended at the N-terminus by approximately 65 amino acids, forming additional structural elements that contribute to the monomer-monomer interface (van2012ßUreidopropionase). The dimerization involves a 4-helical bundle formed by interactions between the first two helices (van2012ßUreidopropionase).

Beta-ureidopropionase can exist in multiple oligomeric states, including dimers, tetramers, hexamers, and octamers, as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy studies (Cederfelt2023The). The enzyme's oligomerization is crucial for its function, and mutations affecting the dimer-dimer interfaces can lead to significant decreases in enzymatic activity (van2012ßUreidopropionase). The enzyme's structure is also influenced by pH and substrate concentration, which can shift the equilibrium towards larger oligomeric forms (Cederfelt2023The).

## Function
The UPB1 gene encodes the enzyme β-ureidopropionase, which plays a critical role in the pyrimidine degradation pathway. This enzyme is responsible for the final step in the catabolism of pyrimidine bases, specifically converting N-carbamyl-β-alanine and N-carbamyl-β-aminoisobutyric acid into β-alanine and β-aminoisobutyric acid, respectively, with the concomitant production of ammonia and carbon dioxide (van2004βUreidopropionase; Nakajima2014Clinical). These reactions are essential for maintaining normal levels of pyrimidine bases and their degradation products, preventing the accumulation of toxic intermediates that can lead to neurological and developmental issues (van2004βUreidopropionase).

In healthy human cells, β-ureidopropionase is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, where it helps in the breakdown of N-carbamyl-β-amino acids (van2004βUreidopropionase). The enzyme's activity is crucial for preventing the accumulation of substrates like N-carbamyl-β-alanine and N-carbamyl-β-aminoisobutyric acid, which can inhibit other enzymes in the pathway and potentially lead to neurological abnormalities if not properly metabolized (van2004βUreidopropionase). The proper functioning of the UPB1 gene is essential for maintaining the homeostasis of these β-amino acids, which is important for normal neurological function (van2004βUreidopropionase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UPB1 gene, which encodes the enzyme beta-ureidopropionase, lead to beta-ureidopropionase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. This condition is characterized by a range of clinical manifestations, including neurological abnormalities such as intellectual disabilities, seizures, and microcephaly (Lee2014A; van2012ßUreidopropionase). The deficiency results in the accumulation of pyrimidine degradation products, specifically N-carbamyl-β-alanine and N-carbamyl-β-aminoisobutyric acid, in urine and plasma (van2004βUreidopropionase; van2012ßUreidopropionase).

The clinical phenotype of beta-ureidopropionase deficiency is highly variable, ranging from severe neurological involvement to asymptomatic cases (Nakajima2014Clinical). The most common mutation associated with this deficiency is the c.977G>A (p.R326Q) mutation, which is prevalent in Japanese patients and results in significantly reduced enzyme activity (Nakajima2014Clinical). Other mutations, such as p.E271K and p.G31S, also contribute to the deficiency by affecting enzyme function and stability (Nakajima2014Clinical).

The pathogenesis of the clinical symptoms may be due to the loss of physiological function of absent pathway metabolites rather than the toxicity of accumulated metabolites (Nakajima2014Clinical). The condition may have low penetrance, with some individuals remaining asymptomatic despite carrying mutations (Nakajima2014Clinical).
