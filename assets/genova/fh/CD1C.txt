# CD1C

## Overview
The CD1C gene encodes the CD1c protein, a member of the CD1 family of glycoproteins, which are integral to the immune system's ability to present lipid and glycolipid antigens to T cells. The CD1c protein is a transmembrane molecule predominantly expressed on antigen-presenting cells, such as B cells and dendritic cells, and plays a pivotal role in the immune response by facilitating the recognition of lipid-based antigens, including those from pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Adams2013Diverse; Scharf2010The). Structurally, CD1c is characterized by its α1, α2, and α3 domains, which form a complex with beta-2 microglobulin, creating a unique ligand-binding platform that accommodates a diverse array of lipid antigens (Roy2014Molecular; Scharf2010The). This structural versatility allows CD1c to interact with both αβ and γδ T cells, thereby modulating immune responses to infectious agents and contributing to immune surveillance (Scharf2010The). The clinical significance of CD1C is underscored by its involvement in various diseases, including leukemia and tuberculosis, where alterations in its expression can impact disease progression and treatment outcomes (Consonni2021Human; Roy2014Molecular).

## Structure
The CD1c protein is a member of the CD1 family, which is involved in lipid antigen presentation. Its structure is composed of α1, α2, and α3 domains that assemble noncovalently with the beta-2 microglobulin (β2m) subunit, forming a quaternary structure (Scharf2010The). The α1 and α2 domains create the ligand-binding platform, characterized by two alpha helices supported by a six-stranded beta sheet, forming two distinct ligand-binding cavities, A' and F' (Roy2014Molecular; Scharf2010The). The A' pocket is a wide circular tunnel with a constriction that selects for lipids with methylated branches, while the F' pocket is open to the solvent, allowing for the accommodation of diverse ligands (Scharf2010The).

CD1c exhibits structural flexibility, with the ability to undergo conformational changes depending on ligand occupancy. This flexibility is particularly evident in the F' channel region, which undergoes transformations upon binding optimal ligands (Mansour2016Cholesteryl). The protein's tertiary structure includes a unique open groove ideally suited for diverse antigen presentation, allowing it to bind various lipid species (Scharf2010The). Common post-translational modifications of CD1c include glycosylation, which is typical for members of the CD1 family (Scharf2010The).

## Function
The CD1C gene encodes the CD1c molecule, a member of the CD1 family of glycoproteins involved in the presentation of lipid and glycolipid antigens to T cells. CD1c is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as B cells, myeloid dendritic cells, and thymocytes. It plays a crucial role in the immune response by presenting lipid-based antigens, including those from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, to T cells (Adams2013Diverse; Scharf2010The).

CD1c is unique among CD1 isoforms for its ability to present a wide range of lipid antigens, including mycobacterial phosphoketides, polyisoprenoids, and lipopeptides with long peptide moieties. This diversity is facilitated by its structural features, such as the open F0 groove, which allows for the binding of diverse lipid antigens (Scharf2010The). The protein interacts with both αβ and γδ T cells, mediating T cell responses to infectious pathogens (Scharf2010The).

In healthy human cells, CD1c is involved in immune surveillance and response, particularly in the endocytic system, where it surveys early and late endosomes similar to MHC class II proteins (Scharf2010The). CD1c+ dendritic cells also promote Th1 and Th17 effector functions in memory CD4+ T cells, contributing to the immune response by producing cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p70, and IL-23 (Leal2017Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CD1C gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of leukemia and lymphoma. CD1c is abundantly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), making it a potential target for immunotherapy. Studies have shown that engineered T cells with a CD1c-specific TCR can effectively target and kill CD1c-expressing leukemia cells, suggesting a promising approach for adoptive cell therapy in these malignancies (Consonni2021Human).

In familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL), the expression of CD1C and other CD1 isoforms is reduced, which may contribute to impaired immune responses. This down-regulation affects the presentation of lipid antigens to T cells, potentially impacting pathogen detection and clearance (Sumegi2011Gene).

CD1c also plays a role in the immune response to mycobacterial infections, such as tuberculosis. It presents mycobacterial lipid antigens to T cells, and its expression is associated with CD1c-dependent polyclonal responses in tuberculosis patients (Roy2014Molecular). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CD1C in both cancer and infectious diseases.

## Interactions
The CD1c molecule is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in immune response modulation. CD1c interacts with T-cell receptors (TCRs) on T cells, facilitating the presentation of lipid antigens. This interaction is crucial for the recognition of mycobacterial lipid antigens, such as phosphomycoketide (PM) and mannosyl-β1-phosphomycoketide (MPM), by αβ T cells. The DN6 TCR, for instance, specifically recognizes PM when presented by CD1c, highlighting the specificity and diversity of TCRs in recognizing CD1c-presented antigens (Roy2014Molecular).

CD1c also interacts with immunoglobulin-like transcript 4 (ILT4), a member of the leukocyte receptor family. This interaction is competitive with CD1d, as CD1c binds to ILT4 with higher affinity, potentially modulating CD1d-mediated natural killer T (NKT) cell recognition. The binding of CD1c to ILT4 involves the first two Ig domains of ILT4, and this interaction can regulate the inhibitory effects of ILT4 on CD1d, thereby influencing NKT cell activity (Li2012A). These interactions underscore the role of CD1c in immune regulation and its potential as a target for modulating immune responses.
