# GABPB1

## Overview
GABPB1 is a gene that encodes the GA binding protein transcription factor subunit beta 1, a critical component of the heteromeric transcription factor complex known as GA-binding protein (GABP). This protein is categorized as a transcription factor and plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression related to mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular energy metabolism. GABPB1 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, protein synthesis, and cell differentiation, by forming a tetrameric complex with GABPA, which facilitates DNA binding and transcriptional activation. The protein's structure is characterized by ankyrin repeats and a carboxy-terminal dimerization domain, which are essential for its interactions and functional activities. GABPB1 is also implicated in the regulation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and is associated with several cancers, where its expression and regulation can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Wang2024GABPB1; Sun2023HOMER3; de1994Molecular).

## Structure
The GABPB1 protein is a component of the heterotetrameric transcription factor GABP, which includes GABPA and GABPB subunits. The primary structure of GABPB1 features ankyrin repeats and a carboxy-terminal dimerization domain. The ankyrin repeats, located at residues 1-130, are crucial for protein-protein interactions, including binding to GABPA (de1994Molecular). The carboxy-terminal dimerization domain, spanning residues 334-382, functions as a coiled-coil alpha-helix, facilitating both homodimerization and heterodimerization with GABPB2 (de1994Molecular).

GABPB1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, such as GABPB1-1 and GABPB1-2. The GABPB1-1 isoform contains the dimerization domain, which is absent in GABPB1-2 (de1994Molecular). The protein's quaternary structure involves forming a tetrameric complex with GABPA, which is essential for DNA binding and transcriptional activation (de1994Molecular).

The dimerization domains of GABPB1 and GABPB2 exhibit a four/three repeat pattern typical of coiled-coil proteins, characterized by conserved hydrophobic residues that suggest a polarized distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues (de1994Molecular). This structural feature is similar to the leucine zipper of bZIP proteins, although GABPB1 does not dimerize with the leucine zipper of C/EBP (de1994Molecular).

## Function
GABPB1 encodes a subunit of the GA-binding protein (GABP), a heteromeric transcription factor involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, GABPB1 plays a crucial role in mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular energy metabolism. It acts as a master regulator of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, influencing mitochondrial function, including oxygen consumption and ATP production (Sun2023HOMER3). GABPB1 is also involved in maintaining the balance between cellular energy metabolism and oxidative stress resistance, contributing to the regulation of interactions between mitochondria and the nucleoplasm (Wang2024GABPB1).

GABPB1 functions in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and regulates the transcription of target genes. This regulation is essential for processes such as cell cycle progression, protein synthesis, and cell differentiation (Wang2024GABPB1). GABPB1 is part of a transcriptional regulatory module that is critical for the maintenance and differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, directly influencing genes involved in survival, differentiation, and quiescence (Yu2011GABP). Through these activities, GABPB1 supports the self-renewal and functionality of stem cells, playing a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and regulation of the GABPB1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In thyroid cancer, particularly anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), GABPB1 is significantly downregulated and hypermethylated, which is associated with aggressive cancer features and shorter disease-free survival (Xing2022Downregulation). The downregulation of GABPB1 in thyroid cancer cells leads to increased invasiveness, despite reduced TERT expression, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Xing2022Downregulation).

In glioblastoma, the β1L isoform of GABPB1 is crucial for the activation of the mutant TERT promoter. Disruption of this isoform results in telomere dysfunction and loss of replicative immortality, indicating its role in maintaining tumor growth in TERT promoter mutant glioblastoma (Mancini2018Disruption).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), GABPB1 is involved in mitochondrial metabolism and is associated with the growth and metastasis of cancer cells. Its expression is positively correlated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (Sun2023HOMER3).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the lncRNA GABPB1 intronic transcript 1 (GABPB1-IT1) is downregulated, correlating with poor survival. It acts as a miRNA sponge, influencing cell proliferation and tumor growth (Li2021lncRNA).

## Interactions
GABPB1, a subunit of the GA binding protein (GABP) transcription factor complex, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a multimeric complex with GABPA, where GABPA binds to DNA through its ETS domain, and GABPB1 contains the transcription activation domain (Chen2018Knockdown). In hepatocellular carcinoma cells, GABPB1 interacts with its antisense RNA, GABPB1-AS1, forming RNA duplexes that suppress the translation of GABPB1 by blocking the recruitment of its mRNA to polysomes, which are essential for protein synthesis (Qi2019LncRNA).

GABPB1 also interacts with BAIAP2L2, which inhibits its ubiquitin-mediated degradation, promoting its stability and nuclear translocation. This interaction is mediated through the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of BAIAP2L2, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays (Jia2022BAIAP2L2). In non-small cell lung cancer, GABPB1 is regulated by HOMER3, which influences mitochondrial metabolism. HOMER3 and GABPB1 are positively correlated, and GABPB1 is identified as a master regulator of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes (Sun2023HOMER3). These interactions highlight GABPB1's role in cellular processes such as mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative stress regulation.
