# OXTR

## Overview
The OXTR gene encodes the oxytocin receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in mediating the physiological and behavioral effects of the neuropeptide oxytocin. As a member of the class A/rhodopsin family of GPCRs, the oxytocin receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, which facilitate its function in signal transduction across the cell membrane (Busnelli2017Molecular; Antobreh2017Molecular). The receptor is involved in a variety of biological processes, including social behavior, reproduction, and emotional regulation, by activating intracellular signaling pathways such as MAPK and PKC (Jurek2018The). OXTR is expressed in several brain regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus, where it influences memory, fear response, and social interactions (Jurek2018The). The gene's polymorphisms and epigenetic modifications have been associated with psychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in mental health (Wei2023Involvement; Gregory2009Genomic).

## Structure
The oxytocin receptor (OXTR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) belonging to the class A/rhodopsin family, composed of 389 amino acids. Its primary structure includes seven highly conserved hydrophobic transmembrane alpha helices (7TM) that span the cell membrane, connected by three intracellular loops (ICL1, ICL2, ICL3) and three extracellular loops (ECL1, ECL2, ECL3) (Busnelli2017Molecular; Antobreh2017Molecular). The extracellular regions are responsible for ligand binding, while the intracellular regions interact with G proteins to trigger signaling cascades (Antobreh2017Molecular).

The tertiary structure of OXTR involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, forming a ligand-binding pocket that is highly conserved across species (Busnelli2017Molecular). The receptor can form dimers or oligomers, indicating a quaternary structure, with specific dimeric forms associated with high-affinity states (Busnelli2016Design). 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation can influence receptor function, although specific details are not provided in the context. The OXTR gene also contains several splice variants, mostly in non-coding regions, which may regulate transcription (Busnelli2017Molecular). These structural features are crucial for the receptor's role in mediating the effects of oxytocin.

## Function
The oxytocin receptor (OXTR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that primarily couples with Gq proteins, leading to the activation of phospholipase C-β and subsequent intracellular signaling pathways such as MAPK, PKC, and PLC (Jurek2018The; Gimpl2001The). These pathways influence various cellular responses, including neurite outgrowth, cellular viability, and survival, by affecting transcription factors like CREB and MEF-2 (Jurek2018The). OXTR is involved in the modulation of social behaviors, anxiety, and reproductive functions (Jurek2018The).

In the brain, OXTR is expressed in regions such as the amygdala and hippocampus, where it plays a role in social behavior, fear expression, and memory processes (Jurek2018The). OXTR activation in the hippocampus can lead to CREB-dependent long-term potentiation via the MAPK pathway, which is associated with spatial memory (Jurek2018The). In the amygdala, OXTR negatively regulates fear expression by increasing the excitability of neurons that inhibit the motor fear response through GABA release (Jurek2018The).

OXTR also forms heterodimers with other GPCRs, such as dopamine 2 receptors, enhancing signaling pathways and influencing behaviors like partner preference and pair bonding (Busnelli2017Molecular). The receptor's function is modulated by factors such as cholesterol and divalent metal ions, which affect its binding affinity and signaling pathways (Busnelli2017Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene have been implicated in various psychiatric disorders and behavioral abnormalities. The non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4686302, resulting in the A218T variant, has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), trait empathy, and preterm birth. This variant affects receptor activation and signaling, potentially impacting psychological and behavioral traits (Meyer2022Structurefunction). 

Epigenetic modifications, such as increased methylation in the OXTR gene's promoter region, have been linked to decreased expression in autistic individuals, suggesting a role in the development of autism (Gregory2009Genomic). Copy number variations (CNVs), including deletions encompassing the OXTR gene, have also been identified in autism patients, further implicating the gene in the disorder (Gregory2009Genomic).

OXTR polymorphisms and methylation patterns are associated with other psychiatric conditions, including Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (Wei2023Involvement). Specific SNPs, such as rs53576 and rs237987, are linked to BPD, while rs53576 is also associated with PTSD symptoms and social cognitive abilities in ADHD (Wei2023Involvement). These findings highlight the clinical significance of OXTR in various mental health conditions.

## Interactions
The oxytocin receptor (OXTR) is involved in various interactions with other proteins, forming both homo- and heterodimers. OXTR can form homodimers and heterodimers with vasopressin receptors V1aR and V2R during biosynthesis, a process that occurs early in the endoplasmic reticulum and is not influenced by ligand binding (Terrillon2003Oxytocin). These interactions are constitutive, suggesting that the receptors exist as stable oligomeric complexes (Terrillon2003Oxytocin).

OXTR also forms heterocomplexes with other G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as the ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) and serotonin receptors 5-HT2CR and 5-HT2AR. These complexes are involved in modulating neurotransmission and behavior, with specific roles in locomotor activity and anxiolytic effects (BorrotoEscuela2022The). The interaction with GHS-R1a can impair oxytocin-mediated Gαq signaling, affecting calcium mobilization and potentially altering signaling pathways (BorrotoEscuela2022The).

In addition, OXTR interacts with dopamine D2 receptors (D2R), forming heterocomplexes that may influence social behavior, food intake, and reward mechanisms (BorrotoEscuela2022The). These interactions highlight the role of OXTR in complex signaling networks and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
