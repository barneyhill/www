# C1orf53

## Overview
C1orf53 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 53. This protein is currently categorized as uncharacterized, meaning its specific biological functions and roles within cellular processes are not yet fully understood (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite the limited knowledge about its precise function, C1orf53 has garnered attention in the field of oncology due to its potential prognostic significance in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Elevated expression levels of C1orf53 have been correlated with poorer survival outcomes in UCEC patients, suggesting a possible involvement in cancer progression (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which C1orf53 may influence cancer and other biological processes.

## Clinical Significance
The C1orf53 gene has been identified as having prognostic significance in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Higher expression levels of C1orf53 are associated with poorer overall survival outcomes in UCEC, as indicated by a hazard ratio of 2.13. This suggests that C1orf53 may play a role in the progression or severity of this type of cancer (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The study utilized Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare survival curves between groups with varying levels of C1orf53 expression, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker in UCEC (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

While the specific mechanisms by which C1orf53 influences cancer progression are not detailed, the gene's expression levels, along with those of other ORF genes like C11orf52, C9orf116, and C17orf51, have been noted for their prognostic significance in the UCEC cohort. However, due to a limited number of clinical cases, median five-year survival values were not calculated (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The broader implications of C1orf53 in other diseases or conditions remain to be fully elucidated, as the current research primarily focuses on its role in cancer prognosis.
