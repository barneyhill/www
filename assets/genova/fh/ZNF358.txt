# ZNF358

## Overview
ZNF358 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 358, a transcription factor characterized by its zinc finger domains, which are crucial for binding to DNA and regulating gene expression. As a member of the zinc finger protein family, zinc finger protein 358 plays a significant role in cellular processes such as differentiation and development, primarily functioning within the nucleus to modulate transcriptional activity (Gravholt2017A). The protein's involvement in the MAPK pathway via the ubiquitin C protein pathway highlights its potential impact on cancer progression, particularly in cases where mutations may disrupt normal signaling pathways (Gravholt2017A). Despite its recognized importance in transcriptional regulation, the full spectrum of ZNF358's functions in healthy human cells remains to be elucidated, necessitating further research to understand its broader biological and clinical implications.

## Structure
ZNF358 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which are small protein motifs that coordinate zinc ions to stabilize their folds. These domains typically facilitate binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. Zinc finger proteins often have a modular structure, with multiple zinc finger motifs contributing to their function. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination may regulate their activity. Splice variant isoforms can result in different functional or structural properties.

## Function
ZNF358, or zinc finger protein 358, is a transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression. It contains zinc finger domains that facilitate its binding to DNA, thereby influencing the transcription of target genes. This protein plays a significant role in cellular processes such as differentiation and development. ZNF358 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates transcriptional activity, impacting various organismal outcomes (Gravholt2017A).

In the context of cancer, ZNF358 has been implicated in the MAPK pathway via the ubiquitin C protein pathway. This involvement suggests that mutations in ZNF358 could disrupt normal signaling pathways, potentially enhancing the malignant potential of affected cells (Gravholt2017A). However, the specific function of ZNF358 in healthy human cells remains less well understood, as the variants discovered in certain studies have not been previously described (Gravholt2017A). Despite this, its role as a transcription factor indicates its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF358 gene have been implicated in certain cancers, although their clinical significance remains largely undetermined. In a reported case of embryonal carcinoma in a patient with Turner syndrome, two loss-of-function mutations in ZNF358 were identified. These mutations are involved in the MAPK pathway via the ubiquitin C protein pathway, which may enhance the malignant potential of affected cells (Gravholt2017A). The case challenges the traditional understanding that Y chromosomal material is necessary for malignant transformation in Turner syndrome, suggesting that mutations in genes like ZNF358 could contribute to cancer development in the absence of Y chromosomal material (Gravholt2017A).

While the specific impact of ZNF358 mutations on other diseases or conditions is not detailed, the gene's involvement in transcriptional regulation suggests that alterations in its expression could potentially affect various cellular processes and contribute to disease mechanisms. However, further research is needed to fully understand the role of ZNF358 mutations in clinical settings and their association with other diseases (Gravholt2017A).

## Interactions
ZNF358 is a zinc finger transcription factor that interacts with DNA through its zinc finger domains, which are of the Cys2His2 type. These domains facilitate its role in gene regulation by binding to specific DNA sequences, potentially influencing transcriptional activity (Andrew2002Structural). The protein also contains a proline-rich region and a polyalanine tract, which are important for maintaining its structural integrity and may affect its interactions with other regulatory factors (Andrew2002Structural).

Structural analysis suggests that a 27 bp deletion in the ZNF358 gene, resulting in the loss of nine alanine residues, could alter the protein's secondary structure and its DNA-binding ability. This deletion affects the relationship between the zinc finger domains and the proline-rich domain, which may impact the protein's function in transcriptional regulation (Andrew2002Structural).

In the context of meningiomas, ZNF358 has been identified as a key hub gene with differential expression between molecular subtypes, indicating its potential involvement in complex regulatory networks. However, specific protein interactions involving ZNF358 in these networks are not detailed (Chen2021m6A).
