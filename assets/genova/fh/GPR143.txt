# GPR143

## Overview
GPR143 is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 143, a unique member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains and is classified as an orphan receptor due to its distinct structural features and atypical intracellular localization (Bueschbell2022The). G protein-coupled receptor 143 is primarily expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium and melanocytes, where it plays a critical role in melanosome biogenesis and pigmentation processes. The receptor is involved in regulating melanosome size and protein trafficking, essential for melanin production and storage, which protects the skin and eyes from ultraviolet light (Bueschbell2022The). Mutations in the GPR143 gene are associated with ocular albinism type 1 (OA1), an X-linked disorder that leads to significant visual impairment (Jia2017GPR143; Han2015GPR143).

## Structure
GPR143, the protein product of the GPR143 gene, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, typical of GPCRs, but it is classified as an orphan receptor due to its unique structural features (Bueschbell2022The). The protein is 404 amino acids long and exhibits weak similarities with class A and B GPCRs. It contains partial motifs of class A GPCRs, such as the DAY motif in transmembrane helix 3 (TM3) and a modified CWLS motif instead of the typical CWxP motif (Bueschbell2022The). A conserved disulfide bond is present between C3.25 on TM3 and C184 in the second extracellular loop (ECL2) (Bueschbell2022The).

GPR143 lacks an extracellular domain, which may have been lost through evolution, and includes potential glycosylation sites at N106 in ECL1 and N263 in ECL3 (Bueschbell2022The). The protein is encoded by a gene located on chromosome Xp22.2 and consists of 9 exons, with 7 containing coding sequences. It has several predicted shorter isoforms, such as isoform X1 with 386 amino acids and isoform X2 with 320 amino acids (Bueschbell2022The). These structural features contribute to its atypical intracellular localization and function.

## Function
GPR143, also known as the G protein-coupled receptor 143, is primarily expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and melanocytes, where it plays a crucial role in melanosome biogenesis and pigmentation processes. This receptor is involved in the regulation of melanosome size and protein trafficking within the endolysosomal system, which is essential for the production and storage of melanin, a pigment that protects the skin and eyes from ultraviolet light (Bueschbell2022The).

GPR143 is activated by L-DOPA, an intermediate in melanin synthesis, which leads to increased intracellular calcium levels through the Gαq signaling pathway. This activation influences the secretion of pigment epithelial-derived factor (PEDF), a neurotrophic factor, and downregulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), impacting retinal development and potentially protecting against age-related macular degeneration (McKay2018Pigmentation; Figueroa2019GPR143).

The receptor is localized to intracellular organelles such as lysosomes and melanosomes, suggesting that its ligands must bind from within the organelle lumen. This unique localization is crucial for its function in melanin biosynthesis and ocular health (Bueschbell2022The). GPR143 also plays a role in the regulation of circadian rhythms in the RPE, which is essential for photoreceptor disk shedding and overall retinal health (Figueroa2019GPR143).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GPR143 gene are primarily associated with ocular albinism type 1 (OA1), an X-linked disorder characterized by significant visual impairment. This condition includes symptoms such as reduced visual acuity, nystagmus, iris translucency, and foveal hypoplasia, resulting from the misrouting of optic fibers at the optic chiasm (Jia2017GPR143; Han2015GPR143). The gene is located on the X chromosome, which means OA1 predominantly affects males, while female carriers may exhibit a 'mud-splattered' fundus appearance due to some hypopigmentation but rarely experience visual impairment (Aamir2021Clinical; McKay2018Pigmentation).

Various mutations in GPR143, including missense, nonsense, splice, deletion, insertion, and duplication, have been identified in patients with OA1 (Jia2017GPR143; Aamir2021Clinical). These mutations lead to a range of ocular symptoms, such as congenital nystagmus and retinal depigmentation, with varying degrees of pigment loss in the iris and retina (Yan2012A; Jia2017GPR143). The gene's role in ocular development is linked to its interaction with L-DOPA, an intermediate in melanin production, which acts as a ligand for GPR143, influencing intracellular calcium levels and retinal development (McKay2018Pigmentation).

## Interactions
GPR143, also known as OA1, is an atypical intracellular G protein-coupled receptor that participates in various protein interactions. It binds heterotrimeric Gi, Go, and Gq proteins, as demonstrated through coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays using human melanocyte extracts (Schiaffino2010Signaling; Piccirillo2006An). GPR143 also interacts with the G protein subunit Gαi3, which coprecipitates and colocalizes with it on the melanosomal membrane, suggesting a role in melanosome maturation (Schiaffino2010Signaling).

The receptor can form functional heteromers with the α1b-adrenoceptor, an interaction enhanced by L-DOPA treatment, indicating a potential role in cardiovascular regulation (Bueschbell2022The; Goshima2019lDOPA). GPR143 also interacts with β-Arrestin, leading to endocytosis even in the absence of a ligand (Bueschbell2022The). This interaction is crucial for its intracellular sorting and ubiquitination, involving the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) complex (Bueschbell2022The).

GPR143's interaction with L-DOPA induces an intracellular calcium response, although it binds the receptor with low affinity (Schiaffino2010Signaling). Despite its interactions with various proteins, there is no evidence of direct interactions with nucleic acids in the provided context.
