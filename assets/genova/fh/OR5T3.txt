# OR5T3

## Overview
OR5T3 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily T member 3, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. These receptors are a type of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that play a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules, contributing to the sense of smell. The OR5T3 gene is expressed in various tissues and has been implicated in several physiological and pathological processes beyond olfaction. Recent studies have highlighted its potential clinical significance, particularly in the context of pregnancy-related conditions such as preeclampsia and gestational hypothyroidism, where its expression levels may serve as a biomarker for disease prediction and management (Hirata2023Exploring).

## Clinical Significance
The gene OR5T3 has been studied for its potential clinical significance in predicting preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to other organ systems. Research indicates that low expression of OR5T3 is associated with an increased risk of developing early-onset preeclampsia. This suggests that OR5T3, along with other olfactory receptors, could serve as a biomarker for predicting the occurrence of this condition (Hirata2023Exploring).

The study also explores the link between OR5T3 expression and mild gestational hypothyroidism, identifying olfactory receptors as a shared molecular signature between hypothyroidism and preeclampsia. A significant percentage of olfactory receptors, including OR5T3, were found to be downregulated in both conditions, suggesting a potential connection between thyroid hormone levels and hypertension pathogenesis (Hirata2023Exploring).

The predictive capability of OR5T3 for preeclampsia was supported by statistical measures, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.819, sensitivity of 0.58, and specificity of 0.96, highlighting its relevance as a potential biomarker for this condition (Hirata2023Exploring).
