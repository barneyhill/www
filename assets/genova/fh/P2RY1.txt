# P2RY1

## Overview
The P2RY1 gene encodes the purinergic receptor P2Y1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in purinergic signaling. This receptor is primarily activated by extracellular nucleotides such as ADP and is involved in various cellular and physiological processes, including intracellular calcium signaling and modulation of adenylyl cyclase activity (Burnstock2004Cellular). The P2Y1 receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane helical structure, typical of GPCRs, and is widely distributed in the human brain and other tissues, where it contributes to neurotransmission, cell proliferation, and tissue repair (Moore2000Regional; Jacobson2020Update). The receptor's involvement in critical pathways underscores its significance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, such as neurological disorders and ischemic stroke (Janicki2017PopulationSpecific; Shigetomi2024Diseaserelevant).

## Structure
The P2RY1 gene encodes the P2Y1 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in purinergic signaling. The primary structure of the P2Y1 receptor consists of 373 amino acids, with a predicted molecular size of 24 kDa (Ayyanathan1996Cloning). The receptor features four potential N-linked glycosylation sites, which are important for its function and stability (Ayyanathan1996Cloning). 

The secondary structure of the P2Y1 receptor includes the canonical seven transmembrane (7TM) helical architecture typical of GPCRs (Jacobson2020Update). The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices in the cell membrane, forming a ligand-binding pocket. This pocket is crucial for the binding of nucleotide-like antagonists, such as MRS2500, which interacts with the receptor's helical bundle (Jacobson2020Update). 

The P2Y1 receptor is known to undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which regulates its activity (Harden1995P2Purinergic). The receptor is encoded by an intronless gene located on human chromosome 3, specifically at the 3q25 region (Ayyanathan1996Structural). The receptor's amino acid sequence is highly conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Ayyanathan1996Cloning).

## Function
The P2RY1 gene encodes the P2Y1 receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor primarily activated by extracellular nucleotides such as ADP. This receptor plays a significant role in various cellular and physiological processes. In healthy human cells, the P2Y1 receptor is involved in intracellular signaling pathways that regulate calcium dynamics. Upon activation, it can stimulate phospholipase C, leading to the release of intracellular calcium, and modulate adenylyl cyclase activity, affecting cAMP levels (Burnstock2004Cellular).

The P2Y1 receptor is widely distributed in the human brain, where it is predominantly localized on the surface membrane of neuronal structures. It is involved in transducing the effects of adenine nucleotides, contributing to neurotransmission and neuronal signaling by activating outwardly-rectifying K+ channels and elevating intracellular calcium levels (Moore2000Regional).

In epithelial cells, the P2Y1 receptor regulates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and expression, promoting cell proliferation. This receptor's activation leads to increased EGFR expression and triggers the ERK pathway, which is crucial for cell division and proliferation. The P2Y1 receptor's role in these processes highlights its importance in tissue repair and potential implications in carcinogenesis (Buvinic2007Nucleotide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the P2RY1 gene, which encodes the purinergic receptor P2Y1, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In neurological disorders, the upregulation of P2Y1 receptors in astrocytes is associated with increased neuronal excitability, contributing to the pathogenesis of epilepsy, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury. This is mediated through the upregulation of IGFBP2, an excitatory molecule that enhances neuronal activity (Shigetomi2024Diseaserelevant).

In the context of ischemic stroke, rare genetic variants in the P2RY1 gene have been linked to increased susceptibility. These variants may affect platelet reactivity, which is crucial in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke (Janicki2017PopulationSpecific).

Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in P2RY1 can influence the efficacy of antiplatelet therapies. For instance, the P2RY1:A236G variant is associated with reduced platelet inhibition by clopidogrel in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, indicating potential clopidogrel resistance (Ueda2021A). This highlights the clinical significance of P2RY1 gene interactions in drug response and disease management.

## Interactions
The P2RY1 gene encodes the P2Y1 receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in cellular signaling. This receptor primarily interacts with Gq-proteins to mediate responses to extracellular nucleotides such as ATP and ADP. These interactions activate intracellular signaling pathways that influence various physiological processes, including calcium signaling in astrocytes and neuronal excitability (Shigetomi2024Diseaserelevant; Shigetomi2018Role).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, P2Y1 receptors are expressed by reactive astrocytes around amyloid-beta plaques, where they contribute to astrocytic hyperactivity. This hyperactivity is mediated through purinergic signaling, particularly involving P2Y1 receptors, which are activated by ADP. The application of apyrase, which increases ADP concentration, has been shown to amplify astrocytic activity, further supporting the role of P2Y1 receptors in this process (Delekate2014Metabotropic).

The P2Y1 receptor also plays a significant role in modulating calcium dynamics in astrocytes. Overexpression of P2Y1 receptors in astrocytes leads to increased calcium signaling, characterized by larger calcium waves. These interactions are sensitive to the P2Y1 receptor-specific antagonist MRS 2179, which reduces calcium waves, indicating the receptor's involvement in these dynamics (Shigetomi2018Role).
