# ADAMTS18

## Overview
ADAMTS18 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 18, a member of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs) family. This protein is categorized as a secreted metalloprotease and is involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover and tissue remodeling. It plays a significant role in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, epithelial branching morphogenesis, and the maintenance of the small intestinal villus tip stromal cell unit. ADAMTS18 is also implicated in the regulation of VEGFA signaling and ECM remodeling, which are crucial for maintaining cellular functions and structural integrity in tissues. The gene has been identified as a tumor suppressor, with its expression frequently altered in several cancers due to promoter hypermethylation, highlighting its clinical significance in oncology (Kelwick2015The; Xu2015Hypermethylation; BernierLatmani2022ADAMTS18+).

## Structure
ADAMTS18 is a member of the ADAMTS family, characterized by a multi-domain structure. The protein includes a metalloproteinase catalytic domain and a carboxy-terminal ancillary domain, which determines substrate specificity and localization. The ancillary domain contains thrombospondin type 1 sequence repeats (TSRs), a cysteine-rich domain, and a spacer region (Kelwick2015The). ADAMTS18, like other ADAMTS proteins, is secreted and extracellular, with a compound domain organization (Kelwick2015The).

The catalytic domain of ADAMTS18 features a consensus HEXXHXBG(/N/S)BXHD motif, where histidines coordinate a Zn2+ ion. This domain adopts a metzincin architecture with a globular structure, including a five-stranded β-sheet and α-helices forming a hydrophobic pillow under the Zn2+ ion (Kelwick2015The). ADAMTS proteins have four disulfide bonds stabilizing the structure, unlike matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (Kelwick2015The).

Post-translational modifications of ADAMTS proteins include N-glycosylation, C-mannosylation, and O-fucosylation, which affect secretion and function (Kelwick2015The). Proteolytic processing within ancillary domains is common among ADAMTS proteins (Kelwick2015The). Specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ADAMTS18 are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
The ADAMTS18 gene encodes a secreted metalloprotease that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, particularly in the extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover and tissue remodeling. In healthy human cells, ADAMTS18 is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and endothelial cell function. It is expressed in epithelial branch-tip cells and is implicated in branching morphogenesis of epithelial cells, as well as in angiogenesis, by influencing endothelial sprouting and tube formation (Mushimiyimana2021Characterization).

ADAMTS18 also plays a significant role in maintaining the structure and function of the small intestinal villus tip stromal cell unit. It regulates VEGFA signaling by limiting fibronectin accumulation, which is essential for maintaining a polarized endothelial cell phenotype in the villus tip blood vessels. This regulation ensures proper nutrient absorption and prevents excessive vessel leakiness (BernierLatmani2022ADAMTS18+).

In the context of mammary gland development, ADAMTS18 is involved in ECM remodeling, which is crucial for the activation of the mammary stem cell niche. It modulates ECM components such as fibronectin, laminin, and collagens, influencing the structural integrity of the ECM and promoting stem cell function (Ataca2020The).

## Clinical Significance
ADAMTS18 is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor gene. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ADAMTS18 is frequently hypermethylated, leading to its silencing and contributing to tumorigenesis. This hypermethylation is observed in a significant proportion of ccRCC tumors and is associated with reduced gene expression, although it does not correlate with specific clinicopathological features or disease-free survival (Xu2021Aberrant; Xu2015Hypermethylation). In lung cancer, ADAMTS18 is often inactivated through promoter methylation, which promotes cancer progression by silencing its tumor-suppressive functions. Demethylation can restore its expression, inhibiting cell proliferation and migration (Zhang2018Inactivation).

ADAMTS18 also plays a role in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), where its high expression is linked to poor prognosis, correlating with tumor differentiation and metastasis (Jiang2020High). In other cancers, such as esophageal and nasopharyngeal carcinomas, ADAMTS18 is frequently silenced by promoter methylation, reinforcing its role as a tumor suppressor (Jin2007Epigenetic). The gene's involvement in extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis further underscores its significance in cancer biology (Guo2024Expression).

## Interactions
ADAMTS18 is known to interact with various components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and other proteins, playing a significant role in ECM remodeling and cellular signaling. One of its primary interactions is with fibronectin, a major ECM component. ADAMTS18 cleaves fibronectin, influencing ECM composition and structure, which can affect stem cell niche function and VEGFA signaling (BernierLatmani2022ADAMTS18+; Ataca2020The). This proteolytic activity is crucial for maintaining the polarized VEGFA signaling domain in nutrient-absorbing intestinal blood vessels, as it restricts fibronectin accumulation and thereby modulates VEGFA signaling indirectly (BernierLatmani2022ADAMTS18+).

In the context of mammary gland biology, ADAMTS18 interacts genetically with the heparin-sulfate proteoglycan Col18a1, suggesting a cooperative role in mammary stem cell control and ductal elongation (Ataca2020The). Additionally, mass spectrometry analysis has identified Transforming Growth Factor Beta-Induced (TGFBI) as a potential binding partner of ADAMTS18, indicating its involvement in complex protein interaction networks (Ataca2020The).

Phylogenetic studies have also identified interactions between ADAMTS18 and proteins such as B3GLCT and ALB, highlighting its involvement in diverse protein-protein interaction networks within the ADAMTS-TSL family (Dennler2023Phylogenetic).
