# HERC2

## Overview
HERC2 is a gene that encodes the HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2, a large E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its multiple conserved domains, including RCC1-like domains, a ZZ-type zinc finger motif, and a HECT domain, which are crucial for its function in protein ubiquitination and degradation (Tencer2022The; GarciaGonzalo2005The). HERC2 plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability, regulating the cell cycle, and facilitating DNA repair by interacting with key proteins such as RNF8 and BRCA1 (Cubillos-Rojas2014The). It is also involved in intracellular trafficking, energy metabolism, and centrosome maintenance, highlighting its importance in coordinating cellular pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Galligan2014Proteomic). Mutations in the HERC2 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and other conditions, underscoring its clinical significance (Elpidorou2020Novel).

## Structure
The HERC2 protein is a large E3 ubiquitin ligase composed of 4834 amino acids, with a molecular weight exceeding 500 kDa (Galligan2014Proteomic). It contains several conserved domains, including three RCC1-like domains (RLDs), a ZZ-type zinc finger motif, a DOC domain, a cytochrome b5-like region, and a C-terminal HECT domain (Tencer2022The; GarciaGonzalo2005The). The RLDs are involved in maintaining chromosome decondensation and may function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GarcíaCano2019HERCing:). The ZZ domain is significant for binding arginylated substrates and recognizing the Nt-R degradation signal, suggesting a role in selective cargo degradation (Tencer2022The). The DOC domain is homologous to the APC10/DOC1 subunit of the APC ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in mitosis progression (GarciaGonzalo2005The).

The HECT domain at the carboxyl end facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 enzyme to target proteins, playing a crucial role in protein ubiquitination and degradation (GarcíaCano2019HERCing:). The cytochrome b5-like motif, although lacking histidine residues for heme binding, may form a hydrophobic binding pocket for non-heme ligands (GarciaGonzalo2005The). HERC2 is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which may affect its function and interactions (Galligan2014Proteomic). The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, influencing its structural and functional diversity (Galligan2014Proteomic).

## Function
HERC2 is a large E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in various cellular processes, playing a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating the cell cycle. It functions primarily in the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences DNA repair, cell signaling, and membrane trafficking. HERC2 is essential for the DNA damage response, interacting with proteins such as RNF8 and BRCA1 to facilitate histone ubiquitylation and protein degradation at DNA damage sites (Galligan2014Proteomic; Cubillos-Rojas2014The). It also regulates the tumor suppressor protein p53 by modulating its oligomerization and transcriptional activity, which is vital for stress responses like DNA damage repair and apoptosis (García‐Cano2019Regulation; Cubillos-Rojas2014The).

HERC2 is involved in intracellular trafficking and energy metabolism, interacting with components of the COPI coatomer complex and proteins involved in mitochondrial energy production (Galligan2014Proteomic). It also plays a role in centrosome maintenance and protein translation regulation, linking it to processes such as vesicular transport and organelle organization (Galligan2014Proteomic). These diverse functions highlight HERC2's importance in coordinating cellular pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HERC2 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders and other conditions. A novel loss-of-function mutation in HERC2 has been linked to severe developmental delay and pediatric lethality, characterized by profound intellectual disability, lack of communication skills, blindness, and cortical migration defects (Elpidorou2020Novel). This mutation results in mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupted cellular homeostasis, affecting proteins involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (Elpidorou2020Novel).

HERC2 mutations are also associated with Angelman-like syndrome, particularly the p.Pro594Leu substitution, which leads to developmental delay and features resembling Angelman syndrome. This mutation causes a reduction in HERC2 protein levels due to increased turnover and instability, affecting interactions with other proteins like E6AP (Harlalka2012Mutation).

HERC2 deficiency activates the C-RAF/MKK3/p38 signaling pathway, altering the cellular response to oxidative stress and potentially contributing to tumor malignancy by impairing p53 transcriptional activity. This pathway activation is linked to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, suggesting that HERC2 may play a role as a tumor suppressor (SalaGaston2022HERC2).

## Interactions
HERC2, a large E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in numerous protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with the tumor protein p53, modulating its activity by regulating p53's oligomerization, which is essential for its transcriptional function. This interaction is dependent on the tetramerization domain of p53, and mutations in this domain can disrupt the interaction (Cubillos-Rojas2014The). HERC2 also forms a complex with NEURL4 and MDM2, which is vital for p53 activation during the DNA damage response. This complex facilitates the recruitment of DNA repair factors and stabilizes p53 by promoting the degradation of MDM2 (Mathieu2021Exploring).

HERC2 interacts with various other proteins, including those involved in DNA repair, such as RNF8 and BRCA1, and affects intracellular protein trafficking and energy metabolism (Galligan2014Proteomic). It also associates with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 complex and the COPI coatomer complex, indicating its role in protein translation and intracellular transport (Galligan2014Proteomic). These interactions highlight HERC2's multifaceted role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on disease pathogenesis.
