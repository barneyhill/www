# RBM17

## Overview
RBM17, or RNA binding motif protein 17, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in RNA processing, specifically functioning as a splicing factor. The protein, also known as splicing factor 45 (SPF45), is characterized by its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which enable it to bind RNA and participate in the spliceosome complex. This protein plays a critical role in pre-mRNA splicing, influencing the regulation of gene expression and RNA-processing proteins. RBM17 is essential for the efficient splicing of short introns and is involved in various cellular processes, including embryonic survival and the maintenance of Purkinje cells. It interacts with several proteins, such as ataxin-1 (ATXN1), and is implicated in diseases like Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 and acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (De2018RBM17; Liu2022The; Kim2014Structural).

## Structure
RBM17, or RNA binding motif protein 17, is a human protein involved in RNA processing. The protein contains RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that facilitate its binding to RNA. These motifs are crucial for its function in RNA processing activities. The primary structure of RBM17 is defined by its linear sequence of amino acids, which includes specific residues that participate in interactions with other proteins, such as ataxin-1 (ATXN1) (Kim2014Structural).

The tertiary structure of RBM17 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with phosphorylated ATXN1. This interaction is characterized by a network of salt-bridges and hydrophobic interactions, particularly involving residues like Arg375 and Glu329, which form critical contacts with ATXN1 (Kim2014Structural). The quaternary structure of RBM17, if applicable, would involve its assembly with other protein subunits, although specific details are not provided in the context.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in modulating the function of RBM17, particularly in its interaction with ATXN1. The phosphorylation of ATXN1 at Ser776 is crucial for binding to RBM17, highlighting the importance of such modifications in protein-protein interactions (Kim2014Structural). Splice variants of RBM17 may result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and interactions, although specific variants are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
RBM17, also known as splicing factor 45 (SPF45), plays a crucial role in RNA splicing, a process essential for generating the diverse protein repertoire in humans. It functions as part of the spliceosome, specifically associating with the U2 snRNP complex, and is involved in the regulation of RNA-processing proteins (De2018RBM17). RBM17 interacts with U2SURP and CHERP to form a functional module that regulates the expression and splicing of RNA-processing proteins, impacting cell-cycle regulatory factors (De2018RBM17). 

RBM17 is essential for the efficient splicing of short introns, where it competes with U2AF65 for binding to the UHM-ligand motif of the U2 snRNP protein SF3b155. This indicates that RBM17-dependent splicing is distinct from U2AF-dependent splicing, particularly in short introns with truncated pyrimidine tracts (Fukumura2019SPF45RBM17dependent). 

In terms of cellular function, RBM17 is vital for embryonic survival and the maintenance of Purkinje cells, acting as a repressor of cryptic splicing (De2018RBM17). Its activity is primarily nuclear, where it influences RNA processing homeostasis and cell differentiation (De2018RBM17).

## Clinical Significance
RBM17 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 (SCA1), a neurodegenerative disorder, RBM17 interacts with the Ataxin-1 (ATXN1) protein. The polyglutamine-expanded form of ATXN1 preferentially binds to RBM17, a process dependent on the phosphorylation of ATXN1 at Ser776. This interaction is crucial for SCA1 pathogenesis, suggesting that targeting the RBM17-ATXN1 interaction could modulate the disease (Kim2014Structural).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), RBM17 is significantly upregulated in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and is associated with poor prognosis. It plays a role in maintaining LSCs by preventing nonsense-mediated decay of pro-leukemic factors, thus supporting aberrant alternative splicing programs. Knockdown of RBM17 impairs the function of primitive AML cells, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2022The).

RBM17 is also overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is linked to poor prognosis. Its high expression promotes cancer cell proliferation and is associated with worse overall and disease-free survival rates, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Li2020Exploration).

## Interactions
RBM17, also known as splicing factor 45 kDa (SPF45), is a component of the spliceosome complex and plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, influencing splicing regulation and gene expression. RBM17 is known to interact with pro-leukemic factors such as RBM39, EZH2, and HNRNPDL, preserving their protein levels by excluding poison exons, which prevents nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of their mRNAs (Liu2022The; Liu2021RBM17). It also interacts with spliceosome components CHERP and U2SURP, which are involved in regulating splicing targets enriched for RNA-binding proteins (Liu2021RBM17).

In papillary thyroid cancer, RBM17 interacts with tiRNA-Gly, a tRNA-derived small noncoding RNA, which binds to the UHM domain of RBM17. This interaction facilitates the translocation of RBM17 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and stabilizes RBM17 protein by inhibiting its ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation (Han2021A). Additionally, RBM17 interacts with the neurodegenerative disease protein ataxin-1 (ATXN1), where phosphorylation of ATXN1 at Ser776 is crucial for binding to RBM17, involving a network of salt-bridges and hydrophobic interactions (Kim2014Structural).
