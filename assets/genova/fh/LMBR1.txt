# LMBR1

## Overview
The LMBR1 gene encodes the limb development membrane protein 1, a multipass transmembrane protein that is integral to the development and patterning of limbs in humans. This protein is highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential role in biological processes (Clark2001Reciprocal). LMBR1 is primarily involved in the regulation of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, which is crucial for proper limb formation and digit identity (Clark2001Reciprocal). The protein's function as a potential membrane anchoring protein or adhesion molecule allows it to participate effectively in signaling pathways necessary for normal limb growth (Clark2001Reciprocal). Mutations in the LMBR1 gene can lead to various limb malformations, highlighting its clinical significance in developmental biology (Clark2001Reciprocal).

## Function
The LMBR1 gene encodes a novel multipass transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in limb development and patterning in humans. This protein is highly conserved across different organisms, suggesting its fundamental role in biological processes (Clark2001Reciprocal). LMBR1 is involved in the regulation of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling, a pathway essential for proper limb formation. It influences the spatial expression of SHH, which is critical for determining digit identity and overall limb morphology (Clark2001Reciprocal).

In healthy human cells, LMBR1 is active in the cell membrane, where it may function as a membrane anchoring protein, adhesion molecule, or transcription factor. This positioning allows it to effectively participate in the regulation of signaling pathways that are vital for normal limb growth and patterning (Clark2001Reciprocal). The gene's expression levels are crucial for maintaining the balance required for normal limb development, as misregulation can lead to limb abnormalities such as preaxial polydactyly, characterized by the presence of extra digits (Clark2001Reciprocal). Understanding the precise role and regulatory mechanisms of LMBR1 remains an important area of research in developmental biology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LMBR1 gene are associated with several limb malformations. Gain-of-function mutations in this gene can lead to preaxial polydactyly, characterized by extra digits on the anterior side of the limb. These mutations are often linked to the 7q36 chromosomal region in humans and are homologous to mutations observed in mice, such as the Hemimelic extra toes (Hx) and Hammertoe (Hm) mutations (Clark2001Reciprocal). 

Loss-of-function mutations in LMBR1 result in reductions of distal limb structures, leading to conditions like acheiropodia, which involves severe limb truncations (VanderMeer2011cis‐regulatory; Clark2001Reciprocal). 

The LMBR1 gene also contains the ZPA regulatory sequence (ZRS), a critical enhancer for the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) gene. Mutations or duplications in the ZRS can cause a range of limb malformations, including triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome (TPTPS) and syndactyly type IV (SD4), which are characterized by complex polysyndactyly and syndactyly (Shi2020SubExome; Klopocki2008A). 

These genetic alterations can lead to ectopic SHH expression, resulting in diverse phenotypes such as tibial hypoplasia and Werner mesomelic syndrome (VanderMeer2011cis‐regulatory; Wieczorek2010A).
