# ZNF695

## Overview
ZNF695 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 695, which is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in regulating gene expression. This protein is primarily involved in maintaining the pluripotency and self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by repressing pro-differentiation genes through epigenetic mechanisms. ZNF695 interacts with TRIM28 and other KRAB-ZNF proteins to influence chromatin structure and gene expression, thereby modulating histone modifications and DNA methylation (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28). The expression of ZNF695 is notably upregulated in pluripotent stem cells and during the reprogramming of somatic cells, highlighting its critical role in cell fate decisions. Additionally, ZNF695 has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression levels are associated with disease progression and prognosis, making it a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and treatment (Chen2022Identification; Machnik2019The).

## Function
ZNF695 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in maintaining the pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). It is involved in the epigenetic repression of pro-differentiation genes, thereby supporting the self-renewal and pluripotency of stem cells. This is achieved through its interaction with TRIM28 and other KRAB-ZNF proteins, which modulate chromatin structure and gene expression by influencing histone modifications and DNA methylation (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28).

In healthy human cells, ZNF695 is upregulated in pluripotent stem cells compared to differentiated cells, indicating its role in maintaining stem cell properties. The expression of ZNF695 increases during the reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotent states and decreases during differentiation, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of cell fate decisions (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28).

ZNF695 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to regulate the transcription of target genes. This regulatory activity is essential for various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, by modulating the transcriptional landscape of the cell (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF695 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In breast cancer, ZNF695 is significantly upregulated, particularly in aggressive basal-like and HER2-enriched subtypes, which are linked to early relapse and poor clinical outcomes. It acts as a master regulator, differentiating luminal from nonluminal breast cancer subtypes and promoting cell cycle progression in nonluminal cancers (Machnik2019The). In lung cancer, ZNF695 expression is elevated in subtypes associated with growth and proliferation pathways, with its expression correlating with smoking history and patient survival (Machnik2019The). 

In ovarian cancer, ZNF695 exhibits significant overexpression in malignant tumors compared to healthy tissues. This overexpression is associated with specific splice variants, suggesting a role in the disease's pathology (Juárez-Méndez2013Splice). ZNF695 is also overexpressed in MYCN positive neuroblastoma, where it correlates with poor prognosis and immune cell infiltration, indicating its potential role in the tumor microenvironment (Chen2022Identification). 

In prostate cancer, ZNF695 is part of a radiosensitivity gene signature, with its methylation status potentially predicting treatment response (Wu2023Integrating). These findings suggest that ZNF695 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could serve as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis.
