# MANEAL

## Overview
The MANEAL gene encodes the protein mannosidase endo-alpha like, which is a member of the glycoside hydrolase family. This protein is involved in the processing of N-linked glycans, which are critical for proper protein folding and stability. Mannosidase endo-alpha like is categorized as a glycosidase enzyme, which plays a role in the modification of glycoproteins within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The precise biological functions and interactions of the MANEAL gene product are still under investigation, but it is believed to be involved in various cellular processes, including protein quality control and cellular signaling pathways. Mutations or dysregulation of the MANEAL gene may have implications in certain diseases, although the clinical significance is not yet fully understood (Qiu2020aarFDC).
