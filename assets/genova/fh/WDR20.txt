# WDR20

## Overview
WDR20 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 20 protein, which is characterized by its WD40-repeat motifs. These motifs are integral to the protein's role as an adaptor in various cellular processes, particularly in protein-protein interactions. The WD repeat domain 20 protein is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of misfolded proteins, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis (Ju2018Characterization). Additionally, it acts as a cofactor for the USP12·UAF1 deubiquitinating enzyme complex, enhancing its enzymatic activity and playing a crucial role in cellular functions such as signal transduction and cell cycle progression (Li2016Allosteric; Kee2010WDR20). The protein's interactions and regulatory functions underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in cancer biology, where alterations in WDR20 expression have been linked to tumor progression and patient prognosis (Takahashi2016Downregulation; Olazabal‐Herrero2021The).

## Structure
WDR20 is a protein characterized by its WD40-repeat motifs, which contribute to its β-propeller fold. This structure is typical of proteins involved in protein-protein interactions. WDR20 is a single-domain protein with a larger β-propeller than that of UAF1, due to several long loops and three extra β strands (Li2016Allosteric). The protein consists of 569 amino acids and contains five WD40-repeat domains, which are crucial for its role as an adaptor protein in various cellular processes (Ju2018Characterization).

In the context of its interaction with USP12, WDR20 binds through a confined top surface area, utilizing loops from three adjacent blades. The interface is centered on three hydrophobic residues: W306, F262, and Y261, supported by surrounding polar amino acids. These interactions are essential for WDR20's ability to interact with and activate USP12 (Li2016Allosteric). The binding of WDR20 induces structural changes in USP12, converting it into a compact form similar to Ub-bound USP46, characterized by stabilization of specific structural elements (Li2016Allosteric).

WDR20 is also involved in the ERAD pathway, where it interacts with proteins like p97, GP78, and HRD1, promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of substrates such as TCRα (Ju2018Characterization).

## Function
WDR20 is a protein involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis by eliminating misfolded or unassembled proteins. It acts as a novel regulator of the ERAD machinery, promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of substrates such as TCRα and CD3δ proteins. WDR20 interacts with key ERAD components like p97, GP78, and HRD1, facilitating the transfer of substrates to the proteasome for degradation (Ju2018Characterization).

In addition to its role in ERAD, WDR20 is a cofactor for the USP12·UAF1 deubiquitinating enzyme complex, enhancing its enzymatic activity. This interaction is crucial for the formation of a stable ternary complex, which is necessary for the deubiquitinating activity of USP12. WDR20 selectively interacts with USP12 and USP46, but not with USP1, and enhances the catalytic activity of the USP12·UAF1 complex by 4-5 fold (Kee2010WDR20). WDR20's role in these processes is essential for various cellular functions, including signal transduction, gene expression, and cell cycle progression, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Li2016Allosteric).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the WDR20 gene have been implicated in the progression of several cancers. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), downregulation of WDR20 due to the loss of chromosome 14q is associated with malignant transformation and poorer patient outcomes. This downregulation is linked to lower survival rates and is significantly associated with tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis (Takahashi2016Downregulation). The study suggests that WDR20 may function as a tumor suppressor gene, as its overexpression in ccRCC cells leads to growth suppression and induced apoptosis, partly through the suppression of the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK pathways (Takahashi2016Downregulation).

In colorectal cancer, WDR20 is downregulated, which correlates with an upregulation of DMWD, another gene involved in the regulation of the USP12 deubiquitinase. This inverse correlation is also observed in breast and prostate cancers, suggesting a broader role for WDR20 in cancer biology (Olazabal‐Herrero2021The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of WDR20 expression levels and interactions in cancer progression and patient prognosis.

## Interactions
WDR20 is a WD40-repeat protein that plays a significant role in various protein interactions, particularly in the regulation of deubiquitinating enzymes. It is known to interact with USP12 and USP46, forming part of a multiprotein complex that includes UAF1. This complex is involved in the regulation of protein ubiquitination and degradation, influencing processes such as synaptic strength and plasticity (Dahlberg2014The; Li2016Allosteric).

WDR20 enhances the catalytic activity of USP12 and USP46 by binding to them, which is crucial for their function in deubiquitination. This interaction is mediated by specific structural elements and residues within WDR20, which facilitate its binding to the Palm domain of USP12, leading to structural changes that activate the enzyme (Li2016Allosteric).

In the context of the ERAD pathway, WDR20 interacts with proteins such as TCRα and p97, promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of ERAD substrates. This interaction is independent of USP12, highlighting WDR20's versatile role in protein regulation (Ju2018Characterization).

WDR20 also influences the subcellular localization of the USP12 and USP46 complexes, affecting their recruitment to the plasma membrane and their shuttling between cellular compartments (OlazabalHerrero2019WDR20).
