# IL20

## Overview
Interleukin 20 (IL-20) is a cytokine encoded by the IL20 gene, belonging to the IL-10 family of cytokines. It plays a pivotal role in regulating immune responses and maintaining skin homeostasis. The IL-20 protein is characterized as a cytokine, which primarily acts on keratinocytes and epithelial cells, and is involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis and immune modulation. IL-20 exerts its effects through specific receptor complexes, namely IL-20R1/IL-20R2 and IL-22R1/IL-20R2, activating the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, particularly STAT3, which is crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation (Hsieh2006Interleukin20; Commins2008The). The gene is expressed in multiple tissues, including the skin, kidney, lung, and placenta, and is implicated in several inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, due to its role in promoting keratinocyte proliferation and angiogenesis (Wegenka2010IL-20:).

## Structure
The IL-20 protein is a member of the IL-19 subfamily of cytokines, which also includes IL-19, IL-22, and IL-24. It is a monomer in solution and shares structural similarities with human IL-10, despite low sequence identity (Zdanov2004Structural). The primary structure of IL-20 shows 44.1% sequence identity and 52.4% similarity with IL-19, sharing the same disulfide bond pattern (Zdanov2004Structural). The secondary structure of IL-20 is characterized by a seven-helix bundle with an extensive hydrophobic core, similar to IL-19, but it lacks the C-terminal β-strand found in IL-19 (Zdanov2004Structural; Zdanov2010Structural).

The tertiary structure of IL-20 is stabilized by disulfide bonds, and it does not form higher-order structures in solution, maintaining a monomeric quaternary structure (Zdanov2004Structural). IL-20 interacts with its receptors, forming stable ternary complexes with IL-20R1 and IL-20R2, but does not bind on its own to sIL-20R1 (Pletnev2003Characterization). IL-20 does not have glycosylation sites, unlike IL-19, which has one glycosylated site (Pletnev2003Characterization).

## Function
Interleukin 20 (IL-20) is a cytokine that plays a significant role in various biological processes, particularly in skin homeostasis and immune response regulation. It is part of the IL-10 family and primarily acts on keratinocytes and epithelial cells. IL-20 signals through receptor complexes IL-20R1/IL-20R2 and IL-22R1/IL-20R2, activating the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, particularly STAT3, which is crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation (Hsieh2006Interleukin20; Commins2008The).

In endothelial cells, IL-20 promotes angiogenesis by inducing proliferation, migration, and vascular tube formation, contributing to the formation of new blood vessels. This activity is mediated through the IL-20R1/IL-20R2 receptor complex and involves the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK pathways (Hsieh2006Interleukin20). IL-20 also upregulates angiogenic factors such as VEGF, bFGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9, enhancing tumor vascularization and increasing microvessel density in vivo (Hsieh2006Interleukin20).

IL-20 is expressed in various tissues, including skin, kidney, lung, and placenta, and is involved in the regulation of dendritic cell migration and expression of co-stimulatory molecules, influencing immune responses (Bech2016Interleukin; Wei2006IL20:).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IL20 gene have been implicated in several inflammatory diseases. In psoriasis, IL-20 is significantly elevated in psoriatic lesions, contributing to the formation of psoriatic plaques by promoting keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. This cytokine is involved in both T-cell-dependent mechanisms and direct actions on keratinocytes, amplifying the immune response and sustaining inflammation in psoriatic skin (Wegenka2010IL-20:). 

IL-20 is also associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), where its expression is increased in synovial membranes, potentially sustaining inflammation through an autocrine loop. It may influence RA by affecting angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Wegenka2010IL-20:).

In eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), IL-20 subfamily cytokines, including IL-20, are upregulated, leading to impaired epithelial barrier function by reducing the expression of filaggrin, a protein crucial for maintaining epithelial integrity. This impairment is mediated through the ERK1/2 pathway, and IL-20 receptor deficiency has been shown to be protective against EoE in experimental models (Kaymak2022IL20). 

IL-20's role in atherosclerosis is linked to its pro-angiogenic activity, which may enhance atherosclerotic plaque development by increasing lesion microvascularization (Autieri2018IL19).

## Interactions
Interleukin 20 (IL-20) is a cytokine that primarily interacts with specific receptor complexes to exert its biological functions. IL-20 binds to two main receptor complexes: the IL-20R1/IL-20R2 heterodimer and the IL-22R1/IL-20R2 heterodimer. These interactions initiate signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway, particularly activating STAT3 in certain cell types such as HaCaT cells (Wei2006IL20:; Commins2008The; Wegenka2010IL-20:). 

IL-20 is also involved in promoting angiogenesis by interacting with endothelial cells through its receptors, leading to the activation of pathways such as ERK1/2, p38 kinase, and JNK (Hsieh2006Interleukin20). The cytokine can upregulate angiogenic factors like VEGF, bFGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9, and induce the angiogenic chemokine IL-8 (Hsieh2006Interleukin20).

In the context of Toxoplasma gondii infection, the parasite protein TgROP18 interacts with the extracellular domain of the IL20RB receptor, leading to the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway in cells with high IL20RB expression, such as HaCaT cells (Kong2020TgROP18). These interactions highlight the role of IL-20 in various biological processes and its potential implications in disease mechanisms.
