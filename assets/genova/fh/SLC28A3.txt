# SLC28A3

## Overview
The SLC28A3 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 28 member 3, commonly known as human concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 (hCNT3). This protein is a transmembrane transporter that plays a crucial role in the cellular uptake of nucleosides, which are essential for nucleic acid synthesis and cellular metabolism. hCNT3 is characterized by its ability to transport a wide range of both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides, as well as several nucleoside-based drugs, utilizing electrochemical gradients of sodium (Na+) and hydrogen (H+) ions. The protein's structure includes multiple transmembrane domains, allowing it to span the lipid bilayer and function effectively as a transporter. hCNT3 is expressed in various tissues, including the mammary gland, pancreas, and bone marrow, and is involved in significant pharmacokinetic processes, influencing the efficacy and toxicity of nucleoside drugs (Damaraju2005Identification).

## Structure
The SLC28A3 gene encodes the human concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 (hCNT3), a protein involved in the transport of nucleosides across cell membranes. hCNT3 is composed of 691 amino acids and is characterized by a 13 or possibly 15 transmembrane domain architecture, which facilitates its function as a transporter (Damaraju2005Identification). The protein utilizes electrochemical gradients of Na+ and H+ to transport a wide range of pyrimidine and purine nucleosides and nucleoside drugs into cells (Damaraju2005Identification).

The secondary structure of hCNT3 includes transmembrane alpha-helices, which are common in membrane proteins and contribute to its ability to span the lipid bilayer (Latek2017Rosetta). The tertiary structure is suggested to be stable, as indicated by molecular dynamics simulations, which support the accuracy of the predicted model (Latek2017Rosetta).

hCNT3 is a glycoprotein, as evidenced by shifts in electrophoretic mobility upon treatment with PNGase F or Endo H, indicating N-linked glycosylation (Damaraju2005Identification). This post-translational modification is important for the protein's stability and function. The protein is expressed as a homotrimer, which is a common quaternary structure for transporters, allowing cooperative interactions between subunits (Latek2017Rosetta).

## Function
The SLC28A3 gene encodes the human concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 (hCNT3), a protein involved in the sodium-dependent uptake of nucleosides, which are crucial for nucleic acid synthesis and cellular metabolism. hCNT3 is a member of the concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs) family, which includes CNT1 and CNT2, and is unique in its ability to transport a broad range of both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides, as well as several anticancer and antiviral drugs (Damaraju2005Identification). 

The transporter functions as a Na+/nucleoside symporter, with a coupling ratio of 2:1, meaning it transports two sodium ions for every nucleoside molecule. This stoichiometry allows hCNT3 to transport nucleosides against their concentration gradient, achieving higher intracellular concentrations (Damaraju2005Identification). hCNT3 is also capable of utilizing H+ electrochemical gradients, which is distinct from other CNT family members (Damaraju2005Identification). 

hCNT3 is expressed in various tissues, including the mammary gland, pancreas, bone marrow, and trachea, and is present in fetal tissues and some cultured cell lines (Damaraju2005Identification). Its activity is essential for the cellular uptake of nucleosides, which are necessary for DNA and RNA synthesis, and it plays a significant role in the pharmacokinetics of nucleoside drugs (Damaraju2005Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC28A3 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in nucleoside transport. Alterations in SLC28A3 expression or genetic variants can influence drug response and toxicity. In the context of ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C, specific haplotypes of SLC28A3, such as rs10868138G/rs56350726T, have been associated with a reduced risk of ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia, without affecting the sustained virological response (Doehring2011Role). Another study found that the rs56350726 TT genotype was linked to a higher chance of achieving sustained virological response in hepatitis C treatment (Rau2013Impact).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, high SLC28A3 expression has been associated with poor response to fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide treatment, suggesting a role in drug resistance (Vukovic2019Association). Additionally, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the SLC28A3 AA genotype has been linked to an increased risk of neutropenia during gemcitabine-based chemoradiation (Lemstrová2014Role). These findings highlight the gene's significance in pharmacogenomics, affecting both drug efficacy and toxicity across different medical conditions.

## Interactions
The human gene SLC28A3 encodes the concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 (hCNT3), which is involved in the transport of nucleosides across cell membranes. hCNT3 interacts with cations such as Na+ and H+ to facilitate nucleoside transport. The transporter exhibits a dual cation coupling mechanism, utilizing both Na+ and H+ with different stoichiometries: a 2:1 Na+:nucleoside and a 1:1 H+:nucleoside ratio (Damaraju2005Identification). Key residues such as Glu 519 and Cys 561 are crucial for cation binding and transport function. Mutations at these sites can significantly affect the transporter's function, indicating their role in the interaction with cations (Damaraju2005Identification).

hCNT3 is also involved in forming complexes with other proteins, influencing its transport activity. For instance, the C602R variant alters the Na+:nucleoside stoichiometry and affects glycosylation patterns, which may impact protein interactions (Damaraju2005Identification). The transporter is expressed in various tissues, including the mammary gland, pancreas, and kidney, where it is localized on the apical surfaces of proximal tubules and thick ascending loops of Henle, suggesting interactions with other membrane proteins in these regions (Damaraju2005Identification).
