# PCDH7

## Overview
Protocadherin 7 (PCDH7) is a gene that encodes a member of the non-clustered protocadherin family, which is part of the larger cadherin superfamily known for their roles in cell adhesion. The protein encoded by PCDH7, also named protocadherin 7, is a transmembrane protein characterized by extracellular cadherin (EC) domains that facilitate homophilic cell-cell adhesion. This protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in neural development, synaptic function, and plasticity. PCDH7 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of synaptic NMDA receptor currents and dendritic spine morphology, and it interacts with several proteins such as the GluN1 subunit of NMDA receptors and the SET oncoprotein. Alterations in PCDH7 expression have been associated with several cancers and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological and pathological contexts (Kim2011Nonclustered; Wang2020PCDH7; Zhou2017PROTOCADHERIN).

## Structure
Protocadherin 7 (PCDH7) is a member of the cadherin superfamily, characterized by its extracellular cadherin (EC) domains. The primary structure of PCDH7 includes a sequence of amino acids that form these EC domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. The secondary structure of PCDH7 likely involves the formation of alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of cadherin proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure of PCDH7 involves the three-dimensional folding of its EC domains, which are crucial for its adhesive functions. These domains are arranged in a linear fashion, with canonical calcium-binding sites that stabilize the structure (Harrison2020Familywide). The quaternary structure of PCDH7 is characterized by its ability to form homophilic trans dimers through interactions between the EC1-EC4 regions, which bind in an antiparallel orientation (Harrison2020Familywide).

PCDH7 does not form higher-order oligomers beyond dimers and lacks cis-interaction interfaces, distinguishing it from clustered protocadherins (Harrison2020Familywide). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context. Splice variants of PCDH7 may exist, potentially leading to isoforms with distinct functions, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided information.

## Function
Protocadherin 7 (PCDH7) is a member of the non-clustered protocadherin family, which plays a significant role in cell-cell adhesion and intracellular signaling within the central nervous system. PCDH7 is involved in regulating the differentiation of the embryonic ectoderm, neural tube formation, and axonal elongation in retinal ganglion cells. It exhibits substantial adhesive activity, potentially mediated by its interaction with Template-activating factor 1 (TAF1) in its cytoplasmic region, suggesting a role similar to classical cadherins in mediating cell-cell adhesion (Kim2011Nonclustered).

PCDH7 is predominantly expressed in neurons and astrocytes, where it interacts with the GluN1 subunit of NMDA receptors, influencing synaptic function and dendritic spine morphology. Overexpression of PCDH7 in neurons leads to changes in dendritic structures and a reduction in synaptic NMDA receptor currents, indicating its involvement in synaptic regulation and plasticity (Wang2020PCDH7). PCDH7 is also enriched in postsynaptic density fractions, suggesting its role in synapse formation and function (Wang2020PCDH7).

In addition, PCDH7 is regulated by MeCP2, an epigenetic regulator, which influences its expression in neuronal cells and brain tissues. This regulation is crucial for maintaining proper synaptic connections and may have implications for neurological disorders (Miyake2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PCDH7 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In gastric cancer, PCDH7 expression is down-regulated, and its low expression is associated with poor overall and disease-free survival, suggesting a protective role against cancer progression (Chen2017Protocadherin). In contrast, PCDH7 is overexpressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), where it is linked to enhanced proliferation and tumorigenesis through the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway (Shishodia2019Protocadherin). Similarly, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PCDH7 is overexpressed and associated with poor survival outcomes, promoting tumorigenesis by enhancing MAPK pathway activation (Zhou2017PROTOCADHERIN).

In breast cancer, PCDH7 is upregulated in bone metastatic tissues, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, which suggests its role in metastasis (Li2013Protocadherin7). In colorectal cancer, PCDH7 expression correlates with increased cell proliferation and chemoresistance, although it appears to reduce migration and invasion capabilities (Zheng2023The).

Beyond cancer, PCDH7 is also implicated in neurological disorders. It interacts with the GluN1 subunit of NMDA receptors, affecting dendritic spine morphology and synaptic function, and is linked to conditions such as epilepsy (Wang2020PCDH7a).

## Interactions
Protocadherin 7 (PCDH7) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. PCDH7 interacts with the SET oncoprotein, which is crucial for its role in osteoclast differentiation and lung cancer progression. This interaction facilitates the activation of small GTPases RhoA and Rac1, essential for osteoclast differentiation (Kim2021Protocadherin7). PCDH7 also associates with Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) through SET, leading to the regulation of RhoA activation during osteoclast differentiation (Kim2023PP2AMediated).

In the context of lung cancer, PCDH7 interacts with SET and PP2A, forming a complex that suppresses PP2A activity and enhances MAPK-ERK signaling, particularly in cells with KRAS or EGFR mutations. This interaction is significant for tumorigenesis and suggests PCDH7's role as a scaffold protein that facilitates oncogenic signaling (Zhou2017PROTOCADHERIN).

PCDH7 also interacts with the GluN1 subunit of NMDA receptors, affecting dendritic spine morphology and synaptic function. This interaction modulates Zn2+ inhibition of NMDA receptor currents, indicating a role in synaptic plasticity (Wang2020PCDH7). Additionally, PCDH7 interacts with the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC5, which targets it to the cell surface, influencing cell division processes (Özkan2020ZDHHC5).
