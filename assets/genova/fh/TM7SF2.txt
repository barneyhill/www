# TM7SF2

## Overview
The TM7SF2 gene encodes the transmembrane 7 superfamily member 2 (SR-1) protein, which is integral to cholesterol biosynthesis and cellular homeostasis. As a member of the transmembrane protein family, SR-1 is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it functions as a 3beta-hydroxysterol Delta(14)-reductase, facilitating the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol (Prakash2002Genes; Gatticchi2020Tm7sf2). This protein plays a crucial role in regulating the unfolded protein response and managing endoplasmic reticulum stress, thereby maintaining cellular equilibrium (Bellezza2013A). TM7SF2 is also involved in gene positioning within the nucleus, influencing the expression of genes related to cholesterol metabolism and insulin regulation, which underscores its significance in metabolic homeostasis (Gatticchi2020Tm7sf2). Additionally, TM7SF2 interacts with key metabolic pathways, such as the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, and modulates inflammatory responses, linking metabolic and inflammatory processes (Liu2024TM7SF2induced; Bellezza2013A).

## Structure
The TM7SF2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the transmembrane 7 superfamily, involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. The protein encoded by TM7SF2 is known as SR-1 and consists of 418 amino acid residues (Prakash2002Genes). The primary structure of the SR-1 protein shares 40% amino acid sequence similarity with the sterol C-14 reductase encoded by the Neurospora crassa erg-3 gene, indicating a conserved function in sterol biosynthesis (Prakash2002Genes).

The SR-1 protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting its involvement in processes associated with this organelle (Prakash2002Genes). Although specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of the TM7SF2 protein are not provided, its localization and sequence similarity to known enzymes imply a functional role in sterol biosynthesis pathways.

The splicing pattern of the TM7SF2 transcript is conserved relative to that of the eight exons encoding the LBR CTD, suggesting that SR-1 is a paralogue of the LBR CTD, which possesses sterol biosynthetic activity (Prakash2002Genes). This conservation may indicate similar structural domains or functional motifs between these proteins. However, specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of TM7SF2 are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
The TM7SF2 gene encodes a protein involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, specifically functioning as a 3beta-hydroxysterol Delta(14)-reductase. This enzyme is crucial for the conversion of lanosterol into cholesterol, a key step in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and cell membrane integrity (Bellezza2013A; Gatticchi2020Tm7sf2). The protein is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a role in regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) and managing ER stress, which is essential for cellular homeostasis (Bellezza2013A).

TM7SF2 also influences the radial positioning of genes within the nucleus, particularly in liver cells, affecting the expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and insulin regulation (Gatticchi2020Tm7sf2). Disruption of TM7SF2 can lead to metabolic defects and characteristics of diabetes, highlighting its role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Gatticchi2020Tm7sf2). Additionally, TM7SF2 is involved in an anti-inflammatory loop, modulating the activation of NF-kB and TNFα expression, which links metabolic pathways to inflammatory responses (Bellezza2013A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the TM7SF2 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of skin health, the loss of TM7SF2 accelerates the formation of skin papillomas in mice, suggesting a role in tumor resistance and cholesterol biosynthesis regulation. This gene is crucial for maintaining cholesterol sulfate homeostasis, which is vital for keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal barrier development. Disruption of TM7SF2 leads to increased keratinocyte proliferation and altered expression of differentiation markers, contributing to abnormal skin proliferation and differentiation (Bellezza2015The).

In the liver, TM7SF2 disruption affects gene positioning and expression, leading to metabolic defects and characteristics of diabetes. This disruption alters the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism, contributing to metabolic disorders (Gatticchi2020Tm7sf2). TM7SF2 is also identified as a protective factor against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), with its expression influencing cholesterol metabolism and potentially reducing NAFLD risk (Chen2024Identification).

In the context of acute kidney injury, TM7SF2 deficiency appears to protect against renal damage by reducing inflammatory responses and lipid accumulation, suggesting a role in lipid metabolism and inflammation regulation (Gatticchi2015The).

## Interactions
TM7SF2 is known to physically interact with CPT1A, a key enzyme in fatty acid oxidation. This interaction has been confirmed through exogenous immunoprecipitation (IP) and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays in 293T and C33A cells, demonstrating that TM7SF2 regulates CPT1A protein expression. Overexpression of TM7SF2 leads to increased levels of CPT1A, while knockout of TM7SF2 results in decreased CPT1A expression, suggesting that CPT1A acts as a downstream effector of TM7SF2 (Liu2024TM7SF2induced). 

TM7SF2 also plays a role in the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. Overexpression of TM7SF2 in cervical cancer cells results in the upregulation of proteins such as WNT3A, β-catenin, c-Myc, and TCF1, which are components of this pathway. Conversely, these proteins are downregulated in TM7SF2-knockout cells, indicating that TM7SF2 influences this signaling pathway through its interaction with CPT1A (Liu2024TM7SF2induced). 

These interactions highlight TM7SF2's involvement in lipid reprogramming and its potential role in promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration via the CPT1A/WNT/β-catenin axis (Liu2024TM7SF2induced).
