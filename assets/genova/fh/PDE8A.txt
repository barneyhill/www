# PDE8A

## Overview
PDE8A is a gene that encodes the protein phosphodiesterase 8A, a member of the phosphodiesterase family that specifically hydrolyzes cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This protein plays a pivotal role in modulating intracellular cAMP levels, thereby influencing various signaling pathways, including the cAMP/PKA and MAPK pathways. As a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, PDE8A is involved in critical cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and survival by regulating the activity of key signaling molecules like Raf-1 kinase (Maurice2013PDE8A; Brown2013Phosphodiesterase8A). PDE8A is expressed in multiple tissues, including the heart, testis, and ovary, and is implicated in physiological functions such as cardiac signaling and steroidogenesis (Patrucco2010Phosphodiesterase; Fisher1998Isolation). Alterations in PDE8A expression have been associated with various pathological conditions, including major depressive disorder and certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chimienti2019Brain; Azevedo2013Clinical).

## Structure
The PDE8A protein is a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase with a primary structure consisting of 713 amino acids, encoded by a 3396 nucleotide cDNA sequence (Fisher1998Isolation). The catalytic domain of PDE8A is homologous to other cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, particularly PDE4, sharing 38.5% amino acid identity in this region (Fisher1998Isolation). This domain includes two divalent cation binding motifs essential for catalytic activity, although one motif has a conservative amino acid change (Fisher1998Isolation).

The secondary structure of PDE8A1, a variant of PDE8A, comprises 18 alpha-helices (Wang2008Kinetic). The tertiary structure of PDE8A1 features a catalytic domain that closely resembles those of cAMP-specific PDE4 and PDE7, with unique elements such as the N-terminal helix H1 and a flexible M-loop, which may play a role in substrate and inhibitor recognition (Wang2008Kinetic). The invariant glutamine (Gln778) is involved in substrate recognition and inhibitor binding (Wang2008Kinetic).

PDE8A exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, and it is expressed in various tissues, including the testis, ovary, small intestine, and colon (Fisher1998Isolation). The protein is not modulated by cGMP and is insensitive to many common PDE inhibitors (Fisher1998Isolation).

## Function
Phosphodiesterase 8A (PDE8A) is a high-affinity, cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase that plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular cAMP levels, which are vital for transducing extracellular signals such as hormones and neurotransmitters (Fisher1998Isolation). PDE8A is involved in the modulation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway by forming a complex with Raf-1 kinase, a key component of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. This interaction limits PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Raf-1 at S259, thereby influencing the MAPK signaling pathway and maintaining cellular signaling balance (Maurice2013PDE8A; Brown2013Phosphodiesterase8A).

PDE8A is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, testis, ovary, small intestine, and colon, and is involved in processes such as cell growth, survival, and differentiation through the ERK signaling pathway (Patrucco2010Phosphodiesterase; Fisher1998Isolation). In cardiac cells, PDE8A modulates β-adrenergic receptor signaling, affecting calcium signaling crucial for proper cardiac function (Patrucco2010Phosphodiesterase). Additionally, PDE8A regulates testosterone production in Leydig cells by controlling cAMP levels, which influence steroidogenesis (ShimizuAlbergine2012cAMPSpecific). Through these mechanisms, PDE8A plays a significant role in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PDE8A gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. PDE8A is involved in the regulation of cAMP signaling, which is crucial for numerous physiological processes. Alterations in PDE8A expression have been associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicide. Studies have shown a two-fold decrease in PDE8A expression in the temporal cortex of MDD patients, with specific RNA editing alterations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting a potential immune response-related brain marker for suicide (Chimienti2019Brain).

In the context of cancer, polymorphisms in the PDE8A gene have been linked to a predisposition to developing adrenocortical tumors, as well as testicular and prostatic cancer (Azevedo2013Clinical). PDE8A also plays a role in Leydig cell function, where its absence leads to increased testosterone production, indicating its potential involvement in conditions related to steroidogenesis (Vasta2006Modulation). The regulation of Raf-1 kinase activity by PDE8A suggests its potential as a therapeutic target in cancers where Raf-1 is involved, such as Ras-mutated melanoma (Brown2013Phosphodiesterase8A).

## Interactions
Phosphodiesterase 8A (PDE8A) is known to interact with Raf-1 kinase, a key component of the ERK signaling pathway. This interaction is characterized by a high affinity and is crucial for modulating Raf-1 activity. PDE8A binds to Raf-1, protecting it from inhibitory phosphorylation by cAMP-activated protein kinase (PKA) at the S259 site, thereby enhancing Raf-1's ability to stimulate ERK signaling (Maurice2013PDE8A; Brown2013Phosphodiesterase8A). The binding site on PDE8A has been identified as amino acids 454-465, and disruption of this interaction reduces ERK activation (Brown2013Phosphodiesterase8A).

PDE8A also interacts with c-RAF, another member of the RAF kinase family, in the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The interaction between PDE8A and c-RAF is targeted by the cell-penetrating peptide disruptor DRx-170, which promotes the inactivation of c-RAF through an allosteric mechanism involving PKA phosphorylation. This disruption leads to the inhibition of cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration in KRAS mutant PDAC cell lines (Cooke2024Disruption). The interaction between PDE8A and c-RAF is significant for managing the crosstalk between c-RAF and cAMP-PKA signaling axes (Cooke2024Disruption).
