# ATP6V1E1

## Overview
The ATP6V1E1 gene encodes the ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit E1, a crucial component of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. This protein is part of the V1 domain of the V-ATPase, which is responsible for the acidification of intracellular compartments such as lysosomes and endosomes. This acidification is essential for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, endosome maturation, and lysosomal function, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolism (Pottie2021Loss). The ATP6V1E1 protein is involved in significant physiological pathways, including Notch and Wnt signaling, and plays a role in cellular iron uptake and the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) (Pottie2021Loss). Mutations in ATP6V1E1 are linked to autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2C syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Pottie2021Loss).

## Function
The ATP6V1E1 gene encodes a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, specifically part of the V1 domain. This complex is essential for acidifying various intracellular compartments, such as lysosomes and endosomes, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolism (Pottie2021Loss). The acidification process facilitated by V-ATPase is vital for several cellular functions, including protein degradation, endosome maturation, and lysosomal function (Pottie2021Loss). 

In healthy human cells, ATP6V1E1 is involved in key physiological pathways, such as Notch and Wnt signaling, and the activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. These pathways are critical for cellular functions like anabolic and catabolic events, endocytosis, and transcription activation (Pottie2021Loss). The protein also plays a role in cellular iron uptake and the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α), which is linked to iron homeostasis and cellular responses to hypoxia (Pottie2021Loss). 

The ATP6V1E1 subunit is active in organelles such as lysosomes and endosomes, contributing to processes like receptor-mediated endocytosis and neurotransmitter release, which are essential for maintaining the acidic pH necessary for these cellular activities (Pottie2021Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP6V1E1 gene are associated with autosomal recessive cutis laxa (ARCL) type 2C syndrome, a condition characterized by loose, wrinkled skin and systemic manifestations. This syndrome includes craniofacial dysmorphisms, vascular anomalies, cardiac dysfunction, N-glycosylation defects, hypotonia, and epidermal structural defects (Pottie2021Loss). The loss of ATP6V1E1 disrupts vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) functions, affecting various biological pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation, sphingolipid, fatty acid, and energy metabolism, leading to mitochondrial respiration defects (Pottie2021Loss).

In zebrafish models, the loss of the atp6v1e1b gene, an ortholog of human ATP6V1E1, results in phenotypes that mimic human ARCL type 2C, including early mortality, craniofacial abnormalities, and cardiovascular issues (Pottie2021Loss). These zebrafish also exhibit glycosylation abnormalities, such as increased oligomannose N-glycans and altered Golgi morphology, which are similar to those observed in ARCL type 2C patients (Pottie2021Loss). The study of these models highlights the pleiotropic effects of ATP6V1E1 mutations and their impact on cellular processes, contributing to the understanding of ARCL type 2C pathogenesis (Pottie2021Loss).
