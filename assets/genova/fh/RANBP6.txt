# RANBP6

## Overview
RANBP6, or RAN binding protein 6, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the importin β superfamily, which is primarily involved in nuclear transport processes. The protein, RanBP6, plays a significant role in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, acting as a repressor of EGFR transcription and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It contains structural motifs such as an importin β-like N-terminal domain and HEAT repeats, which facilitate its interactions within the Ran-GTPase pathway and its function in nucleocytoplasmic transport (Oldrini2017EGFR). RanBP6 is crucial for the nuclear import of proteins, including the transcription factor STAT3, which is involved in EGFR regulation (Oldrini2017EGFR). Alterations in RANBP6 expression have been linked to various cancers, including glioblastoma and lymphomas, where its dysregulation leads to increased EGFR activity and tumor progression (Oldrini2017EGFR; Rui2010Cooperative).

## Structure
RanBP6 is a member of the importin β superfamily and is involved in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in cancer. The protein contains an importin β-like N-terminal domain, which is characteristic of proteins involved in nuclear transport. This domain is crucial for its interaction with the Ran-GTPase pathway, which is essential for nucleocytoplasmic transport (Oldrini2017EGFR). RanBP6 also features several HEAT repeats, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. These repeats are common in proteins that participate in transport processes (Oldrini2017EGFR).

RanBP6 includes a putative Ran-binding domain (RBD), which shows high homology with other proteins in the Ran-GTPase pathway, suggesting its role in nuclear import processes (Oldrini2017EGFR). The protein's structure is adapted to its function in regulating EGFR transcription and signal output, as its knockdown leads to increased EGFR mRNA and protein levels (Oldrini2017EGFR). While specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of these domains and motifs indicates a complex structure tailored for its regulatory roles in cellular processes.

## Function
RANBP6 (RAN binding protein 6) is a member of the importin β superfamily and plays a crucial role in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. In healthy human cells, RANBP6 contributes to cellular EGFR homeostasis by repressing EGFR transcription. This repression is lifted when there is an increased cellular demand for EGFR, such as during ligand-induced EGFR degradation (Oldrini2017EGFR). RANBP6 is involved in the nuclear import of proteins, particularly facilitating the nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which is necessary for the transcriptional repression of EGFR (Oldrini2017EGFR).

RANBP6 interacts with the Ran-GTPase pathway, suggesting its involvement in nuclear transport processes. It contains a putative importin N-terminal domain and several HEAT repeats, indicating its role in nuclear transport (Oldrini2017EGFR). The protein is active in the nuclear pore complex, influencing gene expression and cell cycle regulation. By modulating EGFR levels and activity, RANBP6 helps maintain normal cellular functions, which is crucial for preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer progression (Oldrini2017EGFR).

## Clinical Significance
RANBP6 has been implicated in several cancers due to its role in regulating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. In glioblastoma (GBM), alterations in RANBP6 expression are associated with increased EGFR activity, a common feature in various cancers. The loss or reduced expression of RANBP6 leads to enhanced EGFR pathway activation, contributing to tumor growth and progression (Oldrini2017EGFR). Focal deletions of the RANBP6 locus on chromosome 9p have been observed in a subset of GBM, suggesting a selective pressure for the loss of this gene in cancer (Oldrini2017EGFR).

RANBP6 is also involved in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), where it is part of the 9p24 amplicon. This region is often amplified in these cancers, and RANBP6 knockdown has been shown to be selectively toxic to PMBL and HL cell lines with the 9p24 amplicon, indicating its role in cell proliferation and survival (Rui2010Cooperative). The disruption of RANBP6-mediated feedback inhibition of EGFR in cancer suggests a potential link between RANBP6 expression alterations and cancer development (Oldrini2017EGFR).

## Interactions
RANBP6 (RAN binding protein 6) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly within the context of nuclear transport and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) regulation. It interacts with proteins such as importin subunit α-1, importin subunit β-1, and nuclear pore complex 93 (Nup93), which are key components of the nuclear transport pathway (Oldrini2017EGFR). RANBP6 also binds to Ran in the nuclear fraction, where Ran is predominantly GTP-bound, and interacts with RCC1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Oldrini2017EGFR).

RANBP6 has been shown to interact with EGFR, acting as a regulator by repressing its transcription and signaling. Knockdown of RANBP6 results in increased EGFR mRNA and protein levels, indicating its role in modulating EGFR promoter activity (Oldrini2017EGFR). The protein also facilitates the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor STAT3, which is associated with EGFR and may regulate EGFR promoter activity (Oldrini2017EGFR).

In cancer, particularly glioblastoma, the interaction between RANBP6 and EGFR is disrupted, leading to increased EGFR expression and enhanced pathway activation. This disruption is linked to the absence of PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K pathway, suggesting that RANBP6 functions are PTEN-dependent (Oldrini2017EGFR).
