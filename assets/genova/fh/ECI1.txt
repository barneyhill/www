# ECI1

## Overview
ECI1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme enoyl-CoA delta isomerase 1, which plays a critical role in the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids. This enzyme is categorized as an isomerase, a type of enzyme that catalyzes the rearrangement of molecular structures within a single molecule. Enoyl-CoA delta isomerase 1 is primarily involved in the beta-oxidation pathway, a crucial metabolic process that breaks down fatty acids to produce energy. The protein encoded by ECI1 is localized in peroxisomes, where it interacts with the peroxisomal targeting factor Pex5, facilitating its import into these organelles. This interaction is essential for the enzyme's function in fatty acid metabolism, highlighting its importance in cellular energy homeostasis (Peer2024An).

## Structure
The ECI1 protein, encoded by the human ECI1 gene, is involved in fatty acid metabolism. Its primary structure consists of a specific sequence of amino acids, although the exact sequence is not detailed in the provided context. The secondary structure of ECI1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its enzymatic function. The tertiary structure of ECI1 is characterized by its overall three-dimensional shape, stabilized by interactions such as hydrogen bonds and disulfide bridges. This structure is crucial for its enzymatic activity, allowing it to interact with substrates and other molecules effectively.

ECI1 may form a quaternary structure if it associates with other protein subunits, although specific details on such interactions are not provided in the context. The protein contains specific domains that are essential for its function, and it may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and stability. Additionally, ECI1 may have splice variant isoforms, resulting in different functional forms of the protein, which can have implications for its role in metabolic pathways. These structural features are vital for the protein's role in the beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids.

## Interactions
ECI1, or enoyl-CoA delta isomerase 1, interacts with the peroxisomal targeting factor Pex5 through a non-canonical interface, enabling its import into peroxisomes independently of the traditional PTS1 signal. This interaction involves a unique C-terminal segment of ECI1, which includes the PTS1 peroxisomal targeting signal, interacting with the TPR3, TPR6, and TPR7 domains of Pex5. This interaction is characterized by a network of hydrogen bonds and a salt bridge, enhancing the stability and specificity of the ECI1-Pex5 complex (Peer2024An).

The interaction is further stabilized by multiple salt-bridge interactions between specific amino acid residues in both proteins. Negatively charged residues in Pex5 interact with positively charged residues in ECI1, ensuring precise targeting even in the absence of the PTS1 signal. The N-terminal segment of ECI1 also plays a role in fatty acid metabolism by binding Coenzyme A (CoA), suggesting potential competition or coordination between CoA and Pex5 for ECI1 binding (Peer2024An).

ECI1 forms a hexamer, with a single Pex5 monomer binding to this hexamer, as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy. This structural analysis highlights the flexibility of the N-terminal domain of Pex5, which is crucial for the interaction with ECI1 (Peer2024An).
