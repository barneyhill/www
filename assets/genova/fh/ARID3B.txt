# ARID3B

## Overview
ARID3B is a gene that encodes the AT-rich interaction domain 3B protein, a member of the ARID family of DNA-binding proteins. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind to AT-rich DNA sequences, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. ARID3B functions as a transcription factor and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. It is particularly significant in the development of B lymphocytes and embryonic structures such as the apical ectodermal ridge and craniofacial features. The protein is expressed in multiple tissues and has been implicated in the progression of certain cancers, such as neuroblastoma and ovarian cancer, where it influences oncogenic pathways and cell adhesion mechanisms (Kobayashi2006ARID3B; Bobbs2015ARID3B).

## Structure
ARID3B is a member of the ARID family of DNA-binding proteins, characterized by the presence of an ARID domain that binds to AT-rich DNA sequences. The ARID domain in ARID3B is composed of six core helices (H1-H6) and two larger loops (L1 and L2), with additional flanking helices H0 and H7. The secondary structure includes these helices and loops, with L1 making non-sequence specific contacts with the phosphate backbone, and a non-canonical helix-turn-helix motif formed by H4-L2-H5 making sequence-specific contacts with the major groove (Deák2021Missense).

ARID3B also contains a C-terminal oligomerization domain known as REKLES, which is divided into two sub-domains: REKLES-α and REKLES-β. The REKLES-β domain is highly conserved and necessary for nuclear import and export, although ARID3B lacks the nuclear export signal found in some related proteins (Tidwell2011Characterization).

ARID3B has multiple isoforms, including a full-length version and a smaller isoform, ARID3B-Sh, which lacks significant portions of the DNA binding domain and REKLES domains. These isoforms exhibit differential expression patterns across various tissues (Samyesudhas2014Differential). The protein is known to be expressed exclusively within the nucleus (Tidwell2011Characterization).

## Function
ARID3B is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating chromatin accessibility, proliferation, and differentiation in healthy human cells. It is part of the ARID family of DNA-binding proteins, which are involved in modifying chromatin structure and activating transcription (Samyesudhas2014Differential). ARID3B is crucial for the development of B lymphocytes, where it interacts with ARID3A to regulate gene expression, enhancing transcriptional activity on target DNA and influencing B cell differentiation (Kurkewich2016Arid3b). 

In embryonic development, ARID3B is essential for the morphogenesis of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) during limb development, where it regulates cell movements and organization, impacting skeletal formation (Casanova2011Apical). It is also involved in the development of cranial mesenchymal cells, contributing to the formation of craniofacial structures and the outflow tract of the heart (Takebe2006Microarray). 

ARID3B is expressed in various adult tissues, including the spleen, thymus, and epithelial tissues, where it is involved in cell differentiation and development (Samyesudhas2014Differential). Its expression is regulated during cell differentiation, particularly in stratified squamous epithelium and secretory cell types (Samyesudhas2014Differential).

## Clinical Significance
The ARID3B gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various cancers, particularly neuroblastoma and ovarian cancer. In neuroblastoma, ARID3B is overexpressed, especially in advanced stage IV tumors, and is associated with poor prognosis. It plays a critical role in the malignant transformation of neuroblastoma by enhancing oncogenic potential and proliferation, often in cooperation with the MYCN oncogene (Kobayashi2006ARID3B). ARID3B expression is correlated with 11q deletion in neuroblastoma, and its suppression using siRNA significantly impairs tumor growth, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Kobayashi2006ARID3B).

In ovarian cancer, ARID3B is overexpressed and regulates genes in the Wnt signaling pathway, contributing to cancer progression by promoting cell adhesion to extracellular matrix components (Bobbs2015ARID3B). It also influences the expression of cancer stem cell-related genes, which may contribute to tumor growth and chemoresistance (Roy2014ARID3B). The gene's splice form, ARID3B Fl, induces apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells through the TNFa apoptotic pathway, suggesting a complex role in cancer cell survival and death (Joseph2012ARID3B).

## Interactions
ARID3B is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. It has been identified as a binding partner for E2F1, a transcription factor, and the retinoblastoma protein (RB), which are crucial for cell cycle regulation. ARID3B can induce the transcription of E2F target genes and is involved in cell death induction when co-expressed with E2F1, highlighting its role in promoting apoptosis (Saadat2021Distinct). 

ARID3B also interacts with histone-modifying enzymes such as HDAC1, HDAC2, and KDM4C, suggesting its involvement in altering chromatin structure to regulate gene expression (Saadat2021Distinct). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays have demonstrated that ARID3B binds to E2F-responsive genes, including the Cdc2 promoter, with higher levels than control ChIPs, indicating its direct role in gene regulation (Saadat2021Distinct).

Additionally, ARID3B can form heteromeric complexes with other ARID family members, such as ARID3A, through the REKLES domain, which is crucial for its DNA-binding capabilities (Tidwell2011Characterization). These interactions underscore ARID3B's multifaceted role in transcriptional regulation and its potential impact on cellular processes like differentiation and proliferation.
