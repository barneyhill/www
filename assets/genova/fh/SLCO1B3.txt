# SLCO1B3

## Overview
The SLCO1B3 gene encodes the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B3 (OATP1B3), a transmembrane protein that belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters. OATP1B3 is primarily expressed in the liver, where it plays a critical role in the uptake and clearance of a diverse array of endogenous and exogenous organic anions, including bile salts, hormones, and various pharmaceuticals. The protein's structure is characterized by 12 transmembrane helices and unique binding pockets that contribute to its substrate specificity and transport mechanisms (Hagenbuch2004Organic; Ciută2023Structure). Genetic variations in SLCO1B3 can influence the transporter's function, impacting drug metabolism and individual responses to medications. Additionally, SLCO1B3 has clinical significance in conditions such as prostate cancer and Rotor syndrome, where mutations can affect disease progression and treatment outcomes (van2012Complete; Hamada2008Effect).

## Structure
The SLCO1B3 gene encodes the human organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3), which is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transport proteins. OATP1B3 features a major facilitator superfamily fold, characterized by 12 transmembrane helices that form two pseudo-symmetrical bundles, known as the N-bundle and C-bundle (Ciută2023Structure). The protein adopts an inward-open conformation, with a unique binding pocket located exclusively in the C-bundle, which is distinct from other MFS transporters (Ciută2023Structure).

OATP1B3 contains a large extracellular domain with a Kazal-like domain, which is cysteine-rich and unique to organic anion transporting polypeptides (Ciută2023Structure). The protein also has a bicarbonate-binding pocket in the N-bundle, lined by conserved tryptophan residues and interacting with other amino acids, suggesting a role in pH-dependent transport (Ciută2023Structure). This structural feature is not present in OATP1B1, highlighting differences in substrate specificity and transport mechanisms between these transporters (Ciută2023Structure).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may influence the stability and activity of OATP1B3, and alternative splicing can lead to variants that affect its transport efficiency and substrate specificity.

## Function
The SLCO1B3 gene encodes the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3), a crucial transporter protein predominantly expressed in the liver. OATP1B3 is located at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes, where it facilitates the uptake of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous organic anions. These substrates include bile salts, steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, and various drugs such as methotrexate and rifampicin (Letschert2004Mutations; Hagenbuch2004Organic). The protein's function is essential for the hepatic extraction and clearance of these compounds from the bloodstream, playing a significant role in drug metabolism and detoxification processes (Hagenbuch2013The).

OATP1B3 operates as a sodium-independent transporter, often utilizing anion exchange mechanisms to mediate the bidirectional transport of its substrates (Hagenbuch2004Organic). The transport activity of OATP1B3 can be influenced by genetic polymorphisms, which may alter its substrate specificity and transport efficiency, impacting individual drug responses and pharmacokinetics (Letschert2004Mutations; Zaïr2008Pharmacogenetics). The expression of OATP1B3 is regulated by factors such as the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF-1a and the bile acid nuclear receptor FXR/BAR, indicating that bile acids may induce SLCO1B3 gene expression to maintain hepatic function (Hagenbuch2004Organic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLCO1B3 gene have significant clinical implications. SLCO1B3 encodes the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3), which is involved in the transport of various substances, including testosterone and bilirubin. In prostate cancer, particularly androgen-independent prostate cancer, variations in SLCO1B3 can affect testosterone transport. The SLCO1B3 334GG/699AA haplotype is associated with impaired testosterone transport and improved survival outcomes in Caucasian patients, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression and treatment response (Hamada2008Effect).

SLCO1B3 is also implicated in Rotor syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. This condition arises from complete deficiencies in both OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, leading to impaired bilirubin reuptake into the liver and resulting in increased plasma bilirubin levels (van2012Complete). Genetic mutations in SLCO1B3, such as deletions and splice site mutations, contribute to the development of Rotor syndrome by disrupting the normal function of the transporter (van2012Complete). These mutations can also lead to increased drug toxicity risks due to altered drug metabolism (van2012Complete).

## Interactions
SLCO1B3, which encodes the OATP1B3 transporter, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence its function and localization. OATP1B3 can form homo-oligomers, as demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays. These assays also revealed interactions between OATP1B3 and other transporters such as OATP1B1 and NTCP, with these interactions confirmed in human liver sections (Zhang2019Proteinprotein). The functional units of OATP1B3 in these oligomers are individual subunits, and the study is investigating the functional consequences of hetero-oligomerization (Zhang2019Proteinprotein).

The expression and function of OATP1B3 are modulated by interactions with proteins like PDZK1, which affects their trafficking and stabilization in the plasma membrane (Zhang2019Proteinprotein). This interaction is crucial for the proper localization and function of OATP1B3 in hepatocytes. Additionally, the regulation of OATP1B3 expression can be influenced by transcription factors such as HNF3b, which represses its transcription in hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to decreased expression levels (Hagenbuch2013The). These interactions and regulatory mechanisms highlight the complex network of factors that modulate the activity and expression of SLCO1B3 in various physiological and pathological contexts.
