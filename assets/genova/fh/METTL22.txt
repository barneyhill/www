# METTL22

## Overview
METTL22 is a gene that encodes the protein methyltransferase 22, Kin17 lysine, which is a member of the methyltransferase enzyme family. This protein is primarily involved in the post-translational modification of other proteins through methylation, specifically targeting the DNA/RNA-binding protein Kin17. The methylation activity of METTL22 on Kin17, particularly at lysine 135, plays a significant role in modulating Kin17's association with chromatin, thereby influencing essential cellular processes such as DNA replication, repair, and pre-mRNA processing. METTL22 is active in various cellular compartments, including both soluble and chromatin fractions, highlighting its versatile role in cellular homeostasis. The protein's interactions extend to molecular chaperones and other proteins, suggesting its involvement in complex regulatory networks. Clinically, METTL22 has been implicated in cancer progression and neurological disorders, including depression, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (He2024METTL; Cloutier2013A; Cloutier2014Methylation).

## Function
METTL22 is a methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in the methylation of the DNA/RNA-binding protein Kin17. This methylation occurs specifically on lysine 135 of Kin17, a modification that significantly influences Kin17's association with chromatin. In healthy human cells, METTL22's activity affects the localization of Kin17, as overexpression of METTL22 results in the displacement of Kin17 from chromatin to the cytoplasmic fraction. This suggests that METTL22-mediated methylation regulates the chromatin association of Kin17, which is involved in essential cellular processes such as DNA replication, repair, and pre-mRNA processing (Cloutier2014Methylation).

METTL22 is active in both the soluble and chromatin fractions of the cell, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular compartments. The interaction between METTL22 and Kin17 in these fractions highlights its role in modulating protein interactions and stability, which are critical for maintaining genomic integrity and proper gene expression. By influencing the chromatin dynamics and interactions of Kin17, METTL22 contributes to the regulation of DNA repair and transcription processes, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and function (Cloutier2014Methylation).

## Clinical Significance
METTL22 is implicated in various diseases and conditions through its role in methylation processes. Alterations in METTL22 expression or mutations can impact its normal interactions, leading to significant clinical outcomes. In cancer, METTL family mutations, including those affecting METTL22, can contribute to malignant cell proliferation and cancer progression. METTL22 is specifically linked to depression, suggesting its role in neurological disorders (He2024METTL).

The methylation of the DNA/RNA-binding protein Kin17 by METTL22 affects its association with chromatin, which is crucial for DNA replication, repair, and pre-mRNA processing. Overexpression of METTL22 in HEK 293 cells displaces Kin17 from chromatin to the cytoplasmic fraction, indicating that methylation of lysine 135 regulates its chromatin association. This displacement could potentially disrupt normal cellular functions and contribute to disease states (Cloutier2014Methylation).

The METTL family, including METTL22, is also associated with neurological disorders. Alterations in METTL family expression may impact neural function, with METTL22 being linked to depression. This highlights the need for further research into its role in maintaining neural function and potential therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders (He2024METTL).

## Interactions
METTL22 is a methyltransferase that interacts with several proteins, primarily through its role in post-translational modification. One of its main interactions is with the DNA/RNA-binding protein Kin17 (KIN). METTL22 was initially identified in the soluble fraction of a protein affinity purification targeting KIN, suggesting a direct interaction between the two proteins. This interaction was confirmed through affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified KIN as the main interactor of METTL22 (Cloutier2013A). METTL22 trimethylates KIN at lysine 135, a modification that influences KIN's association with chromatin and its cellular localization (Cloutier2014Methylation; Gaspar2021Interactome).

METTL22 also interacts with molecular chaperones, including Hsp70 and Hsp90, as well as chaperonins like HSPD1 and CCT. These interactions suggest a role for METTL22 in regulating chaperone activity (Cloutier2013A). The protein's interaction network was further explored using tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry, resulting in a dataset of 234 interactions with a false discovery rate below 10% (Cloutier2013A). These findings highlight METTL22's involvement in complex regulatory networks through its interactions with various proteins.
