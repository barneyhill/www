# SIN3B

## Overview
The SIN3B gene encodes the SIN3 transcription regulator family member B, a protein that functions as a transcriptional corepressor. This protein is a critical component of the Sin3/HDAC complex, which is involved in histone deacetylation, leading to chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression. As a member of the transcription regulator family, SIN3B plays a significant role in regulating the cell cycle, hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, and cellular senescence. It acts as a scaffold for recruiting chromatin-modifying activities and interacts with various proteins, including histone deacetylases and tumor suppressor p53, to modulate gene expression. The SIN3B protein is implicated in several clinical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Grandinetti2009Sin3B; Latypova2021Haploinsufficiency; Bainor2018The).

## Structure
The SIN3B protein is a member of the SIN3 transcription regulator family and functions as a transcriptional corepressor. It contains several conserved domains, including four paired amphipathic helices (PAH1-4), a histone deacetylase interaction domain (HID), and a highly conserved region (HCR) (Hasan2015pH). The PAH domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, with PAH2 forming a novel 'wedged helical bundle' structure when interacting with the Mad1 protein, involving four α-helices creating a hydrophobic cleft (Vuister2000TheMad1–Sin3Binteractioninvolvesanovelhelicalfold).

The SIN3B protein forms a complex with histone deacetylases (HDACs), PHF12, and MORF4L1, creating a V-shaped structure with a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry. This complex was characterized using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a high-resolution map of the full-length SIN3B complex (Wan2023Mechanism). The SIN3B protein wraps around the catalytic HDAC module, with the middle-domain (MD), HID, and a loop from the C-terminal domain (CTD) interacting with HDAC (Wan2023Mechanism).

SIN3B is subject to post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF220, which targets it for proteasomal degradation (Chaubal2018Same). Additionally, alternative splicing results in multiple isoforms, including a shorter form, SIN3B(293), which lacks the HID region but can still repress basal transcription (Chaubal2018Same).

## Function
The SIN3B gene encodes a protein that is a key component of the Sin3/HDAC complex, which functions as a transcriptional co-repressor in mammalian cells. This complex is involved in histone deacetylation, leading to chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression. SIN3B plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle by interacting with the DREAM complex to repress over 800 cell-cycle-related genes, particularly during quiescence and early G1 phase (Bainor2018The). It is essential for maintaining quiescence by restricting the expression of proteins like cyclin A2, and its deletion results in the premature upregulation of these genes (Bainor2018The).

SIN3B also participates in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation by modulating chromatin structure and gene expression. It restricts cell cycle progression in long-term HSCs, maintaining them in a quiescent state, which is crucial for proper differentiation (Calderon2023The). Additionally, SIN3B is involved in cellular senescence, acting as a barrier to uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer progression by silencing E2F target genes (Grandinetti2009Sin3B). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it serves as a scaffold for recruiting chromatin-modifying activities (Latypova2021Haploinsufficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SIN3B gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers. Haploinsufficiency of SIN3B, a member of the Sin3/histone deacetylase (HDAC) corepressor complex, has been linked to syndromic intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with heterozygous SIN3B deletions or single-nucleotide variants exhibit a range of symptoms, including developmental delay, dysmorphic facial features, congenital malformations, and corpus callosum defects (Latypova2021Haploinsufficiency). Zebrafish models with SIN3B mutations demonstrate altered craniofacial patterning and growth defects, supporting the gene's role in neurodevelopment (Latypova2021Haploinsufficiency).

In cancer, SIN3B expression is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and breast cancer. In HCC, SIN3B promotes integrin αV transcription and cell migration, potentially contributing to cancer progression (Cai2018SIN3B). In breast cancer, SIN3B appears to promote metastasis, with knockdown experiments showing decreased invasiveness and metastasis in breast cancer cells (Lewis2016SIN3A). These findings suggest that SIN3B plays a complex role in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, with its dysregulation contributing to disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
SIN3B is involved in various protein interactions, forming complexes that play significant roles in transcriptional regulation. It interacts with histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 through its HDAC Interaction Domain (HID), which is crucial for the formation of repressive chromatin-modifying complexes (Wan2023Mechanism; Adams2019Differential). SIN3B also forms a tetrameric complex with Pf1, Mrg15, and HDAC1, which binds to nucleosomes enriched with specific histone modifications, such as H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, indicating its role in modulating gene expression (Jelinic2011A).

The protein interacts with the tumor suppressor p53, where it is phosphorylated upon binding, suggesting a role in transcriptional repression mediated by p53 (Bansal2011Tumor). SIN3B also associates with PHF12, which acts as a scaffolding subunit in the SIN3B complex, facilitating interactions with other proteins and nucleosomes (Wan2023Mechanism). In differentiated myotube extracts, SIN3B preferentially interacts with the histone demethylase RBP2, indicating coordinated binding on common target genes (Chaubal2018Same).

SIN3B's interaction with voltage-gated sodium channels suggests a role in modulating channel function, potentially affecting channel trafficking or retrieval from the plasma membrane (Vega2013Interaction). These interactions highlight SIN3B's versatility in forming distinct complexes, influencing various cellular processes.
