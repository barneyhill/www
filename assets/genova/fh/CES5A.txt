# CES5A

## Overview
CES5A is a gene that encodes the protein carboxylesterase 5A, a member of the carboxylesterase family of enzymes. These enzymes are primarily involved in the hydrolysis of ester and amide bonds, playing a crucial role in drug metabolism and detoxification processes. Carboxylesterase 5A, also known as cauxin or CES7, is distinct from other carboxylesterases due to its potential secretion from cells, as it lacks a known endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal (Singh2021Human). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, kidneys, lungs, and testis, suggesting a unique physiological role in these areas (Singh2021Human). Structurally, CES5A is characterized by a catalytic triad and potential glycosylation sites that may enhance its stability and activity (Holmes2010Recommended). Despite its structural and functional significance, the specific substrates and detailed roles of CES5A in cellular processes remain largely unexplored (Singh2021Human).

## Structure
The CES5A protein, encoded by the CES5A gene, consists of 575 amino acid residues and is part of the carboxylesterase family. Its primary structure includes a catalytic triad composed of Ser221, Glu354, and His468, which is conserved across CES subunits (Holmes2010Recommended). The secondary structure of CES5A is predicted to have α-helix and β-sheet structures similar to other CES proteins, with a notable α-helix at the hydrophobic C-terminus, which is unique to CES5A (Holmes2010Recommended). The protein also features a hydrophobic N-terminus signal peptide and a C-terminal ER retention sequence, although it lacks a known endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal, suggesting it may be secreted (Singh2021Human; Holmes2010Recommended).

CES5A contains disulfide bond-forming residues, specifically Cys87/Cys116 and Cys274/Cys285, which contribute to its structural stability (Holmes2010Recommended). Potential N-glycosylation sites at positions 6, 8, and 9 may enhance protein stability and catalytic efficiency (Holmes2010Recommended). The absence of charge clamps in CES5A suggests it may not form the same oligomeric structures as CES1, indicating a likely monomeric state (Holmes2008Mammalian; Singh2021Human).

## Function
CES5A, also known as cauxin and CES7, is a carboxylesterase enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of ester and amide bonds, contributing to drug metabolism and detoxification processes. Unlike other carboxylesterases, CES5A lacks a known endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal, suggesting it may be secreted from cells. It is expressed in the brain, kidneys, lungs, and testis, indicating a potentially unique role in these tissues (Singh2021Human).

The enzyme is thought to play a role in xenobiotic and lipid metabolism, although this has not been experimentally confirmed. CES5A has up to four potential glycosylation sites, which may enhance its stability and activity if secreted into body fluids (Singh2021Human). Sequence analysis and models suggest that CES5A is likely monomeric, with major structural differences compared to CES1, particularly an alpha helix near the site where the acyl product is released. However, the exact influence of these structural differences on substrate scope has not been hypothesized or experimentally determined (Singh2021Human).

The enzyme's activity and function in healthy human cells remain largely unexplored, with its specific substrates and roles in cellular processes yet to be fully elucidated (Singh2021Human).
