# MMS19

## Overview
MMS19 is a gene that encodes the MMS19 homolog, a cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly component protein, which plays a pivotal role in the maturation of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins. These proteins are crucial for various cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, transcription, and chromosome segregation. The MMS19 protein is a part of the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) targeting complex, which is essential for the transfer of Fe-S clusters to target apoproteins in both the cytosol and nucleus (Paul2015Biogenesis; Stehling2012MMS19). Structurally, the MMS19 protein is characterized by multiple domains that facilitate its involvement in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and RNA polymerase II transcription (Hatfield2006Identification). The gene's function and interactions underscore its importance in maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis, with potential implications in clinical contexts such as cancer susceptibility and treatment outcomes (Moxley2013The).

## Structure
The human MMS19 protein is composed of 1030 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 113 kDa. It features an alanine-rich N-terminus and hydrophobic regions at both the N- and C-terminal parts, which contribute to its structural characteristics (Seroz2000Cloning). The protein contains amphiphatic helical motifs and a putative nuclear localization signal (KKRXXRK) in the C-terminus, indicating its role in nuclear functions (Seroz2000Cloning).

MMS19 is characterized by three functional domains: A, B, and C. Domain A, located at the N-terminus, is the least conserved and is not essential for nucleotide excision repair (NER) but is necessary for transcription. Domain B, spanning amino acids 165-282, includes two highly conserved motifs crucial for NER. Domain C contains four HEAT repeats, which are essential for the assembly and stability of multiprotein complexes involved in NER and RNA polymerase II transcription (Hatfield2006Identification).

The protein exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which result in polypeptides lacking different domains. These variants suggest distinct structural and functional roles, influencing the protein's ability to switch between NER and transcription processes (Hatfield2006Identification).

## Function
The MMS19 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein assembly pathway, playing a crucial role in the maturation of Fe-S proteins. These proteins are essential for various DNA metabolic processes, including DNA replication, repair, transcription, and chromosome segregation (Paul2015Biogenesis; Stehling2012MMS19). MMS19 functions as part of the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) targeting complex, which includes CIA1 and CIA2B, facilitating the transfer of Fe-S clusters to target apoproteins in the cytosol and nucleus (Paul2015Biogenesis; Stehling2012MMS19).

In healthy human cells, MMS19 is involved in the maturation of specific Fe-S proteins, such as DNA polymerase subunits and DNA helicases, which are critical for maintaining genome stability (Paul2015Biogenesis). The protein also interacts with the transcription repair factor TFIIH via the XPB and XPD helicases, suggesting a role in DNA repair and transcription (Seroz2000Cloning). The depletion of MMS19 affects the incorporation of XPD into TFIIH, impacting DNA metabolism and increasing sensitivity to DNA damage (Paul2015Biogenesis; Stehling2012MMS19). Overall, MMS19 is essential for the proper functioning of Fe-S proteins, contributing to cellular homeostasis and genomic integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the MMS19 gene, which is involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and RNA polymerase II transcription, have potential clinical significance. In yeast, mutations in MMS19 lead to increased sensitivity to UV and DNA-cross-linking agents, impairing the incision step of NER, which suggests that similar mutations in humans could result in conditions affecting both NER and transcription (Lauder1996Dual). The human homolog, hMMS19, interacts with the transcription repair factor TFIIH via the XPB and XPD helicases, which are crucial for NER and transcription. Although no direct genetic disorders have been linked to hMMS19, its interaction with TFIIH suggests a potential role in stabilizing this complex, which is relevant in disorders like trichothiodystrophy (TTD) that involve TFIIH defects (Seroz2000Cloning).

Additionally, polymorphisms in the MMS19 gene have been studied in the context of cancer. For instance, certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MMS19 have been associated with progression-free survival in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, although they do not significantly impact overall survival (Moxley2013The). These findings indicate that MMS19 may influence cancer susceptibility and treatment outcomes.

## Interactions
MMS19 is involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins and interacts with several components of the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) machinery. It forms a complex with CIAO1 and FAM96B, known as the CIA targeting complex, which facilitates the transfer of Fe-S clusters to target proteins essential for DNA replication, repair, and telomere stability (Gari2012MMS19; Stehling2012MMS19). MMS19 also interacts with the DNA repair helicase XPD, a component of the TFIIH complex, which is crucial for nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription (Hatfield2006Identification; Stehling2012MMS19).

In human cells, MMS19 is required for the Fe-S cluster assembly of specific proteins, such as dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) and the POLD1 subunit of DNA polymerase δ (Stehling2012MMS19). It also interacts with RTEL1, a helicase involved in telomere-length regulation and genomic stability, and is a major interaction partner of RTEL1, as identified by mass spectrometry (Gari2012MMS19).

In Arabidopsis, MMS19 associates with components of the Fe-S assembly complex, including CIA1, CIA2/AE7, and NAR1, and interacts with the catalytic subunits of DNA polymerases α, δ, and ε (Han2015The). These interactions suggest a role in transcriptional gene silencing, DNA repair, and flowering time regulation (Han2015The).
