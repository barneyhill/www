# TMEM9

## Overview
TMEM9 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 9, a type I transmembrane protein primarily localized in lysosomes, late endosomes, and multivesicular bodies. This protein is characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, including autophagy and lysosomal acidification, through its interactions with key proteins such as Beclin1 and components of the vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) complex. TMEM9 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and nutrient sensing by influencing the mTORC1 signaling pathway. It is also implicated in pathological conditions, such as colorectal cancer and asthma, where its expression levels and interactions with other proteins can modulate disease progression and cellular signaling pathways (Jones2020Discovery; Baek2024TMEM9; Jung2018TMEM9).

## Structure
TMEM9 is a type I transmembrane protein predominantly localized in lysosomes, late endosomes, and multivesicular bodies. It consists of 183 amino acids and includes an N-terminal signal peptide and a single transmembrane spanning region. The protein has three N-glycosylation sites located at the N-terminal part of the mature form, specifically at positions N21, N38, and N47, which are crucial for its lysosomal localization and interaction with Beclin1 (Baek2024TMEM9; Wang2024TMEM9). 

The transmembrane domain (TMD) of TMEM9 contains a dimerization motif, suggesting potential oligomerization, which may be relevant to its function in cellular processes (Jung2018TMEM9). TMEM9 also features two phosphorylation sites at S137 and S144 in the cytosolic region, which may play a role in its regulatory functions (Baek2024TMEM9).

TMEM9 interacts with components of the vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) complex, specifically ATP6AP2 and ATP6V0D1, enhancing v-ATPase activity, which is crucial for maintaining the acidic environment in membranous organelles (Jung2018TMEM9). This interaction is essential for its role in promoting intestinal tumorigenesis through Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Jung2018TMEM9).

## Function
TMEM9 (transmembrane protein 9) is a lysosomal protein involved in Rab9-dependent alternative autophagy, a process distinct from the conventional LC3-dependent autophagy. TMEM9 interacts with Beclin1, a key regulator of autophagy, and this interaction is crucial for the activation of Rab9-dependent pathways. The glycosylation of TMEM9 is essential for its proper localization to the lysosome and its interaction with Beclin1. When glycosylation is disrupted, TMEM9 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and cannot interact with Beclin1, impairing its function in autophagy (Baek2024TMEM9).

TMEM9 also plays a role in regulating lysosomal acidification through its interaction with the v-type ATPase complex. This interaction is important for autophagosome maturation, a critical step in the autophagy process. TMEM9's subcellular localization overlaps with lysosomal and late endosome markers, indicating its involvement in these cellular compartments (Baek2024TMEM9).

In healthy human cells, TMEM9 is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and nutrient sensing by influencing the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and metabolism. It is primarily active in the endosomal and lysosomal membranes, where it regulates endosomal trafficking and lysosomal function (Baek2024TMEM9).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of TMEM9 have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and pulmonary conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), TMEM9 is significantly upregulated, promoting intestinal tumorigenesis through the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This upregulation enhances vesicular acidification and trafficking, leading to the hyperactivation of Wnt signaling, which is crucial for cancer development (Jung2018TMEM9). TMEM9's role in CRC is further supported by its interaction with the vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) complex, which is essential for its function in modulating Wnt signaling (Jung2018TMEM9).

In pulmonary diseases, TMEM9 has been linked to asthma pathogenesis. The expression of TMEM9 is inversely correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β in nasal epithelial cells, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in asthma. Reduced TMEM9 expression is associated with decreased lung function, specifically a reduction in FEV1, and the IL-6/IL-1β asthma subtype (Jones2020Discovery).

TMEM9 also plays a role in autophagy, where its interaction with Beclin1 is crucial for Rab9-dependent alternative autophagy. Alterations in TMEM9 expression or mutations affecting its glycosylation could impact autophagic processes, potentially influencing cellular homeostasis and disease states (Baek2024TMEM9).

## Interactions
TMEM9 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as tumorigenesis and autophagy. In colorectal cancer (CRC), TMEM9 is upregulated and interacts with components of the vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) complex, specifically ATP6AP2 and ATP6V0D1. This interaction enhances v-ATPase activity, leading to increased vesicular acidification and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for CRC progression (Jung2018TMEM9). TMEM9's interaction with ATP6AP2 is dependent on its transmembrane domain, while its interaction with ATP6V0D1 is not (Jung2018TMEM9).

In the context of autophagy, TMEM9 interacts with Beclin1, a key regulator of autophagy. This interaction is essential for Rab9-dependent alternative autophagy, a process distinct from conventional LC3-dependent autophagy. TMEM9 competes with Bcl-2 for binding to Beclin1, facilitating the dissociation of Bcl-2 and promoting autophagy (Baek2024TMEM9). TMEM9's proper lysosomal localization and interaction with Beclin1 are dependent on its N-linked glycosylation (Baek2024TMEM9).

These interactions highlight TMEM9's role in modulating key signaling pathways and cellular processes through its binding with other proteins.
