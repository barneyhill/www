# HLA-DQA1

## Overview
The HLA-DQA1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which are integral to the immune system's function. This gene is responsible for producing the DQ alpha 1 chain, which pairs with the DQ beta chain to form a heterodimeric structure essential for antigen presentation. The protein encoded by HLA-DQA1 is categorized as a transmembrane protein, featuring an extracellular domain that binds and presents peptides to CD4+ T cells, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. This antigen presentation is vital for initiating immune responses and maintaining immune tolerance. Variations in the HLA-DQA1 gene have been linked to several autoimmune diseases, highlighting its significance in immune regulation and disease susceptibility (Beppu2022High; Miyadera2014Cellsurface).

## Structure
The HLA-DQA1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which are essential for immune response. The protein is composed of an alpha chain that pairs with a beta chain to form a heterodimer. The structure includes an extracellular domain responsible for antigen binding and presentation, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domain features alpha helices and beta sheets, which are typical of MHC class II molecules. 

The HLA-DQA1 protein undergoes common post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can affect its stability and function. Variants in the HLA-DQA1 gene can lead to different isoforms, influencing immune function. The HLA-DQA1*05:03 allele, in particular, has been studied for its high cell surface expression and peptide binding affinity, which are attributed to its specific amino acid sequence. The α1 domain's amino acid sequence, especially at position L75, plays a crucial role in maintaining high expression levels and the molecular structure of the protein (Beppu2022High). The larger peptide binding cavity of HLA-DQA1*05:03 allows for greater conformational entropy and better accommodation of peptide side-chains, contributing to its high binding affinity (Beppu2022High).

## Function
HLA-DQA1 is a gene that encodes a protein component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which are essential for the immune system's ability to present extracellularly derived peptides to CD4+ T cells. This process is crucial for initiating and regulating immune responses. The HLA-DQA1 protein forms a heterodimer with the HLA-DQB1 protein, creating the peptide-binding groove necessary for antigen presentation (Miyadera2014Cellsurface).

In healthy human cells, HLA-DQA1 is expressed on antigen-presenting cells such as B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. These cells play a key role in adaptive immunity by presenting peptides to T cells, which is essential for maintaining self-tolerance and adaptive immune responses (Miyadera2014Cellsurface). The stability of the HLA-DQ molecules, influenced by specific amino acid residues, affects their ability to present peptides effectively. This stability is crucial for the proper function of the MHC in presenting peptides and is a significant factor in immune system function (Miyadera2014Cellsurface).

The intrinsic stability of HLA-DQ proteins, including those encoded by HLA-DQA1, is determined by interdomain hydrogen bonds and interactions with the peptide main chain, which are mediated by specific polymorphic sites (Miyadera2014Cellsurface). These interactions ensure the effective presentation of peptides, which is vital for the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to pathogens.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the HLA-DQA1 gene are associated with several autoimmune diseases. The HLA-DQA1*05:03 allele is linked to neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), a relapsing autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of anti-aquaporin 4 (AQP4) antibodies. This allele exhibits high cell surface expression and peptide binding affinity, which may contribute to its role in NMOSD susceptibility by efficiently presenting AQP4 peptides to CD4+ T cells, promoting their differentiation into effector T cells and subsequent anti-AQP4 antibody production (Beppu2022High).

In idiopathic membranous nephropathy (iMN), a significant association has been found between certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the HLA-DQA1 gene and the disease in Japanese patients. This association is consistent with findings in other populations, suggesting a genetic predisposition linked to HLA-DQA1 variations (Kaga2017Analysis).

The HLA-DQA1 gene is also implicated in primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) among South Asians, where the SNP rs2187668 is associated with anti-PLA2R positivity, indicating a potential gene-gene interaction between HLA-DQA1 and PLA2R1 as determinants of PMN risk (Ramachandran2015PLA2R).

## Interactions
HLA-DQA1 is a component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which play a crucial role in the immune system by presenting peptides to CD4+ T cells. This gene forms a heterodimer with HLA-DQB1, creating the antigen-presenting groove essential for immune response activation (Wang2019Interaction). The interaction between HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 is fundamental for the formation of HLA-DQ molecules, which are involved in presenting peptides to the immune system (Beppu2022High).

The HLA-DQA1*05:03 allele, in particular, has been studied for its interactions with immunodominant aquaporin 4 (AQP4) peptides, which are relevant in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). This allele has a larger peptide binding cavity, allowing for greater conformational entropy and better accommodation of peptide side-chains, such as the ability to bury a large aromatic side-chain like tyrosine (Beppu2022High). The energetic stability of the peptide-MHC complex involving HLA-DQA1*05:03 and AQP4 peptides has been evaluated using tools like ImmuneScape and EMPIRE, indicating a significant role in presenting AQP4 peptides and potentially influencing the immune response in NMOSD (Beppu2022High).
