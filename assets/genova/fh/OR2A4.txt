# OR2A4

## Overview
The OR2A4 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily A member 4, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily known for its role in the olfactory system, where it detects odor molecules. However, OR2A4 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as human melanocytes and keratinocytes, where it participates in various cellular processes beyond olfaction. In melanocytes, OR2A4 is implicated in the regulation of melanogenesis, influencing skin pigmentation and protection against UV radiation. In keratinocytes, it plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation, impacting wound healing and skin renewal (Wojcik2018Functional; Tsai2016Two).

## Structure


## Function
The OR2A4 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, traditionally associated with the detection of odor molecules in the olfactory epithelium. However, OR2A4 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as human melanocytes and keratinocytes, where it plays significant roles in cellular processes beyond olfaction.

In human melanocytes, OR2A4 is involved in the regulation of melanogenesis, the process of melanin production. Upon activation by the odorant cyclohexyl salicylate (CHS), OR2A4 triggers intracellular signaling pathways that increase levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and calcium ions (Ca2+). This activation leads to enhanced melanin biosynthesis, growth inhibition, and differentiation of melanocytes, contributing to skin pigmentation and protection against UV radiation (Wojcik2018Functional).

In keratinocytes, OR2A4 activation by CHS influences cell proliferation and differentiation. It is involved in a cAMP-dependent signaling cascade that affects cytokinesis and cell cycle regulation, impacting processes such as wound healing and skin cell renewal (Tsai2016Two). These findings suggest that OR2A4 has diverse functions in skin physiology, contributing to both pigmentation and cellular regeneration.
