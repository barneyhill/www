# OGFOD1

## Overview
OGFOD1 is a gene that encodes the protein 2-oxoglutarate and iron-dependent oxygenase domain-containing 1, which is a member of the 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase superfamily. This protein functions as a prolyl hydroxylase, primarily targeting the small ribosomal protein S23 (RPS23) to regulate translational fidelity and protein synthesis. The enzymatic activity of OGFOD1 is crucial for cellular stress responses, including the modulation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation, which is vital for translation initiation during stress conditions. OGFOD1's interactions with various proteins, such as RPS23 and components of stress granules, underscore its role in translation control and stress granule formation. Additionally, OGFOD1 has been implicated in cancer progression and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Lee2021Phosphorylation; Wehner2010OGFOD1; Singleton2014OGFOD1).

## Structure
OGFOD1 is a protein that belongs to the 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase superfamily. It is characterized by a double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) fold, which is a common structural motif in this enzyme family (McDonough2010Structural). The DSBH fold supports a conserved triad of iron-binding residues and a 2-oxoglutarate co-substrate binding site, essential for its enzymatic activity (McDonough2010Structural).

The protein consists of 542 amino acids and includes a putative N-terminal oxygenase domain, which is involved in its catalytic function (Singleton2014OGFOD1). The N-terminal domain contains the catalytic site, while the C-terminal domain is non-catalytic (Singleton2014OGFOD1). OGFOD1 forms a stable complex with its substrate, the small ribosomal protein RPS23, which is unusual for 2OG oxygenases (Singleton2014OGFOD1).

OGFOD1 is involved in the posttranslational hydroxylation of RPS23, specifically at Pro-62, which is crucial for mRNA codon recognition during protein synthesis (Thinnes2019Selective). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context. OGFOD1 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its function and interactions.

## Function
OGFOD1 is a 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase that functions as a prolyl hydroxylase, primarily targeting the small ribosomal protein S23 (RPS23) in human cells. This enzyme catalyzes the hydroxylation of a conserved proline residue (Pro-62) in RPS23, a modification crucial for maintaining translational fidelity and regulating protein synthesis (Loenarz2014Hydroxylation; Singleton2014OGFOD1). The hydroxylation of RPS23 by OGFOD1 is essential for the formation of a stable OGFOD1-RPS23 complex, which plays a significant role in translation control and stress granule formation (Singleton2014OGFOD1).

OGFOD1 is involved in cellular stress responses, particularly in modulating the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), which is critical for translation initiation during stress. Its activity influences the recovery of translation post-stress and is linked to the regulation of stress granule formation (Wehner2010OGFOD1; Singleton2014OGFOD1). The enzyme's function is crucial for cell growth and proliferation, as its knockdown leads to stress granule formation, translational arrest, and growth impairment in a cell type-dependent manner (Singleton2014OGFOD1). OGFOD1's activity is also associated with cellular adaptation to oxygen levels and ischemic signaling (Loenarz2014Hydroxylation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the OGFOD1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and metabolic disorders. In breast cancer, OGFOD1 is a critical regulator of cell proliferation and poor prognosis. Its interaction with RNA polymerase II and phosphorylation by CDK7 and CDK9 are essential for its oncogenic potential. The nuclear localization of OGFOD1 is crucial, as only the wild-type form can rescue phosphorylation levels and proliferation rates in knockout cells. Mutations affecting its phosphorylation, such as at serine 256, significantly impact its role in promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Lee2021Phosphorylation).

In the context of metabolic disorders, deletion of OGFOD1 in mice has shown protective effects against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. OGFOD1 knockout mice exhibit resistance to weight gain and maintain better insulin sensitivity when subjected to a high-fat diet, suggesting that down-regulation of OGFOD1 could be a potential strategy for managing obesity and related metabolic issues (Rodriguez2024Deleting).

OGFOD1 also plays a role in neuroprotection following ischemic stroke. Inhibition of OGFOD1 activates the unfolded protein response and autophagy, reducing cell injury and promoting recovery, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for ischemic events (Xie2024Inhibition).

## Interactions
OGFOD1 is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with the small ribosomal subunit protein RPS23, forming a stable complex that is dependent on OGFOD1's catalytic activity. This interaction is essential for the hydroxylation of RPS23, which plays a role in translation control and stress granule formation (Singleton2014OGFOD1).

OGFOD1 also interacts with components of stress granules, such as G3BP1, USP10, Caprin1, and YB-1, in both stressed and unstressed cells. These interactions are RNA-independent and suggest a role for OGFOD1 in modulating the cellular stress response (Wehner2010OGFOD1). The interaction with G3BP1 is particularly significant, as G3BP1 influences the stability of specific OGFOD1 forms, which are involved in the regulation of eIF2α phosphorylation during stress (Wehner2010OGFOD1).

In breast cancer cells, OGFOD1 interacts with RNA polymerase II, particularly its C-terminal domain, affecting transcriptional activity. This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation events, which are crucial for OGFOD1's role in cancer cell proliferation (Lee2021Phosphorylation).
