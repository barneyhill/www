# TEKT4

## Overview
TEKT4 is a gene that encodes the protein tektin 4, which is a member of the tektin family of proteins. Tektins are structural proteins that play a crucial role in the formation and stability of microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. The tektin 4 protein is particularly important in the assembly and function of cilia and flagella, contributing to their structural integrity and motility. Research has shown that TEKT4 is involved in various cellular processes, and its expression and mutations have been linked to several pathological conditions, including cancer. The gene's role in modulating microtubule dynamics makes it a significant focus of study in understanding its contribution to disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions (Zheng2018TEKT4; Jiang2014Enriched).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the TEKT4 gene have been implicated in several cancer types, affecting disease progression and treatment response. In papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), alterations in TEKT4, such as the c.1276_1279delinsACCC mutation, have been associated with increased cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. This suggests that TEKT4 may play a role in promoting PTC progression, potentially through the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (Zheng2018TEKT4).

In breast cancer, specific germline variations in TEKT4, including c.A541G and c.A547G, have been linked to resistance to the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel. These variations are associated with reduced microtubule stability, which counteracts paclitaxel's stabilizing effects, leading to increased drug resistance. Patients with these TEKT4 variations often exhibit poorer disease-free and overall survival rates when treated with paclitaxel-based chemotherapy (Jiang2014Enriched). The presence of these variations has been proposed as a biomarker for predicting treatment response and guiding therapeutic strategies in breast cancer (Jiang2014Enriched).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of TEKT4 in cancer, suggesting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention and a marker for treatment resistance.
