# IZUMO2

## Overview
IZUMO2 is a gene that encodes the protein IZUMO family member 2, which is part of the IZUMO protein family involved in gamete fusion. The protein is categorized as a single-pass transmembrane protein and is a member of a conserved superfamily associated with gamete fusion processes (Vance2022SPACA6a; Vance2022SPACA6). Structurally, IZUMO2 is characterized by a four-helix bundle (4HB) domain, which is a common feature among IZUMO family proteins, although it lacks the immunoglobulin-like domain found in IZUMO1 (Vance2022SPACA6a; Vance2022SPACA6). The IZUMO domain includes a pattern of eight conserved cysteines and a secondary structure of four α-helices, contributing to its role in gamete fusion (Ellerman2009Izumo). While the precise function of IZUMO2 in gamete fusion is not fully understood, its structural features suggest a significant role in this biological process.

## Structure
IZUMO2 is a member of the IZUMO protein family, which is involved in gamete fusion. The protein is predicted to be a single-pass membrane protein, similar to IZUMO1, and is part of a conserved superfamily of gamete fusion-associated proteins (Vance2022SPACA6a; Vance2022SPACA6). IZUMO2 is characterized by a four-helix bundle (4HB) domain, which is a common structural feature among IZUMO family members. This domain is predicted to have a similar disulfide pattern to IZUMO1, although IZUMO2 lacks the immunoglobulin-like domain present in IZUMO1 (Vance2022SPACA6a; Vance2022SPACA6).

The IZUMO domain, shared among the IZUMO family, includes a pattern of eight conserved cysteines and a predicted secondary structure of four α-helices (Ellerman2009Izumo). The IST superfamily, which includes IZUMO2, is characterized by a distorted 4HB domain with helices packed in an alternating anti-parallel/parallel fashion, a triangular face made from two helices and a third perpendicular helix, and a double CXXC motif connecting the perpendicular helix to a flexible hinge region via dual disulfide bonds (Vance2022SPACA6). The specific roles of IZUMO2 in gamete fusion remain to be fully established.
