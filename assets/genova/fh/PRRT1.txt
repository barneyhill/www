# PRRT1

## Overview
PRRT1, or proline-rich transmembrane protein 1, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane protein, also known as SynDIG4. This protein is characterized by its proline-rich intracellular domain and its involvement in the regulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) in the brain. As a member of the dispanin superfamily, PRRT1 features a unique topology with a single transmembrane domain and a second hydrophobic segment that does not fully span the membrane, contributing to its role in AMPAR trafficking and stabilization (Dίaz2021Beyond; Martin2021Interaction). PRRT1 interacts with AMPAR subunits GluA1-GluA4, influencing synaptic plasticity and receptor surface levels, which are critical for fast excitatory synaptic transmission and processes such as learning and memory (Plambeck2022Mutually; Martin2021Interaction). The protein's interactions with protein phosphatase 2B further underscore its role in modulating synaptic strength and plasticity (Martin2021Interaction).

## Structure
PRRT1, also known as SynDIG4, is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by a single transmembrane domain and a second hydrophobic segment that does not span the membrane completely (Dίaz2021Beyond; Martin2021Interaction). The protein's topology includes a large proline-rich intracellular N-terminus, a small intracellular loop, and a small extracellular C-terminus (Plambeck2022Mutually). The second hydrophobic helix forms the transmembrane domain, while the first hydrophobic helix forms a loop on the inner leaflet or associates peripherally (Martin2021Interaction).

PRRT1 is palmitoylated at conserved juxtatransmembrane cysteine residues, which influences its stability, localization, and function (Dίaz2021Beyond). The protein is part of the dispanin superfamily, which includes proteins with two predicted transmembrane domains (Dίaz2021Beyond). PRRT1 has several isoforms, including Isoform 1 (306 amino acids), Isoform 2 (225 amino acids), and Isoform 3 (153 amino acids) (Dίaz2021Beyond).

PRRT1 interacts with AMPA receptor subunits GluA1-GluA4 through direct protein-protein interactions, likely involving its transmembrane domain (Martin2021Interaction). It plays a role in AMPAR trafficking and channel properties, potentially affecting the deactivation and desensitization kinetics of these receptors (Dίaz2021Beyond).

## Function
PRRT1, also known as proline-rich transmembrane protein 1, plays a significant role in the regulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) in the brain. It is a component of native AMPAR complexes and is involved in modulating their biophysical properties and subcellular trafficking. PRRT1 interacts with all AMPAR subunits (GluA1-GluA4), influencing AMPAR function and synaptic plasticity, which are crucial for fast excitatory synaptic transmission (Martin2021Interaction).

PRRT1 is primarily associated with extrasynaptic AMPARs, particularly GluA1 homomers, and is found at extrasynaptic sites on endosomes, suggesting a role in AMPAR trafficking and stabilization at the plasma membrane (Kirk2015Distribution; Martin2021Interaction). It interacts with protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B), which regulates GluA1 phosphorylation, indicating its involvement in synaptic plasticity processes (Martin2021Interaction).

The protein's topology includes a transmembrane domain and an intracellular loop, facilitating direct protein-protein interactions that influence AMPAR channel properties and trafficking (Martin2021Interaction). PRRT1's function in neurons is essential for maintaining synaptic strength and plasticity, contributing to learning and memory processes (Plambeck2022Mutually).

## Interactions
PRRT1, also known as SynDIG4, is a proline-rich transmembrane protein that interacts with AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits, including GluA1, GluA2, GluA3, and GluA4, through direct protein-protein interactions. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of AMPAR trafficking and channel properties, influencing synaptic plasticity and receptor surface levels (Martin2021Interaction). PRRT1 is associated with AMPAR complexes in various brain regions and is primarily found at extrasynaptic sites, such as early endosomes, where it stabilizes AMPARs (Martin2021Interaction).

PRRT1 also interacts with protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B or calcineurin), a regulator of GluA1 phosphorylation, indicating a role in modulating AMPAR phosphorylation states (Martin2021Interaction). The interaction with PP2B is robust, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Martin2021Interaction).

In addition to its interactions with AMPARs, PRRT1 is involved in clustering AMPAR subunits GluA1 and GluA2, which is essential for synaptic strengthening and maintaining a reserve pool of AMPARs for long-term potentiation (LTP) (Dίaz2021Beyond; Plambeck2022Mutually). The clustering activity is dependent on specific regions within PRRT1 and the AMPAR subunits, highlighting the importance of these interactions in synaptic function (Plambeck2022Mutually).
