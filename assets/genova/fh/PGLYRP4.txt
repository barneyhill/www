# PGLYRP4

## Overview
PGLYRP4 is a gene that encodes the protein peptidoglycan recognition protein 4, which is a key component of the innate immune system. This protein is categorized as a pattern recognition receptor and is involved in identifying bacterial peptidoglycans, which are essential components of bacterial cell walls. PGLYRP4 is expressed in various tissues exposed to the external environment, such as the skin and mucosal surfaces, where it plays a critical role in maintaining epithelial integrity and providing a defense mechanism against bacterial infections. Unlike traditional antimicrobial peptides, PGLYRP4 does not kill bacteria by disrupting their membranes; instead, it inhibits the function of peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes, thereby exerting its antimicrobial effects. The protein's activity is enhanced by calcium ions and requires N-glycosylation for optimal function (Lu2006Peptidoglycan).

## Structure
PGLYRP4 is a protein involved in the immune response, characterized by its ability to recognize bacterial peptidoglycans. The primary structure of PGLYRP4 consists of a polypeptide chain of 374 amino acids, encoded by an open reading frame of 1125 nucleotides (Ueda2011Molecular). The protein contains two PGRP domains, which overlap with amidase domains, crucial for its function in binding peptidoglycans (Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs; Ueda2011Molecular) page 0 of 4). 

The secondary structure includes a ligand-binding groove that specifically targets MurNAc bound to peptide-bonded amino acids, a feature shared with other PGRPs (Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs) page 3 of 4). The tertiary structure is stabilized by conserved cysteines forming disulfide bonds, essential for the protein's activity (Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs) page 0 of 4). 

PGLYRP4 can form disulfide-linked homodimers and heterodimers with PGLYRP3, indicating a quaternary structure (Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs) page 0 of 4). The protein also has several N-glycosylation sites, with six identified in the porcine version, which may influence its antimicrobial activity (Ueda2011Molecular). These structural features are critical for its role in the immune response.

## Function
PGLYRP4 (peptidoglycan recognition protein 4) is a crucial component of the innate immune system, primarily involved in recognizing and binding to bacterial peptidoglycan, a key component of bacterial cell walls. This protein is secreted as disulfide-linked homo- or heterodimers, often forming heterodimers with PGLYRP3 when co-expressed in the same cells (Lu2006Peptidoglycan). Unlike traditional antimicrobial peptides, PGLYRP4 does not kill bacteria by permeabilizing their membranes. Instead, it interacts with the cell wall peptidoglycan, inhibiting the access of peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes, which is similar to the action of certain antibiotics (Lu2006Peptidoglycan).

PGLYRP4 is expressed in various tissues that are in contact with the external environment, such as the skin, eyes, and mucosal tissues, including the throat, esophagus, and gastrointestinal tract (Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs; Lu2006Peptidoglycan) page 2 of 4). It plays a significant role in maintaining epithelial integrity and contributes to the innate immune response by providing a defense mechanism against bacterial infections in these tissues (Dziarski2006Thepeptidoglycanrecognitionproteins(PGRPs; Lu2006Peptidoglycan) page 2 of 4). The protein's bactericidal activity is enhanced in the presence of calcium ions and requires N-glycosylation for its function (Lu2006Peptidoglycan).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PGLYRP4 gene have been associated with several inflammatory diseases. PGLYRP4, along with other peptidoglycan recognition proteins, plays a crucial role in maintaining gut microbiota balance and protecting against colitis. Deficiencies in PGLYRP4 can lead to dysbiosis, resulting in a pro-inflammatory microbiota that exacerbates conditions like ulcerative colitis. This dysbiosis can attract natural killer cells, leading to excessive interferon-γ production and intestinal damage (Royet2011Peptidoglycan; Dziarski2016PglyrpRegulated).

In addition to colitis, PGLYRP4 is implicated in other inflammatory conditions. Genetic associations have been identified between human PGLYRP4 variants and inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis. PGLYRP4 is also located near susceptibility loci for these diseases, suggesting a genetic predisposition linked to its expression (Dziarski2016PglyrpRegulated).

Furthermore, PGLYRP4 has been associated with skin conditions such as psoriasis. Its expression is genetically linked to psoriasis, indicating that alterations in PGLYRP4 may influence the development of this condition (Dziarski2016PglyrpRegulated). These findings underscore the importance of PGLYRP4 in immune regulation and its potential impact on inflammatory diseases.
