# SEC14L4

## Overview
SEC14L4 is a gene that encodes the SEC14-like lipid-binding protein 4, a member of the SEC14-like family of proteins. This protein is characterized by the presence of a SEC14 domain, which is involved in lipid binding and transport, and a C-terminal Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions related to Golgi function. The SEC14L4 protein plays a crucial role in intracellular lipid transport and regulatory lipid-dependent events, influencing cellular processes such as signal transduction and membrane trafficking. It is involved in the modulation of the phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI3K) pathway, which is significant in cell proliferation and survival, particularly in the context of cancer. The gene has been implicated in various conditions, including oxidative hemolysis and potentially neurodegenerative and cancerous processes, although its full clinical significance remains to be elucidated (Page2021Multipleancestry; Montag2023Role; Kempna2009Alternative).

## Structure
The SEC14L4 protein, also known as TAP3, is part of the SEC14-like family of proteins, characterized by the presence of a SEC14 domain and a C-terminal Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain. The SEC14 domain is a lipid-binding domain that forms a hydrophobic pocket, allowing it to bind and enclose lipophilic ligands as whole molecules. This domain is crucial for lipid transport and signal transduction, facilitating the binding of various lipids, including phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylinositol phosphates (Saito2007The; Montag2023Role).

The GOLD domain, consisting of eight β-strands organized as a jelly-roll barrel, is involved in protein-protein interactions related to Golgi function or trafficking (Saito2007The). This domain suggests a role in integrating lipid signaling with protein complexes in organelle homeostasis or traffic. The SEC14L4 protein can also bind α-tocopherol and its derivatives, indicating a potential role in preventing lipid peroxidation (Montag2023Role).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of SEC14L4 are not provided, the presence of these domains highlights its functional importance in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling pathways. The protein's ability to bind various lipids and its involvement in membrane trafficking underscore its significance in cellular processes.

## Function
The SEC14L4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the SEC14-like lipid-binding protein family, which is involved in intracellular lipid transport and regulatory lipid-dependent events. This protein, also known as hTAP3, is related to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SEC14 protein and plays a role in the cellular uptake, intracellular distribution, and secretion of various ligands, including phospholipids, squalene, and specific tocopherol analogues and derivatives (Kempna2009Alternative).

SEC14L4 interacts with phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI3K) and may modulate the PI3K/PKB signal transduction pathway, which is significant in cell proliferation and survival. This modulation has been observed in prostate tumors, where overexpression of a related protein, TAP1, increased tocopherol uptake and acted as a tumor suppressor by influencing PI3K/PKB activity (Kempna2009Alternative).

The protein shows selective binding capacity toward different natural tocopherols and tocotrienols, suggesting it confers specificity by mediating recognition and selective transport to enzymes, transcription factors, nuclear receptors, organelles such as mitochondria, or specific plasma domains. The functional implications of an alternatively spliced form of the SEC14L4 gene and a polymorphism in its coding sequence in healthy human cells are not yet fully understood (Kempna2009Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the SEC14L4 gene is not fully understood, but it has been implicated in several conditions. A genome-wide association study identified a significant nonsynonymous variant in SEC14L4 (Arg124Gly) associated with oxidative hemolysis, suggesting a role in protecting cells from oxidative damage (Page2021Multipleancestry). Although the specific function of SEC14L4 in neurodegeneration is unclear, mutations in SEC14 domain-containing proteins, including SEC14L4, may be linked to neurodegenerative processes (Barbu2020Expression).

In the context of cancer, SEC14L4 has been minimally investigated in relation to non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). It was found to have high expression levels in normal lung tissues, contrasting with other genes highly expressed in LUAD tissues (Zhang2023Indepth). This differential expression suggests a potential role in lung cancer pathology, although specific clinical implications remain to be elucidated.

Overall, while SEC14L4 is associated with oxidative hemolysis and potentially neurodegenerative and cancerous processes, further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance and the impact of its mutations or altered expression.
