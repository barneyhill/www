# B4GALT1

## Overview
The B4GALT1 gene encodes the enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (β4GalT1), a type II membrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the glycosylation process within the Golgi apparatus. This enzyme is responsible for transferring galactose to N-acetylglucosamine residues on glycoproteins and glycolipids, a critical step in the biosynthesis of complex glycoconjugates. These glycoconjugates are essential for various cellular functions, including cell-cell communication, protein stability, and immune responses (Roth1982Immunocytochemical; Hennet2002The). β4GalT1 is also involved in lactose synthesis in the mammary glands during lactation, in association with alpha-lactalbumin (Hennet2002The). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the elongation of O-fucose glycans, impacting Notch signaling pathways that are vital for cell differentiation and development (Hennet2002The). Mutations or altered expression of B4GALT1 can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation and have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders (Montasser2019Genetic; Staretz‐Chacham2020B4GALT1‐congenital).

## Structure
The B4GALT1 protein is a type II membrane protein involved in glycosylation, specifically transferring galactose to N-acetylglucosamine residues. Its molecular structure includes a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, an α-helical transmembrane domain, a stem domain, and a globular catalytic domain (Harrus2018The). The catalytic domain is responsible for the enzyme's activity and undergoes conformational changes upon substrate binding, involving key structural elements such as the Trp loop, the lid, and loop1 (Harrus2018The).

B4GALT1 forms homodimers, existing in a dynamic equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric states. The dimeric structure is characterized by a symmetrical pair of salt bridges and hydrophobic contacts, with a dimer interface area of 1106 Å² (Harrus2018The). The protein's quaternary structure is biologically relevant, as validated by mutagenesis and FRET assays (Harrus2018The).

Post-translational modifications of B4GALT1 include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its function and localization. The protein also has splice variant isoforms, which could result in different functional or localization properties (KhoderAgha2019Assembly). The interaction surfaces of B4GALT1 are crucial for its assembly with other proteins, such as ST6GAL1, in the Golgi membranes (KhoderAgha2019Assembly).

## Function
The B4GALT1 gene encodes the enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (β4GalT1), which plays a crucial role in glycosylation processes within human cells. This enzyme is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the transfer of galactose residues from UDP-galactose to terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues on glycoproteins and glycolipids (Roth1982Immunocytochemical; Hennet2002The). This activity is essential for the biosynthesis of complex glycoconjugates, which are important for various cellular functions, including cell-cell communication, protein stability, and immune responses (Staretz‐Chacham2020B4GALT1‐congenital).

In the mammary glands, β4GalT1, in association with alpha-lactalbumin, catalyzes the formation of lactose during lactation, highlighting its role in reproductive physiology (Hennet2002The). The enzyme's activity is also implicated in the elongation of O-fucose glycans on epidermal growth factor-like protein domains, which is important for Fringe-mediated modulation of Notch signaling, a pathway critical for cell differentiation and development (Hennet2002The). Deficiency in B4GALT1 can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, underscoring its importance in normal human physiology (Staretz‐Chacham2020B4GALT1‐congenital).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the B4GALT1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. A missense variant, p.Asn352Ser, in B4GALT1 is linked to lower plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and fibrinogen. This variant is rare in the general population but has a higher frequency in the Amish due to genetic drift. It affects glycosylation efficiency, impacting the folding and stability of glycoproteins related to lipid metabolism and coagulation (Montasser2019Genetic).

Homozygosity for a protein truncating mutation in B4GALT1 (1032insC) causes Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation type 2 (CDGII), characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, coagulopathy, and elevated transaminases (van2019Reduced; Montasser2019Genetic). In colorectal cancer, B4GALT1 hypermethylation is linked to downregulation of its expression, which correlates with advanced cancer stages and poor survival outcomes (Picardo2019Diagnostic).

In acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), high expression of B4GALT1 is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to immune cell infiltration and drug resistance. It promotes proliferation and suppresses apoptosis in LAML cells, suggesting its role in tumor progression (Ren2022High).

## Interactions
B4GALT1, a glycosyltransferase, is involved in various protein-protein interactions within the Golgi apparatus. It forms heteromeric complexes with ST6GAL1, another glycosyltransferase, through lateral interactions involving highly charged surface domains. This interaction is crucial for their catalytic activity and involves specific amino acids on B4GALT1 that form salt bridges with ST6GAL1. Mutations in these residues can disrupt the interaction, although B4GALT1 can still bind to itself (KhoderAgha2019Assembly). B4GALT1 also interacts with ST3GAL3, which competes with ST6GAL1 for binding, indicating distinct binding sites for different proteins (KhoderAgha2019Assembly).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma, B4GALT1 interacts with PD-L1, enhancing its stability through glycosylation. This interaction is confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown assays, and it plays a role in immune escape by regulating PD-L1 expression (Cui2023B4GALT1). B4GALT1 also interacts with TAZ, a transcription factor, promoting PD-L1 transcription and stability through N-glycan modifications (Cui2023B4GALT1).

B4GALT1 forms both homodimers and heterodimers with other Golgi enzymes, such as β-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I and α-2,6-sialyltransferase I, enhancing the efficiency of glycosylation reactions (Hassinen2010Golgi).
