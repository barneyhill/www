# DUSP3

## Overview
DUSP3, also known as dual specificity phosphatase 3 or Vaccinia H1-related phosphatase, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the dual-specificity phosphatase family. This protein is characterized by its ability to dephosphorylate both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues, distinguishing it from other phosphatases that typically target only one type of residue. DUSP3 plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is vital for processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Amand2014DUSP3VHR; Russo2018Revisiting). The protein is widely expressed in different tissues and is involved in essential physiological functions, such as angiogenesis and immune response modulation (Amand2014DUSP3VHR; Lang2019DualSpecificity). DUSP3's involvement in both the nucleus and cytoplasm underscores its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to external stimuli (Russo2018Revisiting). Its complex interactions and regulatory functions make it a significant focus of research, particularly in the context of cancer and other diseases where its expression and activity are altered (Russo2018Revisiting; Torres2017Loss).

## Structure
DUSP3, also known as Vaccinia H1-related phosphatase, is a dual-specificity phosphatase that dephosphorylates both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. The protein is approximately 21 kDa in size and consists of 185 amino acids (Amand2014DUSP3VHR; Russo2018Revisiting). It contains a catalytic domain typical of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, featuring a highly conserved HC(X)5R consensus sequence crucial for its phosphatase activity (Russo2018Revisiting). The crystal structure of DUSP3 reveals a catalytic site that is 6 Å deep, which is shallower than other classic PTPs, allowing it to accommodate a broader range of substrates (Russo2018Revisiting).

The secondary structure of DUSP3 includes a central beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices, a common feature in the PTP family (Jeong2014The). DUSP3 lacks an apparent targeting domain or docking site, which is atypical for many phosphatases (Amand2014DUSP3VHR). The protein functions as a monomer, indicating it does not have a quaternary structure (Russo2018Revisiting). DUSP3 is constitutively active and widely expressed in various tissues, localizing to both the nucleus and cytosol, which is important for its role in cellular processes (Russo2018Revisiting).

## Function
DUSP3, also known as Vaccinia H1-related phosphatase, is a dual-specificity phosphatase involved in several critical cellular processes. It dephosphorylates both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues, playing a significant role in regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Russo2018Revisiting). DUSP3 is highly expressed in endothelial cells and is essential for angiogenic sprouting, indicating its pro-angiogenic role in healthy human cells (Amand2014DUSP3VHR). It is involved in the regulation of the ERK and JNK pathways, although its depletion in endothelial cells does not affect the activation of these kinases, suggesting a specific role in other signaling pathways such as the PLCγ/PKC pathway (Amand2014DUSP3VHR).

In the immune system, DUSP3 acts as a non-redundant regulator of the innate immune response, particularly influencing macrophage polarization and cytokine production (Lang2019DualSpecificity). It is also involved in platelet activation and aggregation, playing a role in arterial thrombosis (Russo2018Revisiting). DUSP3's activity is observed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it modulates cellular responses to external stimuli and maintains cellular homeostasis (Russo2018Revisiting).

## Clinical Significance
DUSP3, also known as Vaccinia H1-related phosphatase, plays a significant role in various human diseases, particularly cancers. Alterations in DUSP3 expression have been linked to both tumor suppressive and oncogenic properties, which are cell type-dependent. In cervical and prostate cancers, DUSP3 is overexpressed, contributing to cancer progression by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation (Amand2014DUSP3VHR; Torres2017Loss). Conversely, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast cancer, DUSP3 is downregulated, which is associated with poor prognosis and enhanced cancer pathogenesis (Amand2014DUSP3VHR; Russo2018Revisiting).

DUSP3 is also involved in the regulation of DNA damage response and repair pathways. Its inhibition increases radiosensitivity in tumor cells by impairing DNA repair mechanisms, suggesting its potential as a target for enhancing radiotherapy effectiveness (Torres2017Loss). In lung cancer, DUSP3 deficiency affects epithelial tight junctions, contributing to cancer progression by disrupting cell-cell junction integrity (Chou2022DUSP3).

The dual role of DUSP3 in cancer, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter, highlights its complex involvement in disease progression and its potential as a therapeutic target (Russo2018Revisiting).

## Interactions
DUSP3, also known as dual specificity phosphatase 3, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with occludin (OCLN) and ZO-1, proteins crucial for maintaining epithelial tight junctions. Although direct binding was not observed, proximity ligation assays suggest that DUSP3, OCLN, and ZO-1 are in close proximity, forming a protein complex. DUSP3 dephosphorylates OCLN, which is essential for tight junction integrity (Chou2022DUSP3).

In the context of DNA damage and repair, DUSP3 interacts with components of the MRN complex and pH2AX, a DNA double-strand break sensor, indicating its role in DNA damage sensing and repair (Forti2014Combined). DUSP3 also co-localizes with phosphorylated MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38) after gamma radiation, suggesting these as potential targets (Forti2014Combined).

DUSP3 has a high affinity for nucleophosmin (NPM), dephosphorylating specific tyrosine residues, which impacts p53 signaling and genomic stability. This interaction is crucial for regulating DNA repair pathways and cellular responses to DNA damage (Russo2021Nucleophosmin). These interactions highlight DUSP3's role in maintaining cellular integrity and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
