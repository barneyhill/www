# FRMPD3

## Overview
FRMPD3 (FERM and PDZ domain containing 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular signaling and structural organization, primarily functioning as a scaffolding molecule. The protein, characterized by its FERM and PDZ domains, plays a critical role in the regulation of dendritic spine morphogenesis and synaptic plasticity by interacting with post-synaptic density protein (PSD)-95, which is essential for the maturation of glutamatergic synapses (Oh2024Integration). Additionally, FRMPD3 is implicated in the regulation of excitatory synaptic connections in somatostatin neurons, potentially influencing neurocognitive disorders (Oh2024Integration). Beyond its neurological functions, FRMPD3 is also involved in immune response and cellular organization, particularly in the context of aging (de2021Aging). The gene's expression and mutations have been studied in various clinical contexts, including reproductive traits in geese and immune response modulation in sarcomas, although its precise mechanisms and broader clinical significance remain areas of active research (Zhao2020GenomeWide; Li2022Subtyping).

## Structure


## Function
FRMPD3 (FERM and PDZ domain containing 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular signaling and structural organization. The protein contains FERM and PDZ domains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins and cellular components. In healthy human cells, FRMPD3 acts as a scaffolding molecule involved in the regulation of dendritic spine morphogenesis by associating with post-synaptic density protein (PSD)-95. This interaction is crucial for the maturation of glutamatergic synapses, indicating its role in stabilizing and modulating synaptic plasticity (Oh2024Integration).

FRMPD3 is also regulated by NPAS4, an inhibitory neuronal gene, suggesting that its activity promotes the development of excitatory synaptic connections in somatostatin neurons. This regulation may influence the correlation between long-term stress and symptoms of depression, highlighting its potential role in neurocognitive disorders (Oh2024Integration).

Additionally, FRMPD3 has been identified as a differentially expressed gene in aging, particularly in individuals aged 60-79 years, where it is involved in immune response, inflammation, and platelet activation. This suggests a role in immune system function and cellular organization (de2021Aging).

## Clinical Significance
FRMPD3 (FERM and PDZ domain containing 3) has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although its precise role in many conditions remains to be fully elucidated. In the context of egg production in lion head geese, FRMPD3 was identified as a candidate gene with significantly lower expression in high egg production populations compared to low production groups, suggesting a potential regulatory role in reproductive traits (Zhao2020GenomeWide). However, the specific mechanisms by which FRMPD3 influences egg production are not yet clear.

In sarcomas, FRMPD3 mutations have been associated with the Imm-C subtype, which is characterized by strong immune signatures. These mutations correlate with increased CD8+ T cell enrichment and immune cytolytic activity, indicating a possible involvement in immune response modulation (Li2022Subtyping).

In the context of ovarian cancer, FRMPD3 is identified as a target gene of miR-197-3p, although its expression did not significantly differ between patients responsive and resistant to platinum-based therapies, suggesting limited clinical significance in this specific context (Zhu2024CircNUP50).

Overall, while FRMPD3 is associated with various conditions, its clinical significance and the mechanisms by which it influences these conditions require further investigation.
