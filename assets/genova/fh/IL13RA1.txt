# IL13RA1

## Overview
The IL13RA1 gene encodes the interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha 1, a transmembrane protein that is part of the type I cytokine receptor family. This protein plays a crucial role in the immune system by forming part of the receptor complex for interleukin 13 (IL-13) and interleukin 4 (IL-4), which are key cytokines involved in immune response regulation. The IL13RA1 protein is integral to the type II interleukin 4 receptor complex, facilitating the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, particularly through STAT6, in various cell types including macrophages and fibroblasts. This signaling is essential for processes such as alternative macrophage activation and the modulation of inflammatory responses. The gene's polymorphisms have been studied in relation to diseases like asthma, COPD, and idiopathic Parkinson's disease, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions characterized by immune dysregulation (Sheikh2015The; Izuhara2007IL13; Beghé2010Polymorphisms).

## Structure
The IL13RA1 gene encodes the interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha 1, a protein that is part of the type I cytokine receptor family. The protein consists of 427 amino acids and includes a signal peptide, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Tabata2007IL13; Miloux1997Cloning). The extracellular domain features three fibronectin type III domains, with the second and third forming the cytokine receptor homology module (CRH) (Izuhara2007IL13). This domain contains critical residues for binding interleukin 13, such as Leu319 and Tyr321 (Izuhara2007IL13).

The protein's extracellular region also includes a WSXWS motif, essential for proper receptor positioning and ligand binding (Izuhara2007IL13; Miloux1997Cloning). The cytoplasmic domain contains a proline-rich Box1 motif, which is necessary for binding and activation of Janus kinases, and a tyrosine residue that binds to STAT3, facilitating signal transduction (Izuhara2007IL13; Osawa2000Characterization).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, with 11 potential N-linked glycosylation sites identified in the extracellular domain (Aman1996cDNA). Alternative splicing can produce soluble isoforms of IL-13Rα1, which lack the transmembrane domain (Osawa2000Characterization).

## Function
The IL13RA1 gene encodes the interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha 1, which is a critical component of the type II interleukin 4 receptor (IL-4R) complex. This receptor complex is involved in mediating the effects of interleukin 13 (IL-13) and interleukin 4 (IL-4), two cytokines that play significant roles in immune response regulation. IL13RA1 is essential for IL-13 signaling, particularly in macrophages and fibroblasts, where it facilitates the activation of the transcription factor STAT6. This activation leads to the expression of STAT6-responsive genes, which are involved in the alternative macrophage activation pathway (Sheikh2015The).

In fibroblasts, IL13RA1 is necessary for both IL-4 and IL-13 to activate STAT6, highlighting its importance in nonhematopoietic cells that do not express the common gamma chain (γc) (Sheikh2015The). The receptor is also involved in modulating inflammatory responses and is crucial for processes such as membrane fusion and the formation of multinucleated giant cells in macrophages (Sheikh2015The). IL13RA1's role in immune responses extends to influencing allergic reactions and fibrosis, as it is involved in the development of allergic airway disease and fibrotic outcomes in certain parasitic infections (Ramalingam2007Unique).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the IL13RA1 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly those involving immune system dysregulation. In asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL13RA1, such as rs2250747, have shown a sex-specific association with disease risk. This SNP is linked to an increased risk of COPD in females, with an odds ratio of 10.5, but not in males (Beghé2010Polymorphisms). The IL13RA1 gene is also implicated in asthma, with studies investigating its polymorphisms, such as -281T.G and 1365A.G, although no significant associations with asthma susceptibility were found in some analyses (Konstantinidis2007Genetic).

In idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), the IL13RA1 SNP rs145868092 results in a leucine to phenylalanine substitution, which, although not statistically significant in association with PD, has been studied for its potential impact on IL-13 binding. This mutation may increase cellular susceptibility to oxidative stress, suggesting a possible role in PD pathogenesis (Aguirre2020Two). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of IL13RA1 in various diseases, particularly those involving inflammatory and immune responses.

## Interactions
The IL13RA1 protein is a component of the interleukin-13 receptor complex, which interacts with interleukin-13 (IL-13) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) to mediate immune responses. IL13RA1 forms a receptor complex with the IL-4 receptor alpha chain (IL-4Rα), creating a high-affinity binding site for IL-13. This complex is crucial for activating the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, involving proteins such as TYK2, JAK1, STAT3, and STAT6, with STAT6 being particularly important for IL-13 and IL-4 signaling (Izuhara2007IL13).

IL13RA1 also interacts with microRNA-155 (miR-155), which targets the 3' untranslated region of IL13RA1 mRNA, leading to a reduction in IL13RA1 protein levels. This interaction affects the IL-13-dependent phosphorylation of STAT6, thereby modulating the immune response and influencing macrophage activation states (MartinezNunez2011The).

In the context of allergic rhinitis, IL13RA1 expression is upregulated in nasal epithelial cells, correlating with the disruption of tight junctions and the downregulation of tight junction proteins. This suggests that IL13RA1 plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the nasal epithelial barrier through its interactions with IL-4 and IL-13 (Nur2022IL4IL13).
