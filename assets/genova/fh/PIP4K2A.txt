# PIP4K2A

## Overview
PIP4K2A is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase type 2 alpha, a member of the kinase family involved in phosphoinositide metabolism. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes by catalyzing the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate to produce phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, a critical lipid signaling molecule (Raghu2021Emerging). PIP4K2A is implicated in various cellular functions, including membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and autophagy regulation, and is active in multiple cellular compartments such as the plasma membrane and endosomal systems (Lundquist2018Phosphatidylinositol5Phosphate). The protein's interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids suggest additional roles in translation regulation and cellular signaling pathways (Behari2021Conserved). Clinically, alterations in PIP4K2A expression have been linked to several cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and glioblastoma, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker (Zhang2019Regulatory; Shin2019PIP4K2A).

## Structure
The PIP4K2A protein, also known as phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase type 2 alpha, is involved in phosphoinositide metabolism, specifically phosphorylating phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate to generate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. The primary structure of PIP4K2A consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a kinase domain crucial for its enzymatic activity (Ibrahim2023Modelling). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the formation of the kinase domain (Ibrahim2023Modelling).

In terms of tertiary structure, PIP4K2A forms a kinase domain that is essential for its function. This domain is involved in binding ATP and the substrate, phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate, facilitating the phosphorylation process (Ibrahim2023Modelling). The protein can form homodimers or heterodimers with other isoforms, indicating a quaternary structure that allows for diverse functional interactions (Shin2019PIP4K2A).

Post-translational modifications of PIP4K2A may include phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions with other proteins (Behari2021Conserved). The protein's ability to bind RNA is independent of its kinase activity, suggesting additional functional roles beyond its enzymatic activity (Behari2021Conserved).

## Function
PIP4K2A is a crucial enzyme involved in phosphoinositide metabolism, specifically catalyzing the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PI5P) to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). This enzymatic activity is essential for various cellular processes, including signaling, membrane trafficking, and cytoskeletal dynamics (Raghu2021Emerging). PIP4K2A is active in multiple cellular compartments, such as the plasma membrane, endosomal systems, and autophagosomes, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological processes (Raghu2021Emerging).

In healthy human cells, PIP4K2A plays a significant role in regulating autophagy and cellular lipid metabolism. It facilitates the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, a process necessary for cellular recycling and maintaining metabolic balance, particularly during nutrient stress (Lundquist2018Phosphatidylinositol5Phosphate). The enzyme also influences insulin signaling through a catalytic-independent mechanism, affecting the synthesis of PI(4,5)P2 and the PI3K pathway (Wang2018PIP4Ks).

PIP4K2A's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, as its loss can lead to metabolic imbalances and impaired autophagy, which are associated with increased autophagic vesicles and lysosomal accumulation (Lundquist2018Phosphatidylinositol5Phosphate). These functions highlight PIP4K2A's importance in cellular metabolism and stress response.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PIP4K2A gene have been implicated in various cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and glioblastoma (GBM). In ALL, germline variants of PIP4K2A are associated with increased susceptibility due to overexpression, which correlates with poorer survival outcomes (Zhang2019Regulatory). In AML, high PIP4K2A expression is linked to poor survival, chemotherapy resistance, and a higher frequency of DNMT3A mutations, which are associated with a worse prognosis (Lima2019PIP4K2A; Jude2014A). Knockdown of PIP4K2A in AML cells results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Jude2014A).

In glioblastoma, particularly in PTEN-deficient tumors, PIP4K2A acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is inversely correlated with tumor growth, and higher levels are associated with better survival outcomes (Shin2019PIP4K2A). The gene's role in regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is crucial, as it affects the stability of key proteins involved in tumor progression (Shin2019PIP4K2A). These findings suggest that PIP4K2A expression levels could serve as prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in various cancers.

## Interactions
PIP4K2A is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It binds specifically to the 3′UTR of Plasmodium Rad51 transcripts, with a dissociation constant of approximately 750 nM. This interaction is facilitated by a 35-base sequence predicted to form a stem-loop structure, which is crucial for binding (Behari2021Conserved). PIP4K2A also interacts with eIF4EBP1, a translational repressor, as confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. This interaction suggests a role in translation regulation (Behari2021Conserved).

In the context of glioblastoma, PIP4K2A acts as a negative regulator of the PI3K signaling pathway by mediating the degradation of the p85/p110 PI3K complex. It directly binds to the p85 subunit, particularly in PTEN-deficient glioblastoma, and this interaction is disrupted when PTEN is expressed (Shin2019PIP4K2A). PIP4K2A's interaction with the p85 subunit is part of a mechanism that leads to the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of the PI3K complex, thereby inhibiting tumor growth (Shin2019PIP4K2A). These interactions highlight PIP4K2A's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and regulation.
