# KAT2B

## Overview
KAT2B, or lysine acetyltransferase 2B, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as an acetyltransferase enzyme. This enzyme is primarily involved in the acetylation of lysine residues on histone proteins, a critical process for the regulation of gene expression and chromatin remodeling (Bai2016Dysregulated). As a member of the acetyltransferase family, KAT2B plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation by modifying chromatin structure, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis (Sheikh2018The). The KAT2B protein is active in the nucleus and is a component of large protein complexes like ATAC and SAGA, which are essential for chromatin modification and transcription regulation (BondyChorney2019Nonhistone). Additionally, KAT2B acetylates non-histone proteins, impacting DNA replication, repair, and protein transport, and is involved in immune regulation by modulating cytokine expression (Bai2016Dysregulated; BondyChorney2019Nonhistone). The gene's expression and function are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis, with alterations in KAT2B linked to various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and certain cancers (Bai2016Dysregulated; BondyChorney2019Nonhistone).

## Function
KAT2B, also known as lysine acetyltransferase 2B, is a crucial enzyme involved in the acetylation of lysine residues on histone proteins, which is essential for the regulation of gene expression. In healthy human cells, KAT2B maintains the acetylation status of histones, particularly at sites such as H4K5, facilitating the activation of downstream target genes (Bai2016Dysregulated). This acetylation process is vital for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, impacting various cellular functions including cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis (Sheikh2018The).

KAT2B is active in the nucleus, where it is incorporated into large protein complexes such as ATAC and SAGA, which are involved in chromatin modification and transcription regulation (BondyChorney2019Nonhistone). Beyond histones, KAT2B also acetylates non-histone proteins, influencing processes like DNA replication, repair, and protein transport (BondyChorney2019Nonhistone). It plays a role in immune regulation by modulating the expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine, through histone acetylation, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis in the intestine (Bai2016Dysregulated). KAT2B's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis by regulating mitosis and inflammation (BondyChorney2019Nonhistone).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KAT2B gene have been implicated in various diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is associated with the down-regulation of KAT2B. This down-regulation leads to decreased acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 5, resulting in the transcriptional repression of interleukin-10 (IL-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. The reduced expression of KAT2B in inflamed colonic tissues correlates with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to the pathogenesis of IBD (Bai2016Dysregulated).

A homozygous variant in KAT2B has been linked to cardiomyopathy and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) in a family study. This variant affects a conserved amino acid within the PCAF homology domain, crucial for interaction with CBP/p300, and results in reduced KAT2B protein levels in patient fibroblasts. The variant may exacerbate phenotypes associated with ADD3 deficiency, such as intellectual disability and microcephaly (Gonçalves2018A).

KAT2B expression is also altered in various cancers. It is downregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, intestinal type gastric cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, with its misregulation potentially contributing to therapeutic resistance and decreased survival in liver cancer patients (BondyChorney2019Nonhistone).

## Interactions
KAT2B, also known as lysine acetyltransferase 2B, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. KAT2B physically interacts with the transcription factor TBX5, acetylating it at lysine 339. This acetylation enhances TBX5's transcriptional activity and is crucial for its nuclear retention, impacting heart and limb development (Ghosh2018Acetylation). The interaction between KAT2B and TBX5 is confirmed through pull-down experiments, demonstrating a direct physical association (Ghosh2018Acetylation).

In the context of breast cancer, KAT2B interacts with the transcription factors NELF-E and SLUG, forming a regulatory axis that promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stemness. KAT2B is enriched at SLUG binding sites when co-bound by NELF-E, indicating a synergistic relationship in gene activation (Zhang2023Dependency). KAT2B also forms an activating complex with ZEB1 to stimulate the transcription of EMT targets via histone acetylations (Zhang2023Dependency).

KAT2B, along with its paralogue KAT2A, interacts with PLK4, a kinase involved in centrosome duplication. KAT2B acetylates PLK4, stabilizing its inactive conformation and inhibiting its kinase activity, which is crucial for preventing centrosome amplification (Fournier2016KAT2AKAT2Btargeted).
