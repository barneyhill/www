# FERD3L

## Overview
FERD3L is a gene that encodes the Fer3 like bHLH transcription factor, a protein involved in the regulation of gene expression. This transcription factor belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family, which is known for its role in various cellular processes, including differentiation and development. The FERD3L gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as triple-negative breast cancer and intellectual disabilities, due to its regulatory functions. Alterations in the methylation levels of FERD3L have been associated with chemotherapy response in cancer, while deletions of the gene have been linked to developmental disorders, including Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (Pineda2019A; Zechi‐Ceide2012Saethre–Chotzen). Despite its involvement in these conditions, the role of FERD3L in other diseases, such as intracranial aneurysms, appears to be limited (Lansdell2019Rs10230207).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The FERD3L gene, also known as N-TWIST, has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in transcription regulation. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), alterations in FERD3L methylation levels have been associated with chemotherapy response. Higher methylation levels of FERD3L correlate with lower gene expression and are linked to a better response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting its potential as a predictive biomarker for treatment outcomes in TNBC patients (Pineda2019A).

In the context of developmental disorders, FERD3L deletions have been associated with intellectual disability. A case study of a patient with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, who had a microdeletion encompassing the FERD3L gene, supports the hypothesis that FERD3L may be a candidate gene for intellectual disability. This patient exhibited significant learning difficulties, suggesting a potential link between FERD3L deletions and cognitive impairments (Zechi‐Ceide2012Saethre–Chotzen).

While FERD3L has been studied in the context of intracranial aneurysms, no significant changes in its expression were observed in patients compared to controls, indicating that its role in this condition may be limited (Lansdell2019Rs10230207).
