# ZNF519

## Overview
ZNF519 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 519, a member of the krueppel zinc-finger family characterized by C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains are crucial for the protein's ability to bind DNA, thereby playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 519 is involved in various biological processes, including the maintenance of pluripotency in human pluripotent stem cells and the regulation of gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. It functions as part of a complex with TRIM28 and other KRAB-ZNF proteins, influencing histone modifications and DNA methylation. The protein is also implicated in the progression of gastric cancer through its interaction with the Noxa protein, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Additionally, ZNF519 is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and male fertility issues, underscoring its diverse roles in human health and disease (Shi2024Noxa; Akella2019Bioinformatics; Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28).

## Structure
ZNF519 is a zinc finger protein that belongs to the krueppel zinc-finger family, characterized by C2H2-type zinc finger domains which facilitate DNA binding (Akella2019Bioinformatics). These domains are typically rich in cysteine and histidine residues, contributing to the protein's primary structure. The secondary structure of zinc finger proteins often includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are stabilized by the coordination of zinc ions with the cysteine and histidine residues. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a compact, stable configuration, allowing for specific interactions with DNA.

Post-translational modifications of ZNF519 may include phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which can affect the protein's stability, localization, and interaction with other molecules. Splice variants of ZNF519 may exist, leading to different isoforms with potentially distinct functions, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the available context.

ZNF519 is localized to the nucleoli and is involved in altering gene expression through DNA methylation, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation (Akella2019Bioinformatics). The protein's function in metal ion binding and regulation of transcription is highlighted in studies of embryonic development and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (Pohjolainen2021Transcriptomics; Dessie2007Dielectrophoretic).

## Function
ZNF519 is a zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in maintaining the pluripotency and self-renewal of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). It is involved in the epigenetic repression of pro-differentiation genes, which is crucial for preserving the undifferentiated state of stem cells. During the reprogramming of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), ZNF519 is upregulated, suggesting its importance in the dedifferentiation process (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28). The protein functions as part of a complex with TRIM28 and other KRAB-ZNF proteins, which modulate histone modifications and DNA methylation to suppress gene expression (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28).

In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), knockdown experiments have shown that reduced expression of ZNF519 leads to the loss of pluripotency markers and induces differentiation, indicating its critical role in maintaining the pluripotent state (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28). ZNF519 is active in the nucleus, where it likely influences the transcriptional activity of target genes, impacting cellular differentiation and development. Its function in healthy human cells is primarily associated with the regulation of gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms, contributing to the maintenance of stem cell characteristics.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF519 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in transcriptional regulation. In neurodevelopmental disorders, ZNF519 is highly expressed in the brain and has been associated with microcephaly and lissencephaly. These conditions are characterized by abnormal brain development, with lissencephaly involving a smooth brain cortex due to improper neuronal migration. Studies have shown that ZNF519 is downregulated in mouse models with knockouts of genes known to cause lissencephaly in humans, suggesting that alterations in ZNF519 expression may contribute to these disorders (AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

In cancer, ZNF519 plays a role in gastric cancer through its interaction with the Noxa gene. Noxa overexpression leads to increased ZNF519 levels, which inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells. Conversely, downregulation of ZNF519 restores these cancerous properties, indicating its involvement in the oncogenic process. The regulatory axis involving hsa-miR-200b-3p, Noxa, and ZNF519 is significant in gastric cancer progression, highlighting ZNF519 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Shi2024Noxa).

ZNF519 has also been identified as upregulated in non-obstructive azoospermia, a condition affecting male fertility, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of genes associated with this condition (Karoii2024Whole).

## Interactions
ZNF519, a zinc finger protein, is involved in interactions that influence gastric cancer progression. It is regulated by Noxa, a protein that inhibits oncogenesis in gastric cancer by modulating ZNF519 expression. Overexpression of Noxa leads to an increase in ZNF519 levels, suggesting a regulatory interaction where Noxa positively influences ZNF519 expression (Shi2024Noxa). This interaction is part of a broader regulatory axis involving miR-200b-3p, which negatively regulates Noxa. The miR-200b-3p/Noxa axis affects ZNF519 abundance, indicating that ZNF519 is a downstream target in this pathway (Shi2024Noxa).

The study highlights that the depletion of ZNF519 reverses the oncogenic attributes induced by Noxa, suggesting a significant interaction between these two proteins in the Mitophagy-animal pathway (Shi2024Noxa). This interaction is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of gastric cancer and offers potential therapeutic targets. The miR-200b-3p-Noxa-ZNF519 axis is implicated in regulating gastric cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and tumorigenesis, underscoring the importance of these interactions in cancer biology (Shi2024Noxa).
