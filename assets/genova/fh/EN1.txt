# EN1

## Overview
EN1 (engrailed homeobox 1) is a gene that encodes a homeobox-containing transcription factor, which plays a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. These neurons are crucial for dopamine production and are involved in various neurological functions and disorders, including Parkinson's disease. The EN1 protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to regulate the transcription of target genes, thereby influencing neuronal identity, axonal outgrowth, and pathfinding (Simon2001Fate; Alves2011En1). EN1 is also involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, acting as a downstream target of Wnt1 and influencing the expression of midbrain-specific genes (Kim2018Wnt; Alves2011En1). Beyond its developmental roles, EN1's deregulation in adulthood can lead to progressive dopaminergic cell death, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (Alves2011En1). Additionally, EN1 is implicated in cancer biology, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, where it interacts with various transcriptional cofactors and modulates key signaling pathways (Peluffo2019EN1).

## Function
EN1 (engrailed homeobox 1) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons, which are essential for dopamine production and are implicated in various neurological functions and disorders. EN1 is highly expressed in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, regions crucial for the survival of these neurons (Simon2001Fate). It functions as a transcription factor and signaling molecule, influencing processes such as neuronal identity specification, axonal outgrowth, and pathfinding (Alves2011En1).

EN1 is involved in the regulation of α-synuclein, a protein associated with Parkinson's disease, and its expression is crucial for the survival of mdDA neurons (Simon2001Fate). The gene is also implicated in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it acts as a downstream target of Wnt1, influencing the expression of midbrain-specific genes (Kim2018Wnt; Alves2011En1). EN1's role extends into adulthood, where its deregulation can lead to progressive dopaminergic cell death, a characteristic of Parkinson's disease (Alves2011En1). EN1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to regulate the transcription of target genes, contributing to the proper development and function of the central nervous system.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the EN1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), EN1 is crucial for the survival of mesencephalic dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. Mice heterozygous for EN1 exhibit progressive loss of these neurons, mirroring the neurodegeneration seen in PD. This loss is associated with motor deficits and increased sensitivity to neurotoxins, suggesting that EN1 mutations may contribute to PD pathology (Sonnier2007Progressive; Alves2011En1; Rekaik2015Engrailed).

EN1 is also linked to cancer, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). In TNBC, high EN1 expression correlates with poor prognosis and increased risk of brain metastases. EN1 influences pathways such as WNT signaling, which are crucial for cancer progression, making it a potential therapeutic target (Peluffo2019EN1). In ACC, EN1 is hypermethylated, correlating with tumor grade and patient outcomes, suggesting its role as a biomarker for poor prognosis (Bell2011Developmental). EN1's involvement in these conditions highlights its significance in both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.

## Interactions
EN1 (engrailed homeobox 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, EN1 interacts with transcriptional cofactors such as TLE3 and TRIM28, as well as nuclear hormone receptor coactivators like TRIM33 and TRIM24. These interactions are crucial for chromatin modification, androgen receptor signaling, and DNA damage response pathways (Peluffo2019EN1). EN1's interaction with TLE3 is particularly significant, as it may suppress gene expression by preventing TLE3 binding (Peluffo2019EN1).

EN1 also plays a role in the WNT signaling pathway. It negatively regulates β-catenin transcriptional activity by destabilizing β-catenin through a glycogen synthase kinase-3β-independent pathway. This regulation involves decreasing β-catenin levels and its transcriptional activity, as demonstrated in studies using β-catenin mutants resistant to degradation (BacharDahan2006Engrailed1). EN1's interaction with β-catenin affects its association with TCF/β-catenin complexes, reducing their binding to target promoters (BacharDahan2006Engrailed1).

These interactions highlight EN1's role in modulating key signaling pathways and transcriptional networks, impacting processes such as cell differentiation and cancer progression.
