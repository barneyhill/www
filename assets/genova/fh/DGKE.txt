# DGKE

## Overview
The DGKE gene encodes the enzyme diacylglycerol kinase epsilon (DGKε), which is a member of the kinase family involved in lipid metabolism. DGKε plays a pivotal role in the conversion of diacylglycerol (DAG) to phosphatidic acid (PA), a critical step in the phosphatidylinositol cycle that influences various cellular processes, including signal transduction and membrane dynamics (So2019Phosphatidylinositol). This enzyme is particularly noted for its specificity towards DAG species containing stearoyl and arachidonoyl moieties (So2019Phosphatidylinositol). DGKε is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells and glomerular podocytes, where it contributes to vascular homeostasis and thrombosis regulation (Epand2016Diacylglycerol). Mutations in the DGKE gene are linked to rare renal disorders such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Yoshida2019Pathogenesis; Dai2023Clinical).

## Function
The DGKE gene encodes diacylglycerol kinase epsilon, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by phosphorylating diacylglycerol (DAG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA) (So2019Phosphatidylinositol). This process is integral to the phosphatidylinositol cycle, which is essential for synthesizing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P₂) (So2019Phosphatidylinositol). DGKE is unique among diacylglycerol kinases due to its specificity for DAG species containing stearoyl and arachidonoyl moieties, such as 38:4-DAG, which it converts into 38:4-PA (So2019Phosphatidylinositol).

In healthy human cells, DGKE is highly expressed in endothelial cells and glomerular podocytes, where it is involved in regulating thrombosis and maintaining vascular function (So2019Phosphatidylinositol; Epand2016Diacylglycerol). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining the balance of DAG and PA, which affects the levels of PtdIns(4,5)P₂, a lipid central to signal transduction, membrane transport, and actin cytoskeleton remodeling (So2019Phosphatidylinositol). DGKE's function is particularly important in endothelial cells, where it helps prevent thrombotic microangiopathy by maintaining normal endothelial cell function (So2019Phosphatidylinositol).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DGKE gene are associated with several rare kidney-related disorders, primarily atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and nephrotic syndrome, particularly steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). aHUS is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal impairment, often presenting in infancy or early childhood. Patients with DGKE mutations typically experience multiple relapsing episodes of aHUS and persistent proteinuria (Yoshida2019Pathogenesis; Dai2023Clinical). 

DGKE mutations lead to a prothrombotic state due to the loss of enzyme activity, resulting in endothelial cell apoptosis and impaired angiogenic response, which contributes to thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) (Palma2022Thrombotic). These mutations are recessive and can manifest as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, and hemolytic uremic syndrome (Palma2022Thrombotic). 

The effectiveness of eculizumab, a treatment for aHUS, is inconsistent in patients with DGKE mutations, as these cases are not primarily complement-mediated (Yoshida2019Pathogenesis; Alabdulqader2021A). However, some patients have shown improvement with eculizumab or plasma infusions, although long-term outcomes remain similar with or without specific aHUS therapy (Alabdulqader2021A).

## Interactions
Diacylglycerol kinase epsilon (DGKε) is involved in several protein interactions, although many of these interactions lack independent experimental confirmation. Studies using HEK293T cells have identified proteins such as CDCA1, NUDC, NUF2, PAICS, PDHA1, and SET as interacting with DGKε through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, though their relevance to DGK biology remains unclear (Epand2016Diacylglycerol). DGKε has also been associated with arrestinβ1 (ARRB1) and arrestinβ2 (ARRB2), which are negative regulators of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This interaction is considered promising due to DGKε's role in the signaling pathway of phospholipase C (PLC) activated by GPCRs (Epand2016Diacylglycerol).

In liver cell extracts, DGKε was found to interact with MRPL44, a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, although this interaction is considered weak evidence (Epand2016Diacylglycerol). Post-translational modifications of DGKε, such as ubiquitination at lysine 357, have been observed, suggesting potential regulatory interactions, although specific interacting partners have not been detailed (Epand2016Diacylglycerol). These interactions highlight DGKε's potential involvement in complex signaling networks, although further studies are needed to confirm and elucidate these interactions.
