# OR11G2

## Overview
OR11G2 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 11 subfamily G member 2, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, a hallmark of GPCRs, which facilitates its role in detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways essential for the perception of smell (Sankaran2011Olfactory). The protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to olfactory sensation (Concas2021The). OR11G2 has been studied for its potential role in predicting preeclampsia, with its expression levels being part of a combination of olfactory receptors that have shown high prediction capability for early preeclampsia (Hirata2023Exploring). The gene's high sequence similarity with the mouse olfactory receptor OR744 suggests conserved functions across species, particularly in detecting specific alcohols (Sankaran2011Olfactory).

## Structure
The human gene OR11G2 encodes an olfactory receptor that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structural feature is crucial for its role in detecting odor molecules (Sankaran2011Olfactory). The primary amino acid sequence of OR11G2 shows a high degree of similarity to the mouse olfactory receptor OR744, with 81% identity and 92% positives, indicating a conserved structure across species (Sankaran2011Olfactory).

The secondary structure of OR11G2 is predicted to include transmembrane helical domains, similar to those found in other GPCRs, which facilitate its function in signal transduction (Sankaran2011Olfactory). The tertiary structure of OR11G2 has been modeled using bovine rhodopsin as a template, revealing seven transmembrane helical domains, a common feature among olfactory receptors (Sankaran2011Olfactory).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are typical for GPCRs, potentially affecting the activity and stability of OR11G2, although specific modifications for this receptor are not detailed in the available data. There is no information on quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms for OR11G2 in the provided context.

## Function
OR11G2 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR11G2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to olfactory sensation (Concas2021The).

The function of OR11G2 in healthy human cells includes its involvement in odor discrimination. Variants in this gene can impact the binding of odorant molecules or the structural integrity of the receptor, potentially affecting its function in smell perception (Concas2021The). Additionally, OR11G2 has been studied for its potential role in predicting preeclampsia, with its expression levels being part of a combination of olfactory receptors that have shown high prediction capability for early preeclampsia (Hirata2023Exploring).

OR11G2 shares a high sequence similarity with the mouse olfactory receptor OR744, suggesting that it may have similar ligand affinities and functions, particularly in detecting specific alcohols (Sankaran2011Olfactory). This highlights its potential involvement in detecting a range of odorant molecules.

## Clinical Significance
The gene OR11G2 has been studied for its potential clinical significance in conditions such as preeclampsia and mild gestational hypothyroidism. Research has shown that OR11G2 is among the olfactory receptor genes that exhibit differential expression in these conditions, suggesting a possible role in their pathophysiology. Specifically, OR11G2 was identified as a shared gene between the transcriptomes of gestational hypothyroidism and preeclampsia, indicating its involvement in these pregnancy-related disorders (Hirata2023Exploring).

In the context of preeclampsia, OR11G2 expression was analyzed to predict the onset of the condition, with findings suggesting that alterations in its expression could be linked to an increased or decreased risk of developing preeclampsia (Hirata2023Exploring). The study also reported a loss of OR11G2 expression with a sensitivity of 0.67 and specificity of 0.83, highlighting its potential as a clinical predictive parameter for preeclampsia (Hirata2023Exploring).

While the role of OR11G2 in odor discrimination has been explored, no specific diseases or conditions related to its mutations or expression alterations have been documented in this context (Concas2021The). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of OR11G2 expression changes.
