# NKX2-6

## Overview
NKX2-6 is a gene that encodes the NK2 homeobox 6 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the NK-2 class of homeodomain-containing proteins. This protein plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular development, particularly in the formation and septation of the cardiac outflow tract during embryogenesis. The NK2 homeobox 6 protein is characterized by a conserved homeodomain that facilitates DNA binding, nuclear translocation, and interaction with other transcription factors, thereby regulating gene expression in early embryonic heart progenitor cells (Wang2014A; WANG2014NKX26). Mutations in the NKX2-6 gene have been associated with various congenital heart defects, including common arterial trunk and ventricular septal defects, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiac development (Heathcote2005Common; Wang2014A).

## Structure
The NKX2-6 gene encodes a protein that is crucial for cardiovascular development and is part of the NK-2 class of homeodomain-containing proteins. The NKX2-6 protein consists of 301 amino acids and includes an evolutionarily conserved homeodomain located at amino acid positions 132-191. This homeodomain is responsible for recognizing and binding to a consensus DNA motif, AAGTG, and is involved in target DNA binding, nuclear translocation, and interaction with other transcription factors (Wang2014A; WANG2014NKX26). The protein is a vertebrate homolog of the Drosophila homeobox-containing protein 'tinman' and is expressed in early embryonic heart progenitor cells (WANG2014NKX26).

The NKX2-6 protein structure includes domains such as the tinman domain, homeodomain, and nucleotide kinase domain, as indicated in schematic diagrams (WANG2014NKX26). The homeodomain is a key structural feature, facilitating the protein's role in gene regulation. Specific mutations within this domain, such as p.Q175H and F151L, have been associated with familial atrial fibrillation and common arterial trunk, respectively, indicating the functional importance of this region (Heathcote2005Common; WANG2014NKX26). The protein's structure and function may be influenced by post-translational modifications, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

## Function
The NKX2-6 gene encodes a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that plays a crucial role in cardiovascular development. It is part of the NK-2 class of transcription factors, which are vertebrate orthologs of the Drosophila tinman gene. NKX2-6 is expressed in early embryonic heart progenitor cells and is involved in the regulation of gene expression during embryogenesis (Zhao2014Prevalence; Wang2014A). The protein contains a conserved homeodomain that binds to a consensus DNA motif, AAGTG, facilitating DNA binding, nuclear translocation, and interaction with other transcription factors (Wang2014A).

In healthy human cells, NKX2-6 is implicated in proper heart development, particularly in the formation of the cardiac outflow tract (OFT) and septation processes (Heathcote2005Common). It is expressed in the caudal pharyngeal arches and at opposite poles of the developing heart, with notable expression in the OFT at embryonic day 9.5 (Heathcote2005Common). Although NKX2-6-null mouse embryos do not exhibit obvious heart abnormalities, this is likely due to functional compensation by NKX2-5, another member of the NK family, which shares overlapping functions with NKX2-6 (Heathcote2005Common; Wang2014A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NKX2-6 gene are associated with several congenital heart defects (CHDs). One notable mutation, F151L, has been linked to common arterial trunk (CAT) and persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA) in humans. This mutation affects the transcriptional activity of NKX2-6, which is crucial for heart development, particularly in the cardiac outflow tract (Heathcote2005Common). The F151L mutation is pathogenic and not a rare polymorphism, as it was identified in a consanguineous family with multiple cases of CAT (Heathcote2005Common).

NKX2-6 mutations have also been implicated in truncus arteriosus (TA), a rare CHD. Studies have identified compound heterozygous variants in NKX2-6 in siblings with TA, suggesting that biallelic loss of function may be a rare genetic cause of this condition (Ritter2020NKX2‐6). Additionally, NKX2-6 mutations have been linked to ventricular septal defects (VSD) and familial atrial fibrillation (AF). The p.K152Q mutation is associated with VSD, while the p.Q175H mutation has been linked to AF, both demonstrating reduced transcriptional activity and suggesting a genetic basis for these conditions (Wang2014A; WANG2014NKX26).
