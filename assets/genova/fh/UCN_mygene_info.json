The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature peptide, an endogenous ligand for both corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2. In the brain this peptide may be responsible for the effects of stress on appetite. This peptide may also play a role in mood disorders, neurodegeneration, and skeletal system disorders. In spite of the gene family name similarity, the product of this gene has no sequence similarity to urotensin-2.
