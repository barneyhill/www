# BLTP3B

## Overview
BLTP3B is a gene that encodes the protein bridge-like lipid transfer protein family member 3B, commonly referred to as SHIP164. This protein is categorized as a lipid transporter and plays a significant role in the biogenesis of early endosome (EE) buds at Golgi-endosome contacts. SHIP164 is integral to a protein complex that includes RhoBTB3 and Vps26B, which is essential for the expansion of membranes necessary for EE bud formation. These buds are specialized structures that manage the segregation and recycling of cargo destined for the plasma membrane or Golgi. The protein's function as a bridge lipid transporter is crucial for transferring lipids from the Golgi to EEs, thereby maintaining EE structure and function. The absence of SHIP164 leads to fewer and enlarged EEs, underscoring its importance in cellular processes (Wang2022A).

## Function
The human gene BLTP3B, also known as SHIP164, plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of early endosome (EE) buds at Golgi-endosome contacts. It is part of a protein complex that includes RhoBTB3 and Vps26B, which facilitates the expansion of membranes necessary for the formation of EE buds. These buds are specialized membrane structures that segregate recycled cargo destined for the plasma membrane or Golgi. SHIP164 functions as a bridge lipid transporter, facilitating lipid transfer from the Golgi to EEs, which is essential for EE bud biogenesis. The depletion of SHIP164 results in fewer and enlarged EEs, indicating its role in maintaining EE structure and function (Wang2022A).

SHIP164 is recruited to Golgi-EE contacts by adaptors such as RhoBTB3 and Vps26B, which are located on the Golgi apparatus and early endosomes, respectively. It interacts with enzymes involved in phospholipid synthesis on motile Golgi vesicles, suggesting it plays a role in lipid transport and synthesis. This lipid transport is crucial for the trafficking of sphingomyelin to the plasma membrane, which is important for cell growth (Wang2022A).
