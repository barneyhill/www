# WFDC11

## Overview
The WFDC11 gene encodes the WAP four-disulfide core domain 11 protein, which is a member of the Whey Acidic Protein (WAP) family. This family is characterized by the presence of a conserved WAP domain, which typically contains eight cysteine residues forming four disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The WFDC11 protein is involved in various biological processes, including immune response and protease inhibition, due to its structural properties. It is predominantly expressed in specific tissues, suggesting a specialized role in physiological and possibly pathological contexts. The precise mechanisms and pathways involving WFDC11 remain an active area of research, with ongoing studies aiming to elucidate its function and potential implications in human health and disease.
