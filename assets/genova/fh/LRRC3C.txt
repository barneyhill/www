# LRRC3C

## Overview
The LRRC3C gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 3C, which is part of a family of proteins characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that LRRC3C may play a role in cellular communication or signaling pathways. Although the specific function of the LRRC3C protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is hypothesized to be involved in processes such as apoptosis and cell proliferation, given its structural similarity to other proteins in the LRR family (Söderman2015Gene). The gene has been studied in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where variations in its expression have been linked to disease susceptibility, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Söderman2015Gene). Further research is necessary to clarify the precise biological roles and mechanisms of action of LRRC3C.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The LRRC3C gene has been implicated in the susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a condition characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Research by Söderman et al. has identified a susceptibility allele, rs2872507, which is associated with increased expression of LRRC3C in the colon tissue of individuals without IBD. This suggests a potential role for LRRC3C in IBD susceptibility, possibly through mechanisms involving apoptosis and cell proliferation (Söderman2015Gene). The study found that individuals homozygous for the susceptibility allele exhibited a 6.78-fold increase in LRRC3C expression in noninflamed, non-IBD colonic samples, indicating a significant alteration in gene expression linked to the allele (Söderman2015Gene).

Despite these findings, the exact clinical significance of LRRC3C in IBD remains unclear, as no functional studies have been published regarding the protein it encodes, leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 3C. The gene is most similar to LRRC3B, which has been suggested to play a role in the suppression of cell proliferation, but the relevance of LRRC3C in this context is not fully elucidated (Söderman2015Gene). Further research is needed to understand the biological implications of LRRC3C expression alterations in IBD and its potential role in disease mechanisms.
