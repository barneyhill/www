# PRPH

## Overview
The PRPH gene encodes peripherin, a type III intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in neurons of the peripheral nervous system. Peripherin plays a crucial role in maintaining neuronal structure and integrity by forming filamentous networks essential for axonal stability and regeneration. These networks are vital for nerve repair and functional recovery following injury. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including neurite outgrowth, axonal transport, and myelination, and interacts with numerous proteins involved in vesicular trafficking and signal transduction. The expression of peripherin is regulated by nerve growth factor and other cytokines, and it is upregulated following axonal injury, indicating its role in axonal regeneration. Mutations in the PRPH gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Larivière2002Reduced; Bjornsdottir2019A; Romano2022Role).

## Structure
Peripherin (PRPH) is a type III intermediate filament protein primarily expressed in neurons of the peripheral nervous system. Its primary structure consists of a central α-helical rod domain flanked by non-α-helical head and tail domains. The central rod domain is organized into heptad repeats forming four sub-helices: coil 1A, coil 1B, coil 2A, and coil 2B, separated by linker domains L1, L12, and L2. Crystallographic studies suggest that coil 2A, coil L2, and coil 2B form a single coiled-coil domain (Romano2022Role).

Peripherin's secondary structure includes α-helices that form coiled-coil motifs, which are characteristic of intermediate filament proteins. The tertiary structure involves the assembly of these motifs into filamentous structures. Quaternary structure is achieved through the polymerization of two monomers into a 'coiled-coil' dimer, which associates in an antiparallel manner to form a tetramer. Eight tetramers then form a cylindrical unit filament, and multiple-unit filaments associate to form intermediate filaments (Romano2022Role).

Peripherin undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at serine and tyrosine residues, nitration at tyrosine residues, acetylation at lysine residues, and methylation at arginine residues. These modifications influence its solubility, dynamics, and interaction with microtubules (Romano2022Role). Multiple isoforms of peripherin exist due to alternative splicing, including Per 58, Per 45, Per 56, and Per 61 in mice, and Per 28 in humans (Zhao2016αInternexin; Hol2017Type).

## Function
Peripherin (PRPH) is a type III intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in neurons of the peripheral nervous system. It plays a significant role in maintaining neuronal structure and integrity by forming filamentous networks essential for axonal stability and regeneration. These networks contribute to nerve repair and functional recovery after injury (Larivière2002Reduced; Romano2022Role).

Peripherin is involved in various cellular processes, including neurite outgrowth, axonal transport, and myelination. It interacts with proteins involved in vesicular trafficking, signal transduction, DNA/RNA processing, protein folding, and mitochondrial metabolism, indicating its broad involvement in cell biology (Romano2022Role). The protein is crucial for the initiation and maintenance of axons, particularly in sensory neurons, and is selectively expressed in type II spiral ganglion neurons in the cochlea (Romano2022Role).

Peripherin's expression is regulated by nerve growth factor and other cytokines, and it is upregulated following axonal injury, suggesting a role in axonal regeneration (Romano2022Role). It is also implicated in the differentiation of sensory, motor, and sympathetic neurons, with its gene expression tightly regulated to produce different isoforms that affect filament network formation (McLean2007A; Romano2022Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRPH gene, which encodes the intermediate filament protein peripherin, have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. A splice-donor variant, rs73112142-A, is associated with reduced sural nerve amplitude and an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. This variant disrupts normal splicing, leading to the production of truncated protein isoforms that fail to form functional filamentous structures, resulting in sensory-negative neuropathy characterized by axonal degeneration (Bjornsdottir2019A).

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the PRPH gene is linked to the disease through a frameshift deletion, PRPH 228delC, which results in a truncated protein that disrupts neurofilament assembly. This mutation is associated with the disorganization of the neurofilament network, contributing to ALS pathogenesis (GrosLouis2004A).

Alterations in peripherin expression are also noted in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2B disease, where mutations in the RAB7A protein, which interacts with peripherin, affect its assembly. This interaction potentially contributes to the onset of the disease (Romano2022Role). Peripherin's role in these conditions highlights its clinical significance as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
Peripherin (PRPH) is known to interact with various proteins, playing a significant role in the assembly and function of neurofilaments. It coassembles with neurofilament proteins such as NFL, NFH, and NFM into a single filament network, both in vitro and in vivo. This interaction is crucial for the structural integrity of peripheral nerve neurofilaments, with the presence of NFL being particularly important for the efficient assembly of peripherin into filaments (Yuan2012Peripherin).

Peripherin also interacts with the SNAP25-interacting protein, SIP30, through coiled-coil domains. This interaction affects the subcellular distribution of SIP30 and is involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking (Gentil2014A). The interaction between peripherin and SIP30 has been confirmed through various molecular biology techniques, including co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays (Gentil2014A).

Additionally, peripherin interacts with RAB7A, a small GTPase involved in vesicular trafficking. This interaction is significant in the context of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2B disease, as disease-causing RAB7A mutants show altered binding to peripherin, potentially contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Cogli2012Charcot–Marie–Tooth).
