# TSPYL4

## Overview
TSPYL4, or Testis-Specific Protein Y-Encoded-Like 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the TSPY-like family, which is involved in various cellular processes, including serotonin transport and drug metabolism. The TSPY-like 4 protein is implicated in the regulation of serotonin transporter protein SLC6A4, influencing serotonin levels and playing a significant role in mood regulation and the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) (Qin2019Dual). Additionally, TSPYL4 modulates the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP2C19, which are crucial for the metabolism of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), thereby affecting treatment outcomes in MDD patients (Qin2019Dual). The protein is also involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for cell cycle regulation and gene expression, although its precise role in these processes remains to be fully elucidated (Zhu2022Testis).

## Structure


## Function
TSPYL4, a member of the TSPY-like family, plays a role in mediating serotonin transport and the metabolism of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). TSPYL4, along with TSPYL1 and TSPYL2, regulates the expression of the serotonin transporter protein, SLC6A4, which affects serotonin transport into cells. This regulation is crucial for maintaining serotonin levels, which are important for mood regulation and are implicated in depression severity (Qin2019Dual).

TSPYL4 also influences the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP2C19, which are involved in drug metabolism. This regulation is significant for the metabolism of SSRIs, impacting treatment response in MDD patients (Qin2019Dual). Additionally, TSPYL4 is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is important for cell cycle regulation and gene expression. Knockdown of TSPYL4 has been shown to increase Wnt signaling activity, suggesting a role in modulating this pathway, although its specific function in cell biology requires further investigation (Zhu2022Testis).
