# UBTFL1

## Overview
UBTFL1 is a gene that encodes the protein upstream binding transcription factor like 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. The activity of UBTFL1 is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and has been implicated in several signaling pathways, including the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the precise mechanisms by which UBTFL1 influences these pathways is an ongoing area of research, with implications for understanding its role in health and disease.
