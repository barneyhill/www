# MOSPD3

## Overview
MOSPD3, or motile sperm domain containing 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the formation of membrane contact sites (MCS) within cells. The MOSPD3 protein is categorized as a membrane contact site protein, playing a crucial role in facilitating communication between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and other organelles, such as mitochondria. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, including calcium storage, endosomal trafficking, and lipid transfer. It is particularly significant in the reformation of the nuclear envelope during cell division, interacting with LEM family proteins to aid in this process. Additionally, MOSPD3 influences mitochondrial distribution and ER membrane organization, highlighting its importance in cellular structure and function (Cabukusta2020Human). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its role in cardiac development, where mutations can lead to right ventricular defects, drawing parallels to human heart conditions (Pall2004A).

## Function
MOSPD3 is a membrane contact site protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes by interacting with FFNT motifs, which are related to the classical FFAT motifs. It is part of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in forming membrane contact sites (MCS) between the ER and other organelles, such as mitochondria. These sites are crucial for interorganellar communication, participating in processes like calcium storage, endosomal trafficking, and lipid transfer (Cabukusta2020Human).

MOSPD3 is particularly noted for its role in the timely reformation of the nuclear envelope in post-mitotic cells. It interacts with LEM family proteins like EMD and ANKLE2, which are involved in nuclear envelope reassembly, suggesting that MOSPD3 may recruit these proteins to facilitate this process (Cabukusta2020Human). The protein is localized in the ER and interacts with EMD predominantly in the cytoplasm, rather than in the inner nuclear membrane (Cabukusta2020Human).

MOSPD3 also influences the peripheral distribution of mitochondria and can induce the formation of organized smooth ER (OSER) structures when overexpressed. This suggests a role in ER membrane organization and protein complex formation (Cabukusta2020Human). The protein's interactions are facilitated by its MSP domain and preference for FFNT motifs, indicating a subspecialization among VAP proteins (Cabukusta2020Human).

## Clinical Significance
The MOSPD3 gene is implicated in right ventricle development, and its disruption can lead to significant cardiac abnormalities. In mice, mutations in MOSPD3, particularly those induced by gene trapping, result in defects in the right ventricle, characterized by dilation and thinning of the parietal wall, which can lead to neonatal lethality in 50% of homozygous mice (Pall2004A). These defects are less severe but comparable to those seen in animals with disrupted Alp gene, associated with right ventricular chamber dilation (Pall2004A). The phenotype of MOSPD3 mutants invites comparison with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), a human heart muscle disease, although MOSPD3 mutants do not show tissue replacement with adipose or fibrous tissue (Pall2004A).

The penetrance of the MOSPD3 mutant phenotype is influenced by genetic background, suggesting the presence of genetic modifiers, with Mospd1 being a potential candidate (Pall2004A). The gene's role in cardiac development highlights its potential clinical significance, as alterations in its expression or function could contribute to congenital heart defects, which are the most common birth defects in humans (Pall2004A).

## Interactions
MOSPD3 is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its role as a membrane contact site protein. It interacts with FFAT-related FFNT motifs, which are distinct from the classical FFAT motifs that interact with VAPA and VAPB. MOSPD3 shows a preference for FFNT motifs, leading to the formation of specific ER-resident complexes (Cabukusta2020Human). 

MOSPD3 interacts with the outer mitochondrial membrane protein RMDN3, although it is less efficient in this interaction compared to other VAP proteins (Cabukusta2020Human). It also interacts with proteins such as centrosomal protein 85 (CEP85), ankyrin repeat and LEM domain containing 2 (ANKLE2), and endosome-associated-trafficking regulator 1 (ENTR1), mediated by FFNT motifs (Cabukusta2020Human). 

The interaction between MOSPD3 and emerin (EMD) occurs predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum, and mutations in EMD can significantly reduce this interaction. This interaction is relevant to nuclear envelope dynamics during mitosis, as depletion of MOSPD3 delays nuclear envelope reformation (Cabukusta2020Human). MOSPD3 also forms specific complexes with MOSPD1, distinct from those formed by VAPA, VAPB, and MOSPD2 (Cabukusta2020Human).
