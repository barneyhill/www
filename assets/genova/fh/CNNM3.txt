# CNNM3

## Overview
CNNM3 is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin and CBS domain divalent metal cation transport mediator 3, which is a member of the CNNM family of integral membrane proteins. This protein plays a pivotal role in the transport and homeostasis of magnesium ions within human cells. Structurally, CNNM3 is characterized by its transmembrane domain and cytosolic regions, which include a cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domain and a cyclic nucleotide-binding homology (CNBH) domain. These domains are crucial for its function in magnesium transport, as they facilitate interactions with other proteins and ions. CNNM3 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with notable expression in the lung, spleen, and heart, and is primarily active in the cell membrane. Its interactions with proteins such as TRPM7 and PRL phosphatases underscore its importance in cellular ion homeostasis and its potential implications in cancer progression (GiménezMascarell2019Current; Zhang2017PRL3; Bai2021CNNM).

## Structure
The CNNM3 protein is part of the CNNM family, which are integral membrane proteins involved in magnesium transport. Structurally, CNNM3 contains an N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain (DUF21), and a large cytosolic region with a cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domain and a cyclic nucleotide-binding homology (CNBH) domain (Chen2018The; GiménezMascarell2019Current). The CNBH domain is characterized by an eight-stranded antiparallel β-roll capped by an α-helical bundle, with a single-turn α-helix between the β1 and β2 strands (Chen2018The). This domain does not bind cyclic nucleotides due to steric hindrance from a large aromatic residue, Tyr628, which blocks the typical nucleotide-binding site (Chen2018The).

The CBS-pair domain forms dimers in a head-to-head manner, creating disc-like structures that enclose central nucleotide-binding sites for Mg2+-ATP (Chen2020Mg2+ATP). The CNBH domain mediates dimerization, which is crucial for the protein's function, although not strictly required for Mg2+ efflux activity (Chen2018The). The CNNM3 protein forms homodimers, which are likely its functional unit (GiménezMascarell2019Current). The protein's structure is essential for its role in magnesium transport, with specific motifs and residues playing critical roles in ligand interaction and stabilization (GiménezMascarell2019Current).

## Function
CNNM3, a member of the cyclin and CBS domain divalent metal cation transport mediator family, plays a crucial role in magnesium ion transport and homeostasis in human cells. It is involved in both magnesium influx and efflux, contributing to the maintenance of intracellular magnesium levels, which are essential for various cellular functions (GiménezMascarell2019Current; Bai2021CNNM). CNNM3 interacts with the TRPM7 ion channel, acting as a regulatory subunit to stimulate the entry of divalent cations, including magnesium, into cells. This interaction is vital for maintaining cellular ion homeostasis and is particularly important in tissues where TRPM7 activity is critical (Bai2021CNNM).

CNNM3 is ubiquitously expressed, with higher levels in the lung, spleen, and heart, and lower levels in skeletal muscles and odontoblasts (GiménezMascarell2019Current). It is primarily active in the cell membrane, where it influences physiological processes by regulating magnesium levels, which are crucial for enzymatic reactions, DNA synthesis, and energy production (GiménezMascarell2019Current). The protein's role in magnesium homeostasis is also linked to its interaction with PRL phosphatases, which are involved in tumor progression, suggesting a potential impact on cancer development (Zhang2017PRL3; Cai2020A).

## Clinical Significance
CNNM3 is implicated in cancer progression due to its interaction with phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRLs), which are overexpressed in metastatic cancers. The binding of PRLs to CNNM3 inhibits magnesium efflux, leading to increased intracellular magnesium levels that promote cell proliferation and tumor progression (Gulerez2016Phosphocysteine; Zhang2017PRL3). This interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation and oxidation of the PRL active site, which can affect the binding affinity and subsequent cellular effects (Gulerez2016Phosphocysteine).

Mutations in CNNM3 that disrupt its interaction with PRLs can influence tumor formation. For instance, mutations in the CBS-pair domain of CNNM3, such as those affecting key amino acids, can alter its binding to PRLs and impact magnesium homeostasis, potentially affecting cancer progression (Gulerez2016Phosphocysteine; Zhang2017PRL3). Although specific diseases directly linked to CNNM3 mutations are not detailed, the protein's role in magnesium transport and its interaction with oncogenic phosphatases suggest its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (GiménezMascarell2019Current). The clinical significance of CNNM3 in other conditions remains an area of active research.

## Interactions
CNNM3 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in magnesium homeostasis. It forms complexes with the TRPM7 ion channel, which is essential for the entry of divalent cations like Mg2+ into cells. The absence of CNNM3 significantly reduces TRPM7 channel activity, indicating a direct interaction between these proteins (Bai2021CNNM). CNNM3 also interacts with protein tyrosine phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRLs), such as PRL-2, which modulate its function in magnesium transport. PRL-2 binds to the cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domain of CNNM3, influencing its activity (Gulerez2016Phosphocysteine).

ARL15, another interacting partner, binds to CNNM3 and acts as a negative regulator of magnesium transport by promoting complex N-glycosylation of CNNMs (Zolotarov2020ARL15). The interaction network involving CNNM3 is complex, with PRLs and ARL15 having opposing effects on TRPM7 function; PRLs stimulate TRPM7-mediated cation influx, while ARL15 suppresses it (Bai2021CNNM). These interactions highlight CNNM3's role in regulating magnesium homeostasis through its interactions with various proteins.
