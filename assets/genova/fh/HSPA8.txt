# HSPA8

## Overview
HSPA8 is a gene that encodes the heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 8, also known as heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70), a molecular chaperone involved in a wide array of cellular processes. This protein is a member of the Hsp70 family, which is characterized by its role in protein folding, prevention of protein aggregation, and assistance in protein transport across cellular membranes (Radons2016The; Bonam2019HSPA8HSC70). HSC70 is constitutively expressed in various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and nucleus, and is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein quality control (Bonam2019HSPA8HSC70). It also plays a significant role in chaperone-mediated autophagy, a process essential for cellular stress responses and immune regulation (Bonam2019HSPA8HSC70). The protein's involvement in numerous interactions and pathways underscores its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Wu2023HSPA8).

## Structure
HSPA8, also known as HSC70, is a protein with a modular structure comprising a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) at the N-terminal and a substrate-binding domain (SBD) at the C-terminal, connected by a hydrophobic hinge (Bonam2019HSPA8HSC70; Stricher2013HSPA8HSC70). The NBD is responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis, essential for the protein's chaperone activity, and is composed of two lobes, each divided into subdomains (Stricher2013HSPA8HSC70). The SBD includes a 15-kDa β-sandwich for peptide binding and a 10-kDa α-helix acting as a lid over the binding site (Bonam2019HSPA8HSC70; Stricher2013HSPA8HSC70).

The protein undergoes conformational changes upon ATP binding, which opens the α-helical lid of the SBD, and peptide binding increases the ATP hydrolysis rate (Stricher2013HSPA8HSC70). HSPA8 can exist as monomers or oligomers, and its structure is influenced by the presence of ATP or ADP, which affects its conformation (Bonam2019HSPA8HSC70). The protein's interaction with lipid membranes involves entropy-driven processes and is influenced by pH, with no change in secondary and local tertiary structure upon interaction with liposomes (DoresSilva2021Human). HSPA8's flexibility allows it to couple the ATP/ADP cycle to the substrate binding cycle efficiently (Stricher2013HSPA8HSC70).

## Function
HSPA8, also known as Hsc70, is a molecular chaperone that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein quality control in healthy human cells. It is involved in the folding and refolding of nascent and misfolded proteins, preventing their aggregation and ensuring proper protein conformation and function (Radons2016The; Bonam2019HSPA8HSC70). HSPA8 is constitutively expressed and found in various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm, nucleus, and organelles, where it assists in the transport of proteins across intracellular membranes (Radons2016The; Bonam2019HSPA8HSC70).

HSPA8 is also a key regulator of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), where it detects and processes substrates for degradation, thus playing a role in cellular stress responses and immune regulation (Bonam2019HSPA8HSC70). It interacts with the KFERQ motif in proteins targeted for CMA and is involved in the initial stages of macroautophagy (Bonam2019HSPA8HSC70). Additionally, HSPA8 acts as an amyloidase, inhibiting and reversing the formation of functional amyloids, which is crucial in preventing necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death (Wu2023HSPA8). This function helps maintain cellular stability and prevent inflammation (Wu2023HSPA8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HSPA8 gene, which encodes the heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70), have been implicated in various diseases. A specific missense mutation, V95E, in the Hspa8 gene has been linked to neuroaxonal dystrophy (NAD) in rats. This mutation leads to symptoms such as abnormal gaits and hind limb ataxia, and is associated with decreased expression levels of HSC70 in the spinal cord, as well as histopathological changes (Tanaka2024A).

In cancer, HSPA8 is often upregulated, contributing to cancer cell survival and proliferation. High expression levels of HSPA8 have been associated with poor clinical outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients, where it serves as an independent prognostic factor for survival (Li2021High). HSPA8 is also identified as a potential biomarker for endometrial carcinoma, where its upregulation is linked to increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis (Zhang2016Identification).

Altered expression of HSPA8 has been observed in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17), where it is downregulated, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disease (Lee2009Altered). These findings highlight the clinical significance of HSPA8 in various diseases, emphasizing its role in disease progression and as a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
HSPA8, also known as HSC70, is a molecular chaperone that participates in numerous interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It forms complexes with co-chaperones such as BAG1 and BAG3, which are involved in chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA) to degrade ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates (Bonam2019HSPA8HSC70). HSPA8 interacts with the DnaJ homologues, which enhance its ATPase activity, facilitating the binding of substrates in the ADP-bound state (Liu2012Comprehensive).

HSPA8 also forms a stable trimeric complex with cysteine string protein (Csp) and small glutamine-rich TPR-containing protein (SGT) on synaptic vesicles, functioning as a chaperone machine (Liu2012Comprehensive). It interacts with HSP90, facilitating functions such as glucocorticoid receptor activation and protein import via the Tom 70 receptor (Liu2012Comprehensive). HSPA8 is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, supporting the nuclear import of karyophilic proteins and accelerating nucleoli recovery from heat injury (Liu2012Comprehensive).

HSPA8 also interacts with proteins involved in immune responses, such as the arylhydrocarbon receptor-interacting proteins (AIP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), facilitating protein folding (Liu2012Comprehensive). It binds to histatin 3, regulating cell proliferation, and interacts with VMAT2, negatively regulating its activity (Liu2012Comprehensive).
