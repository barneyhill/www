# ATP6V1B2

## Overview
The ATP6V1B2 gene encodes the ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit B2, a critical component of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. This protein is part of the V1 domain, which is responsible for ATP hydrolysis, a process essential for the acidification of intracellular compartments such as lysosomes, endosomes, and the Golgi apparatus. The B2 subunit, often referred to as the brain isoform, is ubiquitously expressed in mammals and can substitute for the B1 subunit in certain tissues, highlighting its versatile role in cellular physiology (Zhao2019A). The V-ATPase complex, to which ATP6V1B2 contributes, is vital for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release, thereby playing a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Qiu2021Syndromic; Zhao2019A). Mutations in ATP6V1B2 have been linked to several clinical conditions, including dominant deafness-onychodystrophy syndrome and Zimmermann-Laband syndrome, underscoring its importance in human health and disease (Rousseau2023The; Zhao2019A).

## Structure
The ATP6V1B2 gene encodes the B2 subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme complex involved in organelle acidification. The B2 subunit is part of the V1 domain, which is responsible for ATP hydrolysis. The V1 domain consists of a hexagonal head formed by three pairs of A and B subunits, which undergo conformational changes to bind ATP, ADP, and phosphate (Zhao2019A). The B subunits form a heterohexameric ring structure with alternating A and B subunits, linked to the V0 subcomplex by the C-H subunits (Kortüm2015Mutations).

The primary structure of ATP6V1B2 includes amino acid sequences that form the protein, with specific mutations such as R485P and p.Arg506X affecting its function. The R485P mutation disrupts an alpha-helical segment and a salt bridge with Asp507, potentially destabilizing the protein structure (Kortüm2015Mutations). The p.Arg506X mutation introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein that disrupts hydrogen bond formation between Tyr504 and Asp507 (Yuan2014De).

The B2 subunit is known as the brain isoform and is ubiquitous in mammals, capable of substituting for the B1 subunit in specific tissues (Zhao2019A).

## Function
The ATP6V1B2 gene encodes a subunit of the V1 domain of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), a crucial enzyme complex responsible for acidifying intracellular compartments such as lysosomes, endosomes, and the Golgi apparatus. This acidification is essential for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release (Qiu2021Syndromic; Zhao2019A). The V-ATPase complex consists of a peripheral V1 domain, which catalyzes ATP hydrolysis, and a membrane-integral V0 domain, which is involved in proton translocation (Qiu2021Syndromic).

In healthy human cells, ATP6V1B2 plays a significant role in maintaining lysosomal function and cellular homeostasis by ensuring proper lysosomal acidification. This process is vital for the activation of lysosome-resident peptidases that degrade proteins delivered to the lysosome, facilitating autophagy and cellular metabolism (Wang2019Follicular). The protein is also involved in the regulation of the mTOR pathway, a major regulator of cell growth and metabolism, by maintaining the proton gradient necessary for mTORC1 activation (Wang2019Follicular). ATP6V1B2's function is critical for synaptogenesis and neurotransmitter loading into synaptic vesicles, supporting neuronal connectivity and cognitive functions (Zhao2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP6V1B2 gene are associated with several syndromes and conditions. Dominant deafness-onychodystrophy (DDOD) syndrome is linked to the c.1516C>T (p.Arg506X) mutation, which causes severe congenital sensorineural deafness, onychodystrophy, and brachydactyly. This mutation results in V-ATPase dysfunction and abnormal lysosome acidification (Rousseau2023The; Zhao2019A). Zimmermann-Laband syndrome (ZLS) is another condition associated with ATP6V1B2 mutations, characterized by facial dysmorphism, intellectual disability, and nail and phalangeal aplasia. Variants such as p.R485P are linked to ZLS without epilepsy, while others like p.K489* are associated with ZLS with epilepsy (Rousseau2023The; Kortüm2015Mutations).

ATP6V1B2 mutations are also implicated in central nervous system disorders, including synaptic transmission issues related to Alzheimer's disease and generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures (Zhao2019A). In follicular lymphoma, ATP6V1B2 mutations activate autophagic flux and mTOR signaling, providing a survival advantage to lymphoma cells under nutrient stress (Wang2019Follicular). These mutations lead to impaired lysosomal acidification, which is compensated by increased V-ATPase levels and autophagic flux (Wang2019Follicular).

## Interactions
ATP6V1B2, a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, participates in several critical protein interactions. It is a component of the V1 subcomplex, which is responsible for ATP hydrolysis, and interacts with other subunits such as V1A and V0b, forming a stable V-ATPase complex. Despite mutations like Atp6v1b2 c.1516C>T (p.Arg506X), the overall assembly of V-ATPases remains intact, although specific interactions, such as with the V1E subunit, are weakened (Zhao2019A).

Mutations in ATP6V1B2, such as p.R400Q and p.Y371C, have been shown to affect its interaction with the Ragulator complex, enhancing its lysosomal localization and potentially impacting autophagy and mTOR signaling pathways (Wang2019Follicular). In mature adipocytes, ATP6V1B2 interacts with SIRT1, a deacetylase, which deacetylates ATP6V1B2, suggesting a regulatory role in vacuolar ATPase function (Kim2015SIRT1).

These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of V-ATPases, influencing processes such as lysosomal acidification, cellular metabolism, and autophagic flux, and are implicated in various pathologies, including intellectual disability and follicular lymphoma (Zhao2019A; Wang2019Follicular).
