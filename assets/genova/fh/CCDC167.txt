# CCDC167

## Overview
CCDC167 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 167, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. Although the precise biological functions of CCDC167 remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, particularly in the context of cancer. The gene's expression is notably altered in several cancer types, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and oral cancer, where it is associated with disease progression and prognosis. Research suggests that CCDC167 may play a role in cellular energy metabolism and the regulation of cell death pathways, such as cuproptosis, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Tu2022Identification; Tian2024Causal).

## Clinical Significance
CCDC167 has been implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression linked to disease progression and prognosis. In breast cancer, CCDC167 is identified as a driver of tumorigenesis and progression. It contributes to the proliferation of cancer cells, resistance to apoptosis, and increased invasiveness, particularly in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Elevated levels of CCDC167 are associated with poorer prognosis and survival outcomes in breast cancer patients (Tian2024Causal).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CCDC167 is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to healthy tissues. Its expression is linked to the regulation of cuproptosis, a form of cell death associated with copper toxicity. Knockdown experiments in NSCLC cell lines suggest that CCDC167 may play a role in maintaining intracellular copper levels, impacting cellular energy metabolism pathways. The gene is part of a prognostic model predicting poor overall survival in NSCLC patients (Tu2022Identification).

CCDC167 is also associated with oral cancer, where it has been identified as having a significant causal association with the disease. The gene's expression in plasma proteins suggests a potential role in oral carcinogenesis, although specific mechanisms remain to be elucidated (Tian2024Causal).
