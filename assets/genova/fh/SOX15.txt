# SOX15

## Overview
SOX15 is a gene that encodes the SRY-box transcription factor 15, a member of the SOX family of transcription factors, which are critical for regulating embryonic development and cell fate determination. The SOX15 protein functions as a transcription factor, playing a pivotal role in various biological processes, including muscle regeneration, placental development, and the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency. It is involved in modulating key signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and interacts with other proteins to influence gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. SOX15's expression is crucial in both fetal and adult tissues, and its dysregulation has been linked to several diseases, including various cancers and muscle disorders (Choi2022SOX15; Kumar2020Transcription; Thu2014SOX15).

## Function
SOX15 is a transcription factor involved in various biological processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in embryonic development, placental development, and muscle regeneration. SOX15 is expressed in placental trophoblastic cells and is crucial for cell type-specific promoter activities in myoblast-derived C2C12 cells and placenta-derived Rcho-1 and TS cells. A specific 300bp region upstream from the transcription start site of SOX15 contains cis-elements that control placenta-specific, myoblast-specific, and common basal expression, which are conserved among eutherian mammals (Kumar2020Transcription).

SOX15 is also involved in regulating lineage and tissue-specific gene expression, participating in cell differentiation, sex determination, and organogenesis. It is implicated in modulating key signaling pathways like Wnt/β-catenin, which is crucial for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Kumar2020Transcription). In skeletal muscle development, altering SOX15 levels in mice leads to muscular abnormalities, indicating its involvement in this process (Thu2014SOX15). SOX15 is expressed in various fetal and adult tissues, including the brain, heart, and testes, and is upregulated in induced pluripotent and embryonic stem cells, suggesting its role in maintaining pluripotency and stemness (Thu2014SOX15).

## Clinical Significance
SOX15 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In cancer biology, SOX15 is considered a potential tumor suppressor gene. It is frequently downregulated in several cancers, including colon, stomach, prostate, and uterine cancers, while being overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, indicating a tissue-specific dependency of its expression and function (Thu2014SOX15). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), SOX15 is often inactivated through mechanisms such as copy number loss and DNA hypermethylation, leading to its underexpression in a significant portion of PDAC cell lines. Re-expression of SOX15 in these cells has been shown to reduce cell viability and tumor growth, supporting its role as a tumor suppressor (Thu2014SOX15).

In the context of muscle disorders, a mutation in SOX15, specifically the R104G variant, has been associated with abnormalities in the nervous system and musculature, including fatigable and progressive muscle weakness. This mutation is considered a potential pathogenic autosomal dominant variant, suggesting a novel genotype-phenotype association for SOX15 with muscle disorders (Underwood2023Evolutionary).

## Interactions
SOX15 is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in stem cell pluripotency and differentiation. It cooperates with OCT4 to activate the transcription of the NANOG gene, a crucial factor in maintaining stem cell pluripotency (Choi2022SOX15). SOX15 also binds to enhancers of key pluripotency genes such as Oct4 and Sox2 in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Choi2022SOX15).

In terms of protein interactions, SOX15 has been shown to bind with three stem cell coactivators: the XPC DNA repair complex, the dyskerin (DKC1) ribonucleoprotein complex, and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily F member 1 (ABCF1). These interactions were confirmed through transient transfection and coimmunoprecipitation assays in 293T cells (Choi2022SOX15). SOX15's interaction with ABCF1 is particularly important for activating pluripotency genes, despite its lower abundance compared to SOX2 (Choi2022SOX15).

SOX15 also plays a role in neural differentiation by binding to a distal enhancer of the Hes5 gene, which is essential for neural fate specification during differentiation (Choi2022SOX15). This binding is crucial for the expression of neural stem cell markers and transcription factors important for neural commitment (Choi2022SOX15).
