# NIPAL2

## Overview
NIPAL2 is a gene that encodes the protein NIPA-like domain containing 2, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein involved in magnesium transport. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining magnesium homeostasis within human cells by selectively facilitating the transport of magnesium ions (Mg2+) across cell membranes. Unlike other divalent cations, such as calcium (Ca2+), NIPA-like domain containing 2 is highly specific for Mg2+, underscoring its specialized function in cellular magnesium metabolism (Goytain2008Functional). The protein is predominantly localized to early endosomes and the peripheral surface of cells, highlighting its involvement in surface membrane activities and magnesium transport (Goytain2008Functional). NIPAL2 is particularly significant in renal cells, where it is upregulated in response to low magnesium conditions, indicating its role in magnesium conservation (Goytain2008Functional).

## Function
The NIPAL2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a selective magnesium (Mg2+) transporter, playing a crucial role in maintaining magnesium homeostasis in human cells. This protein is highly specific for Mg2+ and does not facilitate the transport of other divalent cations such as Ca2+ (Goytain2008Functional). NIPAL2 is primarily localized to early endosomes and the peripheral surface of cells, indicating its involvement in surface membrane activities and Mg2+ transport across the cell membrane (Goytain2008Functional). 

In response to low magnesium conditions, NIPAL2 is upregulated, suggesting its role in magnesium conservation, particularly in renal cells where it is abundantly expressed (Goytain2008Functional). The protein's transport activity is characterized as concentration-dependent, saturable, reversible, and inhibitable, with channel-like properties (Goytain2008Functional). 

NIPAL2's activity is crucial for cellular magnesium metabolism, as it mediates Mg2+ flux in a voltage-dependent manner, with a Michaelis constant of 0.31 mM, indicating its physiological relevance (Goytain2008Functional). The protein's localization and function suggest its significant role in regulating magnesium levels, which is essential for various cellular processes, including enzyme function and cellular energy production (Goytain2008Functional).
