# EXOC3

## Overview
EXOC3 is a gene that encodes the protein exocyst complex component 3, which is a crucial part of the exocyst complex involved in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. The exocyst complex is an octameric protein assembly that plays a pivotal role in tethering secretory vesicles to specific sites on the plasma membrane, facilitating vesicle fusion and cargo delivery. EXOC3, as a component of this complex, interacts with various proteins, including phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and other exocyst components, to regulate the spatial and temporal assembly of the SNARE complex, which is essential for vesicle fusion (Wu2015The; Mukerji2012Proteomic). The protein's interactions and functions are critical in processes such as cell polarity, protein trafficking, and immune regulation, with implications in neurodevelopmental disorders, ciliopathies, and certain cancers (SunderPlassmann2023Identification; Halim2023The).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EXOC3 gene, a component of the exocyst complex, have been implicated in several human diseases. Variants in EXOC3 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and ciliopathies, which often present with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and brain abnormalities (Halim2023The). The exocyst complex, including EXOC3, plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as protein trafficking and cell polarity, which are essential for normal neuronal development and function.

EXOC3 has also been identified as a susceptibility locus for Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, suggesting its involvement in carcinogenesis (SunderPlassmann2023Identification). In the context of keratinocyte cancer (KC), particularly in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients, a significant association has been found between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in EXOC3 and the risk of developing KC (SunderPlassmann2023Identification). This highlights the gene's potential role in cancer development, possibly through its involvement in cell migration and immune regulation.

Despite its involvement in various diseases, EXOC3 appears to be dispensable for certain physiological processes, such as spermatogenesis in mice, indicating that its role may vary across different biological contexts (Mikami2024Deletion).

## Interactions
EXOC3, a component of the exocyst complex, participates in several critical protein interactions essential for its function in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. It interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) through a PH-domain-like region at its N-terminus, which is crucial for the exocyst's association with the plasma membrane (Wu2015The). In yeast, disruption of this interaction results in the dissociation of the exocyst from the plasma membrane and a block in secretion (Wu2015The).

EXOC3 also interacts with other exocyst components, such as EXOC1, EXOC2, and EXOC4, forming part of the octameric exocyst complex that tethers vesicles at the plasma membrane (Mukerji2012Proteomic). It is involved in the spatial and temporal regulation of SNARE complex assembly for vesicle fusion (Halim2023The). EXOC3 interacts with the v-SNARE protein Snc2 and the t-SNARE protein Sec9, indicating a role in SNARE assembly and exocytosis (Wu2015The).

In the context of HIV-1 infection, EXOC3 associates with the Nef protein, which enhances intercellular nanotube formation. This interaction is specific to wild-type Nef and is disrupted in Nef mutants (Mukerji2012Proteomic). The association of EXOC3 with Nef was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays (Mukerji2012Proteomic).
