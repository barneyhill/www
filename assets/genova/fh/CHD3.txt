# CHD3

## Overview
The CHD3 gene encodes the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 3, a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family, which plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The CHD3 protein is characterized by its SNF2-like ATPase/helicase domain, chromodomains, and plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers, which collectively facilitate its function in the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, DNA repair, and neuronal development, by modulating chromatin structure through ATP-dependent mechanisms. CHD3's involvement in the NuRD complex underscores its significance in transcriptional repression and nucleosome remodeling, with its dysfunction linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as Snijders Blok-Campeau syndrome (den2024The; Hall2007CHD; Snijders2018CHD3).

## Structure
The CHD3 protein is a member of the Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family and is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in chromatin remodeling. It contains a SNF2-like ATPase/helicase domain, which is crucial for its role in nucleosome remodeling and chromatin interactions. This domain is divided into two subdomains: the Helicase ATP-binding lobe and the Helicase C-terminal lobe, which provide the energy necessary for its remodeling activities through ATPase activity (Snijders2018CHD3).

CHD3 also features two plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers and two chromodomains, which are involved in chromatin binding and interactions (Snijders2018CHD3). The protein's structure includes a unique C-terminal domain that may serve as a binding platform for specific interaction partners, such as KAP-1, which interacts exclusively with CHD3 (Hoffmeister2017CHD3).

CHD3 forms part of the NuRD complex, a macromolecular assembly involved in chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylation. It does not coexist with CHD4 in the same NuRD complex, indicating the formation of isoform-specific complexes (Hoffmeister2017CHD3). The protein's high intolerance to loss-of-function and missense mutations underscores its critical role in cellular processes (Snijders2018CHD3).

## Function
CHD3 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 3) is a chromatin remodeler that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It is a core component of the nucleosome-remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation (Hall2007CHD). CHD3 interacts with histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, as well as other proteins like ATR and TRIM27, to modulate chromatin structure and gene expression (Hall2007CHD).

CHD3 possesses ATP-dependent helicase activity, which is essential for nucleosome mobilization, a process that facilitates various nuclear functions, including transcriptional regulation and DNA repair (Hall2007CHD). The protein is characterized by a chromodomain, SNF2-like helicase-ATPase domain, and a DNA-binding domain, which together enable it to recognize specific histone methylation patterns and interact with DNA through the NuRD complex (Hall2007CHD).

In the context of neuronal development, CHD3 is highly expressed in mature neurons and regulates genes involved in synaptic development and function. It influences axon guidance and synapse formation, contributing to the maturation and functionality of neurons (den2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHD3 gene are associated with a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by macrocephaly, intellectual disability, and impaired speech and language. These mutations predominantly occur as de novo missense mutations within the ATPase/helicase domain of the CHD3 protein, affecting its function in chromatin remodeling, which is crucial for brain development (Snijders2018CHD3). The syndrome, known as Snijders Blok-Campeau syndrome (SNIBCPS), presents with a range of phenotypic features including global developmental delay, hypotonia, autism-like features, and distinct facial characteristics (Snijders2018CHD3; Gao2024Novel).

The CHD3 gene is part of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, and its mutations can lead to either decreased or increased ATPase activity, disrupting chromatin remodeling and contributing to the neurodevelopmental disorder (Snijders2018CHD3). The CHD3 helicase domain is a hotspot for pathogenic variants, although no significant phenotypic differences have been observed between mutations in this domain and those in other regions (Gao2024Novel). The gene's high expression in brain tissue may relate to the severity of intellectual disability observed in affected individuals (Gao2024Novel).

## Interactions
CHD3, a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein family, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. CHD3 is a core component of the NuRD complex, which includes histone deacetylases (HDAC1/2) and methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins, facilitating transcriptional repression and nucleosome remodeling (Snijders2018CHD3). The protein interacts with nucleosomes and double-stranded DNA, as demonstrated by ATPase assays that measure its activity in the presence of these substrates (Snijders2018CHD3).

Mutations in the CHD3 gene, particularly in the helicase domain, have been associated with a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by macrocephaly and impaired speech and language. These mutations affect the protein's ATPase activity and chromatin remodeling capabilities, which are essential for its interactions with chromatin and nucleic acids (Snijders2018CHD3). The CHD3 protein is also noted as an interaction partner of FOXP2, a transcription factor involved in speech and language development, suggesting a role in regulating genes associated with these functions (Snijders2018CHD3).
