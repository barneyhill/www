# ANAPC7

## Overview
ANAPC7 is a gene that encodes the protein anaphase-promoting complex subunit 7, which is a critical component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). The APC/C is an essential E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates the cell cycle by targeting specific proteins for degradation, thereby facilitating the transition from metaphase to anaphase. ANAPC7 is part of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) arm of the APC/C, which is crucial for the structural integrity and function of the complex, as well as for recruiting co-activators necessary for its activity (Melloy2019The; Zhou2016Insights). The protein plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing chromosomal instability, which is vital for preventing tumorigenesis (Zhou2016Insights). ANAPC7's involvement in both the nucleus and cytoplasm underscores its importance in various cellular processes essential for cell division and genomic integrity (Zhou2016Insights).

## Function
ANAPC7 is a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. Within the APC/C, ANAPC7 is part of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) arm, which provides binding sites for the scaffolding subunit and coactivators, playing a significant role in the structural integrity and function of the complex (Melloy2019The; Zhou2016Insights). The TPR arm, including ANAPC7, is essential for recruiting co-activators like Cdc20 and Cdh1, which are necessary for the APC/C's activity during different phases of the cell cycle (Zhou2016Insights).

ANAPC7, through its role in the APC/C, contributes to the regulation of the cell cycle by targeting specific proteins for degradation, thus facilitating the transition from metaphase to anaphase and ensuring proper chromosome segregation (Zhou2016Insights). This process is vital for maintaining genomic stability and preventing chromosomal instability, which can lead to tumorigenesis (Zhou2016Insights). ANAPC7 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, reflecting its involvement in various cellular processes essential for cell division and genomic integrity (Zhou2016Insights).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ANAPC7 gene have been implicated in various cancers. ANAPC7 is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation. Alterations in APC/C subunits, including ANAPC7, have been observed in a range of cancer types. For instance, 14% of patients in a study had at least one mutation in APC/C subunits, with some cancer subtypes, such as ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma, showing mutation frequencies over 20% (Melloy2019The). 

High copy number alterations of ANAPC7 have been associated with poor prognosis in glioma, suggesting that these genetic changes can have cancer subtype-specific impacts (Melloy2019The). Overexpression of ANAPC7 has also been reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples, indicating its potential role in the progression of this malignancy (Melloy2019The).

The clinical significance of ANAPC7 mutations and expression changes is still being explored, with ongoing research needed to fully understand their functional implications and potential as biomarkers for cancer prognosis and treatment response (Melloy2019The).

## Interactions
ANAPC7 is a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. ANAPC7 is part of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) sub-complex within the APC/C, which includes other subunits such as Apc3, Apc6, and Apc8. The TPR domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that ANAPC7 may interact with other proteins through these domains (Melloy2019The; Zhou2016Insights).

While specific physical interactions of ANAPC7 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its role in the APC/C implies interactions with proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. ANAPC7 is associated with the regulation of the cell cycle by mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of key cell cycle regulators (Zhou2020Quantitative). It is also part of a network associated with innate immunity, interacting with proteins such as SCGN, ISG15, OAS1, IFIT1, and IFIT3 (Zhou2020Quantitative).

ANAPC7 has been identified in studies involving the degradation of proteins like NEDL2 by the APC/C-Cdh1 complex, indicating its involvement in the ubiquitination process (Lu2013The). However, specific details on direct physical interactions remain limited.
