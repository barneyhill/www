# ATG12

## Overview
The ATG12 gene encodes the autophagy-related 12 protein, a ubiquitin-like modifier that plays a pivotal role in the autophagy pathway, a critical cellular process for maintaining homeostasis and energy balance. The ATG12 protein is integral to the formation of autophagosomes, which are essential for the degradation and recycling of cellular components. It achieves this by forming a conjugate with ATG5, which subsequently interacts with ATG16L1 to facilitate autophagosome formation and expansion (Hanada2005StructureFunction; Li2017Novel). Beyond its primary role in autophagy, ATG12 is involved in mitochondrial homeostasis and apoptosis regulation, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Radoshevich2010ATG12; Rubinstein2011The). The gene's dysfunction has been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Yang2020Autophagy; Li2017Novel).

## Structure
The ATG12 protein is a ubiquitin-like modifier essential for autophagy, characterized by a ubiquitin-fold region crucial for its function. This region is conserved across species and is necessary for the formation of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate, which is vital for autophagosome formation (Hanada2005StructureFunction). The ubiquitin-fold region of ATG12 includes two α-helices and three β-strands, forming a structure similar to that of ubiquitin, despite lacking sequence homology (Hanada2005StructureFunction; Suzuki2005The).

The tertiary structure of ATG12 involves a compact conformation when conjugated to ATG5, with a hydrophobic interface that stabilizes the complex (Otomo2012Structure). The quaternary structure of ATG12 involves its interaction with ATG5 and ATG16, forming a complex necessary for autophagic function (Noda2012Structure). Specific residues, such as Phe-154, are critical for maintaining the structural integrity required for autophagy, although they do not affect the conjugate's formation (Hanada2005StructureFunction).

ATG12's interaction with ATG3 is facilitated by a unique surface area on ATG12, which is crucial for the lipidation of LC3 family proteins, highlighting its role as a protein recruitment apparatus in autophagy (Metlagel2013Structural).

## Function
The ATG12 gene encodes a ubiquitin-like protein that plays a crucial role in the autophagy process, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and energy balance. In healthy human cells, ATG12 is primarily involved in the formation of autophagosomes, structures that facilitate the degradation and recycling of cellular components. ATG12 conjugates with ATG5, forming the ATG12-ATG5 complex, which further interacts with ATG16L1 to form a larger complex critical for autophagosome formation and expansion (Li2017Novel). This complex acts as an E3-like enzyme, promoting the conjugation of MAP1LC3 protein to lipids, a key step in autophagosome formation (Hanada2007The).

Beyond its role in autophagy, ATG12 also participates in mitochondrial homeostasis and cell death regulation. The ATG12-ATG3 complex, formed through the conjugation of ATG12 to ATG3, is involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function. This complex influences mitochondrial dynamics and morphology, playing a role in restricting mitochondrial expansion and regulating cell death pathways (Radoshevich2010ATG12). The ATG12-ATG3 complex is also implicated in mitophagy, particularly after oxidative stress, contributing to the maintenance of mitochondrial fitness and cellular longevity (Mai2012Autophagy).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATG12 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, alterations in the ATG12 gene have been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). A study identified three novel heterozygous DNA sequence variants in the ATG12 gene promoter in sporadic PD patients, which significantly altered the transcriptional activity of the gene. These variants may contribute to the development of sporadic PD by affecting autophagy, a process crucial for cellular homeostasis and the prevention of alpha-synuclein accumulation, a hallmark of PD (Li2017Novel).

In cancer, ATG12 is involved in tumorigenesis, particularly in gastric and colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI). Although frameshift mutations in ATG12 were not found in these cancers, the gene's role in autophagy suggests that its dysfunction could contribute to cancer development. Alterations in ATG12, such as mutations affecting its interaction with other proteins, have been linked to impaired autophagy, which can influence cancer progression (Yang2020Autophagy; Kang2009Frameshift).

Overall, the ATG12 gene plays a significant role in disease pathogenesis through its involvement in autophagy, with implications for both neurodegenerative disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
ATG12 is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for autophagy and apoptosis. It forms a covalent conjugate with ATG5, which is crucial for the lipidation of LC3, a process necessary for autophagosome formation. This ATG12~ATG5 conjugate interacts with ATG3, an E2-like enzyme, through specific residues on ATG12, facilitating LC3 lipidation (Metlagel2013Structural; Otomo2012Structure). The ATG12~ATG5 complex also binds to ATG16L1, recruiting it to autophagosomal membranes (Otomo2012Structure).

ATG12 also forms a covalent complex with ATG3, representing a second conjugation target alongside ATG5. This interaction is confirmed through mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation, indicating ATG12's role in mitochondrial homeostasis and cell death (Radoshevich2010ATG12).

In addition to its role in autophagy, ATG12 interacts with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members through a BH3-like motif, promoting mitochondrial apoptosis. This interaction occurs independently of its conjugation to ATG5, suggesting distinct roles in apoptosis and autophagy (Rubinstein2011The). These interactions highlight ATG12's multifaceted role in cellular processes.
