# PPP1R1C

## Overview
PPP1R1C is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 1C, a regulatory protein that functions as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). PP1 is a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the reversible phosphorylation of proteins, a critical regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic cells. The protein encoded by PPP1R1C, often referred to as IPP5, is characterized by a conserved RVXF motif essential for its binding to PP1, thereby modulating its activity (Casamayor2020Controlling). This interaction plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. PPP1R1C is notably expressed in the heart and testis, suggesting its importance in these tissues (Casamayor2020Controlling). The gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including cardiovascular malformations and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its potential significance in human health and disease (Rylaarsdam2019Genetic; Lalani2012Rare).

## Function
PPP1R1C encodes a small protein that functions as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a critical enzyme involved in the reversible phosphorylation of proteins, which is a key regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic cells. The protein is highly expressed in the heart and testis, indicating its potential importance in these tissues (Casamayor2020Controlling). PPP1R1C contains a conserved RVXF motif in its N-terminal region, which is crucial for binding to PP1 and modulating its activity (Casamayor2020Controlling).

The active form of PPP1R1C, known as IPP5, has been identified as a potential apoptosis-promoting factor. Overexpression of a truncated version of IPP5 with a phosphomimetic mutation can arrest the cell cycle in the G2/M phase and promote apoptosis, particularly enhancing the effects of chemotherapeutic agents like Paclitaxel (Casamayor2020Controlling). This suggests that PPP1R1C plays a role in regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis, which are critical processes for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. By inhibiting PP1, PPP1R1C influences various signal transduction pathways, contributing to the regulation of cellular responses and the maintenance of organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
The PPP1R1C gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and genetic variations. In the context of cancer, both PPP1R1C and its related gene KRT18 have been found to be differentially expressed in human non-small cell lung carcinoma. Specifically, KRT18 expression was upregulated, while PPP1R1C was downregulated in an EGR1-overexpressing cell line, suggesting a potential regulatory interaction that may influence the malignancy of lung carcinoma (CiomborowskaBasheer2021Not).

In cardiovascular health, rare copy number variations (CNVs) involving the PPP1R1C gene have been associated with cardiovascular malformations (CVMs) and extracardiac anomalies (ECAs). A de novo loss at the 2q31.3-q32.1 locus, which includes PPP1R1C, was identified in individuals with these conditions, indicating a possible role in cardiac development and structural defects (Lalani2012Rare).

Additionally, PPP1R1C has been mentioned in the context of psychiatric disorders. It is hypothesized to be part of a shared risk mechanism involving abnormal gene regulation in radial glia and interneurons during mid-gestation, which could contribute to disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (Rylaarsdam2019Genetic).

## Interactions
PPP1R1C, a regulatory protein, interacts with the serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP1. It contains a conserved RVXF motif, which is crucial for binding to PP1, a common feature among PP1 interacting proteins (Casamayor2020Controlling). This interaction is significant for modulating PP1's activity, which is involved in various cellular processes. PPP1R1C is highly expressed in the heart and testis, suggesting tissue-specific roles in these organs (Casamayor2020Controlling).

The protein also has a phosphorylation site in its N-terminal region, which is important for its function. Overexpression of a truncated version of PPP1R1C with a phosphomimetic mutation (T41D) in HeLa cells can arrest the cell cycle in the G2/M phase and promote apoptosis. This indicates that PPP1R1C may have a role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, potentially enhancing the effects of chemotherapeutic agents like Paclitaxel (Casamayor2020Controlling).

While specific interactions of PPP1R1C with other proteins or its detailed functional mechanisms are not extensively covered, its interaction with PP1 and the presence of the RVXF motif suggest a regulatory role in PP1-mediated pathways (Casamayor2020Controlling).
