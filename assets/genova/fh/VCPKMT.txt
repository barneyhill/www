# VCPKMT

## Overview
VCPKMT, or valosin-containing protein lysine methyltransferase, is a gene that encodes a lysine-specific protein methyltransferase, known as METTL21D. This enzyme is part of a novel family of human protein methyltransferases and is responsible for the trimethylation of lysine 315 on the valosin-containing protein (VCP), also referred to as p97. The methylation activity of VCPKMT is highly specific, with VCP being its only identified substrate, and occurs primarily in the cytoplasm and nucleus. This post-translational modification is crucial for regulating VCP's involvement in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, membrane fusion, and DNA repair (Aileni2017A; Kernstock2012Lysine). While the methylation of VCP is not essential for its basic functions, it may influence specialized cellular activities such as cell proliferation and migration, which are significant in cancer metastasis (Kernstock2012Lysine). Mutations in the VCPKMT gene have been associated with several diseases, including pontocerebellar hypoplasia and a recessive marfanoid syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Frolov2024Two; Bizzari2020Recessive).

## Function
VCP-KMT, also known as METTL21D, is a lysine-specific protein methyltransferase that trimethylates lysine 315 on the valosin-containing protein (VCP), also known as p97. This methylation occurs primarily in the cytoplasm and nucleus and is crucial for regulating VCP's role in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, membrane fusion, and DNA repair (Luo2018Chemical; Kernstock2012Lysine).

In healthy human cells, VCP-KMT is responsible for the almost complete trimethylation of VCP at Lys315, a modification that is not essential for VCP's basic functions such as ATPase activity or its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy. However, this methylation may serve specialized purposes, potentially influencing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, which are critical in processes like cancer metastasis (Kernstock2012Lysine).

VCP-KMT belongs to a novel family of human protein methyltransferases, specifically Family 16, which includes other lysine-specific enzymes. These enzymes share a conserved motif crucial for their catalytic activity, indicating a broader role in protein methylation beyond VCP (Kernstock2012Lysine). The enzyme's activity is highly specific, with VCP being its only identified substrate (Aileni2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the VCPKMT gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. VCPKMT is linked to pontocerebellar hypoplasia, Type 2A, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by underdevelopment of the cerebellum and brainstem, leading to severe motor and cognitive impairments (Frolov2024Two). Additionally, mutations in VCPKMT have been implicated in a recessive marfanoid syndrome with herniation. This condition is associated with a homozygous nonsense mutation in the VCPKMT gene, resulting in early truncation of the lysine methyltransferase protein METTL21D, which is predicted to be deleterious (Bizzari2020Recessive).

Alterations in VCPKMT expression or function may also be linked to cancer. The gene has been identified as a potential genetic biomarker for oral squamous cell carcinoma, although its predictive power for disease recurrence is limited (Hurník2023Enhancing). These findings suggest that VCPKMT plays a role in various pathological conditions, potentially through its involvement in protein methylation and regulation of protein interactions.

## Interactions
VCPKMT, also known as valosin-containing protein lysine methyltransferase, is primarily known for its interaction with the valosin-containing protein (VCP). VCPKMT specifically methylates VCP at lysine 315, a modification that is crucial for its function in various cellular processes (Kernstock2012Lysine). The interaction between VCPKMT and VCP is facilitated by a domain within VCP, specifically residues 282-364, which is located in the D1 ATPase domain (Aileni2017A; Kernstock2012Lysine). This interaction is essential for the methylation process, as VCPKMT does not methylate the intact hexameric form of VCP, suggesting that methylation occurs before hexamer assembly (Kernstock2012Lysine).

VCPKMT has been shown to have a high specificity for VCP, with no additional substrates identified despite extensive testing (Kernstock2012Lysine). The enzyme's activity is not significantly affected by mutations in the amino acids surrounding the methylation site, indicating a robust interaction with its substrate (Aileni2017A). Although VCPKMT is part of a larger family of methyltransferases, its interaction with VCP remains its primary known function (Kernstock2012Lysine).
