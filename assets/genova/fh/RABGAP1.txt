# RABGAP1

## Overview
RABGAP1 is a gene that encodes the RAB GTPase activating protein 1, a critical regulator of intracellular vesicle trafficking. This protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and is involved in the modulation of Rab GTPases, which are pivotal in processes such as endocytosis, exocytosis, and membrane recycling. The RABGAP1 protein is characterized by distinct domains, including a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, a catalytic TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain, and a coiled-coil (CC) domain, which facilitate its interactions and regulatory functions. It plays a significant role in the recycling of β1 integrins, influencing cell migration and invasion, and is implicated in the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), with potential relevance to Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, RABGAP1 is involved in mTORC1 signaling through its interaction with TUFT1, affecting lysosomal positioning and vesicular trafficking (Eden2024RABGAP1; Kawasaki2018TUFT1; Samarelli2020Rabgap1).

## Structure
RABGAP1, also known as GAPCenA or TBC1D11, is a protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in regulating Rab GTPases. The molecular structure of RABGAP1 includes an N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, which is crucial for its interaction with specific motifs, such as the NPxY motif of the β1 integrin cytoplasmic tail (Samarelli2020Rabgap1). This interaction is essential for the recycling of active β1 integrins, supporting cell migration and invasion (Samarelli2020Rabgap1).

The central part of RABGAP1 contains a conserved catalytic TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain, which promotes GTP hydrolysis, a key function in its role as a GTPase-activating protein (Samarelli2020Rabgap1). This domain is responsible for stimulating the GTPase activity of several Rab proteins, including Rab4, Rab11, and Rab36 (Kawasaki2018TUFT1).

RABGAP1 also features a C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain, which may be involved in protein-protein interactions or structural stability (Samarelli2020Rabgap1). The protein's activity can be regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and it may exist in different isoforms due to splice variants, potentially affecting its function or localization.

## Function
RABGAP1 is a GTPase-activating protein that plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular vesicle trafficking by modulating the activity of Rab GTPases. It facilitates the conversion of Rab proteins from an active GTP-bound state to an inactive GDP-bound state, impacting processes such as endocytosis, exocytosis, and membrane recycling (Eden2024RABGAP1). RABGAP1 is involved in the recycling of active β1 integrins, which are essential for cell migration and cell-ECM interactions. It balances Rab11 activity, crucial for the endosomal recycling of α5β1 integrins, thereby maintaining proper integrin trafficking and cell motility (Samarelli2020Rabgap1).

RABGAP1 also interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of amyloid precursor protein (APP), facilitating its sorting and processing in endosomes. This interaction is essential for the amyloidogenic processing of APP, affecting its cleavage by secretase enzymes (Eden2024RABGAP1). Additionally, RABGAP1 is involved in mTORC1 signaling through its interaction with TUFT1, influencing lysosomal positioning and vesicular trafficking (Kawasaki2018TUFT1). The protein is active in various cellular compartments, including the Golgi apparatus and endosomes, where it regulates the trafficking of integrins and APP, contributing to cellular organization and signaling (Eden2024RABGAP1; Samarelli2020Rabgap1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RABGAP1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. Biallelic loss of RABGAP1 in humans and mouse models is associated with severe neurodevelopmental defects, including intellectual disabilities, global developmental delays, delayed myelination, and loss of white matter volume in the brain (Eden2024RABGAP1). These findings suggest that RABGAP1 plays a critical role in normal brain development and function.

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, RABGAP1 is involved in the trafficking and processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Dysregulation of RABGAP1, either through knockdown or overexpression, disrupts APP processing, leading to changes in the levels of the pathogenic amyloid-beta precursor, C99. This disruption is relevant to conditions involving amyloid processing, such as Alzheimer's disease (Eden2024RABGAP1).

RABGAP1 is also implicated in cancer, particularly in the context of breast cancer. It promotes the recycling of active β1 integrins, which is crucial for cell migration and invasion. High levels of RABGAP1 are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer (Samarelli2020Rabgap1).

## Interactions
RABGAP1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking and signaling pathways. It is identified as a novel interactor of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), binding specifically to the YENPTY motif in the APP cytosolic tail. This interaction is mediated by the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain of RABGAP1 and is crucial for the proper trafficking and processing of APP, influencing the production of amyloidogenic fragments (Eden2024RABGAP1).

RABGAP1 also interacts with β1 integrins, binding to the Y783 residue in the β1 integrin tail. This interaction is essential for the recycling of active β1 integrins, which supports effective cell migration and invasion, particularly in cancer cells. The PTB domain of RABGAP1 mediates this interaction, and its GAP activity is necessary for promoting integrin recycling (Samarelli2020Rabgap1).

Additionally, RABGAP1 interacts with TUFT1, a protein involved in mTORC1 signaling. This interaction regulates lysosomal positioning and vesicular trafficking, which are important for mTORC1 activation. TUFT1 enhances the GAP activity of RABGAP1, particularly on Rab36, although Rab36 is not the sole target for mTORC1 regulation (Kawasaki2018TUFT1).
