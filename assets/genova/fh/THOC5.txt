# THOC5

## Overview
THOC5 is a gene that encodes the THO complex subunit 5, a protein integral to the THO complex, which is part of the larger transcription/export (TREX) complex involved in mRNA processing and export. The THOC5 protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a nuclear localization signal, a potential WW domain binding site, a PEST domain, and a leucine zipper, which facilitate its role in mRNA maturation and export (Tran2014THOC5a). As a component of the THO complex, THOC5 is crucial for the regulation of alternative polyadenylation, transcription termination, and the prevention of R-loop formation, thereby maintaining genome stability (Katahira2019Human; Katahira2013Human). The protein's interactions with other components of the mRNA processing machinery, such as CPSF100 and CFIm68, underscore its importance in cellular processes like stem cell maintenance and differentiation (Tran2014THOC5a; Katahira2013Human). Clinically, THOC5 is significant in hematopoiesis and is implicated in hematological disorders, including chronic myeloid leukemia, where its altered expression or function can lead to severe conditions (Mancini2010THOC5FMIP; Tran2013Transcriptional).

## Structure
The THOC5 protein is a component of the THO complex, which is part of the transcription/export (TREX) complex involved in mRNA processing and export. The human THOC5 protein consists of 683 amino acids and shares over 96% amino acid identity with its mouse counterpart (Tran2014THOC5a). The protein contains several functional domains, including a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a potential WW domain binding site for protein-protein interactions, a PEST domain for proteolytic degradation, and a leucine zipper (LZ) (Tran2014THOC5a).

In terms of secondary and tertiary structure, THOC5 forms part of a four-helix bundle through its tRWD-N domains, contributing to the dimerization of the THO complex (Pühringer2020Structure). The THOC5-THOC7 coiled coil structure is crucial for the dimerization and tetramerization of the THO-UAP56 complex, with the C-terminal ends of THOC5 and THOC7 forming a four-helix bundle (Pühringer2020Structure).

THOC5 undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites by various protein kinases in response to extracellular stimuli, which is essential for its role in mRNA export and signal transduction pathways related to cell proliferation and differentiation (Tran2014THOC5a). The phosphorylation of THOC5 by ATM kinase in response to DNA damage affects its mRNA-binding potential, although phosphorylation is not required for the dissociation of mRNAs from THOC5 after DNA damage (Ramachandran2011An).

## Function
THOC5, a component of the human THO complex, plays a critical role in mRNA processing and export, influencing several molecular processes essential for healthy cell function. It is involved in the regulation of alternative polyadenylation site choice by recruiting the mammalian cleavage factor I (CFIm68) to active genes, which affects the expression of mRNAs with different 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) (Katahira2013Human). This recruitment is crucial for the proper assembly of the cleavage and polyadenylation complex on pre-mRNA, ensuring efficient mRNA maturation and export (Katahira2013Human).

THOC5 also coordinates transcription termination and transcript release, particularly at the HSPA1A gene locus. It facilitates the processivity of termination factors like XRN2, aiding in the release of transcripts and preventing the formation of aberrant R-loops, which can disrupt transcription and genome stability (Katahira2019Human). In the absence of THOC5, there is an accumulation of mRNA at transcriptional foci, indicating its essential role in mRNA release and export (Katahira2019Human).

In terms of cellular outcomes, THOC5 is vital for the maintenance, differentiation, and proliferation of stem cells, and its depletion can lead to apoptosis and abnormal differentiation of hematopoietic cells (Li2019Colla).

## Clinical Significance
THOC5, a component of the mRNA export TREX complex, plays a critical role in hematopoiesis and is implicated in various hematological disorders. Alterations in THOC5 expression or function can lead to severe hematopoietic conditions. In mice, depletion of THOC5 results in rapid apoptosis of hematopoietic cells, leading to conditions such as anemia and leukocytopenia, and ultimately causing death within two weeks unless rescued by bone marrow transplantation (Mancini2010THOC5FMIP). This suggests that THOC5 is essential for the survival and proliferation of hematopoietic primitive cells (Mancini2010THOC5FMIP).

In the context of leukemia, THOC5 is highly phosphorylated in stem cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), indicating its potential involvement in leukemogenesis (Tran2013Transcriptional). The gene's role in mRNA processing and export is crucial for the expression of immediate-early genes, which are important for cell proliferation and differentiation. Disruptions in these processes can contribute to abnormal cell behavior and cancer development (Tran2013Transcriptional).

THOC5 is also being explored as a potential target for treating anemia in β-thalassemia patients, with studies suggesting that its pathway might be modulated to improve hematopoietic function (Li2019Colla).

## Interactions
THOC5, a component of the THO complex, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for mRNA processing and export. It interacts with CPSF100, a component of the 3' end-processing machinery, forming a complex that is essential for the 3' end-processing of immediate early genes (IEGs). This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments and is necessary for the recruitment of CPSF100 to the 3' UTR of THOC5 target genes (Tran2014THOC5a).

THOC5 also interacts with CFIm68, a component of the mammalian cleavage factor I (CFIm), which is involved in alternative polyadenylation site choice. This interaction influences the recruitment of CFIm68 to the 5' regions of genes, affecting the selection of polyadenylation sites and thus the length of 3' UTRs in mRNAs (Katahira2013Human).

In the context of DNA damage, THOC5's interaction with mRNAs is regulated by the ATM kinase pathway. DNA damage impairs the formation of THOC5/mRNA complexes, and this process is mediated by ATM kinase, which is necessary for inhibiting the export of THOC5-dependent mRNAs following DNA damage (Ramachandran2011An).

These interactions highlight THOC5's role in mRNA processing, export, and regulation under various cellular conditions.
