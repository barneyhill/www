# FANCC

## Overview
The FANCC gene encodes the FA complementation group C protein, a critical component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which is essential for DNA repair processes, particularly the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). The FA complementation group C protein is part of the FA core complex, functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that facilitates the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2/FANCI complex, a crucial step in the DNA repair mechanism (Palagyi2010Genetic; LopezMartinez2016Cellular). This protein is predominantly cytoplasmic and forms various complexes depending on its subcellular location, playing a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the repair of ICLs and protecting replication forks (Walden2014The; LopezMartinez2016Cellular). Mutations in the FANCC gene are associated with Fanconi anemia, a condition characterized by bone marrow failure and increased cancer risk, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Toksoy2020Clinical; Mamrak2017Recent).

## Structure
The FANCC protein is a component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair processes. It is a 558-amino acid protein with a predicted entirely helical structure, consisting of approximately 15% leucine residues (Walden2014The). Although detailed structural analysis is lacking, FANCC is reported to be predominantly cytoplasmic and forms various complexes depending on its subcellular location (Walden2014The). 

Recent studies using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and deep learning techniques have modeled the FANCC protein as part of the FA core complex. These studies suggest that FANCC comprises a single helical-repeat domain (Farrell2024Deep). The modeling process involved advanced computational techniques, including Monte Carlo simulated-annealing assembly and iterative refinement, which improved residue assignment within the complex (Farrell2024Deep). Despite these advancements, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of FANCC remain unreported (Farrell2024Deep).

FANCC is involved in forming a ternary complex with other FA proteins, such as FANCF, FANCE, and FANCD2, indicating its role in the quaternary structure of the FA core complex (Walden2014The). However, no specific domains, prominent folds, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms have been detailed in the available literature.

## Function
The FANCC gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which is essential for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). In healthy human cells, FANCC is part of the FA core complex, which includes other proteins such as FANCA, FANCB, and FANCL. This complex functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2/FANCI complex, a critical step in the DNA repair process (Palagyi2010Genetic; LopezMartinez2016Cellular).

FANCC plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the repair of ICLs, which can interfere with DNA replication and transcription. The FA core complex, including FANCC, is involved in the recruitment and activation of other DNA repair proteins, such as RAD51, at sites of DNA damage (Palagyi2010Genetic). This process is vital for protecting cells from chromosomal instability and ensuring proper cell division.

In addition to its role in DNA repair, FANCC is implicated in the protection and recovery of replication forks and the resolution of ultra-fine DNA bridges during mitosis, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic integrity in healthy cells (LopezMartinez2016Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FANCC gene are clinically significant due to their association with various diseases and conditions. FANCC mutations are responsible for 10-15% of Fanconi anemia (FA) cases globally, although this percentage can vary by population, such as 5% in Turkey and 63.6% in Brazil (Toksoy2020Clinical; Rodriguez2005Molecular). FA is characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital malformations, and an increased risk of cancers, including leukemia and squamous cell cancers (Toksoy2020Clinical; Mamrak2017Recent).

In breast carcinoma, alterations in FANCC, such as promoter methylation and deletions, are associated with reduced mRNA expression and poor patient survival. These alterations are linked to the pathogenesis of both early- and late-onset breast cancer, indicating a potential role in disease progression (Sinha2008Alterations). Heterozygous carriers of FANCC mutations, particularly relatives of FA patients, have an increased risk of breast cancer (Akbari2011Mutations).

FANCC mutations also contribute to genetic instability, leading to a predisposition to therapy-related myeloid neoplasms following cytotoxic treatments for primary malignancies (Voso2015Fanconi). These findings underscore the importance of FANCC in maintaining genomic stability and its role in various malignancies.

## Interactions
FANCC, a protein involved in the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, participates in several critical protein-protein interactions. It interacts with the dependence receptor uncoordinated-5A (UNC5A), a pro-apoptotic receptor, through the UNC5A intracellular domain, specifically its death domain. This interaction reduces UNC5A-mediated apoptosis, highlighting FANCC's role in modulating cell sensitivity to apoptosis (Huang2014The).

FANCC also interacts with other FA proteins, notably FANCE. This interaction is essential for the nuclear localization of FANCC, as FANCE is required for FANCC's nuclear import or retention. The FANCC Leu554Pro mutant fails to interact with FANCE, which affects FANCC's nuclear localization (Gordon2003Fanconi). FANCC and FANCE are mutually dependent for their stability in the nuclear compartment, indicating a reciprocal relationship (Léveillé2006The).

In addition to its interactions within the FA pathway, FANCC is involved in redox metabolism and interacts with proteins such as glutathione S-transferase π I (GSTπI) and NADPH cytochrome-P450 reductase (RED), which are crucial for attenuating redox activation and preventing apoptosis (Kaddar2012Fanconi). FANCC also interacts with the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), which is essential for cytokine-mediated signaling pathways (Kaddar2012Fanconi).
