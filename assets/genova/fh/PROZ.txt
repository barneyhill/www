# PROZ

## Overview
The PROZ gene encodes Protein Z, a vitamin K-dependent plasma glycoprotein that plays a significant role in the regulation of blood coagulation. Located on chromosome 13q34, the PROZ gene spans 15 kilobases and is organized into nine exons, including an alternative exon (Almawi2013Protein). Protein Z is primarily synthesized in the liver and secreted into the plasma, where it functions as a cofactor for the protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI). This interaction is crucial for the inhibition of activated factor X (FXa), thereby modulating thrombin generation and maintaining hemostatic balance (Almawi2013Protein; Bafunno2011The). Despite its structural similarity to other coagulation serine proteases, Protein Z lacks significant proteinase activity due to specific substitutions in its catalytic domain (Almawi2013Protein). Variants in the PROZ gene can affect the stability and function of the PROZ-ZPI complex, potentially leading to thrombotic disorders and other clinical conditions (Pinto2020Biallelic).

## Structure
Protein Z (PROZ) is a vitamin K-dependent plasma glycoprotein encoded by the PROZ gene, located on chromosome 13q34. The gene spans 15 kilobases and is organized into nine exons, including an alternative exon (Almawi2013Protein). Protein Z consists of 360 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 62 kDa. Its primary structure includes a gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain, which is crucial for phospholipid interaction and secretion (Almawi2013Protein).

The secondary structure of Protein Z features two epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains and a C-terminal pseudo-catalytic domain. Despite its structural similarity to other coagulation serine proteases, Protein Z lacks significant proteinase activity due to the substitution of key residues in the catalytic triad with alanine and threonine (Almawi2013Protein).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a three-dimensional shape, stabilized by disulfide bonds. Protein Z undergoes post-translational modifications, including gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, which are essential for its function (Almawi2013Protein).

Protein Z acts as a cofactor for the serpin ZPI, inhibiting factors Xa and XIa, thereby reducing thrombin generation (Han2000Characterization). The interaction with ZPI is crucial for its anticoagulant function, highlighting the importance of its structural domains in maintaining hemostatic balance.

## Function
Protein Z (PZ), encoded by the PROZ gene, is a vitamin K-dependent plasma glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the coagulation cascade. In healthy human cells, PZ acts as a cofactor for the protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI), which significantly enhances the inhibition of activated factor X (FXa) on phospholipid surfaces. This interaction is essential for controlling thrombin generation and maintaining hemostatic balance by preventing excessive clot formation (Almawi2013Protein; Bafunno2011The).

PZ is primarily synthesized in the liver and secreted into the plasma, where it forms a complex with ZPI. This complex is crucial in the early phases of coagulation, as it delays thrombin generation before the formation of the prothrombinase complex, thereby reducing the risk of thrombotic disorders (Bafunno2011The; Almawi2013Protein). The presence of phospholipids and calcium ions further enhances the inhibitory effect of the PZ-ZPI complex on FXa (KemkesMatthes2002Protein).

Despite its structural similarities to other vitamin K-dependent factors, PZ is not a zymogen of a serine protease due to differences in its catalytic domain, which underscores its unique role in the anticoagulant system (Bafunno2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PROZ gene, which encodes protein Z, have been associated with various thrombotic disorders and pregnancy complications. Biallelic variants in the PROZ gene can lead to hypercoagulability and livedo racemosa, conditions characterized by increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and skin manifestations, respectively. These variants can disrupt the PROZ-ZPI complex, crucial for regulating clotting, and are linked to decreased PROZ levels and increased Factor Xa levels, indicating a hypercoagulable state (Pinto2020Biallelic).

Protein Z deficiency, often due to genetic polymorphisms, is associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis, although studies show conflicting results regarding its significance. Some research suggests that low PZ levels are more common in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Bafunno2011The). Additionally, certain PROZ gene variants, such as G79A, have been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including recurrent miscarriage and pre-eclampsia, although findings are inconsistent (Almawi2013Protein).

In the context of cancer, PROZ has been identified as a potential protumorigenic factor, with its expression linked to tumor cell invasion and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (Neumann2012Methylome). These findings underscore the complex role of PROZ in coagulation and disease.

## Interactions
Protein Z (PROZ) is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood coagulation through its interaction with the protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI). This interaction is essential for the inhibition of factor Xa, a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade. Protein Z forms a calcium ion-dependent complex with factor Xa on phospholipid surfaces, which significantly enhances the inhibition of factor Xa by ZPI, thereby preventing excessive thrombin generation and maintaining a balanced coagulation cascade (Bafunno2011The; Almawi2013Protein).

The PROZ-ZPI complex is particularly important in the context of pregnancy, where it helps prevent thrombin generation in the early phases of coagulation, which is critical for maintaining proper blood flow (Almawi2013Protein). Variants in the PROZ gene can affect the stability and function of the PROZ-ZPI complex, potentially leading to hypercoagulability and associated conditions such as livedo racemosa (Pinto2020Biallelic). Structural modeling studies have shown that certain variants can destabilize the protein structure or affect protein loop positioning, impacting the interaction between PROZ and ZPI (Pinto2020Biallelic).
