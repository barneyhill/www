cells. This protein is the predominant aquaporin found in brain and has an important role in brain water homeostasis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. Additional isoforms, resulting from the use of alternative in-frame translation initiation codons, have also been described. Recent studies provided evidence for translational readthrough in this gene, and expression of C-terminally extended isoforms via the use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon.
