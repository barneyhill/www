# FCRLA

## Overview
FCRLA (Fc receptor-like A) is a gene that encodes an intracellular protein primarily expressed in B cells, where it is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Unlike other members of the Fc receptor family, which typically function as cell surface receptors, the FCRLA protein does not have a transmembrane domain and is not glycosylated, indicating its role as an intracellular protein. It is thought to function as a chaperone-like protein, assisting in the folding and assembly of immunoglobulins, including IgM, IgG, and IgA, within the ER. The protein is characterized by its unique structure, comprising four domains, including a mucin-like C-terminal domain that may facilitate oligomerization. FCRLA's expression and function have been implicated in various immune-related conditions, such as autoimmune diseases and infections, highlighting its potential significance in immune regulation (Davis2007Fc; Kulemzin2013Characterization; Reshetnikova2012Differential).

## Structure
The FCRLA protein is a B cell-specific protein that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is part of the Fc receptor (FcR) family. It is composed of four domains: the N-terminal domain (D1), which is a truncated homologue of classical FcRs' N-terminal domains; the second (D2) and third (D3) domains, which have high sequence similarity with the extracellular domains of FcgRI; and an unusual C-terminal domain enriched with proline, serine, and threonine residues, making it mucin-like (Volkova2007Generation; Kulemzin2013Characterization). The N-terminal domain is responsible for the intracellular retention of FCRLA (Kulemzin2013Characterization).

FCRLA lacks predicted N-linked glycosylation sites and does not have a transmembrane domain, indicating its role as an intracellular protein rather than a plasma membrane protein (Reshetnikova2012Differential). The protein is retained in the ER and does not transit to the Golgi apparatus (Reshetnikova2012Differential). Alternative splicing results in different isoforms, including those with short and long signal peptides, which affect the protein's processing and secretion (Kulemzin2013Characterization). The major human FCRLA isoform is encoded by five exons, with variations in signal peptide length influencing the intracellular retention and secretion of the isoforms (Kulemzin2013Characterization).

## Function
FCRLA (Fc receptor-like A) is an intracellular protein primarily expressed in B cells, where it resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Kulemzin2013Characterization). Unlike other members of the Fc receptor family, FCRLA does not function as a cell surface receptor but is thought to play a role in the folding and assembly of immunoglobulins, acting potentially as a chaperone-like protein (Kulemzin2013Characterization). It interacts with multiple isotypes of intracellular immunoglobulins, including IgM, IgG, and IgA, suggesting its involvement in immunoglobulin maturation and/or secretion (Kulemzin2013Characterization).

FCRLA is composed of four domains, with the N-terminal domain responsible for its retention in the ER (Kulemzin2013Characterization). The protein's unique structure includes a leucine-rich, mucin-like carboxy-terminal region, which may allow for homo- or heterooligomerization, as suggested by evidence of FCRLA multimerization in immunoprecipitates (Davis2007Fc). This structural feature might facilitate its role in intracellular processes within B cells, particularly related to its localization in the ER (Reshetnikova2012Differential). The exact function of FCRLA remains unclear, but its expression pattern and interactions indicate a significant role in B cell biology and immune response regulation (Kulemzin2013Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
FCRLA (Fc receptor-like A) has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in immune regulation. Alterations in the expression of FCRLA have been associated with autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In RA, FCRLA is both upregulated and hypomethylated, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Zhang2017Identification). This gene's expression is also linked to the severity of mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) in children. In severe cases of MPP, alternative splicing events in FCRLA lead to down-regulated expression, indicating a potential role in disease progression (Wang2017Transcriptome).

FCRLA's expression is influenced by genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FCGR2C region, which are associated with altered expression levels of FCRLA. These genetic variations may affect immune responses and have been studied in the context of HIV-1 vaccine efficacy (Peng2016FCGR2C; Geraghty2019Effect). Despite these associations, the precise clinical significance of FCRLA mutations or expression alterations remains to be fully elucidated, and further research is needed to understand its role in immune-related diseases.

## Interactions
FCRLA (Fc receptor-like A) is known to interact with multiple immunoglobulin isotypes, including IgM, IgG, and IgA, suggesting a potential chaperone-like role in immunoglobulin maturation or secretion. This interaction is facilitated by FCRLA's retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it may assist in the assembly or processing of these immunoglobulins (Kulemzin2013Characterization). The protein's unique N-terminal domain, which is a truncated homologue of classical Fc receptor N-terminal domains, is responsible for its intracellular retention, distinguishing it from other Fc receptors that are typically cell surface receptors (Kulemzin2013Characterization).

FCRLA is also characterized by its ability to form multimers, as evidenced by immunoprecipitates from COS cell transfectants showing multiple high-molecular-weight bands that dissociate under reducing conditions. This suggests the formation of interchain disulfide bonds, indicating potential homo- or heterooligomerization (Davis2007Fc). Despite its intracellular localization, there is unpublished evidence suggesting the secretion of at least one splice variant of FCRLA in humans, although the specific interactions of this secreted form remain unclear (Davis2007Fc).
