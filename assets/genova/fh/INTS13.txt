# INTS13

## Overview
The INTS13 gene encodes the integrator complex subunit 13, a protein that plays a critical role in the Integrator complex, which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of ciliary genes and RNA processing. The protein is characterized by its involvement in forming a heterodimer with INTS14 and a heterotrimer with INTS10, contributing to the structural and functional integrity of the Integrator complex. This complex is essential for the proper assembly and function of primary cilia, cellular organelles that are crucial for various signaling pathways. INTS13 is predominantly localized in the nucleus and is vital for maintaining the expression levels of genes necessary for cilium formation. Mutations in the INTS13 gene can lead to ciliopathies, such as oral-facial-digital syndrome type 2, by disrupting the assembly of the Integrator complex and affecting ciliary gene regulation (Mascibroda2022INTS13; Mascibroda2020INTS13Mutations).

## Structure
The INTS13 protein is a component of the Integrator complex and forms a heterodimer with INTS14. This complex is characterized by a pseudo-symmetric structure, with both proteins featuring an N-terminal von Willebrand type A like domain (VWA), a central β-barrel domain, and a C-terminal α-helical domain. These domains are connected by a long linker that lacks secondary structure elements (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14). The β-barrel domains are a major contact point, forming around a rotational pseudosymmetry axis, while the α-helical C-termini contribute to binding by packing against the β-barrel of INTS13 or the VWA domain of INTS14 (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14).

The INTS13-INTS14 complex also forms a stable trimeric complex with INTS10, with the VWA domain of INTS14 serving as the main interaction surface for INTS10 (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14). The C-terminal region of INTS13 is crucial for its interaction with the Integrator Cleavage Module, particularly involving subunits INTS4, INTS9, and INTS11 (Mascibroda2022INTS13). Mutations in the C-terminus can disrupt these interactions, affecting the assembly of the Integrator complex (Mascibroda2022INTS13). The structure of the INTS13 C-terminus was not visualized by crystallography, limiting detailed understanding of its folding or binding (Mascibroda2022INTS13).

## Function
The human gene INTS13 encodes a subunit of the Integrator complex, which is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of ciliary genes and ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation. INTS13 is predominantly localized in the nucleus and is involved in RNA processing and transcriptional regulation through its role in the Integrator complex (Mascibroda2022INTS13). It forms a heterotrimer with INTS10 and INTS14, which is essential for the proper assembly of the Integrator complex and its interaction with the Integrator Cleavage Module (ICM) (Mascibroda2022INTS13).

In healthy human cells, INTS13 is vital for maintaining the proper expression levels of genes necessary for cilium formation. Its depletion leads to a significant reduction in the number of properly assembled primary cilia and causes dysregulation of a broad collection of ciliary genes (Mascibroda2022INTS13; Mascibroda2020INTS13Mutations). This indicates that INTS13 normally represses genes involved in cilium biogenesis, ensuring the correct balance of ciliary gene expression (Mascibroda2020INTS13Mutations). Mutations in INTS13 can disrupt the assembly of the Integrator complex, leading to ciliopathies, which are disorders characterized by defects in cilia formation and function (Mascibroda2022INTS13).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the INTS13 gene are associated with developmental ciliopathies, particularly a form of oral-facial-digital syndrome type 2 (OFD2), also known as Mohr Syndrome. These mutations disrupt the assembly of the Integrator complex, leading to defects in ciliogenesis. Two distinct germline mutations in INTS13 have been identified in families with OFD2, which interfere with the interaction between the C-terminus of INTS13 and the Integrator cleavage module. This disruption results in reduced primary cilia and transcriptional dysregulation of ciliary genes, contributing to the clinical manifestations of the syndrome (Mascibroda2020INTS13Mutations).

In human retinal pigment epithelial cells, knockdown of INTS13 leads to disrupted ciliogenesis and deregulation of ciliary genes, with significant transcriptional changes observed. This suggests that INTS13 is crucial for proper ciliogenesis and transcriptional regulation of ciliary genes (Mascibroda2020INTS13Mutations).

Clinically, individuals with INTS13 mutations may experience recurrent respiratory tract infections and chronic cough due to disrupted cilia formation and function. These mutations can lead to significant clinical symptoms related to respiratory health (Mascibroda2020INTS13Mutations).

## Interactions
INTS13 is a component of the Integrator complex, which is involved in the processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and transcription regulation. It forms a stable complex with INTS14 and INTS10, creating a functional module within the Integrator complex. The INTS13-INTS14 complex is a strongly intertwined heterodimer, requiring multiple mutations to disrupt their interaction. This complex also forms a stable module with INTS10, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a high-affinity interaction (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14).

The INTS13-INTS14-INTS10 complex binds nucleic acids, with a preference for stem-loop RNAs, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and fluorescence polarization experiments (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14). INTS13 directly binds to the cleavage module of the Integrator complex, which consists of INTS4, INTS9, and INTS11, through its C-terminal motif. This interaction is crucial for snRNA processing and is required for spermatogenesis (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14).

INTS13 also interacts with the NELF complex, as part of an RNAPII complex on the gene, through protein-protein interactions independent of RNA and DNA (Stadelmayer2014Integrator). These interactions highlight the role of INTS13 in nucleic acid binding and complex formation within the Integrator complex.
