# SPINK14

## Overview
SPINK14 is a gene that encodes a putative serine peptidase inhibitor, classified within the Kazal-type family of inhibitors. This protein is thought to play a role in regulating protease activity, which is crucial for maintaining various physiological processes, including immune response and tissue homeostasis. Although the precise biological functions of the SPINK14-encoded protein remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in protease inhibition suggests potential implications in pathological conditions such as cancer and immune system disorders. Research has highlighted its possible role in gastric cancer pathogenesis and immune response modulation, indicating that SPINK14 may influence susceptibility to infections and other diseases (GinerDelgado2019Evolutionary; Esser2017Interpreting).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
SPINK14, a gene encoding a putative serine peptidase inhibitor, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in protease regulation. In the context of gastric cancer, somatic inversions affecting SPINK14 have been identified in both microsatellite instability (MSI) and microsatellite stable (MSS) tumor samples. These structural variations suggest a potential role for SPINK14 in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer, although the specific clinical significance of these alterations remains unclear (Esser2017Interpreting).

In evolutionary studies, a notable inversion, HsInv0201, associated with SPINK14, has been linked to immune response modulation. This inversion, which deletes an exon of SPINK14, is associated with lower expression of SPINK6 during immune responses to Salmonella infection. This suggests that SPINK14 may play a role in immune system regulation, potentially affecting susceptibility to infections (GinerDelgado2019Evolutionary).

In mouse models, SPINK14 has been validated for differential expression in the epididymis of Plag1-deficient mice, indicating its involvement in sperm maturation and extracellular matrix maintenance. However, the direct clinical implications of SPINK14 expression changes in this context are not fully understood (wong2020unravelling; Wong2020Transcriptome).
