# OR14C36

## Overview
The OR14C36 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 14 subfamily C member 36, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell (Mariman2015Olfactory). The OR14C36 protein is specifically implicated in the recognition and transduction of odorant signals, contributing to the diversity and specificity of olfactory perception. Variations in the OR14C36 gene have been linked to phenotypic differences in olfactory sensitivity and eating behaviors, highlighting its potential impact on both sensory and metabolic processes (Markt2016Sniffing; Lee2018Therapeutic).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The OR14C36 gene has been associated with extreme obesity, with genetic variations in this gene showing a significant difference in allele frequency compared to control populations. These variations may contribute to a genetic predisposition to extreme obesity, potentially through altered eating behaviors and an altered sense of smell (Mariman2015Olfactory). The gene is located on chromosome 1q44, and its association with obesity is thought to involve cooperation with protocadherin (PCDH) genes, particularly those in the PCDH beta-cluster, which are linked to tissue development and neuronal connectivity (Mariman2015Olfactory).

In addition to its role in obesity, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in OR14C36, rs28545014, has been associated with asparagus anosmia, a condition characterized by the inability to detect the odor of asparagus in urine. This SNP is classified as 'probably damaging', indicating a high likelihood of affecting protein function or structure (Markt2016Sniffing). The potential impact of OR14C36 on olfactory perception and its broader implications for eating behavior and obesity warrant further investigation (Lee2018Therapeutic).
