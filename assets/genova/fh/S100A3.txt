# S100A3

## Overview
S100A3 is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein A3, a member of the S100 protein family characterized by its EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. This protein is predominantly expressed in hair cuticular cells and plays a crucial role in calcium-dependent processes essential for hair structure and integrity. S100A3 is unique within its family due to its high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bridges critical for its stability and function. These structural features enable S100A3 to effectively bind calcium and zinc ions, which are vital for its role in cellular processes, including the formation of the cornified envelope in hair cuticles. Additionally, S100A3 interacts with nuclear receptors such as retinoic acid receptors, influencing their stability and activity, which has implications in cancer cell proliferation and differentiation (Gianni2018S100A3; Kizawa2011S100).

## Structure
The S100A3 protein is a member of the S100 protein family, characterized by its EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. Its primary structure consists of 101 amino acids, including a high cysteine content with 10 cysteine residues, which is unique within the S100 family (Kizawa2011S100). The secondary structure of S100A3 includes alpha helices typical of EF-hand proteins, forming a compact calcium-binding domain (Mittl2002Metalfree). 

In terms of tertiary structure, S100A3 has a unique Zn2+ binding site composed of three cysteine residues and one histidine, which is conserved across most orthologs (Kizawa2011S100). The protein also contains two disulfide bridges: SS1, connecting the two EF-hand motifs, and SS2, linking the C-terminal tail domain to helix IV. These disulfide bridges are crucial for the protein's conformation and metal ion binding properties (Kizawa2011S100).

S100A3 can form homodimers and, under certain conditions, assemble into homotetramers. This tetramerization is facilitated by the post-translational modification of citrullination at Arg-51, which reduces electrostatic repulsion and allows dimer-dimer interactions (Kizawa2008Specific). The protein's ability to form tetramers is influenced by the presence of Ca2+ ions, which induce conformational changes necessary for its function (Kizawa2008Specific).

## Function
The S100A3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the S100 family, known for its calcium-binding properties. S100A3 is primarily expressed in hair cuticular cells and plays a significant role in the calcium-dependent processes essential for hair structure and integrity. It is involved in the formation of the cornified envelope in hair cuticles, a process crucial for hair shaft formation and keratinization (Kizawa2011S100).

S100A3 is characterized by its unique structural features, including a high cysteine content that facilitates the formation of disulfide bridges, which are critical for its function and stability. These disulfide bridges enable S100A3 to bind calcium ions effectively, which is necessary for its role in cellular processes (Kizawa2011S100). The protein also has a high affinity for zinc ions, with a unique binding site that is conserved among S100A3 orthologs (Kizawa2011S100).

In the cellular context, S100A3 undergoes post-translational modifications such as citrullination, which enhances its calcium-binding properties and facilitates its assembly into tetramers. This tetramerization is specific to S100A3 and is crucial for its function in hair cuticle cells, where it modulates the activity of calcium-dependent enzymes like peptidylarginine deiminase 3 (PAD3) (Kizawa2011S100).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the S100A3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of atypical pulmonary fibrosis, mutations in S100A3, along with S100A13, have been associated with a unique form of lung fibrosis. This condition is characterized by specific radiological and histological features, and the mutations lead to reduced protein and mRNA levels, potentially impacting calcium signaling pathways. The S100A3 mutation introduces an additional cysteine residue, which may affect the protein's function due to its location in a calcium-binding motif. This mutation alone is not sufficient to cause the disease, suggesting a digenic inheritance pattern where both S100A3 and S100A13 mutations are necessary for the disease phenotype (AlMutairy2019An).

In cancer, S100A3 has been shown to interact with RARα and PML-RARα, influencing their stability and activity. This interaction affects the cellular response to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a compound used in cancer treatment. In breast and lung cancer cells, S100A3 knockdown reduces the response to ATRA's anti-proliferative effects, while in acute myeloid leukemia cells, it enhances ATRA's effects. These findings suggest that S100A3 plays a significant role in modulating the therapeutic efficacy of ATRA in different cancer types (Gianni2018S100A3).

## Interactions
S100A3 is a calcium-binding protein that interacts with retinoic acid receptors, particularly RARα (retinoic acid receptor alpha). This interaction is diminished by the presence of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). S100A3, along with other proteins like FABP5 and HSPB1, predominantly interacts with unliganded RARα in the nucleus of various cancer cell lines, including breast cancer (SK-BR-3, MCF-7), lung cancer (A-549), and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells (Gianni2018S100A3). S100A3 also interacts with PML-RARα and RARγ, but not with RARβ or RXRα, indicating specificity in its interactions (Gianni2018S100A3).

S100A3 affects the stability and activity of RARα and PML-RARα by reducing their proteasome-dependent degradation and inhibiting their ATRA-dependent transcriptional activity. This interaction involves the H12-helix in the ligand-binding domain of RARα, with the I396 residue being crucial for binding (Gianni2018S100A3). S100A3 competes with the N-CoR co-repressor for binding to RARα, suggesting it may act as a nuclear-receptor co-repressor (Gianni2018S100A3). These interactions play a significant role in modulating the cellular response to ATRA, affecting cancer cell proliferation and differentiation (Gianni2018S100A3).
