# DUSP10

## Overview
DUSP10, also known as dual specificity phosphatase 10 or MKP-5, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the dual-specificity phosphatase family. This family of proteins is characterized by their ability to dephosphorylate both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues, which is crucial for the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. The DUSP10 protein specifically targets stress-activated kinases such as p38 and JNK, playing a vital role in modulating cellular responses to stress and inflammation (Bermudez2010The; Lang2019DualSpecificity). It is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it exerts its regulatory functions. DUSP10 is involved in various physiological processes, including immune response modulation and cellular homeostasis, and has been implicated in several pathological conditions, particularly in cancer, where its expression levels are often altered (Xiao2023DUSP10; JiménezMartínez2019The).

## Function
DUSP10, also known as MKP-5, is a dual-specificity phosphatase that plays a significant role in regulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, particularly by dephosphorylating stress-activated protein kinases such as p38 and JNK. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and modulating immune responses (Bermudez2010The; Lang2019DualSpecificity). DUSP10 is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it selectively inactivates p38 MAPK, but not ERK1/2, due to its specific N-terminal MAPK-binding domain (Lang2019DualSpecificity).

In the immune system, DUSP10 modulates the balance of immune responses by controlling the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In macrophages, DUSP10 limits the production of type I interferons and other cytokines, thereby preventing excessive inflammation and ensuring a balanced immune response (Bermudez2010The; Lang2019DualSpecificity). DUSP10 also plays a protective role in conditions such as sepsis-induced lung injury and LPS-induced vascular injury by regulating reactive oxygen species production (Lang2019DualSpecificity).

Overall, DUSP10 is essential for fine-tuning MAPK signaling, which is vital for various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and stress responses, thereby contributing to the organism's overall immune regulation and cellular homeostasis (PérezSen2019DualSpecificity).

## Clinical Significance
DUSP10 has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In cancer, DUSP10 expression is generally higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting a potential pro-tumorigenic role. It is notably overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic melanoma, and breast cancer (JiménezMartínez2019The). In colorectal cancer, DUSP10 promotes cell proliferation and its high nuclear expression correlates with poor prognosis (JiménezMartínez2019DUSP10). 

In lower-grade glioma (LGG), DUSP10 is identified as an independent prognostic indicator, with high expression associated with poorer prognosis and increased tumor mutation burden (Xiao2023DUSP10). Its expression is linked to immune regulation, correlating with immune checkpoint genes and influencing responses to immunotherapy (Xiao2023DUSP10). 

In glioma, DUSP10 upregulation is associated with poor overall survival and is linked to DNA demethylation and immune-related pathways (Zhou2023DUSP10). These findings suggest that DUSP10 could serve as a predictive biomarker and potential therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
DUSP10, also known as MKP-5, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function and stability. It interacts with the p38 MAP kinase, where it dephosphorylates and inactivates p38, a process crucial for regulating cellular responses to stress and inflammation (Hrstka2015AGR2; Jeong2014The). DUSP10 also interacts with the mTORC2 complex through its binding with the Rictor component. This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of DUSP10 at serines 224 and 230, which stabilizes the protein and enhances its ability to dephosphorylate p38 MAPK (BenavidesSerrato2014mTORC2).

In immune signaling, DUSP10 interacts with IRF-3, a non-MAPK substrate, suggesting a role in regulating immune responses. This interaction is particularly noted in macrophages stimulated with TLR4 and TLR9 ligands or infected with Listeria monocytogenes (Lang2019DualSpecificity). DUSP10 also plays a role in the IL-33 signaling pathway, affecting cytokine production by interacting with components of this pathway (Lang2019DualSpecificity). These interactions highlight DUSP10's role in modulating various signaling pathways, impacting immune responses and cellular stress mechanisms.
