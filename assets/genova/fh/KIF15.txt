# KIF15

## Overview
KIF15 is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin family member 15, a motor protein belonging to the kinesin-12 family. This protein plays a pivotal role in mitotic spindle dynamics, essential for proper chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division. Kinesin family member 15 is characterized by its ability to crosslink and slide microtubules, counteracting the forces generated by other motor proteins such as Kinesin-5 (Eg5) (Reinemann2017Collective; Drechsler2016Kinesin12). The protein's structure includes a motor domain responsible for ATP binding and microtubule interaction, and it can form both dimeric and tetrameric structures, which are crucial for its function in spindle assembly (Klejnot2013The; Milic2018KIF15). KIF15's activity is modulated through interactions with other proteins, such as TPX2 and kinesin-binding protein (KBP), which regulate its microtubule binding and motility (Malaby2019Kinesinbinding; Drechsler2014The). The gene's expression is implicated in various cancers, where it influences cell proliferation and survival, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Ding2020KIF15; Mi2022Integrative).

## Structure
The KIF15 protein is a kinesin motor protein involved in mitotic spindle dynamics. It consists of 1388 amino acid residues, featuring an N-terminal motor domain spanning residues 19-375, which is responsible for ATP binding and microtubule interaction (Klejnot2013The). This motor domain exhibits the typical kinesin fold, characterized by an eight-stranded β-sheet surrounded by three major α-helices on each side (Klejnot2013The). The motor domain is in an 'ATP-like' conformation with Mg2+-ADP bound in the catalytic site, and the neck linker is docked to the catalytic core, forming a small β-sheet (Klejnot2013The).

KIF15 lacks a conventional C-terminal globular domain and instead features a C-terminal leucine zipper, a common dimerization motif, which facilitates its quaternary structure as a tetramer (Drechsler2014The; Klejnot2013The). The protein also contains a long helical rod-shaped stalk predicted to form an interrupted coiled coil, and a putative myosin tail homology domain that enables co-localization with actin (Klejnot2013The). KIF15 can exist in both dimeric and tetrameric forms, depending on the ionic strength of the environment (Milic2018KIF15). The tetrameric structure allows KIF15 to cross-link microtubules and switch tracks at intersections, contributing to its role in spindle assembly and dynamics (Drechsler2014The).

## Function
KIF15, a kinesin-12 family member, plays a crucial role in mitotic spindle assembly and maintenance during cell division. It functions by crosslinking and sliding microtubules, which is essential for proper chromosome alignment and segregation. KIF15 is particularly active during mitosis, where it localizes to kinetochore fibers and spindle microtubules, generating forces that counteract those produced by Kinesin-5 (Eg5) (Reinemann2017Collective; Drechsler2016Kinesin12).

KIF15 is capable of forming dynamic cross-links between microtubules, which can become static when complexed with TPX2, allowing it to sustain higher loads and resist microtubule sliding within the spindle (Drechsler2014The). This motor protein is adapted to operate on parallel microtubule substrates, distinguishing it from Eg5, which primarily drives the sliding of antiparallel microtubules (Drechsler2016Kinesin12).

KIF15 also plays a role in suppressing microtubule catastrophes at polymerizing plus-ends, stabilizing microtubule growth and maintaining spindle bipolarity, especially when Eg5 activity is compromised (Tanenbaum2009Kif15; Drechsler2016Kinesin12). This ability to compensate for Eg5 inhibition highlights its importance in ensuring accurate cell division and maintaining organismal growth and tissue integrity (Tanenbaum2009Kif15).

## Clinical Significance
KIF15 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell division and proliferation. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), high KIF15 expression is associated with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis, making it a potential prognostic biomarker (Mi2022Integrative). KIF15 expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration, affecting survival outcomes in several cancer types (Mi2022Integrative).

In pancreatic cancer, KIF15 promotes cell proliferation by facilitating the G1/S phase transition and activating the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. Its overexpression correlates with poor patient prognosis and higher histologic grades (Quan2023KIF15; Wang2017KIF15). Similarly, in gastric cancer, KIF15 enhances cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis, with high expression levels predicting poor prognosis (Ding2020KIF15).

In lung adenocarcinoma, KIF15 is significantly upregulated and associated with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis. Knockdown of KIF15 in these cells induces cell cycle arrest and inhibits growth (Qiao2018Increased). In prostate cancer, KIF15 expression is linked to poorer disease-free survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Qureshi2021Kinesin). Overall, KIF15's altered expression and interactions contribute to cancer progression, making it a significant focus for cancer research.

## Interactions
KIF15 interacts with several proteins that influence its function during mitosis. One significant interaction is with the kinesin-binding protein (KBP), which modulates KIF15's activity by inhibiting its microtubule binding. This interaction is crucial for maintaining proper spindle function and chromosome alignment during mitosis. KBP binds to the motor domains of KIF15, preventing their interaction with microtubules, and thus acts as a buffer to regulate KIF15's activity (Malaby2019Kinesinbinding).

KIF15 also forms a complex with the microtubule-associated protein TPX2. This interaction is significant as TPX2 inhibits the stepping of KIF15 on microtubules, suggesting a regulatory mechanism within the spindle apparatus. TPX2 enhances KIF15's affinity for microtubules in the presence of AMP-PNP and reduces its motility, affecting both directional and diffusive movements (Drechsler2014The).

Additionally, KIF15 interacts with the protein Ki67, which, along with KBP, is essential for the assembly and stability of kinetochore fibers (K-fibers) during mitosis. This interaction is crucial for proper chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate (Brouwers2017Role).
