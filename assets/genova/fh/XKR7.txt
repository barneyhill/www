# XKR7

## Overview
XKR7 is a gene that encodes the protein XK related 7, which is a member of the XK-related protein family. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a crucial role in the regulation of cell membrane dynamics, particularly in the processes of apoptosis and phospholipid distribution. The XKR7 gene is located on chromosome 5 and has been studied for its potential involvement in various neurological disorders and cancers. Notably, a missense mutation in XKR7 has been associated with Moyamoya angiopathy, a condition affecting cerebral arteries (Harris2023Whole). Despite its clinical significance, the precise biological functions and mechanisms of XKR7 remain an active area of research, with ongoing studies aimed at elucidating its role in health and disease.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The XKR7 gene has been implicated in Moyamoya angiopathy, a condition characterized by progressive stenosis of the cerebral arteries, leading to the development of collateral vessels. A specific missense mutation in XKR7, involving a G to A change at position 5:5037801, has been associated with this condition. This mutation occurs with a frequency of 0.0119, although the precise mechanism by which it contributes to Moyamoya angiopathy is not fully understood (Harris2023Whole).

Alterations in the expression or function of XKR7 may also be linked to other neurological disorders and cancers, as changes in its normal interactions can impact cell apoptosis and membrane phospholipid distribution. However, detailed studies on these associations are limited, and further research is needed to elucidate the full clinical significance of XKR7 mutations and expression changes. The gene's role in cell membrane dynamics suggests that disruptions could potentially contribute to disease pathogenesis, although specific conditions beyond Moyamoya angiopathy have not been extensively documented in the available literature.
