# KIAA0232

## Overview
KIAA0232 is a human gene that encodes a nuclear phosphoserine protein involved in gene expression and cell signaling. The protein encoded by KIAA0232 plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including epigenetic regulation and metabolic pathways. It has been identified as a causal gene in coronary artery disease, particularly in East Asian populations, and is associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The gene's involvement in these diseases highlights its potential as a genetic biomarker for early detection and prognosis. Additionally, KIAA0232 has been studied in the context of ciliochoroidal melanoma, although its specific role in this cancer type remains to be fully elucidated (CalderonMartinez2024Assessment; Jaros2024Integrative; McCannel2011Genomic).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
KIAA0232 has been implicated in several diseases due to its genetic mutations and alterations in expression levels. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), mutations in KIAA0232 are associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. The study highlights the adverse impact of diabetes mellitus and PAAD linked to single nucleotide polymorphisms in this gene, suggesting its potential role as a genetic biomarker for early detection and prognosis in these patients (CalderonMartinez2024Assessment).

In the context of coronary artery disease (CAD), KIAA0232 is identified as a causal gene in East Asian populations. It encodes a nuclear phosphoserine protein involved in gene expression and cell signaling, which may contribute to the development of CAD. The gene's involvement in epigenetic processes underscores its potential role in the disease's progression, particularly in relation to metabolic disturbances and immune system interactions (Jaros2024Integrative).

KIAA0232 is also mentioned in studies on ciliochoroidal melanoma, where it is subject to amplification. However, the specific clinical significance of this gene in melanoma remains unclear, as the study primarily focuses on other genomic aberrations associated with cancer progression (McCannel2011Genomic).
