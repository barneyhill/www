# B9D2

## Overview
B9D2 is a gene that encodes the protein B9 domain containing 2, which is integral to the process of ciliogenesis, the formation of cilia. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that play a crucial role in cellular signaling and function. The B9 domain containing 2 protein is categorized as a component of the ciliary transport system, interacting with various proteins involved in intraflagellar transport (IFT), such as IFT88 and Nephrocystin proteins. These interactions are essential for the transport of specific ciliary cargos, including opsins, which are vital for photoreceptor cell function (Zhao2011Nephrocystins). Mutations in the B9D2 gene have been linked to ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome and Meckel syndrome, highlighting its significance in maintaining ciliary structure and function (Bachmann-Gagescu2015Joubert; Hopp2011B9D1).

## Structure


## Function
The B9D2 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, which is essential for proper cellular function and signaling. B9D2 is involved in ciliary transport by interacting with components of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) particle, such as IFT88, and the Nephrocystin protein Inversin. This interaction is crucial for the transport of specific ciliary cargos, including opsins, which are important for photoreceptor cell function (Zhao2011Nephrocystins).

B9D2 is localized to the ciliary shaft and is part of a complex with other B9 domain proteins, including MKS1, which are involved in multiple interactions with the IFT particle. This localization and interaction suggest that B9D2 may function on the 'cargo side' of IFT transport, aiding in cargo interaction with the IFT particle, or on the 'motor side,' affecting kinesin function (Zhao2011Nephrocystins).

In zebrafish models, B9D2 knockdown affects opsin localization in photoreceptor cells, and a double knockdown with Fleer results in ciliary shortening, indicating its role in maintaining ciliary structure and function (Zhao2011Nephrocystins). B9D2's involvement in ciliary transport is essential for maintaining healthy cellular processes and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the B9D2 gene are associated with Joubert syndrome (JS) and Meckel syndrome, both of which are ciliopathies characterized by developmental abnormalities and neurological issues. Joubert syndrome is a recessive neurodevelopmental disorder marked by hypotonia, ataxia, cognitive impairment, and distinctive midhindbrain malformations. The genetic analysis of JS has identified mutations in B9D2 as a cause in some families, highlighting the gene's role in the disorder's extreme genetic heterogeneity (Bachmann-Gagescu2015Joubert). B9D2 is part of a transition zone subcomplex with MKS1 and B9D1, which regulates protein trafficking in and out of the cilium, suggesting its involvement in ciliary function (Bachmann-Gagescu2015Joubert).

In Meckel syndrome, a severe autosomal recessive disorder, B9D2 mutations are implicated in the dysfunction of primary cilia, contributing to the syndrome's phenotypic manifestations (Hopp2011B9D1). The gene's role in cilia stability and formation is crucial, as defects in these processes are linked to the clinical features of ciliopathies (Hopp2011B9D1). Additionally, copy number variations in B9D2 have been studied in the context of autoimmune thyroid disease, although no direct association with the disease was established (Guan2019The).

## Interactions
B9D2 is involved in several key protein interactions, particularly in the context of ciliogenesis. It binds with the IFT particle component Fleer, an interaction crucial for ciliary function, as demonstrated by knockdown experiments in zebrafish that result in shortened cilia when both b9d2 and fleer are knocked down (Zhao2011Nephrocystins). B9D2 also interacts with Nephrocystin 2, also known as Inversin, through the N-terminal ankyrin repeat region of Inversin and the C-terminal region of B9D2. This interaction is essential for localizing Inversin to the ciliary compartment (Zhao2011Nephrocystins).

B9D2 forms a complex with Inversin and Fleer, suggesting a role in ciliary transport by mediating the binding of Inversin to Fleer (Zhao2011Nephrocystins). It also interacts with IFT88, another component of the IFT particle, indicating its involvement in the transport of ciliary cargos (Zhao2011Nephrocystins). B9D2's interactions with these proteins suggest it plays a significant role in the transport of ciliary proteins, potentially affecting both the cargo and motor sides of intraflagellar transport (Zhao2011Nephrocystins).
