# H3C3

## Overview
The H3C3 gene encodes a variant of the histone H3 protein, which is a fundamental component of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. Histone H3 proteins, including those produced by H3C3, are crucial for the formation of nucleosomes, the structural units that compact DNA into chromatin, thereby regulating DNA accessibility for transcription, replication, and repair processes (Zhang2023Exploring). The protein encoded by H3C3 is involved in maintaining chromatin integrity and is actively incorporated into chromatin regions undergoing transcription and in heterochromatic regions such as telomeres (Zhang2023Exploring). Dysregulation of H3C3, particularly through mutations like H3K27M, has been linked to various cancers, including pediatric high-grade gliomas, where it disrupts normal chromatin modification processes and contributes to oncogenesis (Harutyunyan2019H3K27M; Huchedé2022The).

## Function
The H3C3 gene encodes a histone protein that is part of the histone H3 family, which plays a critical role in the structure and function of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. Histone H3 proteins, including those encoded by H3C3, are integral to the formation of nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin, which package DNA into a compact, organized structure. This compaction is essential for regulating access to DNA during processes such as transcription, replication, and repair (Zhang2023Exploring).

In healthy human cells, histone H3 variants, such as those encoded by H3C3, are involved in maintaining chromatin structure and regulating gene expression. These proteins are incorporated into chromatin throughout the cell cycle, particularly in regions undergoing active transcription and in constitutively heterochromatic regions like telomeres. This suggests that H3C3 plays a crucial role in maintaining chromatin integrity and facilitating proper gene expression (Zhang2023Exploring).

The regulation of histone H3 expression is also influenced by intracellular signaling pathways, such as the calcineurin/NFATc1 pathway, which modulates histone gene transcription in response to calcium levels. This regulation is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing cytotoxic effects associated with excessive histone expression (Sato2024CalcineurinNFATc1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the H3C3 gene, which encodes a histone protein involved in chromatin structure and gene regulation, have been implicated in various cancers, including pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs). Specifically, the H3K27M mutation in the H3C3 gene is associated with a global depletion of the repressive H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) mark, crucial for chromatin structure regulation. This mutation acts as a dominant negative, inhibiting the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and leading to increased H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac), a marker of active chromatin and transcription, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis (Huchedé2022The).

The H3K27M mutation is particularly prevalent in diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs), a subgroup of deadly pediatric gliomas, where it is essential for tumor maintenance and growth. Removal of the H3K27M mutation in experimental models has been shown to decrease tumor growth and prevent tumor development, highlighting its critical role in maintaining the tumorigenic potential of gliomas (Harutyunyan2019H3K27M).

Additionally, the H3C3 gene has been identified as a driver in infiltrating duct carcinoma, suggesting its broader role in oncogenesis beyond gliomas (Ostroverkhova2023Leveraging).
