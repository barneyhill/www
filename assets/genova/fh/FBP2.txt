# FBP2

## Overview
Fructose-bisphosphatase 2 (FBP2) is a gene that encodes the enzyme fructose-bisphosphatase 2, which plays a pivotal role in gluconeogenesis, particularly within muscle cells. This enzyme is classified as a hydrolase, catalyzing the conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate, a critical step in glucose production and energy homeostasis (Bakshi2018Fructose). FBP2 is distinct from its liver isoform, FBP1, due to its sensitivity to allosteric inhibitors and its specific expression in various tissues, including neurons and muscle fibers (Barciszewski2021Structural). The protein's structure is characterized by a homotetrameric formation, which is essential for its enzymatic activity and regulation (Barciszewski2016TtoR). FBP2 is involved in numerous cellular processes, such as glycogen synthesis, cell cycle regulation, and transcriptional modulation, and has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders (Li2013Decreased; Duda2021Cobalt).

## Structure
Fructose-bisphosphatase 2 (FBP2) is a crucial enzyme in gluconeogenesis, catalyzing the conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate. The primary structure of FBP2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains essential for its function. The enzyme's secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its stability and function (Barciszewski2016TtoR).

FBP2's tertiary structure forms a three-dimensional conformation necessary for its enzymatic activity. This structure is characterized by an allosteric domain and a catalytic domain, which are crucial for its regulatory and catalytic functions (Barciszewski2016TtoR). The enzyme requires divalent cations like Mg2+, Mn2+, or Zn2+ for activity, while calcium ions inhibit it by affecting the catalytic loop's movement (Barciszewski2021Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, FBP2 forms a homotetramer composed of two dimers. This tetramer can exist in two conformational states: the inactive T form and the active R form. The R form features a unique perpendicular orientation of its dimers, stabilized by a 'leucine lock' that prevents the disengagement of loop L2, crucial for the enzyme's catalytic mechanism (Barciszewski2016TtoR). FBP2 is more sensitive to allosteric inhibitors like AMP and NAD+ compared to its liver isoform, FBP1 (Barciszewski2021Structural).

## Function
Fructose-bisphosphatase 2 (FBP2) is a crucial enzyme in gluconeogenesis, primarily active in muscle cells, where it catalyzes the conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate. This reaction is a key step in glucose production, helping maintain glucose homeostasis and energy balance in the body (Bakshi2018Fructose; Barciszewski2021Structural). FBP2 is expressed in various cell types, including neurons and muscle fibers, and is involved in multiple cellular processes such as glycogen synthesis, cell cycle regulation, and transcriptional modulation (Duda2021Cobalt).

In neurons, FBP2 modulates mitochondrial function and synaptic plasticity through protein-protein interactions, protecting mitochondria from stress conditions like high calcium levels (Duda2021Cobalt). It also influences the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (Camk2), which is essential for synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation (Duda2021Cobalt). FBP2's activity is regulated by allosteric effectors such as AMP and NAD+, and it requires divalent cations like Mg2+, Mn2+, or Zn2+ for catalysis, while Ca2+ inhibits its activity (Barciszewski2021Structural).

In muscle tissue, FBP2 enhances glucose metabolism by increasing glycolytic flux, glucose uptake, and glucose oxidation, particularly in red muscle fibers (Bakshi2018Fructose). This function is significant in conditions like high-fat diets, where FBP2 overexpression can improve glucose uptake and restore enzyme activities related to glucose metabolism (Bakshi2018Fructose).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FBP2 gene have significant clinical implications. In gastric cancer, decreased expression of FBP2 is linked to poor prognosis and increased tumor growth. This downregulation is often due to hypermethylation of the FBP2 promoter, which leads to enhanced glycolysis and tumorigenicity by inhibiting the Akt-mTOR pathway and activating mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. Overexpression of FBP2 in gastric cancer cells has been shown to suppress glucose metabolism, reduce cell proliferation, and induce apoptosis, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor gene (Li2013Decreased).

A variant in the FBP2 gene, c.343G>A, p. Val115Met, is associated with a novel remitting leukodystrophy. This variant results in reduced enzymatic activity, substrate affinity, and thermal stability, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased reactive oxygen species production. The variant disrupts the normal localization of FBP2, affecting mitochondrial and nuclear interactions, which contributes to the disease's pathophysiology characterized by developmental delay and behavioral problems (Gizak2021A). These findings highlight the potential of FBP2 as a therapeutic target in cancer and its role in metabolic and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
Fructose-bisphosphatase 2 (FBP2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular functions. In cardiomyocytes, FBP2 interacts with proteins such as Tau and MAP1B, affecting microtubule stability and mitochondrial motility. The tetramerization of FBP2 enhances its interaction with Tau, leading to increased Tau phosphorylation at Thr231, which reduces its affinity for microtubules and affects their polymerization (Pietras2022FBP2—A). FBP2 also interacts with mitochondrial proteins like VDAC, ANT, and ATP synthase, influencing mitochondrial biogenesis and membrane polarization (Pietras2022FBP2—A).

In neurons, FBP2 interacts with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2α (Camk2α), playing a role in synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation (LTP). This interaction is crucial for Camk2α autoactivation during LTP induction (Duda2020Fructose). FBP2's interaction with Camk2α is influenced by its quaternary structure, which can be modulated by Co2+ exposure, affecting the phosphorylation of Camk2α and its association with mitochondria (Duda2021Cobalt).

FBP2 also interacts with nuclear transcription factors such as HIF1α and c-Myc, regulating glycolytic metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. It binds to HIF1α with high affinity, influencing its transcriptional activity and stability (Duda2020The). FBP2's interaction with c-Myc downregulates mitochondrial biogenesis by inhibiting the transcription of mitochondrial genes (Huangyang2020Fructose-1).
