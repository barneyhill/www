# ATN1

## Overview
The ATN1 gene encodes the atrophin-1 protein, a transcriptional co-repressor involved in regulating gene expression and maintaining neural progenitor cell states. Atrophin-1 is characterized by its interaction with various transcriptional repression complexes, including the N-CoR/mSin3/HDAC complex, and its ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm due to its nuclear localization and export signals. The protein's structure features a polyglutamine tract, which, when expanded, is implicated in the neurodegenerative disorder dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). Atrophin-1 also contains a histidine-rich HX repeat motif with unique zinc-binding properties, linked to a distinct neurocognitive syndrome. The gene's mutations and altered interactions are associated with several neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Wood2000Atrophin1; Palmer2019De; Nucifora2003Nuclear).

## Structure
The ATN1 gene encodes the atrophin-1 protein, which is involved in transcriptional regulation and is associated with the neurodegenerative disorder dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) (Yu2009C‐terminal; Nucifora2003Nuclear). Atrophin-1 is a hydrophilic protein composed of 1184 amino acids and contains several repetitive motifs, including a polyglutamine tract, a polyproline tract, and a region of alternating acidic and basic residues (Nucifora2003Nuclear). The polyglutamine tract is prone to expansion mutations, which are implicated in DRPLA (Yu2009C‐terminal).

The protein's structure includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the N terminus and a nuclear export signal (NES) in the C terminus, allowing it to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Yu2009C‐terminal; Nucifora2003Nuclear). Atrophin-1 interacts with ETO/MTG8 in the nuclear matrix, playing a role in transcriptional repression (Wood2000Atrophin1). The protein can form heterodimers with Atrophin-2 (RERE), modulating interactions with chromatin remodeling enzymes like Histone Deacetylase-1 (Yu2009C‐terminal).

The ATN1 protein also contains a histidine-rich HX repeat motif, which exhibits unique pH-dependent zinc-binding properties (Palmer2019De). Variants in this motif are associated with a non-progressive neurocognitive syndrome distinct from DRPLA (Palmer2019De). The protein's interaction domains and the presence of polyglutamine tracts are crucial for its function and involvement in disease (Wood2000Atrophin1).

## Function
Atrophin 1 (ATN1) is a protein encoded by the ATN1 gene, primarily involved in transcriptional regulation within the nucleus of healthy human cells. It functions as a transcriptional co-repressor, interacting with components of the N-CoR/mSin3/HDAC transcriptional repression complex, which modulates chromatin structure and gene expression (Wood2000Atrophin1). Atrophin 1 interacts with ETO/MTG8, a protein associated with transcriptional corepressor complexes, and this interaction enhances its ability to repress transcription (Wood2000Atrophin1). This repression is dose-dependent and is facilitated by the presence of ETO/MTG8, indicating a functional partnership between the two proteins (Wood2000Atrophin1).

In the context of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), ATN1 is crucial for maintaining these cells in a progenitor state during cortical development. Its expression is regulated by lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), which controls histone methylation at specific sites, preventing premature differentiation of NPCs into neurons (Zhang2014Epigenetic). This regulation is essential for maintaining the pool of cortical progenitors, highlighting ATN1's role in neural development (Zhang2014Epigenetic). The protein's activity in these processes underscores its importance in both transcriptional regulation and cellular signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATN1 gene are associated with several neurological disorders. Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a neurodegenerative condition caused by CAG triplet repeat expansions in the ATN1 gene. This expansion leads to a toxic gain-of-function effect, resulting in symptoms such as choreoathetosis, myoclonus, epilepsy, ataxia, and dementia. The age of onset for DRPLA varies widely, from infancy to late adulthood, and the condition is characterized by genetic anticipation, where symptoms appear earlier and more severely in successive generations (Palmer2019De; Zhang2020Clinical; Magrinelli2021Challenges).

Another condition linked to ATN1 is CHEDDA (congenital hypotonia, epilepsy, developmental delay, digit abnormalities), which is associated with de novo missense and insertion variants in the HX repeat motif of the gene. Unlike DRPLA, CHEDDA is a non-progressive neurocognitive syndrome characterized by severe cognitive impairment, hypotonia, and congenital anomalies. The pathogenic mechanism involves disruption of the HX motif's pH-dependent zinc-binding properties (Palmer2019De).

Altered expression or interactions of ATN1 may also contribute to other neurological conditions, such as Huntington's Disease, where ATN1 shows significant co-expression with other polyglutamine genes in affected brain regions (Keo2017Coexpression).

## Interactions
Atrophin-1 (ATN1) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in transcriptional regulation and neurodegenerative processes. It interacts with the ETO/MTG8 oncoprotein, a component of nuclear receptor corepressor complexes, in the nuclear matrix. This interaction is identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by co-immunoaffinity purification from mouse brain extracts. Atrophin-1 and ETO/MTG8 colocalize in discrete nuclear structures, and their interaction enhances transcriptional repression in a dose-dependent manner (Wood2000Atrophin1).

Atrophin-1 also interacts with mSin3A, HDAC1, and HDAC2, suggesting its involvement in transcriptional repression through these complexes (Wood2000Atrophin1). The protein does not interact with the central polyglutamine tract or the COOH-terminal half of atrophin-1, nor with the NH2-terminal 598 amino acids of huntingtin (Wood2000Atrophin1).

In addition, atrophin-1 forms a heterodimer with its homologous protein, atrophin-2 (RERE), which modulates its interaction with histone deacetylase-1 (Yu2009C‐terminal). These interactions are crucial for its function as a transcriptional corepressor and may contribute to the pathogenesis of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) (Wood2000Atrophin1; Yu2009C‐terminal).
