# HEATR1

## Overview
HEATR1 is a gene that encodes the HEAT repeat containing 1 protein, which is primarily involved in ribosome biogenesis within human cells. The protein is characterized by the presence of HEAT repeats, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for the assembly and maturation of ribosomal subunits (Turi2017Perturbation). HEAT repeat containing 1 is a nucleolar protein that plays a critical role in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) by regulating RNA Polymerase I transcription activity, thereby maintaining nucleolar structure and function (Turi2017Perturbation). Additionally, HEATR1 is involved in the ribosome biogenesis stress checkpoint pathway, influencing cell cycle control and tumorigenesis through the p53 pathway (Turi2017Perturbation). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various diseases, particularly cancer, where it may serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Skvortsova2024Association; Turi2017Perturbation).

## Function
HEATR1 (HEAT repeat containing 1) is a nucleolar protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis in human cells. It is involved in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) by positively regulating RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) transcription activity. HEATR1 co-localizes with Pol I in the nucleoli, specifically in the fibrillar centers, and is essential for maintaining nucleolar structure and function (Turi2017Perturbation). The protein contains HEAT repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions necessary for the assembly and maturation of ribosomal subunits (Turi2017Perturbation).

HEATR1 is also involved in the ribosome biogenesis stress checkpoint pathway. Its depletion leads to the activation of the p53 pathway through the RPL5/RPL11-MDM2 axis, resulting in p53 stabilization and cell cycle arrest (Turi2017Perturbation). This mechanism is crucial for maintaining cell cycle control and preventing tumorigenesis (Turi2017Perturbation). HEATR1's role in ribosome biogenesis is vital due to the high energy demand and the need for precise regulation of ribosome production, which is tightly linked to cell growth and division (Turi2017Perturbation).

## Clinical Significance
HEATR1 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer, due to its role in ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle regulation. Alterations in HEATR1 expression can lead to significant cellular stress responses. Downregulation of HEATR1 results in cell cycle arrest through the activation of the p53 pathway, specifically via the RPL5/RPL11-MDM2 axis, which is independent of DNA damage (Turi2017Perturbation). This mechanism is crucial in maintaining cellular homeostasis, and its disruption can contribute to tumorigenesis.

HEATR1 is overexpressed in certain cancer types, such as glioblastoma, where it may serve as a target for immunotherapy (Turi2017Perturbation). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, HEATR1 is associated with poor prognosis, potentially due to its involvement in AKT phosphorylation rather than ribosome biogenesis (Turi2017Perturbation). Additionally, HEATR1 has been identified as part of prognostic somatic mutation signatures in lung adenocarcinoma, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Menor2019Development).

HEATR1 has also been linked to early-onset breast cancer in Kazakh women, with specific genetic variations showing a significant association with increased risk (Skvortsova2024Association). These findings underscore the clinical significance of HEATR1 in cancer and highlight its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
HEATR1 is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the nucleolus. It interacts with the proteins Pontin and Reptin, which are components of the R2TP-TTT chaperone complex. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays and Western blotting in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines. HEATR1 colocalizes with Pontin and Reptin in the nucleoli, suggesting a physical association in this subcellular compartment. The interaction is crucial for the stability of Pontin and Reptin, as HEATR1 knockdown results in decreased levels of these proteins, an effect reversible by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Nakamura2021HEATR1).

HEATR1 also plays a role in ribosome biogenesis by interacting with components of the RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) transcription machinery. It co-localizes with Pol I in the nucleolus and is involved in rRNA synthesis. Upon transcription inhibition, HEATR1 and Pol I redistribute to nucleolar caps, indicating a physical interaction independent of active transcription but dependent on the integrity of the upstream binding factor (UBF) (Turi2017Perturbation). These interactions highlight HEATR1's role in maintaining nucleolar structure and function, as well as its involvement in cellular stress responses.
