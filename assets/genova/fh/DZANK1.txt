# DZANK1

## Overview
DZANK1, or double zinc ribbon and ankyrin repeat domains 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly within photoreceptor cells. The protein encoded by DZANK1 is characterized by its zinc ribbon and ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate its role in vesicle transport and ciliary function. It is primarily associated with the assembly of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 motor complex, essential for intracellular transport, especially in the context of photoreceptor development and maintenance (Dona2015NINL; Baehr2019Insights). The protein's localization to the basal body and accessory centriole underscores its involvement in ciliary function, contributing to the transport of materials necessary for cilia and photoreceptor maintenance (Dona2015NINL). Research in model organisms such as zebrafish has highlighted the importance of DZANK1 in visual function, with knockdown studies demonstrating its critical role in maintaining photoreceptor structure and function (Dona2015NINL). While its clinical significance in humans is still being elucidated, DZANK1 has been linked to conditions such as retinal dystrophies and corneal dystrophies, suggesting its potential involvement in ocular diseases (Davidson2016AutosomalDominant; Shen2016Association).

## Function
DZANK1 (double zinc ribbon and ankyrin repeat domains 1) is involved in vesicle transport within photoreceptor cells, playing a crucial role in photoreceptor development and function. It interacts with the NINL protein to facilitate the assembly of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 motor complex, which is essential for intracellular transport processes (Dona2015NINL; Baehr2019Insights). This interaction is particularly important for the transport of vesicle-bound transmembrane proteins, such as rhodopsin and USH2A, within photoreceptor cells (Dona2015NINL).

DZANK1 is localized to the basal body and accessory centriole in ciliated cells, indicating its involvement in ciliary function and the transport of materials necessary for cilia and photoreceptor maintenance (Dona2015NINL). The protein's activity is linked to the centrosome and ciliary base, contributing to microtubule nucleation and centrosome maturation, which are vital for maintaining cellular structure and function (Baehr2019Insights).

In zebrafish, knockdown of DZANK1 results in impaired visual responses and disrupted photoreceptor inner segments, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular structure and function (Dona2015NINL). These findings suggest that DZANK1 is critical for cellular transport mechanisms and the maintenance of cellular architecture.

## Clinical Significance
DZANK1 has been implicated in several conditions due to its role in cellular processes. In zebrafish, mutations in DZANK1, along with its interaction partner NINL, lead to defects in vesicle transport and photoreceptor development, resulting in mislocalization of rhodopsin and disrupted mitochondria organization in photoreceptor cells. These findings suggest a potential link between DZANK1 and retinal dystrophies, which are often associated with ciliary dysfunction (Dona2015NINL).

In mice, alterations in DZANK1 expression have been associated with posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD1). A chromosomal rearrangement affecting DZANK1 and other genes was identified in a mouse model of PPCD1, suggesting that changes in DZANK1 expression may contribute to the disease phenotype (Shen2016Association). However, the study ruled out haploinsufficiency of DZANK1 as the sole cause of PPCD1, indicating that other genetic factors may also play a role (Shen2016Association).

In humans, a rare variant in DZANK1 was identified in a family with an autosomal-dominant corneal endothelial dystrophy, but in silico analysis suggested it is likely a benign polymorphism, indicating that the clinical significance of DZANK1 mutations in humans remains unclear (Davidson2016AutosomalDominant).

## Interactions
DZANK1 is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of photoreceptor development in zebrafish. It interacts with components of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 motor complex, specifically the light chains DYNLL1 and DYNLL2. These interactions were confirmed through reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells and co-expression studies in ciliated hTERT-RPE1 cells, where mRFP-tagged DYNLL1 or DYNLL2 recruited eCFP-tagged DZANK1 to the basal body and accessory centriole (Dona2015NINL). 

DZANK1 also interacts with the NINL isoB protein in the retina. This interaction was identified through a screen of a bovine retina cDNA library and validated using yeast two-hybrid analysis, GST pull-down assays, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The ZNF_RBZ domains of DZANK1 interact with both isoforms of NINL, with a focus on NINL isoB. Co-localization studies in hTERT-RPE1 cells and rat retina showed that DZANK1 and NINL isoB co-localize at the ciliary base, suggesting a functional interaction in this region (Dona2015NINL). 

These interactions indicate that DZANK1 plays a role in vesicle transport processes essential for photoreceptor development, potentially linking it to the Usher protein network involved in opsin vesicle docking and transport (Dona2015NINL).
