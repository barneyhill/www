# FOXJ3

## Overview
FOXJ3 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box J3 protein, a member of the forkhead box (FOX) family of transcription factors. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and transcriptional networks within human cells. As a transcription factor, forkhead box J3 binds to specific DNA sequences in the nucleus, modulating the expression of genes critical for cell division and growth (Grant2012Livecell). The protein's activity is essential for maintaining proper cell cycle progression, as evidenced by its role in the periodic expression of cell cycle-regulated genes (Grant2012Livecell). FOXJ3 also interacts with other FOX family members, such as FOXK2 and FOXO3, sharing significant overlap in chromatin binding regions, which suggests a collaborative role in regulating apoptotic signaling pathways and other cellular processes (Chen2015Genome-wide). The gene's expression patterns have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yin2022An).

## Function
FOXJ3 is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of the cell cycle in healthy human cells. It plays a critical role in maintaining proper cell cycle progression by regulating the expression of genes associated with cell division. Knockdown experiments in U2OS cells have shown that FOXJ3 is necessary for the periodic expression of cell cycle-regulated genes, as its reduction leads to decreased oscillations in luciferase activity and a significant decrease in the expression of these genes (Grant2012Livecell). This suggests that FOXJ3 is essential for the proper timing of gene expression during the cell cycle, contributing to normal cell proliferation (Grant2012Livecell).

FOXJ3 is also implicated in the regulation of a network of zinc finger proteins, indicating its involvement in broader transcriptional regulatory networks (Grant2012Livecell). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to modulate the transcription of target genes, impacting cellular functions such as cell growth and division (Grant2012Livecell). The knockdown of FOXJ3 results in an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase, highlighting its role in facilitating the transition through the cell cycle (Grant2012Livecell).

## Clinical Significance
FOXJ3 is implicated in various cancers due to its differential expression patterns. In leukemia, FOXJ3 is notably upregulated in several subtypes, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Yin2022An). It is also differentially expressed in multiple nervous system tumors, such as glioblastoma and neuroblastoma (Yin2022An). In tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), FOXJ3 is significantly upregulated and involved in regulating genes associated with tumor progression and migration. The knockdown of FOXJ3 reduces cell migration, indicating its role in promoting tumor migration (Zhang20217SK).

In lung cancer, FOXJ3 expression is regulated by miR-517a-3p, which promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasion by inhibiting FOXJ3. This interaction suggests that FOXJ3 plays a role in lung carcinogenesis and tumor progression (Jin2014MiR517a3p). The differential expression of FOXJ3 in various cancers highlights its potential as a therapeutic target and its involvement in cancer progression and response to treatment (Yin2022An). However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations in FOXJ3 are not detailed in the available studies.

## Interactions
FOXJ3, a member of the forkhead box (FOX) family of transcription factors, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in gene regulation. FOXJ3 shares significant overlap in chromatin binding regions with other FOX transcription factors, particularly FOXK2 and FOXO3. Over 60% of FOXJ3 binding regions are also occupied by FOXK2, and 27% are co-bound by both FOXK2 and FOXO3, suggesting that these proteins may bind to similar regulatory regions and influence similar biological processes, such as the apoptotic signaling pathway (Chen2015Genome-wide). 

The binding regions of FOXJ3, FOXK2, and FOXO3 are associated with the histone acetylation mark H3K18ac, indicating active regulatory regions in the genome. Regions bound by all three FOX proteins exhibit higher occupancy and stronger binding motifs, which are crucial for FOXO3-mediated transcriptional activation (Chen2015Genome-wide). FOXJ3 shows a more relaxed binding specificity compared to FOXK2 and FOXO3, binding to a more degenerate consensus present in some FOXK2 binding regions (Chen2015Genome-wide). 

In the context of cancer, FOXJ3's interactions with other proteins have been explored using bioinformatics tools like STRING and BioGRID, which provide insights into its potential interactions and role in cancer progression (YANG2024Comprehensive).
