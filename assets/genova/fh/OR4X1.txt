# OR4X1

## Overview
The OR4X1 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily X member 1, a protein that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral to the olfactory system, facilitating the detection and transduction of odorant signals through their characteristic seven-transmembrane domain structure (Ryu2018Association). The OR4X1 protein is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to specific odor molecules, initiating a cascade of intracellular events that culminate in the perception of smell. Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR4X1 has been implicated in genetic studies exploring its potential influence on pulmonary function, although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Takabatake2007A). Despite its involvement in sensory perception, current research does not support a significant clinical role for OR4X1 mutations in major diseases (Ryu2018Association).

## Structure
The OR4X1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors typically have a seven-transmembrane domain structure, characteristic of GPCRs, which facilitates their role in signal transduction across cell membranes (Ryu2018Association). The primary structure of OR4X1 consists of amino acid sequences that form the basis for its functional conformation. The secondary structure includes alpha helices, which are common in GPCRs and contribute to the formation of the transmembrane domains (Ryu2018Association).

The tertiary structure of OR4X1 involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation that is essential for its interaction with odorant molecules. Although specific details about the quaternary structure of OR4X1 are not provided, olfactory receptors generally do not form quaternary structures as part of their functional state (Ryu2018Association). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, influencing the receptor's stability and function (Ryu2018Association). The OR4X1 gene is also noted for its involvement in various genetic studies, highlighting its significance beyond olfactory perception (Hughes2014Loss; Seabury2017Genomewide).

## Function
The OR4X1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Ryu2018Association). The OR4X1 protein contributes to the diversity of olfactory detection by interacting with various odorant molecules, allowing for a wide range of smells to be perceived.

Beyond its role in olfaction, there is evidence suggesting that OR4X1 may have functions outside the olfactory system. Studies have indicated that genetic variations in OR4X1 are associated with pulmonary function, specifically influencing the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio. Individuals with certain nonfunctional alleles of OR4X1 have shown higher FEV1/FVC values, suggesting a potential role in respiratory physiology (Takabatake2007A). However, the exact mechanisms by which OR4X1 influences these non-olfactory pathways remain unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate its broader biological functions.

## Clinical Significance
The OR4X1 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, has been studied in the context of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). A study by Ryu et al. investigated the association of the OR4X1A>T polymorphism with RPL but found no significant link between this polymorphism and the prevalence of RPL. This suggests that mutations in OR4X1 may not play a significant role in this condition (Ryu2018Association). The study primarily focused on other polymorphisms, such as OR4C16G>A, which showed a significant association with RPL, indicating that OR4X1 is not highlighted as clinically significant in this context (Ryu2018Association).

The research also explored gene-gene interactions and environmental factors, but the OR4X1 gene did not show significant associations in these analyses (Ryu2018Association). While olfactory receptor genes, including OR4X1, are involved in sensory perception, the specific clinical significance of OR4X1 mutations in diseases beyond sensory disorders like anosmia is not directly addressed in the available studies (Ryu2018Association). Therefore, the current evidence does not support a direct clinical significance of OR4X1 mutations in major diseases or conditions.
