# CDRT15L2

## Overview
CDRT15L2 is a gene located on chromosome 17 within the CMT1A duplication region, which encodes the protein CMT1A duplicated region transcript 15 like 2. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA replication and immune response modulation, as evidenced by its altered expression in CD4+ T cells following hBD-2 treatment (chen2016role). The gene's expression is notably underrepresented in certain cancer types, such as HER2+ breast cancer, where it is linked to resistance against neoadjuvant chemotherapy (BarrónGallardo2022A). Additionally, CDRT15L2 is implicated in the genomic alterations observed in leiomyosarcoma, particularly in the 17p11.2 gain, suggesting its role in disease progression and high-level amplification (Wozniak2021Molecular). Despite its involvement in these conditions, the precise biological functions and mechanisms of the CMT1A duplicated region transcript 15 like 2 protein remain to be fully elucidated, warranting further investigation.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the CDRT15L2 gene, located within the CMT1A duplication region on chromosome 17, is associated with various conditions due to its involvement in genetic alterations. In HER2+ breast cancer, CDRT15L2 is one of the top 10 underexpressed genes in patients resistant to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting a potential role in treatment resistance (BarrónGallardo2022A). In leiomyosarcoma, CDRT15L2 is part of the 17p11.2 gain observed in 67.5% of samples, indicating its possible involvement in high-level amplification and disease progression (Wozniak2021Molecular). 

The gene is also implicated in immune responses, as hBD-2 treatment affects its expression in CD4+ T cells, linking it to DNA replication processes (chen2016role). Although the specific clinical significance of CDRT15L2 in these contexts is not fully detailed, its altered expression and genomic location suggest a potential impact on disease mechanisms and treatment responses. Further research is needed to clarify its role in these conditions and its broader implications in genetic disorders.
