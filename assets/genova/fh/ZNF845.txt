# ZNF845

## Overview
ZNF845 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 845, a member of the KRAB zinc-finger protein (KZFP) family, which is involved in transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression. ZNF845 is particularly active during early embryonic development and the differentiation of embryonic stem cells, where it plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle and other developmental processes (Shen2021Conserved). The protein interacts with TRIM28, a transcriptional co-repressor, to mediate transcriptional repression, a process that can be modulated by post-translational modifications such as acetylation (Chang2023AcetylationMimic). These interactions and modifications are significant for understanding the gene's role in cellular differentiation and its potential implications in diseases such as leukemia (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).

## Function


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF845 is a zinc finger protein that is part of the KRAB zinc-finger protein (KZFP) family, which is known for its role in transcriptional regulation through interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. ZNF845 is included in the EM7 co-expression module, which is highly expressed during early embryonic development and early differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). This module is associated with biological processes related to the cell cycle, which are crucial for development and ESC differentiation (Shen2021Conserved).

ZNF845 interacts with TRIM28, a transcriptional co-repressor that plays a significant role in gene regulation. TRIM28, also known as KAP1, is an essential epigenetic modifier that interacts with KRAB-ZNF proteins, including ZNF845, to mediate transcriptional repression. The interaction between ZNF845 and TRIM28 is part of a broader network of interactions that regulate gene expression and cellular differentiation (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).

The interaction between ZNF845 and TRIM28 is affected by post-translational modifications, such as acetylation. The acetylation-mimic mutation TRIM28-K304Q has been shown to alter interactions with KRAB-ZNFs, including ZNF845, impacting gene expression profiles in leukemic K562 cells (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).
