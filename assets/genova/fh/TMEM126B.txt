# TMEM126B

## Overview
TMEM126B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 126B, a mitochondrial transmembrane protein integral to the assembly of mitochondrial complex I, a crucial component of the electron transport chain. This protein is a part of the mitochondrial complex I assembly complex (MCIA), which includes other assembly factors such as ACAD9, ECSIT, and NDUFAF1, and is essential for the proper assembly and stability of complex I (Heide2012Complexome; Alston2016Biallelic). TMEM126B facilitates the incorporation of the Q-module into complex I, ensuring efficient electron transfer and ATP production (Fuhrmann2019TMEM126B). Mutations in the TMEM126B gene are linked to mitochondrial disorders, including complex I deficiency and Leigh-like syndrome, highlighting its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism (Alston2016Biallelic; Zhou2022Novel).

## Structure
The TMEM126B protein is a mitochondrial transmembrane protein involved in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I. While the precise molecular structure of TMEM126B has not been fully elucidated, it is predicted to contain four transmembrane α-helices, which are characteristic of its hydrophobic nature (Andrews2013Assembly). In silico modeling suggests that the Gly212 residue is located within a helical domain, and its substitution with valine is likely to affect the protein's tertiary structure, potentially compromising its function (Alston2016Biallelic).

TMEM126B is associated with the mitochondrial complex I assembly complex (MCIA), where it plays a crucial role in the assembly process by recruiting hydrophilic proteins such as CIA30, Ecsit, and Acad9 to the membrane, forming a functional assembly complex (Heide2012Complexome). The protein's involvement in complex I assembly is further supported by its association with a 370-kDa subcomplex, which is essential for the formation of larger assembly intermediates (Andrews2013Assembly).

The protein's function is critical for mitochondrial respiration, as knockdown of TMEM126B significantly impairs complex I assembly and activity (Heide2012Complexome). Despite its importance, specific details about post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of TMEM126B are not provided in the available context.

## Function
TMEM126B is a mitochondrial transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I, a key component of the electron transport chain involved in oxidative phosphorylation. This protein is part of the mitochondrial complex I assembly complex (MCIA), which includes other assembly factors such as ACAD9, ECSIT, and NDUFAF1 (Heide2012Complexome; Alston2016Biallelic). TMEM126B is essential for the proper assembly and stability of complex I, ensuring efficient electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone, which is crucial for maintaining the electrochemical proton gradient necessary for ATP production (Zhou2022Novel).

In healthy human cells, TMEM126B is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it facilitates the incorporation of the Q-module into complex I, contributing to the correct functional composition of the complex's 45 subunits (Fuhrmann2019TMEM126B). The absence or deficiency of TMEM126B leads to impaired complex I assembly, resulting in reduced mitochondrial respiration and energy production, although other respiratory complexes remain unaffected (Fuhrmann2019TMEM126B; Heide2012Complexome). This highlights TMEM126B's specific and crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM126B gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders, primarily characterized by complex I deficiency. Biallelic mutations in TMEM126B can lead to severe complex I deficiency, manifesting in a range of clinical phenotypes from pure myopathy in adulthood to severe multisystem presentations in infancy, including chronic renal failure and cardiomyopathy (Alston2016Biallelic). Specific mutations, such as c.635G>T (p.Gly212Val) and c.401delA (p.Asn134Ilefs*2), have been identified in patients with these conditions (Alston2016Biallelic).

TMEM126B mutations are also linked to Leigh-like syndrome, a severe neurological disorder. Novel biallelic mutations, such as c.82-2 A > G and c.290dupT, cause splicing defects that lead to this condition, characterized by developmental delays, neurological symptoms, and elevated blood lactate levels (Zhou2022Novel).

Alterations in TMEM126B expression have been implicated in ischemic stroke, where its repression can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Wei2020Ablation). In the context of high-fat diet-induced obesity, TMEM126B ablation has been shown to alleviate heart injury by improving mitochondrial function (Ruan2019Ablation).

## Interactions
TMEM126B is a mitochondrial transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I. It is a component of the mitochondrial complex I assembly (MCIA) complex, which includes other assembly factors such as ACAD9, ECSIT, and NDUFAF1. TMEM126B interacts with these proteins to facilitate the proper assembly and function of complex I (Heide2012Complexome; Alston2016Biallelic). 

The protein is involved in recruiting hydrophilic proteins like CIA30 (NDUFAF1), Ecsit, and Acad9 to the mitochondrial membrane, forming a functional assembly complex necessary for complex I assembly (Heide2012Complexome). TMEM126B's interaction with these proteins is crucial for the integration of the matrix module into the membrane arm of complex I, as evidenced by the accumulation of subcomplexes containing NDUFS3 in the absence of functional TMEM126B (Alston2016Biallelic).

TMEM126B also comigrates with these assembly factors in native gel profiles, indicating its association with the 370-kDa assembly intermediate of complex I (Andrews2013Assembly). These interactions highlight TMEM126B's essential role in the stability and assembly of mitochondrial complex I.
