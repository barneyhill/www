# C20orf203

## Overview
C20orf203, also known as FLJ33706, is a human-specific de novo protein-coding gene located on chromosome 20. The gene encodes the protein chromosome 20 open reading frame 203, which is primarily expressed in the brain and is under purifying selection, highlighting its functional significance in cellular processes (Li2010A). The protein is predominantly found in neurons across various brain regions, including the cortex, cerebellum, and midbrain, and is implicated in cognitive functions and neurological conditions such as nicotine addiction and Alzheimer's disease (Li2010A). The expression of C20orf203 is notably enriched in brain areas associated with cognitive abilities, with levels comparable to those of the neuronal-specific isoform of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF1) (Li2010A). Additionally, the gene has been linked to various clinical conditions, including papillary thyroid carcinoma, intellectual disabilities, and hip osteoarthritis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and its involvement in disease pathogenesis (Mo2020lncRNAmiRNAmRNA; Hanafusa2017The; Wang2020Evaluation).

## Structure


## Function
The gene C20orf203, also known as FLJ33706, is a human-specific de novo protein-coding gene primarily expressed in the brain. It is associated with human brain functions and may play a role in nicotine addiction and Alzheimer's disease (Li2010A). The protein encoded by C20orf203 is under purifying selection, indicating its functional importance in cellular processes (Li2010A). 

C20orf203 is expressed in neurons across various regions of the human brain, including the cortex, cerebellum, and midbrain, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry studies (Li2010A). Its expression is significantly enriched in brain regions related to cognitive abilities, such as the cortex and hippocampus, with expression levels comparable to those of the neuronal-specific isoform of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF1) (Li2010A). 

The protein has a predicted molecular weight of 22 kDa and is detected in human brain tissues, suggesting its involvement in brain-specific functions (Li2010A). Elevated expressions of C20orf203 have been detected in Alzheimer's disease brain samples, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of the disease (Li2010A; Broeils2023Evolution).

## Clinical Significance
C20orf203 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression or genetic mutations. In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), C20orf203 is identified as a differentially expressed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and is significantly associated with overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker for PTC (Mo2020lncRNAmiRNAmRNA). 

In a case study of a young Japanese girl, a microdeletion on chromosome 20q11.2, which includes C20orf203, was associated with intellectual disability, motor developmental delay, and facial dysmorphism. This deletion was the smallest reported for this type and was confirmed to be de novo (Hanafusa2017The).

C20orf203 is also mentioned in the context of hip osteoarthritis (OA) in a Han Chinese population, where its expression levels were associated with a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2424905. This SNP was linked to an increased risk of hip OA, suggesting that C20orf203 may contribute to OA susceptibility (Wang2020Evaluation).

Additionally, C20orf203 is involved in a fusion gene, CNTNAP3B::C20orf203, identified in a patient with childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), indicating its potential role in cancer (Ryan2022Whole).
