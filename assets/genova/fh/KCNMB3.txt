# KCNMB3

## Overview
The KCNMB3 gene encodes the potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily M regulatory beta subunit 3, a crucial component of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels. These channels are integral membrane proteins that play a significant role in modulating cellular excitability by responding to changes in intracellular calcium levels and membrane potential. The KCNMB3 protein, categorized as a regulatory subunit, influences the biophysical and pharmacological properties of BK channels, including their calcium sensitivity and gating kinetics (Hu2003Variants; Brenner2000Cloning). The gene is expressed in various tissues, notably the brain and testis, and exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which contribute to the functional diversity of BK channels (Uebele2000Cloning). Alterations in KCNMB3 have been linked to neurological conditions such as epilepsy, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal neuronal function (Hu2003Variants; Lorenz2006Allelic).

## Structure
The KCNMB3 gene encodes a regulatory beta subunit of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels. The protein structure includes two putative transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function as a regulatory subunit (Behrens2000hKCNMB3; Riazi1999Identification). The protein also features a conserved N-glycosylation region, indicating potential post-translational modifications that may affect its function (Riazi1999Identification). 

KCNMB3 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, specifically β3a, β3b, β3c, and β3d, which differ at the amino terminus due to alternative splicing (Hu2003Variants; Uebele2000Cloning). These isoforms contribute to the functional diversity of BK channels by modulating their biophysical properties (Uebele2000Cloning). The β3 subunits have a longer carboxyl-terminal domain compared to other β subunits, which includes a leucine zipper motif and potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Uebele2000Cloning). 

The protein's extracellular domain contains consensus N-glycosylation sites and a characteristic pattern of four cysteine residues, which are likely involved in forming disulfide bridges (Behrens2000hKCNMB3). These structural features are important for the protein's role in modulating BK channel activity.

## Function
The KCNMB3 gene encodes a regulatory beta subunit of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels, which are crucial for modulating the electrical excitability of cells. These channels are activated by both cytoplasmic calcium and membrane depolarization, playing a significant role in repolarizing the membrane during neuronal excitation and calcium entry into the cell (Hu2003Variants). The KCNMB3 subunit influences the pharmacological properties and sensitivity of BK channels to blockers, affecting the channel's activation curve and its dependence on intracellular calcium concentration (Henney2009A). 

In healthy human cells, KCNMB3 is involved in regulating neuronal excitability by modulating the repolarization phase following neuronal stimulation, which is essential for maintaining normal neuronal activity and preventing excessive excitability that could lead to conditions such as epilepsy (Lorenz2006Allelic). The subunit is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and testis, and contributes to the functional diversity of BK channels by modulating their calcium sensitivity and gating kinetics (Brenner2000Cloning). This modulation is important for physiological processes such as shaping action potential waveforms in neurons and regulating smooth muscle contraction (Brenner2000Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KCNMB3 gene are associated with several neurological conditions, particularly epilepsy. The gene encodes the regulatory β3 subunit of large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels, which play a crucial role in neuronal excitability. A specific mutation, a single nucleotide deletion in exon 4 (delA750), has been linked to idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), especially typical absence epilepsy. This mutation results in a truncated β3b-isoform, leading to altered channel inactivation and increased neuronal excitability, which may contribute to seizure susceptibility (Hu2003Variants; Lorenz2006Allelic).

The KCNMB3 gene is located on chromosome 3q26.3-q27, a region associated with dup(3q) syndrome, characterized by congenital and neurological abnormalities, including seizures. Duplication of the KCNMB3 gene in this syndrome suggests that overexpression may contribute to the etiology of seizures (N’Gouemo2011Targeting). Additionally, the β3b-V4 variant of the KCNMB3 gene has been found to significantly alter BK channel properties, leading to increased neuronal excitability, which is characteristic of epilepsy (Hu2003Variants). These findings indicate that KCNMB3 gene mutations and expression alterations can significantly impact neurological health, particularly in relation to epilepsy.

## Interactions
KCNMB3, a regulatory beta subunit of the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels, is involved in protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function. These interactions primarily occur with the pore-forming alpha subunits of the BK channels, influencing the channel's gating properties, calcium sensitivity, and pharmacological responses. The intrinsic disorder in KCNMB3 facilitates these interactions, as disordered regions are known to enable various binding events, including protein-protein interactions (Peng2014Intrinsic).

The interaction between KCNMB3 and the BK channel is mediated through the S0 transmembrane region of the channel. This interaction is significant for the modulation of the channel's activity, impacting physiological processes such as muscle contraction and neuronal excitability (Peng2014Intrinsic). The intrinsic disorder profiles of KCNMB3, evaluated using PONDR predictors, indicate the presence of intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs), which are likely to facilitate these protein-protein interactions (Peng2014Intrinsic).

Overall, KCNMB3's interactions with the BK channel highlight its role in modulating channel activity through its disordered regions, which are essential for the dynamic and flexible binding necessary for its regulatory functions.
