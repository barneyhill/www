# ZP3

## Overview
ZP3 is a gene that encodes the zona pellucida glycoprotein 3, a crucial component of the zona pellucida, which is an extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte in mammals. The ZP3 protein is a glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in fertilization by acting as a primary sperm receptor, facilitating sperm binding, and inducing the acrosome reaction necessary for sperm to penetrate the oocyte (Wassarman2021Zona; Hinsch1999Species). Structurally, ZP3 is characterized by a polypeptide chain with a transmembrane domain and multiple disulfide bonds that contribute to its stability and function (Zhao2004Mass; Ringuette1988Molecular). The protein is heavily glycosylated, which is essential for its role in sperm binding and preventing polyspermy (Wassarman2008Zona). Mutations in the ZP3 gene can lead to infertility-related conditions, such as empty follicle syndrome, underscoring its importance in reproductive biology (Zhang2020A; Cao2020Heterozygous).

## Structure
The ZP3 protein is a glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the structure and function of the zona pellucida, an extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte. The primary structure of ZP3 consists of a polypeptide chain with 424 amino acids, including a signal peptide and a transmembrane domain near the C-terminus (Zhao2004Mass; Ringuette1988Molecular). The N-terminal glutamine is cyclized to pyroglutamate, a modification that is conserved between human and mouse ZP3 (Zhao2004Mass).

ZP3 contains 12 cysteine residues that form six disulfide bonds, contributing to its tertiary structure and stability. These disulfide bonds are crucial for maintaining the protein's three-dimensional conformation, with specific linkages such as between Cys 78 and Cys 99, and Cys 217 and Cys 282 (Zhao2004Mass). The protein also features a conserved zona domain, which is essential for its polymerization and function (Zhao2004Mass).

Post-translational modifications of ZP3 include both N-linked and O-linked glycosylation. Human ZP3 has three N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn 125, Asn 147, and Asn 272, which are important for protein folding and stability (Zhao2004Mass). These glycosylation patterns are critical for the protein's role in sperm binding and the acrosome reaction.

## Function
ZP3 (zona pellucida glycoprotein 3) is a critical component of the zona pellucida, an extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte in mammals, including humans. It plays a pivotal role in sperm binding and the induction of the acrosome reaction, which are essential steps in fertilization. ZP3 acts as a primary sperm receptor, facilitating the initial binding of sperm to the egg and triggering the acrosome reaction, allowing sperm to penetrate the oocyte (Wassarman2021Zona; Hinsch1999Species).

The ZP3 protein is synthesized in the oocyte and secreted extracellularly, where it becomes part of the fiber network that forms the zona pellucida. This network is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the zona pellucida, which supports oocyte health and provides species-specific sperm binding sites (Wassarman2021Zona; Zhang2020A). ZP3 is heavily glycosylated, a modification that contributes to its function in sperm binding and the prevention of polyspermy (Wassarman2008Zona).

Mutations in the ZP3 gene can lead to defects in the zona pellucida, resulting in conditions such as empty follicle syndrome and female infertility, highlighting its importance in reproductive processes (Zhang2020A; Cao2020Heterozygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZP3 gene are associated with several infertility-related conditions, primarily due to their impact on the formation and function of the zona pellucida. One such condition is Empty Follicle Syndrome (EFS), where no oocytes are retrieved despite normal ovarian response and follicular development. This syndrome is linked to mutations in the ZP3 gene that lead to the absence or degeneration of the zona pellucida, resulting in oocyte degeneration or increased fragility during follicular puncture (Chen2021Case; Zhou2022Can). 

Specific mutations, such as the heterozygous S173C and homozygous L59H mutations, have been identified as causing significant structural damage to the ZP3 protein, affecting its interactions with other zona pellucida proteins and leading to infertility (Zhang2020A; Kong2023Case). These mutations are often located in the highly conserved ZP domain, crucial for zona pellucida assembly, and are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (Cao2020Heterozygous; Zhou2022Can). 

Patients with ZP3 mutations typically exhibit phenotypes such as EFS and ZP-free oocytes, with no successful pregnancies reported in studies (Zhou2022Can). These findings underscore the critical role of ZP3 in fertility and highlight the potential for genetic diagnosis in managing infertility (Cao2020Heterozygous).

## Interactions
ZP3, a key glycoprotein of the zona pellucida, is involved in several critical interactions during fertilization. It primarily interacts with sperm proteins to facilitate sperm binding and the acrosome reaction. One of the notable interactions is with β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (GalTase), which binds to ZP3 through lectin-like interactions with specific sugar residues, triggering signal transduction cascades necessary for sperm-zona binding (Brewis1999Gamete). 

In humans, the yeast two-hybrid system has identified UBAP2L as a protein that interacts strongly with ZP3. This interaction was validated using a mammalian two-hybrid system and a hemizona assay, where antibodies against UBAP2L significantly inhibited sperm-zona binding, highlighting its potential role in fertilization (Naz2010Identification).

ZP3 also plays a role in species-specific fertilization, with its C-terminal region, particularly exon-7, being crucial for sperm binding and the acrosome reaction. This region has undergone evolutionary changes, suggesting its importance in species-specific interactions (Litscher2009Zona). These interactions underscore the complexity and specificity of ZP3's role in mammalian fertilization.
