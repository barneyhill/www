# EARS2

## Overview
The EARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme glutamyl-tRNA synthetase 2, which plays a critical role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme is categorized as an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, responsible for attaching glutamate to its corresponding tRNA within the mitochondria, a key step in translating mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins. The proper function of EARS2 is essential for the oxidative phosphorylation system, which is crucial for ATP production and overall cellular energy metabolism. Mutations in the EARS2 gene are linked to a rare mitochondrial disorder known as leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and brainstem involvement and high lactate (LTBL), characterized by a range of neurological symptoms and specific MRI patterns (Fine2019Mitochondrial; Steenweg2012Leukoencephalopathy; BarbosaGouveia2020Identification).

## Function
The EARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial glutamyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the attachment of glutamate to its corresponding tRNA molecule within the mitochondria, a critical step in the translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins (Fine2019Mitochondrial; BarbosaGouveia2020Identification). The EARS2 protein consists of 523 amino acids and includes an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal that facilitates its import from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria (BarbosaGouveia2020Identification).

Once inside the mitochondria, EARS2 plays a vital role in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system by ensuring the proper translation of proteins necessary for the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. These complexes are essential for ATP production, which is the primary energy source for cellular processes (Steenweg2012Leukoencephalopathy; Fine2019Mitochondrial). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, impacting cellular respiration and overall cellular metabolism (Fine2019Mitochondrial; BarbosaGouveia2020Identification). Proper functioning of EARS2 is essential for maintaining cellular energy production and overall cellular health, as defects can lead to mitochondrial diseases (BarbosaGouveia2020Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EARS2 gene are associated with a rare mitochondrial disorder known as leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and brainstem involvement and high lactate (LTBL). This condition is characterized by a broad clinical spectrum, ranging from mild neurological symptoms in infantile-onset cases to severe, rapidly progressive central nervous system disease in neonatal or early-infantile onset cases (Steenweg2012Leukoencephalopathy; BarbosaGouveia2020Identification). Patients with EARS2 mutations often exhibit specific MRI patterns, including symmetrical signal abnormalities and swelling in the deep cerebral white matter, thalami, and brainstem, with elevated lactate levels observed in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Steenweg2012Leukoencephalopathy).

The clinical manifestations of LTBL include developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures, spastic tetraparesis, dystonia, and visual impairment (Steenweg2012Leukoencephalopathy). Genetic analysis typically reveals compound heterozygous mutations in the EARS2 gene, which are often rare or absent in genomic databases (Steenweg2012Leukoencephalopathy). These mutations lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, specifically affecting the oxidative phosphorylation system, and are linked to combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency (Gedikbasi2023Clinical). The variability in clinical presentations among patients with EARS2 mutations highlights the complexity of this disorder (BarbosaGouveia2020Identification).
