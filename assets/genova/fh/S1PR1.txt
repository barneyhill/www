# S1PR1

## Overview
S1PR1, or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in critical physiological processes, particularly within the immune and cardiovascular systems. The receptor, characterized by its seven-transmembrane helical structure, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of immune cell trafficking, facilitating the egress of lymphocytes from lymphoid organs in response to the signaling lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) (Matloubian2004Lymphocyte). In the cardiovascular system, S1PR1 is essential for maintaining vascular integrity by promoting endothelial barrier function and vascular maturation (Jozefczuk2020Significance; Liu2000Edg1). The receptor's interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids, such as the long noncoding RNA LISPR1 and the Gi protein, underscore its complex role in cellular signaling pathways (Yuan2021Structures; Josipovic2018Long). Clinically, alterations in the S1PR1 gene are associated with several diseases, including certain cancers and vascular disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wasik2018Clinical; Rostami2019S1PR1).

## Structure
The S1PR1 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane helical bundle structure. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific residues playing crucial roles in ligand binding and receptor activation (Rosen2013Sphingosine-1-Phosphate). The secondary structure includes alpha helices typical of GPCRs, with the N terminus forming a well-ordered α-helix that occludes the binding pocket (Rosen2013Sphingosine-1-Phosphate). 

The tertiary structure of S1PR1 involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, forming a ligand-binding pocket characterized by both polar and hydrophobic interactions. Key residues such as R120, R292, and E121 are involved in electrostatic interactions with ligands like sphingosine-1-phosphate (Rosen2013Sphingosine-1-Phosphate). The receptor's extracellular loops (ECL-1, ECL-2, ECL-3) are stabilized by disulfide bonds, contributing to the structural integrity of the binding pocket (Rosen2013Sphingosine-1-Phosphate).

Post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation at Asn16, are essential for proper receptor folding and function. Mutations at this site can lead to improperly folded receptors (Rosen2013Sphingosine-1-Phosphate). The receptor may also undergo palmitoylation, which influences its signaling functions and internalization (Rosen2013Sphingosine-1-Phosphate).

## Function
S1PR1, or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1, is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a critical role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the regulation of immune cell trafficking, particularly the egress of lymphocytes from the thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs. S1PR1 facilitates the migration of T and B cells by responding to the signaling lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which is crucial for their recirculation in the immune system (Matloubian2004Lymphocyte).

In the cardiovascular system, S1PR1 is essential for maintaining vascular integrity and function. It enhances endothelial barrier integrity by promoting the assembly of adherens and tight junctions, which are vital for preventing vascular leakage and maintaining vascular homeostasis (Takuwa2012Sphingosine‐1‐phosphate; Jozefczuk2020Significance). S1PR1 also plays a role in vascular maturation by facilitating the organization and reinforcement of endothelial walls by mural cells, which is crucial for blood vessel stability (Liu2000Edg1).

S1PR1 signaling is also involved in the regulation of endothelial cell functions, such as migration and junction formation, and is implicated in the modulation of inflammatory responses, highlighting its importance in both immune and vascular systems (Pyne2017Sphingosine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the S1PR1 gene are implicated in various diseases, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), where recurrent mutations are found in 7.8% of patients. These mutations often occur at relapse and lead to reduced expression of the S1PR1 receptor, affecting the migration of MCL cells and contributing to disease progression (Wasik2018Clinical). In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), increased S1PR1 levels are associated with tumor growth and poor survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Rostami2019S1PR1). 

In breast and lung cancers, S1PR1 expression is significantly decreased, correlating with immune cell infiltration and potentially affecting tumor development and prognosis (Zhong2020Prognostic). S1PR1 also plays a role in vascular development, where its absence leads to dysregulated blood flow and vascular leakage, contributing to conditions characterized by impaired vascular integrity (Jung2012FlowRegulated).

Genetic variations in S1PR1, such as nonsynonymous mutations, can influence receptor function and drug interactions, impacting disease susceptibility and treatment outcomes. For instance, certain mutations impair receptor endocytosis, affecting the efficacy of drugs like fingolimod used in multiple sclerosis (Obinata2014Individual).

## Interactions
S1PR1, or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function in cellular signaling pathways. S1PR1 interacts with the long noncoding RNA LISPR1, which is crucial for S1P signaling in endothelial cells. LISPR1 facilitates the binding of RNA Polymerase II to the 5'UTR of the S1PR1 gene, potentially by blocking the transcriptional repressor ZNF354C, thereby enhancing S1PR1 transcription (Josipovic2018Long).

S1PR1 also forms complexes with the Gi protein, a critical component of its signaling mechanism. Structural studies have shown that S1PR1 interacts with the Gi protein and various agonists, with glycosylation at specific residues being essential for receptor activation and surface expression (Yuan2021Structures). The receptor's interaction with β-arrestins is facilitated by serine-threonine phosphorylation, which is necessary for its internalization via a clathrin-dependent pathway. This process involves the recruitment of clathrin, AP-2, and endocytic accessory proteins (Anwar2020Posttranslational).

S1PR1 also modulates immune responses by interacting with the interferon alpha receptor 1 (IFNAR1), leading to its degradation and suppression of STAT1 signaling, which affects the autoamplification of interferon-alpha in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (Teijaro2016S1PR1mediated).
