# TRIM67

## Overview
TRIM67 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 67, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family. This family is characterized by a conserved tripartite motif structure, including a RING domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, which are integral to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Unknownauthors2012TRIMRBCC). The TRIM67 protein plays a significant role in neuronal development, particularly in axon guidance and synaptic plasticity, by interacting with various proteins and influencing cellular processes such as protein ubiquitination and degradation (Boyer2018Mammalian; Menon2020The). It is involved in critical signaling pathways and cellular mechanisms, including the regulation of exocytic modes in neurons and the promotion of full vesicle fusion, which are essential for proper neuronal connectivity and function (Urbina2021TRIM67). The gene's expression and interactions have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its diverse biological roles and clinical significance (Wang2019TRIM67; Demirdizen2021TRIM67).

## Structure
TRIM67 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, characterized by a conserved tripartite motif structure. This structure includes a RING domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, which are integral to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Unknownauthors2012TRIMRBCC). The RING domain is crucial for its ubiquitin-ligase activity, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins (Unknownauthors2012TRIMRBCC). The coiled-coil domain is involved in multimerization, allowing TRIM67 to form homomultimers and potentially interact with other proteins (Unknownauthors2012TRIMRBCC).

TRIM67 also contains additional domains such as COS and FN3, which are necessary for its role in regulating growth cone morphology and axon guidance (Boyer2019A). These domains contribute to the protein's ability to regulate filopodial stability and axon guidance, particularly in response to netrin-1, a guidance cue important for neuronal development (Boyer2019A).

Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, are significant for TRIM67's function, influencing its interactions and regulatory roles in cellular processes (Unknownauthors2012TRIMRBCC). The protein's structure and domain composition enable it to participate in complex cellular mechanisms, including axon branching and growth cone regulation (Boyer2019A).

## Function
TRIM67 is a member of the TRIM protein family, characterized by a tripartite motif that includes a RING finger, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in protein ubiquitination, which regulates protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. TRIM67 is involved in neuronal development and function, influencing processes such as axon guidance and synaptic plasticity (Boyer2018Mammalian; Menon2020The).

In the cellular context, TRIM67 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cellular responses. It interacts with various proteins, including the netrin receptor DCC, and is involved in netrin-dependent axon branching, which is essential for proper neuronal connectivity (Menon2020The). TRIM67 also regulates exocytic modes in neurons by interacting with the t-SNARE protein SNAP47, promoting full vesicle fusion over kiss-and-run fusion, which is crucial for synaptic function and neuronal morphogenesis (Urbina2021TRIM67).

The absence of TRIM67 in mice leads to neuroanatomical defects and behavioral deficits, particularly in spatial learning and memory, highlighting its importance in maintaining neuronal structure and function (Boyer2018Mammalian; Menon2020The).

## Clinical Significance
TRIM67 is implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression or interactions. In oligodendrogliomas, a subtype of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant gliomas, TRIM67 acts as an oncogene. Its overexpression leads to increased tumor growth and reduced survival, primarily through Rho GTPase/ROCK-mediated signaling, which enhances cell motility and reduces adhesion (Demirdizen2021TRIM67). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TRIM67 promotes tumor proliferation and invasion by regulating the Notch signaling pathway, with high expression levels correlating with lower survival rates (Jiang2020TRIM67).

Conversely, in colorectal cancer (CRC), TRIM67 functions as a tumor suppressor. It activates the p53 signaling pathway, and its downregulation, often due to promoter hypermethylation, is associated with poor survival outcomes. TRIM67 deficiency in CRC leads to increased tumor incidence and progression (Wang2019TRIM67). In obesity-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), TRIM67 expression is elevated, promoting hepatic inflammation and lipid accumulation, while its deficiency appears protective against these processes (Huang2022Loss). These findings highlight TRIM67's diverse roles in cancer and metabolic diseases, depending on the tissue context and signaling pathways involved.

## Interactions
TRIM67 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in neuronal development and signaling pathways. It interacts with PRG-1 and PRG-2, proteins involved in the Ras-mediated signaling pathway, and 80K-H, a protein that TRIM67 targets for degradation to regulate Ras activity and promote neuritogenesis (Yaguchi2012TRIM67). The interaction with 80K-H is particularly crucial as TRIM67 promotes its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby negatively regulating Ras activity and influencing neural precursor cell differentiation (Yaguchi2012TRIM67).

TRIM67 also interacts with SNAP47, a t-SNARE protein, influencing exocytic modes and neuronal morphogenesis. This interaction affects the incorporation of SNAP47 into SNARE complexes, which are essential for vesicle fusion processes in neurons. TRIM67 limits the formation of SNAP47 SNARE complexes, promoting full-vesicle fusion and membrane expansion in developing neurons (Urbina2021TRIM67). The interaction with SNAP47 is significant for regulating exocytic modes during neuronal development, impacting membrane dynamics and neuronal morphogenesis (Urbina2021TRIM67).

These interactions highlight TRIM67's role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, influencing protein stability and cellular processes critical for neuronal development.
