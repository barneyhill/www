# ZNF770

## Overview
ZNF770 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 770, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate binding to DNA. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression and plays a role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. Zinc finger protein 770 has been implicated in several biological pathways, particularly those related to metabolic and oncological conditions. Its expression levels have been associated with insulin resistance and breast cancer, suggesting its potential involvement in the pathophysiology of these diseases (Memon2022iPSCs; Zheng2021Expression). Further research is necessary to fully understand the functional implications of ZNF770 and its encoded protein in health and disease.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF770 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In the context of insulin resistance (IR), a study by Memon et al. found that ZNF770 is downregulated in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from offspring of type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients. This downregulation is associated with genetic defects that may contribute to the development of T2D, suggesting a potential role for ZNF770 in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance (Memon2022iPSCs).

In breast cancer, ZNF770 is involved in pathways related to estrogen receptor (ESR1) regulation. The expression of ZNF770 differs significantly between groups with high and low expression of the CBLL1 gene, which is associated with better recurrence-free survival and overall survival in breast cancer patients. This suggests that ZNF770 may play a role in ESR1-related, apoptosis-related, and immune-related pathways in breast cancer (Zheng2021Expression).

While specific diseases directly caused by ZNF770 mutations are not detailed, its involvement in these pathways indicates its potential significance in metabolic and oncological conditions. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which ZNF770 influences these diseases.
