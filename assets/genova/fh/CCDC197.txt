# CCDC197

## Overview
The CCDC197 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 197 protein, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting a potential role in cellular processes that require such interactions. While the specific biological functions of the CCDC197 protein remain to be fully elucidated, proteins with coiled-coil domains are often involved in structural and regulatory roles within the cell. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to determine their precise functions and implications in human health and disease.
