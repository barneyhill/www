# PPP4C

## Overview
The PPP4C gene encodes the protein phosphatase 4 catalytic subunit, a serine/threonine phosphatase that is integral to numerous cellular processes. As a catalytic subunit, PPP4C forms part of the protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) complex, which is involved in critical functions such as microtubule organization, centrosome maturation, and cell cycle progression (HASTIE2000Aa; Cohen2005Protein). The protein is highly conserved across species and shares structural similarities with other phosphatases, such as PP2A, although it possesses unique features that influence its substrate specificity and inhibitor binding (Chattopadhyay2016Crystal). PPP4C's interactions with various regulatory subunits and protein complexes underscore its role in diverse cellular activities, including RNA processing and circadian rhythm regulation (Carnegie2003Protein; Klemz2021Protein). Additionally, alterations in PPP4C expression have been linked to several cancers and reproductive disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Han2020Oligoasthenoteratospermia; Wang2024Comprehensive).

## Structure
The protein phosphatase 4 catalytic subunit (PPP4C) is a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes. While specific details about the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of PPP4C are not provided, it is known to form complexes with regulatory subunits, indicating a quaternary structure. These complexes include interactions with subunits such as R1 and R2, which influence its substrate specificity and catalytic activity (Cohen2005Protein).

PPP4C is highly conserved across species, sharing significant amino acid identity with other phosphatases, such as PP2A isoforms (Cohen2005Protein). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including reversible methyl esterification at its carboxy-terminus, which affects its interaction with regulatory subunits (Cohen2005Protein). This modification is crucial for its function in cellular processes like centrosome maturation and microtubule nucleation (Cohen2005Protein).

The structural similarity of PPP4C to other phosphatases, such as PP2AC, has been noted, although specific structural details are not available (Chattopadhyay2016Crystal). The presence of tryptophan instead of phenylalanine in its binding site affects inhibitor binding, contributing to its selectivity (Chattopadhyay2016Crystal).

## Function
PPP4C, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 4, is a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is predominantly localized at centrosomes and is involved in the nucleation, growth, and organization of microtubules, which are essential for mitotic spindle formation during cell division (HASTIE2000Aa; Carnegie2003Protein). PPP4C is also implicated in centrosome maturation, where it facilitates the recruitment of proteins like γ-tubulin and mitotic kinases such as Plk1 and Aurora A, which are vital for proper cell cycle progression (MartinGranados2008Depletion).

In addition to its role in microtubule dynamics, PPP4C is involved in cell migration by regulating the activation of Rho GTPases, Rac1, and Cdc42, which are key mediators of actin cytoskeleton reorganization (MartinGranados2008Depletion). PPP4C also interacts with the Survival of Motor Neurons (SMN) complex, suggesting a role in RNA processing and snRNP maturation (Carnegie2003Protein). Furthermore, PPP4C modulates circadian rhythms by influencing CLOCK/BMAL1 transcriptional activity, thereby affecting the timing of circadian gene expression (Klemz2021Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PPP4C gene have been implicated in several cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, glioma, colorectal carcinoma, and breast cancer. In lung adenocarcinoma, PPP4C is significantly overexpressed, contributing to enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. This overexpression is associated with poor clinical prognosis and is linked to the modulation of key signaling pathways such as mTOR, JNK, and NF-kB, which are crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation (Wang2024Comprehensive). In glioma, high levels of PPP4C correlate with poor overall survival and are associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Li2016Protein). Similarly, in colorectal carcinoma, elevated PPP4C expression is linked to a more invasive tumor phenotype and poor prognosis, with its role in promoting cell proliferation and invasion being mediated through pathways like NF-κB and m-TOR (Li2015High).

PPP4C is also involved in male fertility, where its deficiency in mice leads to oligoasthenoteratospermia, characterized by low sperm count, poor motility, and abnormal morphology. This condition results from improper cytoplasm reorganization during spermiogenesis, highlighting PPP4C's critical role in normal sperm development (Han2020Oligoasthenoteratospermia).

## Interactions
PPP4C, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 4, engages in various interactions with other proteins, forming complexes that play significant roles in cellular processes. PPP4C forms a complex with the regulatory subunit PPP4R2, which is a 50.4 kDa protein. This interaction has been confirmed both in vitro and in cellular environments, where PPP4C co-sediments with GST-PPP4R2 and is present in immunoprecipitates from transfected cells, indicating a specific binding interaction (HASTIE2000A). The PPP4R2-PPP4C complex is involved in microtubule organization at centrosomes and mitotic spindle formation, as evidenced by its role in γ-tubulin recruitment (HASTIE2000A).

PPP4C also interacts with components of the Survival of Motor Neurons (SMN) complex, including Gemin3 and Gemin4. These interactions suggest a role in the maturation and localization of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), potentially by dephosphorylating components of the SMN complex (Carnegie2003Protein). Additionally, PPP4C is involved in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway by interacting with transcription factors such as c-Rel, enhancing DNA binding activity and transcriptional activation (HASTIE2000A). These interactions highlight PPP4C's involvement in diverse cellular functions, including microtubule organization, RNA processing, and transcriptional regulation.
