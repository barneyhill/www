# BRAT1

## Overview
BRAT1 (BRCA1 associated ATM activator 1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes, including the DNA damage response and mitochondrial homeostasis. The protein encoded by BRAT1 is integral to the activation of ATM serine/threonine kinase, a key player in the DNA damage response pathway, and interacts with the tumor suppressor BRCA1 to facilitate this process (Szymańska2018Clinicopathological). Additionally, BRAT1 is involved in RNA processing through its interaction with the Integrator complex, particularly the INTS9 and INTS11 subunits, which are essential for the proper processing of various RNA species (Cihlarova2022BRAT1). The protein's role extends to maintaining mitochondrial function by regulating oxidative stress and energy production, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis (Li2021Novel). Mutations in the BRAT1 gene are linked to severe neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability and preventing disease (Qi2022Novel; Straussberg2015Lethal).

## Function
The BRAT1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response and cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, BRAT1 interacts with the tumor suppressor BRCA1 and ATM serine/threonine kinase, facilitating the activation of ATM, which is essential for the DNA damage response (Szymańska2018Clinicopathological). BRAT1 is also involved in the regulation of mitochondrial functions, contributing to the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis by regulating oxidative stress and energy production (Li2021Novel).

BRAT1 interacts with the Integrator complex, particularly the INTS9 and INTS11 subunits, which are involved in RNA processing. This interaction is vital for the proper processing of various RNA species, including UsnRNAs and histone pre-mRNAs, ensuring efficient gene expression and transcription regulation (Cihlarova2022BRAT1). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, contributing to cellular homeostasis (Li2021Novel).

BRAT1's role in stabilizing key proteins and complexes highlights its importance in maintaining genomic stability and preventing neurodegenerative processes, underscoring its critical function in cellular and organismal health (Cihlarova2022BRAT1; Szymańska2018Clinicopathological).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BRAT1 gene are associated with a spectrum of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. One of the most severe conditions linked to BRAT1 mutations is Rigidity and Multifocal Seizure Syndrome, Lethal Neonatal (RMFSL), characterized by neonatal microcephaly, intractable seizures, hypertonia, and early death (Pourahmadiyan2020A; Qi2022Novel). This condition often results in early infantile epileptic encephalopathy and is associated with catastrophic epilepsy and corticobasal neuronal degeneration (Straussberg2015Lethal).

BRAT1 mutations also lead to a range of other disorders, including neurodevelopmental disorder with cerebellar atrophy and with or without seizures (NEDCAS), and a milder form known as nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia (NPCA) (Qi2022Novel). The severity of these conditions is influenced by the type and zygosity of the BRAT1 variants, with biallelic null variants typically resulting in more severe phenotypes (Carapancea2023Clinical).

Alterations in BRAT1 expression can lead to increased glucose metabolism, reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, impaired cell growth and migration, and neuronal atrophy (Qi2022Novel). The gene's role in RNA processing and its interaction with the Integrator complex are also crucial, with mutations disrupting these interactions leading to neurodegenerative conditions, particularly those involving cerebellar atrophy and ataxia (Cihlarova2022BRAT1).

## Interactions
BRAT1 (BRCA1 associated ATM activator 1) is known to interact with several key proteins, forming important complexes that are crucial for various cellular processes. In human cells, BRAT1 associates with the INTS11/INTS9 heterodimer, forming a trimeric complex that is essential for the regulation of key neurodevelopmental genes. This interaction is particularly important during the differentiation of NT2 cells into neurons and astrocytes, where BRAT1 helps recruit INTS11 to the promoters of neuronal genes, facilitating their expression (Dokaneheifard2023BRAT1).

BRAT1 also plays a role in RNA processing by stabilizing the INTS11/INTS9 heterodimer within the Integrator complex, which is involved in the 3' end processing of various noncoding RNAs and pre-mRNAs. This interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of the Integrator complex, and defects in BRAT1 can lead to neurodegenerative pathologies due to impaired RNA processing (Cihlarova2022BRAT1).

In Arabidopsis, BRAT1 forms a complex with BRP1, a protein containing a plant homeodomain-like zinc finger domain and an AAA-type ATPase domain. This interaction is involved in preventing transcriptional silencing at certain loci by associating with chromatin (Zhang2016The).
