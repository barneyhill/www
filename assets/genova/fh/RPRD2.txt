# RPRD2

## Overview
RPRD2 (regulation of nuclear pre-mRNA domain containing 2) is a human gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of transcription. The RPRD2 protein is characterized by its interaction with RNA polymerase II, playing a crucial role as a negative transcription factor. It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, immune response, and antiviral activities. The protein's structure includes domains that facilitate its interaction with other proteins, contributing to its regulatory functions. RPRD2 is implicated in several clinical conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer, and has been identified as a potential therapeutic target due to its essential role in the survival of certain cancer cells. Additionally, RPRD2's interaction with the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr highlights its significance in viral replication pathways (Chai2022GenomeWide; Winczura2021RPRD; Gibbons2020HIV1).

## Structure
The RPRD2 gene encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation, featuring specific domains such as the CTD-interacting domain, which facilitates interaction with RNA polymerase II. The protein's structure may include secondary structural elements like alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall 3D conformation. This tertiary structure is crucial for its functional interactions and stability. The protein may also engage in quaternary interactions with other proteins, which are essential for its role in transcriptional regulation.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence the function of the RPRD2 protein, potentially altering its interaction capabilities and regulatory roles. These modifications are critical for the dynamic regulation of its activity in response to cellular signals. Additionally, splice variants of the RPRD2 gene may result in different isoforms, each with distinct functional properties. These isoforms can diversify the protein's regulatory functions and interactions within the cell, allowing for a more nuanced control of transcriptional processes. The presence of these structural and functional features underscores the complexity and versatility of the RPRD2 protein in human cellular processes.

## Function
RPRD2 (regulation of nuclear pre-mRNA domain containing 2) is a protein that plays a significant role in transcription regulation in human cells. It acts as a negative transcription factor by interacting with RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), influencing RNA synthesis and modulating transcriptional processes (Winczura2021RPRD). RPRD2 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly affecting the progression through the S phase into the G2/M phase, highlighting its role as a critical cell growth factor (Winczura2021RPRD).

RPRD2 forms complexes with RPRD1B, but not with RPRD1A, and these complexes regulate transcription differently (Winczura2021RPRD). It is also associated with proteins involved in immune processes, suggesting a potential role in antiviral and stress response processes (Winczura2021RPRD). RPRD2 has been identified as a component in a pathway that suppresses HIV-1 replication, indicating its involvement in immunological responses and viral infection pathways (Winczura2021RPRD; Gibbons2020HIV1).

The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences the expression of genes involved in apoptosis, carcinogenesis, and immune responses, contributing to its role in cellular stress response and transcriptional regulation (Winczura2021RPRD).

## Clinical Significance
The RPRD2 gene has been implicated in several clinical contexts due to its role in gene expression regulation. Variants in the RPRD2 gene, such as rs12758270, rs7002, and rs834230, have been associated with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) and aortic aneurysm and dissection (AAD). These variants are linked to changes in mRNA expression levels of ECM1 and ADAMTSL4, suggesting a potential contribution to the pathophysiology of these cardiovascular conditions (Chai2022GenomeWide).

In the context of cancer, RPRD2 has been identified as a gene preferentially essential for the survival of multiple myeloma cells, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in this malignancy (de2023Genomescale). Additionally, a fusion gene involving RPRD2 (RPRD2-KMT2A) has been identified in a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia, suggesting a possible role in leukemogenesis (Zhao2018The).

RPRD2 also interacts with the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr, which mitigates its antiviral activity. This interaction is crucial for HIV-1 replication, as Vpr downmodulates RPRD2, allowing the virus to replicate more effectively in macrophages and HeLa-CD4 cells (Gibbons2020HIV1). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in both viral infections and cancer.

## Interactions
RPRD2, a human protein, is involved in various interactions that play a significant role in transcription regulation. It interacts with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and is part of complexes that regulate transcriptional processes. RPRD2, along with RPRD1A and RPRD1B, forms mutually exclusive complexes with Pol II, acting as negative regulators of transcription (Ni2011Control; Winczura2021RPRD). These interactions are crucial for controlling the phosphorylation state of the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD), influencing transcription initiation, elongation, and termination (Ni2011Control).

RPRD2 also interacts with proteins involved in immune processes, such as GVINP1 and TRIM21, and with chaperones HSPA1 and HSPA8, suggesting a role in antiviral and stress responses (Winczura2021RPRD). It forms a complex with RPRD1B, but not with RPRD1A, indicating distinct regulatory roles in transcription (Winczura2021RPRD). The interaction between RPRD1B and RPRD2 is mediated by the CC domain of RPRD1B, and these interactions are maintained even in the absence of Pol II, highlighting their stability (Winczura2021RPRD).

RPRD2 also plays a role in the antiviral response by interacting with the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr, which mitigates its antiviral activity by inducing the degradation of RPRD2, facilitating HIV-1 replication in macrophages (Gibbons2020HIV1).
