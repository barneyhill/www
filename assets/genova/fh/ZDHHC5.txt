# ZDHHC5

## Overview
ZDHHC5 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 5, a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyl-acyltransferases. This protein is characterized by its zinc-finger DHHC domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity in catalyzing the S-palmitoylation of proteins. ZDHHC5 is predominantly localized at the plasma membrane and contains multiple transmembrane domains, facilitating its role in various cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity, cell adhesion, and cardiac function (Woodley2021Regulation; Salaun2020Accessory). The protein's activity is regulated through post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which influence its stability and localization (Zmuda2020Regulatory). ZDHHC5 is implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, including neuropsychiatric disorders, cardiac pathologies, and cancer, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Wang2024ZDHHC5mediated; Brigidi2015Activityregulated).

## Structure
The ZDHHC5 protein is a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyl-acyltransferases, characterized by the presence of a DHHC domain essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain includes a zinc-finger cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that coordinates zinc ions, maintaining structural integrity and facilitating the catalytic process (Zmuda2020Regulatory). The protein is primarily localized at the plasma membrane and contains several transmembrane domains, which contribute to its function in palmitoylation (Woodley2021Regulation).

ZDHHC5 has a C-terminal tail that undergoes various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and palmitoylation, which are crucial for its cellular localization and function (Woodley2021Regulation). The C-terminal tail is predicted to be largely unstructured, but it includes a PDZ-binding ligand at the extreme C terminus, which facilitates interactions with other proteins (Woodley2021Regulation). The protein also features an amphipathic helix containing palmitoylated cysteine residues, forming a binding site for regulatory proteins like GOLGA7B (Woodley2021Regulation).

ZDHHC5 is subject to extensive post-translational modifications, with phosphorylation and ubiquitination being predominant. These modifications regulate its stability, localization, and function (Zmuda2020Regulatory). The protein's interaction with other cellular components, such as the sodium pump a-subunit, is independent of its PDZ-binding domain, highlighting its versatile role in cellular processes (Woodley2021Regulation). The presence of splice variants may lead to different isoforms, potentially affecting its structure and function, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
ZDHHC5 is a palmitoyl-acyltransferase enzyme that plays a significant role in the post-translational modification of proteins through S-palmitoylation, which involves the attachment of palmitic acid to cysteine residues. This modification is crucial for protein localization, stability, and function. ZDHHC5 is primarily localized to the plasma membrane, where it influences various cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity, cell adhesion, and cardiac function (Woodley2021Regulation; Salaun2020Accessory).

In the brain, ZDHHC5 is highly expressed in the hippocampus and is involved in synaptic palmitoylation, which is essential for learning and memory. It forms a complex with the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 and palmitoylates proteins like d-catenin, affecting the regulation of AMPA receptor subunits at the postsynaptic density (Woodley2021Regulation). In cardiac cells, ZDHHC5 is involved in the process of massive endocytosis during reoxygenation following oxygen deprivation, affecting the localization of the Na/Ca transporter NCX1 and the sodium pump accessory subunit phospholemman (Woodley2021Regulation).

ZDHHC5 also plays a role in cell adhesion by palmitoylating desmosomal proteins such as desmoglein-2 and plakophilin-3, which is crucial for maintaining cell-cell adhesion (Woodley2021Regulation). Its activity and localization are regulated by phosphorylation and S-acylation, which influence its distribution between the plasma membrane and internal membranes (Zmuda2020Regulatory).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the ZDHHC5 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Alterations in ZDHHC5 expression or interactions can impact synaptic function, contributing to the pathophysiology of conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A de novo nonsense mutation in ZDHHC5 has been reported in patients with schizophrenia, suggesting its potential involvement in these conditions (Brigidi2015Activityregulated). 

In cardiac pathologies, ZDHHC5 expression and substrate palmitoylation show complex and context-dependent roles. In heart failure, ZDHHC5 expression is often reduced, and its palmitoylation is altered, which may affect cardiac function. However, the direct clinical significance of ZDHHC5 mutations or expression changes in heart disease remains to be fully elucidated (Main2022Dynamic).

ZDHHC5 also plays a role in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), where it mediates the S-palmitoylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor progression. Knockdown of ZDHHC5 in glioma cells results in decreased tumor growth and increased survival, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in GBM (Wang2024ZDHHC5mediated).

## Interactions
ZDHHC5, a palmitoyltransferase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the Na/Ca transporter NCX1 and phospholemman, stabilizing them at the plasma membrane through palmitoylation, which is crucial for regulating the cardiac sodium pump (Woodley2021Regulation). ZDHHC5 also forms a complex with GOLGA7, which regulates its cell surface expression and is involved in the palmitoylation of proteins associated with the b2-adrenergic receptor, affecting heart muscle contraction (Woodley2021Regulation).

In the context of viral infections, ZDHHC5 interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, influencing its subcellular localization and entry efficiency into host cells. This interaction is independent of the palmitoylated cysteine residues of the spike protein, suggesting a role in the virus's cellular entry process (Zeng2021The). ZDHHC5 also interacts with the depalmitoylase APT2, but not APT1, indicating a specific role in SARS-CoV-2 infection (Zeng2021The).

ZDHHC5 is part of a protein acyltransferase complex with GOLGA7, which promotes nonapoptotic cell death. This complex is involved in retrograde membrane trafficking and can influence cell death pathways by acylating specific transport substrates (Ko2019A).
