# VIPAS39

## Overview
VIPAS39 is a gene that encodes the protein VPS33B interacting protein, apical-basolateral polarity regulator, spe-39 homolog, which plays a pivotal role in cellular processes related to epithelial cell polarity and vesicular trafficking. This protein is integral to the formation and function of the CHEVI complex, which is crucial for maintaining apical-basolateral polarity in epithelial cells and ensuring proper intracellular trafficking (Cullinane2010Mutations). VIPAS39 interacts with components of the HOPS complex, facilitating endosomal-lysosomal trafficking and influencing the post-Golgi trafficking of proteins such as collagen IV, which is essential for connective tissue integrity (Banushi2016Regulation; Zhu2009SPE39). The protein's interactions with VPS33B and other components underscore its importance in cellular organization and protein localization, impacting processes like cell differentiation and tissue development (Zhu2009SPE39). Deficiencies in VIPAS39 can lead to significant structural defects in the extracellular matrix, highlighting its clinical significance (Chiarelli2019Molecular).

## Structure


## Function
The VIPAS39 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining apical-basolateral polarity in epithelial cells. It forms a complex with VPS33B, which is essential for epithelial polarization and intracellular trafficking processes. This complex interacts with RAB11A, a protein involved in vesicle transport and apical recycling pathways, ensuring proper sorting and stability of membrane proteins (Cullinane2010Mutations). VIPAS39 is involved in the regulation of E-cadherin expression, which is crucial for adherens junction formation and epithelial cell adhesion, maintaining the integrity of epithelial layers (Cullinane2010Mutations).

In healthy human cells, VIPAS39 is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in post-Golgi trafficking, particularly affecting the post-translational modification of collagen IV. This process is vital for collagen homeostasis and the structural integrity of connective tissues (Banushi2016Regulation). Deficiencies in VIPAS39 lead to abnormal collagen modifications, resulting in structural defects in the extracellular matrix (Chiarelli2019Molecular). The protein's role in vesicular trafficking and endosomal sorting is essential for proper protein localization and cellular organization, impacting cell differentiation and tissue development (Banushi2016Regulation).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
VIPAS39, also known as SPE-39 homolog, is a protein that interacts with several components of the HOPS complex, a key player in endosomal-lysosomal trafficking. VIPAS39 forms a complex with HOPS subunits such as VPS11, VPS16, VPS18, VPS39, and VPS41, as demonstrated by co-sedimentation in sucrose gradients and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Zhu2009SPE39). It specifically interacts with VPS16-HA and VPS18-MYC, as well as endogenous hVPS33B (Zhu2009SPE39). 

VIPAS39 also interacts with VPS33A and VPS33B, which are part of the Sec1/Munc18 family, crucial for SNARE localization in endosomal compartments (Zhu2009SPE39). These interactions are evolutionarily conserved, as shown by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HeLa and HEK293 cells (Zhu2009SPE39). 

In addition to its role in the HOPS complex, VIPAS39 is part of a distinct tethering complex known as the CHEVI complex, which includes VPS33B. This complex is involved in various cellular processes, such as α-granule formation in megakaryocytes and Rab11a-dependent apical protein targeting in hepatocytes (Rogerson2018VPS33B). VIPAS39's interactions are essential for its function in vesicular trafficking and lysosomal delivery.
