# PPP4R2

## Overview
The PPP4R2 gene encodes the protein phosphatase 4 regulatory subunit 2, which is a crucial component of the protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) complex. This regulatory subunit is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including neuronal differentiation, circadian rhythm regulation, and cell cycle progression. As a regulatory subunit, PPP4R2 modulates the activity of the catalytic subunit PPP4C, forming a complex that is essential for the phosphatase's function in microtubule organization and centrosome maturation (HASTIE2000A). The protein is also implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms by influencing the phosphorylation and chromatin occupancy of circadian clock components (Klemz2021Protein). Clinically, alterations in PPP4R2 expression and mutations have been associated with various diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy, medulloblastoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and papillary thyroid carcinoma, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathology (Bosio2012PPP4R2).

## Function
PPP4R2 is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 4 (PPP4), which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PPP4R2 is involved in neuronal cell differentiation and survival, particularly through its interaction with the Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) protein. This interaction is significant in the context of spinal muscular atrophy, where PPP4R2 helps modulate neuronal differentiation and survival by cooperating with SMN (Bosio2012PPP4R2).

PPP4R2 is also implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms. It modulates the activity of the circadian clock components CLOCK and BMAL1, influencing the circadian period by affecting BMAL1 phosphorylation and chromatin occupancy. This regulatory function is essential for maintaining normal circadian dynamics in both human and Drosophila cells (Klemz2021Protein).

In terms of cellular localization, PPP4R2 is found at centrosomes, where it forms complexes with the catalytic subunit PPP4C. These complexes are involved in microtubule organization and centrosome maturation, which are critical for cell cycle progression and cell migration (HASTIE2000A). PPP4R2's activity in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PPP4R2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In medulloblastoma, particularly the SHH-subtype, PPP4R2 negatively regulates the tumor suppressor activity of Sufu, leading to enhanced cell growth and proliferation. This suggests that PPP4R2 plays a role in promoting the transcriptional activity of the Shh signaling pathway, contributing to the development of this pediatric brain tumor (Liao2020Protein).

In the context of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), PPP4R2 interacts with the SMN complex, influencing neuronal differentiation and survival. Its depletion impairs neuronal differentiation, while its overexpression can protect against DNA damage-induced apoptosis, indicating a potential role in SMA pathology (Bosio2012PPP4R2).

PPP4R2 is also associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PPP4R2 are linked to treatment-free survival and overall survival in CLL patients, suggesting that genetic variants in PPP4R2 may influence disease progression (Mosquera2019The).

In papillary thyroid carcinoma, PPP4R2 mutations are associated with a higher tumor mutational burden and increased metastasis, indicating a potential role in cancer aggressiveness (Guo2022Genotypes).

## Interactions
PPP4R2, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It forms a complex with the catalytic subunit PPP4C and another regulatory subunit, PPP4R3, indicating its role in a stable multiprotein complex essential for phosphatase activity (Gingras2005A). This interaction is specific to PPP4C, as PPP4R2 does not associate with other phosphatases like PP2AC or PP6C (Gingras2005A).

PPP4R2 also interacts with the Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) complex, which is significant for neuronal function. This interaction, although of low affinity under standard conditions, is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Bosio2012PPP4R2). The interaction with SMN suggests a role in neuronal differentiation and survival, as PPP4R2 knockdown leads to abnormal differentiation, which can be rescued by SMN overexpression (Bosio2012PPP4R2).

In the context of the circadian clock, PPP4R2 interacts with BMAL1, a core component of the circadian machinery. This interaction influences BMAL1's phosphorylation status and chromatin binding, affecting the stability and transcriptional activity of the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex (Klemz2021Protein). These interactions highlight PPP4R2's role in various cellular processes through its participation in multiprotein complexes.
