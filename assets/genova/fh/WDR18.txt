# WDR18

## Overview
WDR18 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 18 protein, a member of the WD40-repeat protein family. This protein is characterized by its seven WD40 repeats, which form a beta-propeller structure that serves as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions. The WD repeat domain 18 protein is involved in several critical cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis and the DNA damage response. It is a component of the Rix1 complex, which is essential for ribosome synthesis and RNA degradation, and it plays a role in DNA damage checkpoint signaling by interacting with TopBP1. Mutations in the WDR18 gene have been associated with developmental disorders and congenital conditions, although the clinical significance of these mutations is not fully understood (Yan2013WD40repeat; Gordon2022CryoEM; Fahed2013Genetics).

## Structure
The WDR18 protein, also known as WD40-repeat protein 18, is characterized by its seven WD40 repeats. These repeats are conserved motifs consisting of 44-60 residues, with a GH dipeptide located 11-24 residues from the N-terminus and a WD dipeptide at the C-terminus. Structurally, each WD40 repeat forms a four-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet, and collectively, the seven repeats create a seven-bladed beta-propeller-like structure (Yan2013WD40repeat). This beta-propeller domain acts as a scaffold, facilitating interactions with proteins, peptides, or nucleic acids (Yan2013WD40repeat).

In the context of the PELP1-WDR18 complex, the WDR18 protein does not contact itself but binds to the PELP1 dimer, with its seven-bladed β-propeller domain interacting extensively with PELP1. The C-terminal tail of WDR18 enters through a gap in the PELP1 scaffold and stretches through the core, with an ordered α-helix (WDR18 α3) interacting with PELP1 protomers (Gordon2022CryoEM). The β-propeller domain of WDR18 acts as a molecular 'cap' that stabilizes the PELP1 dimerization (Gordon2022CryoEM). The C-terminal tail is crucial for its interaction with PELP1, as its deletion significantly reduces binding ability (Gordon2022CryoEM).

## Function
WDR18, a WD40-repeat protein, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, primarily through its involvement in ribosome biogenesis and DNA damage response. In healthy human cells, WDR18 is a component of the Rix1 complex, which includes PELP1, TEX10, and SENP3. This complex is essential for ribosome synthesis and RNA degradation, with WDR18 providing structural support for the assembly and stability of the complex (Gordon2022CryoEM). WDR18's interaction with PELP1 directs its function away from steroid receptor coactivation, focusing instead on roles in ribosome synthesis and heterochromatin maintenance (Gordon2022CryoEM).

WDR18 also collaborates with TopBP1 to facilitate DNA damage checkpoint signaling. It is necessary for ATR-mediated Chk1 phosphorylation, a critical step in the DNA damage response pathway. This interaction helps maintain genomic stability by promoting DNA damage response signaling (Yan2013WD40repeat). The protein's WD40 repeats form a seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, acting as a scaffold for interactions with other proteins, peptides, or nucleic acids, which is vital for its function in these cellular processes (Yan2013WD40repeat).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR18 gene have been implicated in several developmental disorders and congenital conditions. In the context of congenital heart disease (CHD), WDR18 has been associated with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), a complex heart defect. However, the specific clinical significance of WDR18 mutations in CHD is not well-documented, and further research is needed to elucidate its role (Fahed2013Genetics).

In a study involving individuals with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), a de novo missense variant in WDR18 was identified, but it showed only weak evidence of being deleterious. Consequently, it was not considered a significant contributor to the syndrome in that study (Ansari2022Whole). This suggests that while WDR18 may harbor mutations in some developmental disorders, its clinical impact remains uncertain.

Additionally, WDR18 is part of the 5FMC complex involved in ribosome biogenesis, and its interactions with other proteins in this complex are crucial for normal cellular functions. However, specific clinical outcomes resulting from disruptions in these interactions have not been detailed in the available literature (Butterfield2014Congenital). Overall, while WDR18 is linked to certain conditions, its precise clinical significance requires further investigation.

## Interactions
WDR18 is involved in several protein interactions, forming part of the human Rix1 complex, which includes PELP1, TEX10, and SENP3. Within this complex, WDR18 forms a stable subcomplex with the Rix1 domain of PELP1, contributing to the structural integrity of the assembly (Gordon2022CryoEM). The interaction between WDR18 and PELP1 is crucial for the dimerization of PELP1, with WDR18's β-propeller domain acting as a molecular 'cap' that stabilizes the assembly (Gordon2022CryoEM).

WDR18 also interacts with TopBP1, a protein involved in DNA damage checkpoint signaling. This interaction is necessary for ATR-mediated Chk1 phosphorylation, a critical process in the DNA damage response. WDR18 associates with the C-terminus of TopBP1, facilitating the recruitment of proteins necessary for checkpoint signaling (Yan2013WD40repeat).

In the context of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) transcriptional activity, WDR18 interacts with PELP1 to modulate its function. While PELP1 alone can promote ERα transcriptional response, the presence of WDR18 inhibits this coactivation, suggesting a regulatory role in transcriptional regulation (Gordon2022CryoEM).
