# CCDC42

## Overview
CCDC42 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 42 protein, which is characterized by its structural motifs known as coiled-coil domains. These domains are crucial for facilitating protein-protein interactions and oligomerization, playing a significant role in the formation of the male germ cell cytoskeleton (Tapia2019CCDC42; Pasek2016Coiledcoil). The CCDC42 protein is highly conserved across species, including humans and mice, and is associated with the DUF4200 domain, a domain of unknown function (Tapia2019CCDC42). The protein is predominantly expressed in the testis and interacts with outer dense fiber proteins such as ODF1 and ODF2, which are essential for sperm tail formation and stability (Tapia2019CCDC42). These interactions are vital for the structural integrity of the sperm tail, highlighting the gene's importance in male fertility (Tapia2019CCDC42).

## Structure
The CCDC42 protein is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs important for protein-protein interactions and oligomerization, mediating both homodimerization and heterodimerization (Tapia2019CCDC42; Pasek2016Coiledcoil). These domains are conserved across species, including mice and humans, and are associated with the DUF4200 domain, a domain of unknown function shared by coiled-coil domain proteins (Tapia2019CCDC42; Pasek2016Coiledcoil). The human and mouse CCDC42 proteins share an 86% identity in their sequences and have a calculated mass of approximately 38 kDa, consisting of 316 amino acids (Pasek2016Coiledcoil).

CCDC42 has three putative isoforms in mice, produced by alternative splicing. Isoform 203 is the longest, consisting of 316 amino acids, while isoform 201 lacks exon 5, resulting in a 238 amino acid protein. Isoform 202 is 169 amino acids long, missing the N-terminal end encoded by exons 1-4 (Tapia2019CCDC42). The full-length isoform 203 is predominantly expressed in the testis (Tapia2019CCDC42). The protein's interactions with ODF1 and ODF2, which are involved in the formation of the male germ cell cytoskeleton, are likely mediated by the coiled-coil domains (Tapia2019CCDC42). Specific details on the tertiary or quaternary structures, prominent folds, or post-translational modifications of CCDC42 are not provided in the available context.

## Interactions
CCDC42, a protein encoded by the human gene CCDC42, is involved in several protein-protein interactions crucial for the formation of the male germ cell cytoskeleton. It interacts with outer dense fiber proteins ODF1 and ODF2, which are essential components of the sperm tail. These interactions have been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays, demonstrating that CCDC42 physically binds to these proteins. The interaction with ODF2 is likely mediated by their coiled-coil domains, which facilitate oligomerization, contributing to the stabilization of cytoskeletal structures (Tapia2019CCDC42).

CCDC42 localizes to specific structures during spermiogenesis, including the manchette, perinuclear ring, and connecting piece, and is present in the sperm tail, particularly in the principal piece. This localization suggests a role in nuclear shaping and the formation of the acrosome-acroplaxome complex (Tapia2019CCDC42). The protein complex formed by ODF2, ODF1, and CCDC42 is essential for creating the rigid scaffold necessary for the connecting piece and sperm tail, highlighting the importance of these interactions in male fertility (Tapia2019CCDC42).
