# SCGB3A1

## Overview
SCGB3A1 is a gene that encodes the protein secretoglobin family 3A member 1, also known as high in normal-1 (HIN-1) or LuLeu2. This protein is a member of the secretoglobin family, characterized by small, leucine-rich, and hydrophobic proteins that are typically expressed in secretory cells of the airway epithelium (Reynolds2002Secretoglobins). Secretoglobins, including SCGB3A1, often form dimers and are involved in various biological processes, such as regulating epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis (Nomair2021SCGB3A1; Jackson2011Update). SCGB3A1 is considered a candidate tumor-suppressor gene, with its expression frequently reduced in several human cancers due to promoter hypermethylation (Jackson2011Update). The protein plays a significant role in inhibiting cell growth, migration, and invasion, and is linked to the AKT signaling pathway, highlighting its importance in cancer biology and potential as a biomarker for early detection and prognosis (Nomair2021SCGB3A1; Tomita2008Regulation).

## Structure
The SCGB3A1 protein, also known as secretoglobin family 3A member 1, is a small, leucine-rich, and hydrophobic protein predicted to be 104 amino acids in length (Reynolds2002Secretoglobins). It is part of the secretoglobin family, which is characterized by small size and hydrophobic nature. The protein is expressed in secretory cells of the airway epithelium in both mice and humans (Reynolds2002Secretoglobins). 

The molecular structure of SCGB3A1 is suggested to have structural homology with other secretoglobins, such as SCGB1A1, indicating similarities in their molecular structures (Jackson2011Update). Secretoglobins typically form dimers consisting of two four-alpha-helix-bundle monomers, creating a hydrophobic binding pocket (Jackson2011Update). Although specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of SCGB3A1 are not provided, secretoglobins generally assemble into homo- or hetero-dimers held together by covalent disulfide bonds and non-covalent interactions (Jackson2011Update). 

SCGB3A1 is also known as LuLeu2 or HIN-1 and is considered a candidate tumor-suppressor gene, with its expression reduced in several human cancers (Jackson2011Update). The protein's expression is decreased after injury in the bronchial epithelium and is reduced in various malignancies due to hypermethylation of its promoter (Jackson2011Update).

## Function
SCGB3A1, also known as high in normal-1 (HIN-1), is a member of the secretoglobin family, which consists of small secretory proteins. It is primarily expressed in epithelial cells of the lung, trachea, and other epithelial organs, where it plays a significant role in regulating epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis (Reynolds2002Secretoglobins; Nomair2021SCGB3A1). SCGB3A1 functions as a tumor suppressor and is involved in the inhibition of cell growth, migration, and invasion, with its expression linked to the AKT signaling pathway (Tomita2008Regulation).

The gene's expression is regulated by the transcription factor NF-Y, which binds to CCAAT elements in the promoter region, and is influenced by cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 (Tomita2008Regulation). SCGB3A1 is also involved in maintaining terminally differentiated epithelial phenotypes and plays a role in inflammation (Tomita2008Regulation). The protein is expressed in the bronchi and tracheal epithelium, as well as in submucosal glands, indicating its role in the differentiation of secretory cells and the protection of the airway from environmental and infectious agents (Reynolds2002Secretoglobins).

## Clinical Significance
The SCGB3A1 gene, also known as high in normal-1 (HIN-1), is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor. Alterations in its expression, often through promoter hypermethylation, have been associated with the development and progression of several malignancies. In breast cancer, SCGB3A1 promoter hypermethylation is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, particularly in estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive tumors. This hypermethylation is linked to lymph node metastasis and lymphovascular invasion, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for breast cancer (Nomair2021SCGB3A1).

In ovarian cancer, SCGB3A1 is identified as a novel target for hypermethylation, particularly in mucous and clear cell tumors. This methylation is more frequent in early-stage carcinomas, indicating its role in early ovarian carcinogenesis and potential as a biomarker for early detection (Wu2007DNA).

SCGB3A1 expression is also reduced in lung, prostate, pancreatic, and nasopharyngeal cancers, with hypermethylation of its promoter reported in these malignancies, suggesting a broader role in cancer development (Jackson2011Update). The gene's expression is influenced by cytokines, with proinflammatory and Th2 cytokines suppressing its expression, which may contribute to its downregulation in cancer (Jackson2011Update).
