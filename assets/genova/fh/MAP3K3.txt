# MAP3K3

## Overview
MAP3K3, or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. This kinase, also referred to as MEKK3, plays a pivotal role in regulating various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and stress response. The protein encoded by MAP3K3 is integral to the activation of several major MAPKs, such as ERK1, ERK2, p38, JNK, and ERK5, which are crucial for gene expression and cell fate determination (Chang2011The). MAP3K3 is particularly significant in immune cell differentiation and has been implicated in maintaining pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells. Additionally, it is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways, contributing to its role in cancer progression and resistance (Samanta2009MEKK3; Son2008Expression). Mutations and alterations in MAP3K3 have been associated with several diseases, including cerebral cavernous malformations and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target (Fan2013Amplification; Weng2021Somatic).

## Function
MAP3K3, or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in the MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and stress response. In healthy human cells, MAP3K3 is involved in the activation of major MAPKs, including ERK1, ERK2, p38, JNK, and ERK5, which are essential for regulating gene expression and determining cell fate (Chang2011The).

MAP3K3 is particularly important in the context of T cell differentiation, where it negatively regulates transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling. This regulation is crucial for the differentiation of T helper (Th) cell lineages, including Th1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T (Treg) cells. MAP3K3, along with MEKK2, suppresses the differentiation of Treg and Th17 cells through a cell-intrinsic mechanism involving the phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 proteins at their linker regions (Chang2011The).

In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), MAP3K3 is upregulated in the undifferentiated state and downregulated during differentiation. This suggests its role in maintaining pluripotency and the undifferentiated state of hESCs, likely through the activation of the NF-kB and MAPK/ERK pathways (Son2008Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAP3K3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), a vascular disorder affecting the central nervous system, somatic mutations in MAP3K3, specifically the c.1323C>G (p.Ile441Met) mutation, are found in 37% of individuals with simplex CCMs. This mutation enhances MEKK3 kinase activity, activating multiple signaling pathways and is mutually exclusive with mutations in CCM genes, suggesting an alternative pathogenic role (Huo2022Simplex; Weng2021Somatic).

In breast cancer, MAP3K3 is frequently amplified and overexpressed, contributing to tumor cell proliferation and survival. Knockdown of MAP3K3 in amplified breast cancer cell lines significantly inhibits cell proliferation and increases sensitivity to apoptosis-inducing agents, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Fan2013Amplification).

MAP3K3 overexpression is also an early event in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and is associated with poor prognosis. High MEKK3 expression correlates with reduced disease-free survival, making it a potential prognostic marker (Hasan2014Mitogen).

In verrucous venous malformation (VVM), a somatic mutation in MAP3K3 has been identified, suggesting its role in endothelial cell differentiation and association with this vascular anomaly (Couto2015A).

## Interactions
MAP3K3, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It forms protein complexes with Akt, a kinase that also activates NF-κB, suggesting a synergistic effect in promoting NF-κB activity. This interaction leads to the upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, and XIAP, contributing to chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cells (Samanta2009MEKK3).

MAP3K3 is also a component of STRIPAK complexes, which include GCKIII kinases and striatin scaffolding proteins. Within these complexes, MAP3K3 interacts with CCM3/PDCD10, a core member that recruits GCKIIIs to various protein complexes. This interaction is significant in the context of cerebral cavernous malformations (Sugden2013SOcK).

In ovarian carcinoma, MAP3K3 overexpression activates the NF-κB signaling pathway by phosphorylating IκB kinase (IKK), leading to the degradation of IκBα and the release of RelA, which enters the nucleus to activate anti-apoptotic genes. This activation promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and metastasis (Zhang2019Overexpression). These interactions highlight MAP3K3's role in modulating key signaling pathways involved in cancer progression and resistance.
