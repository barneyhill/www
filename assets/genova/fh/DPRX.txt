# DPRX

## Overview
DPRX, or divergent-paired related homeobox, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor protein involved in early embryonic development. This gene is a member of the ETCHbox family, which is characterized by its expression in totipotent cells during the initial stages of embryogenesis, particularly from the 8-cell to morula stages. The protein encoded by DPRX is primarily nuclear and functions as a transcription factor, playing a critical role in regulating gene expression necessary for cell fate determination and embryonic genome activation. Despite its limited transcriptional impact compared to other ETCHbox genes, DPRX has undergone positive selection, indicating its evolutionary importance in developmental processes (Dunwell2016Diversity; Maeso2016Evolutionary; Lewin2021Dynamic).

## Structure


## Function
DPRX is a homeobox gene that plays a role in early embryonic development, particularly during the preimplantation stages. It is part of the ETCHbox gene family, which is expressed in totipotent cells of the early embryo, peaking from the 8-cell to morula stages. This expression pattern suggests that DPRX may be involved in preparing totipotent stages for subsequent cell fate specialization (Dunwell2016Diversity; Maeso2016Evolutionary). 

The gene is expressed predominantly in reproductive tissues and early developmental stages, such as the testis, placenta, oocyte, and preimplantation embryos (Dunwell2016Diversity). Despite its expression, DPRX shows limited transcriptional impact compared to other ETCHbox genes, indicating fewer specific transcriptional effects in healthy human cells (Maeso2016Evolutionary). 

DPRX has undergone positive selection, which suggests it has important roles in development, particularly in preimplantation and embryonic genome activation. This selection is thought to have altered its DNA-binding properties and protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for its function (Lewin2021Dynamic). The gene's activity is primarily nuclear, typical for transcription factors, and it may play a role in regulating gene expression changes that distinguish extra-embryonic and embryonic cell types during development (Maeso2016Evolutionary).
