"The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the pentraxin family which also includes serum amyloid P component protein and pentraxin 3. Pentraxins are involved in complement activation and amplification via communication with complement initiation pattern recognition molecules, but also complement regulation via recruitment of complement regulators. The encoded protein has a calcium dependent ligand binding domain with a distinctive flattened beta-jellyroll structure. It exists in two forms as either a pentamer in circulation or as a nonsoluble monomer in tissues. It is involved in several host defense related functions based on its ability to recognize foreign pathogens and damaged cells of the host and to initiate their elimination by interacting with humoral and cellular effector systems in the blood. Consequently, the level of this protein in plasma increases greatly during acute phase response to tissue injury, infection, or other inflammatory stimuli. Elevated expression of the encoded protein is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) infection.
