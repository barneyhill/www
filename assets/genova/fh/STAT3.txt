# STAT3

## Overview
The STAT3 gene encodes the protein signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, a critical transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, survival, and differentiation. STAT3 is part of the STAT protein family, which is activated by cytokines and growth factors through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Upon activation, STAT3 undergoes phosphorylation, dimerization, and translocation to the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. This protein plays a significant role in immune system regulation, influencing the differentiation and function of various immune cells, and is also involved in cellular metabolism and cancer biology. Dysregulation of STAT3 activity, often due to mutations, is associated with several diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancers, highlighting its importance as a potential therapeutic target (Semenzato2024The; Hillmer2016STAT3).

## Structure
The STAT3 protein is a transcription factor with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form various functional domains. The secondary structure features a combination of alpha helices and beta sheets, including an N-terminal domain composed of a four-helix bundle and an eight-stranded β-barrel (Becker1998Threedimensional). The tertiary structure is characterized by the SH2 domain, which is crucial for dimerization and DNA binding. This domain interacts with phosphotyrosine residues, facilitating the formation of STAT3 dimers (Becker1998Threedimensional).

STAT3 can form homodimers or heterodimers, representing its quaternary structure. The dimerization is mediated by interactions between the SH2 domains and phosphotyrosine residues, such as Tyr705, which is a key site for phosphorylation (Becker1998Threedimensional; Sgrignani2018Structural). Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at Tyr705 and serine 727, acetylation, and methylation, play significant roles in STAT3's activation and function (Sgrignani2018Structural).

STAT3 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with STAT3β being a notable truncated variant lacking certain domains present in STAT3α (Becker1998Threedimensional). These structural features and modifications are critical for STAT3's role in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation.

## Function
STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is activated by cytokines and growth factors, leading to its phosphorylation, dimerization, and translocation to the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression (Levy2002What; Hillmer2016STAT3). STAT3 is involved in both innate and adaptive immunity, influencing the development and function of immune cells such as CD4+ T lymphocytes, B cells, and dendritic cells (Hillmer2016STAT3).

In the immune system, STAT3 is crucial for the differentiation of Th17 cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which are important for host defense and B cell help, respectively (Hillmer2016STAT3). It also regulates granulopoiesis, aiding in the proliferation and mobilization of neutrophils during infections (Hillmer2016STAT3). STAT3's anti-inflammatory role is evident in its ability to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine production and promote the expression of regulatory molecules (Hillmer2016STAT3).

Beyond immunity, STAT3 is involved in cellular respiration and metabolism, associating with mitochondria to regulate the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation (Hillmer2016STAT3). It also plays a role in cell survival by inducing anti-apoptotic genes like Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, contributing to its involvement in cancer biology (Desrivières2006The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STAT3 gene are associated with a range of diseases, primarily due to its role in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in STAT3 are linked to T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL), a disorder characterized by the abnormal expansion of cytotoxic lymphocytes. These mutations are found in approximately 50% of T-LGLL cases and are associated with neutropenia and a higher likelihood of developing autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (Semenzato2024The; Jerez2012STAT3). STAT3 GOF mutations also contribute to multisystem autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, and increased susceptibility to infections (Ott2023JAKs; Fabre2019Clinical).

Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in STAT3 are associated with autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome, characterized by elevated IgE levels, recurrent infections, and various other symptoms (Ott2023JAKs). These mutations impair the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into T H 17 helper cells, affecting immune responses (Ott2023JAKs).

STAT3 mutations are also implicated in chronic lymphoproliferative disorders of NK cells and T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia, where they contribute to the aberrant survival of clonal cells and are associated with autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (Jerez2012STAT3).

## Interactions
STAT3 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling and transcriptional regulation. It forms homodimers upon phosphorylation, which then translocate to the nucleus to bind specific DNA sequences, facilitating gene expression (Becker1998Threedimensional). The STAT3 homodimer grips DNA like a pair of pliers, with the DNA almost entirely enclosed by the protein dimer, involving interactions with loops from the β-barrel and connector domains (Becker1998Threedimensional).

STAT3 also interacts with other proteins, such as c-Jun, to enhance transcriptional activation. This interaction is essential for the maximal enhancer function of certain genes, such as those involved in the acute-phase response (Zhang1999Interacting). Additionally, STAT3 interacts with StIP1, a scaffold protein that facilitates its interaction with JAK kinases, although a stable trimolecular complex with JAKs and StIP1 was not observed (Collum2000A).

In cancer cells, STAT3 interacts with various proteins that modulate its activity. For instance, p300/CREB regulates STAT3 acetylation, crucial for its dimerization and DNA binding, while PIAS3 inhibits its gene activation (Laudisi2018STAT3). These interactions highlight STAT3's role in transcriptional regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
