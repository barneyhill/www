# UHMK1

## Overview
UHMK1 (U2AF homology motif kinase 1) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including mRNA splicing, cell cycle regulation, and neuronal development. The protein product of UHMK1, also known as U2AF homology motif kinase 1, is characterized by its kinase activity and a U2AF homology motif (UHM) that facilitates interactions with splicing factors and other proteins. This kinase is implicated in the phosphorylation of key substrates such as SF1, p27 Kip1, and Stathmin, influencing RNA processing, cell cycle progression, and microtubule dynamics. UHMK1 is expressed in multiple tissues, with significant roles in neuronal cells, where it contributes to synaptic plasticity and neuritic outgrowth. Additionally, UHMK1 has been associated with cancer progression and chemoresistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Arfelli2022UHMK1; Francone2010Signaling; Arfelli2018UHMK1).

## Structure
UHMK1 (U2AF homology motif kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes an N-terminal kinase core and a C-terminal U2AF homology motif (UHM) (Arfelli2018UHMK1). The primary sequence of UHMK1 consists of 282 amino acids in the kinase core, which is essential for its enzymatic activity, particularly the lysine at position 54 (Arfelli2018UHMK1). The UHM is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly with UHM-ligand motifs (ULM) found in splicing factors like SF1 and SF3B1 (Arfelli2022UHMK1; Loerch2016Unmasking).

The secondary structure of UHMK1 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of kinases and UHM-containing proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its interaction with splicing factors and other proteins (Loerch2016Unmasking).

UHMK1 undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at positions Y197, S283, and S290, and lysine-ubiquitination at positions K190, K282, K383, and K387, which may regulate its activity and interactions (Arfelli2018UHMK1). These modifications are significant for its role in cellular processes such as mRNA splicing and cell cycle regulation (Arfelli2022UHMK1).

## Function
UHMK1 (U2AF homology motif kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in RNA processing, particularly mRNA splicing, by interacting with splicing factors such as SF1 and SF3B1, and phosphorylating SF1 to enhance its binding to U2AF65, which is crucial for RNA splicing (Arfelli2018UHMK1). UHMK1 also regulates the phosphorylation of proteins involved in chromatin modification, transcription, and translation, influencing gene expression regulation (Arfelli2022UHMK1).

In the cell cycle, UHMK1 phosphorylates the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 Kip1, leading to its degradation and promoting cell cycle progression (Arfelli2018UHMK1). It also interacts with the microtubule-destabilizing protein Stathmin, affecting microtubule dynamics and cell migration (Arfelli2018UHMK1). UHMK1 is highly expressed in neurons, where it is involved in neuritic outgrowth and synaptic plasticity, enhancing the translation of AMPA receptors and stimulating dendritic spine remodeling (Arfelli2018UHMK1).

UHMK1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, cycling between these compartments to regulate various substrates, including PAM and stathmin in the cytosol, and p27 Kip1 and SF1 in the nucleus (Francone2010Signaling). Its activity is crucial for maintaining proper cellular functions and contributing to processes such as cell differentiation and neuronal development (Arfelli2018UHMK1).

## Clinical Significance
UHMK1 (U2AF homology motif kinase 1) plays a significant role in the progression of various cancers, including gastric, colorectal, and liver cancers, due to its involvement in cell proliferation and chemoresistance. In gastric cancer, UHMK1 is upregulated and promotes cancer progression by enhancing de novo purine synthesis through the phosphorylation of NCOA3, which activates the transcription factor ATF4. This pathway is crucial for tumor aggressiveness and is associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival in patients (Feng2020UHMK).

In colorectal cancer, UHMK1 is linked to chemoresistance, particularly to oxaliplatin, by interacting with the STAT3 signaling pathway. UHMK1 enhances STAT3 activity, creating a positive feedback loop that promotes cell proliferation and drug resistance (Gao2022UHMK1). Similarly, in liver cancer, UHMK1 supports the nuclear enrichment of the oncogene MYBL2, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and cancer cell viability. This interaction is associated with poor patient outcomes and is driven by YAP-dependent mechanisms (Wei2019YAPdependent).

Mutations in UHMK1, such as those associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, can further enhance its activity, contributing to cancer progression and poor clinical outcomes (Feng2020UHMK). These findings suggest that UHMK1 is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in these cancers.

## Interactions
UHMK1 (U2AF homology motif kinase 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the splicing factors SF1 and SF3B1, which are crucial for 3' splice site recognition during spliceosome assembly. UHMK1 phosphorylates these splicing factors, suggesting a role in RNA processing (Arfelli2022UHMK1). It also interacts with STAT3, enhancing STAT3's activity in gene transcription regulation. This interaction forms a positive feedback loop where STAT3 activates UHMK1 expression, contributing to colorectal cancer development and chemoresistance (Gao2022UHMK1).

In colon cancer cells, UHMK1 enhances coilin phosphorylation, a Cajal body protein, affecting 5-FU resistance. This interaction is part of UHMK1's role in regulating Cajal body dynamics and chemoresistance (Niu2022UHMK1dependent). UHMK1 also interacts with MYBL2, a transcription factor involved in cell cycle progression, supporting its nuclear enrichment and influencing liver cancer cell viability (Wei2019YAPdependent).

UHMK1's interactions extend to proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as p27 KIP1, and it is linked to the regulation of cytoskeletal rearrangement and gene expression through its interaction with PAM-CD (Francone2010Signaling). These interactions highlight UHMK1's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and regulation.
