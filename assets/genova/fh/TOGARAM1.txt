# TOGARAM1

## Overview
TOGARAM1 is a gene that encodes the protein TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules 1, which is a crucial component in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, particularly within the axoneme of cilia. This protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein and is integral to the processes of microtubule polymerization and stabilization, which are essential for maintaining ciliary structure and function. The TOGARAM1 protein contains multiple TOG domains, which facilitate its interaction with tubulin and other ciliary proteins, such as ARMC9, to form complexes that are vital for ciliary stability and function. Mutations in the TOGARAM1 gene have been implicated in ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome, highlighting its significance in neurodevelopmental and systemic health (Latour2020Dysfunction; Latour2019ARMC9).

## Structure
The TOGARAM1 protein is a member of the FAM179 protein family and is involved in regulating microtubule dynamics. It contains four conserved TOG domains, which are similar to tubulin-binding domains found in ch-TOG and CLASP family proteins (Latour2020Dysfunction; Latour2019ARMC9). These TOG domains are crucial for the protein's function, particularly in microtubule polymerization and ciliary stability (Latour2019ARMC9). The TOG2 domain, in particular, plays a significant role in promoting microtubule polymerization and is essential for the interaction with ARMC9, another protein associated with Joubert syndrome (Latour2020Dysfunction; Latour2019ARMC9).

The molecular structure of TOGARAM1 includes a series of HEAT repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and contribute to the protein's tertiary structure (Latour2020Dysfunction). The TOG2 domain's structure is characterized by intra-HEAT repeat loops that are important for tubulin binding, with specific residues like Arg368 playing a critical role in this interaction (Morbidoni2020Biallelic). Variants in these domains, such as Arg368Trp and Leu375Pro, can disrupt the protein's structure and function, leading to ciliopathy-associated phenotypes (Morbidoni2020Biallelic; Latour2020Dysfunction).

## Function
TOGARAM1, a member of the Crescerin1 family, plays a crucial role in regulating microtubule dynamics, particularly within the axoneme of cilia. This protein is involved in microtubule polymerization, a process essential for maintaining ciliary structure and function. In healthy human cells, TOGARAM1 is active in the cytoplasm, especially in regions associated with microtubule organization, such as the dendritic cilium of sensory neurons (Morbidoni2020Biallelic). The protein's activity is critical for stabilizing microtubules, facilitating their assembly and disassembly, which is vital for cellular processes like intracellular transport and cell division (Latour2020Dysfunction).

TOGARAM1 interacts with ARMC9 to form a ciliary protein module that is essential for proper post-translational modifications of ciliary microtubules, such as polyglutamylation and acetylation. These modifications are crucial for microtubule stability and the binding of microtubule-associated proteins, which influence protein trafficking and signaling within the cell (Latour2019ARMC9). The protein's function is integral to maintaining ciliary stability and function, impacting processes such as sensory perception and cellular motility (Latour2020Dysfunction). Dysfunction in TOGARAM1 can lead to ciliopathies, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal health (Latour2020Dysfunction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TOGARAM1 gene are associated with Joubert syndrome (JBTS), a ciliopathy characterized by neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and the distinctive "molar tooth sign" on brain imaging. These mutations disrupt the interaction between TOGARAM1 and ARMC9, affecting microtubule binding and polymerization, which are crucial for ciliary function (Latour2020Dysfunction; Latour2019ARMC9). Individuals with JBTS due to TOGARAM1 mutations often present with hypotonia, ataxia, cognitive delays, and sometimes kidney and liver involvement (Latour2020Dysfunction).

In zebrafish models, mutations in TOGARAM1 result in phenotypes typical of ciliopathies, such as pronephric cysts and scoliosis, indicating its role in ciliary stability and function (Latour2020Dysfunction; Latour2019ARMC9). These mutations lead to reduced ciliary length and altered post-translational modifications of tubulin, a key component of cilia (Latour2020Dysfunction).

TOGARAM1 mutations have also been linked to a novel primary ciliopathy, characterized by features overlapping with Meckel-Gruber syndrome, such as cleft lip and palate, microphthalmia, and cerebral dysgenesis (Morbidoni2020Biallelic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TOGARAM1 in ciliary disorders.

## Interactions
TOGARAM1, or TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules 1, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for ciliary function. It interacts with ARMC9, forming a protein module associated with Joubert syndrome (JBTS). This interaction is mediated by the TOG2 domain of TOGARAM1 and the ARM domain of ARMC9, which is essential for microtubule binding and ciliary stability (Latour2020Dysfunction; Saunders2024A). Variants in the TOG2 domain, such as Arg368Trp and Leu375Pro, disrupt this interaction, leading to altered ciliary length and function (Latour2020Dysfunction; Latour2019ARMC9).

TOGARAM1 also interacts with other ciliary proteins, including CEP104, CCDC66, and CSPP1, as part of a ciliary module that regulates axonemal post-translational modifications and cilium stability (Latour2019ARMC9). These interactions are confirmed through various methods, such as co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays (Latour2020Dysfunction; Latour2019ARMC9). The presence of ARMC9 enhances the rescue activity of TOGARAM1, although it does not significantly alter microtubule growth rates (Saunders2024A). These interactions highlight the critical role of TOGARAM1 in maintaining ciliary structure and function, particularly in the context of JBTS.
