# PPARGC1B

## Overview
PPARGC1B, or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-beta, is a gene that encodes a transcriptional coactivator protein involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. The protein, PPARG coactivator 1 beta, is categorized as a transcriptional coactivator and plays a pivotal role in modulating the activity of various nuclear receptors, including estrogen receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, and glucocorticoid receptors. This modulation enhances the expression of genes critical for mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and thermogenesis, thereby influencing cellular energy balance and metabolic processes (Chang2016Functional; Villena2015New). PPARGC1B is particularly significant in lipid metabolism, especially in the liver, where it regulates lipogenesis and the synthesis of very low-density lipoproteins in response to dietary lipids (Villena2015New). Variations in the PPARGC1B gene have been linked to several diseases, including gouty arthritis, breast cancer, asthma, and metabolic disorders, underscoring its importance in health and disease (Chang2016Genetic; Zhang2020PPARGC1B; Wirtenberger2006Associations).

## Function
PPARGC1B (PPARG coactivator 1 beta) is a transcriptional coactivator that plays a crucial role in regulating energy metabolism and mitochondrial function in healthy human cells. It interacts with various nuclear receptors, including estrogen receptors (ERs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), to enhance the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and thermogenesis (Chang2016Functional). 

In the context of mitochondrial function, PPARGC1B is involved in maintaining basal mitochondrial activity, as opposed to PGC-1α, which is more responsive to physiological stimuli and involved in increasing mitochondrial mass under high energy demands (Villena2015New). PPARGC1B is active in the nucleus, where it influences cellular energy balance and metabolic processes, impacting overall energy homeostasis in the organism (Villena2015New).

PPARGC1B also plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the liver, where it regulates lipogenesis and the synthesis and transport of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) in response to dietary lipids (Villena2015New). This regulation is crucial for maintaining lipid homeostasis and preventing conditions such as hepatic steatosis (Villena2015New).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PPARGC1B gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In gouty arthritis, genetic variants of PPARGC1B, particularly the missense SNP rs45520937, are linked to increased expression of NLRP3 and IL-1b, exacerbating inflammation. This SNP is strongly associated with gout, with significant differences in allele frequencies between patients and controls, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis (Chang2016Genetic).

PPARGC1B is also implicated in breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) types. Variants such as Ala203Pro and SNP rs741581 have been associated with increased risk. These polymorphisms may alter the interaction of PPARGC1B with estrogen receptors, influencing cancer development (Li2011Genetic; Wirtenberger2006Associations).

In asthma, the R265Q substitution caused by the +102525G>A polymorphism in PPARGC1B is linked to airway hyperreactivity by modulating estrogen receptor alpha activity, potentially exacerbating asthma symptoms (Chang2016Functional).

PPARGC1B is also associated with nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, highlighting its role in metabolic pathways and disease etiology (Zhang2020PPARGC1B).

## Interactions
PPARGC1B (PPARG coactivator 1 beta) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role as a transcriptional coactivator. It interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), enhancing its transcriptional activity. This interaction is particularly strong with the +102525A variant of PPARGC1B, which shows a higher binding affinity to ERα compared to the +102525G variant, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation assays (Chang2016Functional). 

PPARGC1B also interacts with components of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, particularly MCM4, in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). This interaction is crucial for inhibiting DNA replication and cell proliferation, thereby reducing neointimal lesion formation. The interaction involves the transcription factor AP-1, specifically the c-Jun component, which PPARGC1B inhibits from binding to the MCM4 promoter (Guo2013Peroxisome).

Additionally, PPARGC1B is known to interact with various nuclear receptors, including PPARs and estrogen-related receptors, to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and energy homeostasis (Guo2013Peroxisome). These interactions highlight PPARGC1B's role in modulating transcriptional activity and cellular metabolism.
