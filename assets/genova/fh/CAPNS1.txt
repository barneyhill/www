# CAPNS1

## Overview
CAPNS1 is a gene that encodes the calpain small subunit 1, a regulatory protein integral to the calpain protease complex. This protein is categorized as a regulatory component and plays a crucial role in the stability and function of the calpain system, which is involved in various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and apoptosis. The calpain small subunit 1 interacts with large catalytic subunits, forming heterodimers that are essential for the activation and stability of calpains-1 and -2. The protein's structure includes a Gly-rich domain and a penta-EF-hand domain, which are vital for calcium binding and dimerization, respectively (Spinozzi2021Calpains; Sorimachi2011Impact). CAPNS1 is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including muscle function, cardiovascular health, and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Saez2006The; Piper2020Loss).

## Structure
The CAPNS1 protein, also known as calpain small subunit 1, is a regulatory component of the calpain protease complex. Its molecular structure includes an N-terminal Gly-rich (GR) domain and a penta-EF-hand (PEF) domain, which are crucial for its function. The GR domain contains hydrophobic Gly-clusters that are mostly autolyzed during activation, and this region is described as having a 'soft' structure, being almost invisible in the 3D structure (Ono2012Calpains; Sorimachi2011Impact). The PEF domain is characterized by five repetitive EF-hand motifs with a helix-loop-helix structure involved in calcium binding, essential for the activation of calpain proteases (Spinozzi2021Calpains; Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin).

The tertiary structure of CAPNS1 is stabilized by calcium binding, which influences the protein's conformation. The quaternary structure involves the formation of heterodimers with large catalytic subunits of calpain-1 or calpain-2, facilitated by the fifth EF-hand of the PEF domain acting as a dimerization module (Spinozzi2021Calpains). This interaction is crucial for the stability and function of the calpain complex, as demonstrated by the destabilization of these calpains in mice when CAPNS1 is disrupted (Spinozzi2021Calpains). CAPNS1 also functions as a chaperone-like component for nascent catalytic subunits, essential for their stability in vivo (Ono2012Calpains).

## Function
CAPNS1, also known as calpain small subunit 1, is a crucial component of the calpain system, which is involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the regulation and stability of conventional calpains, specifically CAPN1 and CAPN2, by forming a heterodimer with these calpains through its fifth EF-hand motif. This interaction is essential for the proper folding and activation of calpains, and in the absence of CAPNS1, both CAPN1 and CAPN2 are down-regulated, leading to embryonic lethality in knockout mice (Sorimachi2012Regulation).

CAPNS1 is involved in maintaining normal cell cycles by influencing the expression and degradation of cell cycle regulators such as CDK inhibitors. In osteoblasts, the loss of CAPNS1 increases the expression of CDK inhibitor 1B (p27 Kip1), inhibiting the cyclinD-CDK4 complex and affecting cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin). CAPNS1 also facilitates signal transduction by catalyzing the controlled proteolysis of target proteins, impacting pathways related to cell cycle, cell migration, adhesion, survival, autophagy, and apoptosis (Nian2021Calpain–calpastatin). It is active in the cytoplasm and associated with the plasma membrane, where it influences cellular motility and tissue repair (Piper2020Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CAPNS1 gene, which encodes the calpain small subunit 1, have significant clinical implications. CAPNS1 is crucial for the stability and activity of calpains-1 and -2, and its absence leads to severe muscular dystrophy due to impaired plasma membrane repair in skeletal muscles (Piper2020Loss). The loss of CAPNS1 results in a severe dystrophic phenotype characterized by increased central nucleated fibers, variation in fiber size, and extensive fibrosis and fatty replacement in muscle tissues (Piper2020Loss).

In cardiovascular conditions, CAPNS1 is implicated in myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis, particularly in the context of diabetes, where its disruption can mitigate these conditions (Sorimachi2012Regulation). The gene's role in embryonic development is critical, as its disruption leads to embryonic lethality, highlighting its essential function in fetal development and cardiovascular formation (Arthur2000Disruption; Sorimachi2011Impact).

CAPNS1 is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases, where altered calpain activity is linked to conditions such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases (Saez2006The). These findings underscore the importance of CAPNS1 in maintaining cellular integrity and its potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
CAPNS1, also known as calpain small subunit 1, is a regulatory component of the calpain protease complex. It interacts with the catalytic subunits CAPN1 and CAPN2 to form heterodimeric conventional calpains, which are crucial for the stability of these catalytic subunits (Ono2012Calpains). CAPNS1 has been shown to interact with USP1, a deubiquitinating enzyme, influencing its stability. This interaction is significant for maintaining genome integrity, as CAPNS1 regulates USP1 stability through a calpain/Cdk5/APC/C cdh1/USP1 axis (Cataldo2013CAPNS1). 

In the context of DNA repair, CAPNS1 affects the ubiquitination of PCNA, a process dependent on USP1. CAPNS1 depletion leads to increased PCNA ubiquitination, suggesting that CAPNS1 plays a role in the deubiquitination process (Cataldo2013CAPNS1). Additionally, CAPNS1 is involved in the calpain-dependent processing of p35 to p25, which activates Cdk5, leading to the repression of APC/C cdh1 activity and stabilization of USP1 (Cataldo2013CAPNS1). 

CAPNS1 has also been identified as a potential mediator of caveolin-1-induced apoptosis, with its up-regulation observed in caveolin-1 knockout cells (Kulkarni2013Differential).
