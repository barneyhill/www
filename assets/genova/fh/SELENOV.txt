# SELENOV

## Overview
SELENOV is a gene that encodes the protein selenoprotein V, a member of the selenoprotein family characterized by the presence of the amino acid selenocysteine. Selenoprotein V is primarily involved in redox homeostasis and energy metabolism, functioning as a redox-active protein due to its thioredoxin-like fold and conserved CxxU motif. It plays a crucial role in protecting cells from oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and it is implicated in the regulation of lipid and energy metabolism through its interaction with O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). This interaction influences the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of energy balance. SELENOV is predominantly expressed in the testis, particularly within seminiferous tubules, although it is not essential for fertility. The gene's involvement in metabolic processes suggests potential implications in conditions such as obesity and metabolic dysfunction (Chen2020Knockout; Zhang2020Selenoprotein; Chen2021Loss).

## Function
Selenoprotein V (SELENOV) is involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily related to redox homeostasis and energy metabolism. It is characterized by a thioredoxin-like fold and a conserved CxxU motif, suggesting a potential redox function. SELENOV plays a significant role in protecting cells from oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In experiments, the absence of SELENOV led to increased oxidative damage and cell death when exposed to pro-oxidants, while its overexpression conferred greater protection against oxidative insults (Zhang2020Selenoprotein).

SELENOV also influences lipid and energy metabolism. It acts as an inhibitor of body fat accumulation and an activator of energy expenditure. This is achieved through its interaction with O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), affecting OGT protein levels and activity, which in turn influences the phosphorylation and activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This interaction suggests a potential SELENOV-OGT-AMPK cascade that mediates its metabolic impacts (Chen2021Loss).

SELENOV is predominantly expressed in the testis, particularly in seminiferous tubules, and is present in the cytoplasm and nuclei of cells. Despite its high expression in testis, it does not appear essential for fertility or reproduction (Chen2020Knockout; Chen2021Loss).

## Clinical Significance
The SELENOV gene has been implicated in various metabolic and reproductive conditions. Loss of SELENOV in mice leads to increased fat accumulation and reduced energy expenditure, suggesting its role in obesity and metabolic dysfunction. This is linked to changes in the expression of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism and thermogenesis, such as Cpt1a, Prdm16, Pparγ, Pgc1α, and Ucp1 in brown adipose tissue (Chen2021Loss). SELENOV interacts with O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), affecting OGT protein levels and activity, which in turn influences the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of lipid and energy metabolism (Chen2021Loss). This interaction is crucial as O-GlcNAcylation is associated with metabolic diseases like diabetes and obesity (Chen2021Loss).

In terms of reproductive health, SELENOV is highly expressed in the testis, and its deficiency can lead to azoospermia due to compromised spermatogenesis, indicating its importance in male fertility (Dogaru2023“Alphabet”). However, SELENOV knockout mice did not show significant reproductive changes, except for a slight reduction in sperm count, suggesting its role may not be essential for fertility (Chen2021Loss).

## Interactions
SELENOV (selenoprotein V) is known to interact with O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), forming a protein complex that plays a significant role in metabolic regulation. This interaction was identified through various biochemical techniques, including GST-SELENOV pull-down assays and mass spectrometry, which revealed OGT as a major binding partner with the highest number of matched peptides (Chen2021Loss). The binding between SELENOV and OGT was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK 293T cells, demonstrating the presence of both proteins in a complex (Chen2021Loss).

The interaction between SELENOV and OGT affects OGT activity and protein levels, particularly in adipose tissues, influencing global O-GlcNAcylation, a post-translational modification associated with metabolic processes (Chen2021Loss). This interaction is proposed to impact AMPK activity, a key regulator of energy balance, thereby affecting lipogenesis and lipolysis in SELENOV knockout mice (Chen2021Loss). The SELENOV-OGT interaction suggests a potential regulatory mechanism linking selenium-dependent proteins to energy and lipid metabolism, highlighting SELENOV's role as a modulator of metabolic pathways (Chen2021Loss).
