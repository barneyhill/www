# CPED1

## Overview
The CPED1 gene encodes the protein cadherin-like and PC-esterase domain containing 1, which is involved in cellular adhesion and signaling processes. This protein is characterized by its cadherin-like and PC esterase domains, suggesting roles in cell-cell adhesion and potential enzymatic activity. CPED1 is broadly expressed in various tissues, particularly in bone, and is implicated in maintaining protein integrity and participating in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with proteins such as WNT16 and PPP6R3, indicating its involvement in complex protein networks. The gene has been associated with bone mineral density and immune system functions, with variants linked to conditions like celiac disease and alterations in plasma interleukin 2 levels (Bokhari2020Whole; Gómez2023Multiple).

## Structure
The CPED1 protein is characterized by several predicted domains and structural features. It contains an N-terminal signal peptide that directs the protein to the secretory pathway, suggesting its localization to the cell membrane (Maynard2018Characterization). The protein includes a beta-sandwich domain with a cadherin-like fold, which is related to cell-wall binding domains in prokaryotes and is predicted to function in carbohydrate-binding (Maynard2018Characterization). Additionally, CPED1 has a PC esterase domain with an N-terminal fused ATP-grasp domain, similar to the tubulin-tyrosine ligase family of proteins, suggesting it may interact with and modify glycoproteins by adding amino acids (Maynard2018Characterization).

Alternative splicing of CPED1 results in multiple mRNA isoforms, including exon skipping events that can affect the protein's structure and function. For example, skipping of exons 16 and 17 removes 10 amino acids from the PC esterase domain, potentially altering protein folding and function (Maynard2018Characterization). A truncated isoform spanning exons 1-10 lacks the coding sequence for the cadherin-like and PC esterase domains, indicating a possible alternate function (Maynard2018Characterization). The presence of multiple isoforms suggests diverse roles for CPED1, particularly in osteoblast differentiation (Maynard2018Characterization).

## Function
The CPED1 gene encodes a protein involved in cellular adhesion and signaling processes, characterized by cadherin-like and PC esterase domains. These domains suggest roles in cell-cell adhesion and potential enzymatic activity, respectively (Bokhari2020Whole). The protein is predicted to have an N-terminal signal for secretion, indicating its involvement in the secretory pathway, and is broadly expressed in various tissues, including bone (Gómez2023Multiple). CPED1 is absent in certain cell types like monocyte/macrophage RAW264.7 cells and circulating leukocytes, suggesting its expression in cells residing in the extracellular matrix (Gómez2023Multiple).

CPED1 is implicated in maintaining protein integrity, which may be crucial for its function in healthy cells (Bokhari2020Whole). It is involved in a network of protein-protein interactions, notably with proteins like WNT16 and PPP6R3, suggesting a role in cellular signaling pathways (Bokhari2020Whole). The gene has been associated with bone mineral density (BMD), with evidence of an inverse relationship between CPED1 expression and BMD, indicating a potential regulatory role in bone (Gómez2023Multiple). CPED1's involvement in immune system functions is also suggested, as a variant has been linked to alterations in plasma interleukin 2 levels, important for immune regulation (Bokhari2020Whole).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CPED1 gene have been implicated in celiac disease (CD), particularly in a Saudi family where a rare homozygous missense mutation (c.241 A > G; p.Thr81Ala) was identified. This mutation is associated with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and is extremely rare in the general population, suggesting its potential pathogenicity. The mutation may decrease the stability of the CPED1 protein, affecting its integrity and contributing to CD (Bokhari2020Whole). The CPED1 gene has also been linked to other immune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, through shared genetic pathways (Bokhari2020Whole).

In addition to its role in autoimmune diseases, CPED1 is associated with bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk. Variants at the CPED1-WNT16 locus have pleiotropic effects on BMD and lean mass, indicating a broader influence on musculoskeletal health. However, the specific role of CPED1 in these conditions is less well understood compared to other genes at the locus, such as WNT16 (Gómez2023Multiple). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which CPED1 influences these traits.
