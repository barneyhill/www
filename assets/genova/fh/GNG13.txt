# GNG13

## Overview
GNG13 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit gamma 13, a component of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in signal transduction. These proteins play a critical role in transmitting signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to intracellular pathways, influencing various physiological processes. The G protein subunit gamma 13 is particularly significant in sensory systems, such as vision and olfaction, where it modulates signal transduction pathways at the cell membrane (Rong2004Identification). This modulation is essential for sensory perception and processing. Additionally, GNG13 is involved in the regulation of phospholipase C activity, contributing to the inositol trisphosphate signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining intracellular calcium levels (Rong2004Identification). The protein's expression in specific neuronal cell types, such as Purkinje neurons and retinal bipolar cells, underscores its role in synaptic transmission and sensory processing, highlighting its importance in normal neurological function.

## Structure


## Function
The GNG13 gene encodes the gamma subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, which are crucial for signal transduction processes that link extracellular signals to intracellular responses. In healthy human cells, GNG13 is involved in sensory perception, particularly in the visual and olfactory systems, where it modulates signal transduction pathways at the cell membrane (Rong2004Identification). This modulation influences cellular responses and sensory functions, playing a role in the detection and processing of sensory stimuli.

GNG13 is also implicated in the regulation of phospholipase C (PLC) activity, which is part of the inositol trisphosphate (IP3) signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for various cellular processes, including the regulation of intracellular calcium levels (Rong2004Identification). The protein's activity in the cell membrane allows it to participate in the formation of heterotrimeric G protein complexes, which are vital for transmitting signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to downstream effectors.

In the nervous system, GNG13 is expressed in specific cell types, such as Purkinje neurons and retinal bipolar cells, suggesting a role in synaptic transmission and sensory processing (Rong2004Identification). Its involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal sensory and neurological functions.

## Clinical Significance
GNG13 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In keloid formation, GNG13 is significantly upregulated and is involved in the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. It is regulated by microRNAs such as hsa-mir-372 and hsa-mir-20, suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis of keloids (Li2021Integrated).

In neurodevelopmental disorders, GNG13 is affected by genomic copy number variations (CNVs), which have been observed in conditions like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These CNVs suggest that GNG13 may contribute to the etiology of multiple neurodevelopmental disorders (Zarrei2019A).

GNG13 is also associated with prostate cancer, particularly in the context of SPOP and PTEN mutations. It is identified as a hub gene in studies analyzing differentially expressed genes in prostate cancer, indicating its potential importance in disease progression and treatment strategies (Sun2019Identification; Ding2020Key).

In gliomas, GNG13 expression varies among different subgroups, with higher expression linked to more aggressive tumor types, suggesting its role in tumor progression and potential implications for treatment strategies (Cai2021A).

## Interactions
GNG13, encoding the gamma subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, participates in forming functional G protein complexes by interacting with G protein beta subunits. This interaction is crucial for the assembly and stability of the Gβγ dimer, which plays a significant role in signal transduction processes. The Gγ13 subunit, in particular, has been shown to restore proper primordial germ cell (PGC) migration in zebrafish by forming functional Gβγ dimers that interact with upstream and downstream signaling partners (Mulligan2010Prenylationdeficient).

The Gγ13 subunit is noted for its expression in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and retina, suggesting its involvement in specific signaling pathways within these tissues (Tennakoon2021Subtypedependent). Although specific interactions of GNG13 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, it is implied that Gγ subunits, including Gγ13, contribute to signaling diversity due to their sequence variability (Tennakoon2021Subtypedependent). The C-terminal region of GNG13 may function as a PDZ binding site, potentially influencing its intracellular localization and interactions (Hansen2010Specificity). However, detailed physical interactions of GNG13 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not explicitly described in the available context.
