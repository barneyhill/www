# ACTR1A

## Overview
ACTR1A is a gene that encodes the actin-related protein 1A, a crucial component of the dynactin complex involved in intracellular transport and cytoskeletal dynamics. This protein is categorized as an actin-related protein and plays a significant role in maintaining cell shape, motility, and division by facilitating dynein-mediated transport along microtubules (Hassan2015Distinctive). ACTR1A is also implicated in immune signaling, particularly as a novel regulator of the TLR2 signal cascade, which is essential for pro-inflammatory responses (Mostafa2019Crosslinking; Kamal2019Crosslinking). The gene's involvement in these cellular processes underscores its importance in both normal physiological functions and potential disease pathogenesis, including its interactions with tumor suppressor genes in cancer and its role in neurodevelopmental anomalies (Hassan2015Distinctive; Peltekova2014Novel).

## Function
ACTR1A (actin-related protein 1A) is a component of the dynactin complex, which is crucial for dynein-mediated transport along microtubules. This protein plays a significant role in intracellular transport, cell shape maintenance, and motility, contributing to the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. ACTR1A is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences processes such as cell division and signaling (Hassan2015Distinctive).

In the context of immune signaling, ACTR1A has been identified as a novel regulator of the TLR2 signal cascade. TLR2 is a pattern recognition receptor that initiates pro-inflammatory responses upon interaction with microbial molecules. ACTR1A interacts with TLR2, and its expression is modulated by statin treatment, which can remodel the TLR2 interactome. This interaction suggests that ACTR1A is involved in TLR2-mediated immune signaling pathways, potentially affecting the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Mostafa2019Crosslinking; Kamal2019Crosslinking).

The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular function and responding to external stimuli, which can have broader implications for organismal health and disease pathogenesis (Kamal2019Crosslinking).

## Clinical Significance
The ACTR1A gene, encoding actin-related protein 1A, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular processes. In the context of breast cancer, ACTR1A interacts with BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes through the SPTBN2 gene. This interaction suggests that ACTR1A may influence the function of these critical tumor suppressor genes, potentially impacting breast cancer development. Suppressing SPTBN2 could halt this influence, indicating a possible therapeutic target (Hassan2015Distinctive).

In neurodegenerative disorders, ACTR1A is part of the dynactin complex, which is involved in cellular activities such as mitosis and retrograde axonal transport. Although mutations in other dynactin complex genes like DCTN1 have been linked to neurological disorders, no significant association of ACTR1A with hereditary peripheral neuropathies was found in a study of 136 patients (Tey2016Mutation).

ACTR1A is also included in a chromosomal deletion associated with multiple congenital anomalies, including brain malformations. This deletion suggests a potential role for ACTR1A in neuronal development, although its direct involvement in specific conditions remains unclear (Peltekova2014Novel).

## Interactions
ACTR1A, also known as actin-related protein 1A, is involved in various protein interactions, particularly within the context of the TLR2 signaling pathway. It has been identified as a novel interactor of TLR2, a pattern recognition receptor involved in pro-inflammatory responses. This interaction is modulated by statin treatment, which increases ACTR1A protein levels while inhibiting TLR2 protein expression (Mostafa2019Crosslinking; Kamal2019Crosslinking). ACTR1A's interaction with TLR2 is crucial for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-8, indicating its role in TLR2-mediated inflammatory responses (Mostafa2019Crosslinking).

The study by Kamal et al. utilized cross-linking proteomics to identify ACTR1A as part of the TLR2 interactome, particularly under conditions treated with the TLR2 ligand P3C and statins. This suggests that ACTR1A physically interacts with TLR2 and is involved in the TLR2 signaling pathway (Kamal2019Crosslinking). Additionally, ACTR1A is part of the dynactin complex, which is associated with intracellular transport processes (Kamal2019Crosslinking). These interactions highlight ACTR1A's significant role in modulating immune signaling pathways and its potential impact on inflammation-related processes.
