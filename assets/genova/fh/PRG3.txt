# PRG3

## Overview
PRG3 is a gene that encodes the protein proteoglycan 3, also known as pro eosinophil major basic protein 2. This protein is categorized as a member of the proteoglycan family, which are proteins heavily glycosylated with glycosaminoglycan chains. Proteoglycan 3 is primarily expressed in eosinophils, a type of white blood cell involved in the immune response, particularly in allergic reactions and asthma. The protein plays a role in modulating the immune response and is implicated in the pathophysiology of various inflammatory conditions. Its expression and function are critical for understanding the mechanisms underlying eosinophil-related diseases and may offer potential therapeutic targets for conditions characterized by eosinophilic inflammation.
