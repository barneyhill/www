# ZNF541

## Overview
ZNF541 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 541, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 541 is involved in various biological processes, including gene expression regulation and cellular differentiation. It has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain cancers, such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, where its expression levels are associated with patient prognosis (Du2022Identification; Camuzi2021HPV). Additionally, ZNF541 plays a crucial role in male meiosis, with its deficiency leading to impaired spermatogenesis in mice, underscoring its importance in reproductive biology (Oura2021KCTD19a).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF541 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). In HNSCC, ZNF541 is part of a prognostic model based on fatty acid metabolism-related genes, where its expression is associated with better overall survival, especially in HPV-positive cases (Du2022Identification; Camuzi2021HPV). Low expression of ZNF541 is linked to higher risk scores in prognostic models, suggesting it acts as a protective factor (Wei2022Identification).

In the context of HPV-positive OPSCC, ZNF541 is upregulated and hypomethylated, with its expression correlating with improved overall survival. This suggests that ZNF541 may play a role in the differential expression of genes according to HPV status, potentially impacting prognosis (Camuzi2021HPV).

Beyond cancer, ZNF541 is essential for meiosis in male mice, where its deficiency leads to disrupted spermatogenesis and increased apoptosis in spermatocytes. This highlights its critical role in male fertility, although specific diseases related to ZNF541 mutations in humans are not detailed (Oura2021KCTD19; Oura2021KCTD19a).
