# CCDC152

## Overview
CCDC152 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 152, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the CCDC152 protein may play a role in cellular processes that require such interactions. While the precise biological functions of CCDC152 remain to be fully characterized, it has been implicated in various health conditions, including alcohol use disorder and osteosarcoma, through genetic and epigenetic studies (Li2021Identification; Zou2022Application; Zillich2021Epigenomewide). The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential significance in disease mechanisms and as a prognostic marker, although further research is needed to elucidate its specific roles and interactions within cellular pathways.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
CCDC152 has been implicated in several health conditions through its association with genetic and epigenetic alterations. In the context of alcohol use disorder (AUD), an epigenome-wide association study identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the caudate nucleus linked to AUD, with CCDC152 being one of the top genes associated with these changes (Zillich2021Epigenomewide). However, the study did not specify other diseases or conditions related to mutations or alterations in CCDC152 beyond its association with AUD.

In osteosarcoma, CCDC152 has been identified as part of a six-gene signature for survival prediction. This gene is considered a protective factor, associated with a lower risk of poor prognosis in osteosarcoma patients (Li2021Identification). The study highlights the potential of CCDC152 as a prognostic marker, although it does not elaborate on specific mutations or alterations in the gene itself.

Additionally, CCDC152 has been mentioned as a candidate gene for risk anticipation in osteosarcoma through genomic and transcriptomic data integration, suggesting its potential role in cancer biology (Zou2022Application). Despite these associations, the specific mechanisms by which CCDC152 mutations or expression alterations contribute to these conditions remain to be fully elucidated.
