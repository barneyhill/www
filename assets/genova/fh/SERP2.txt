# SERP2

## Overview
The SERP2 gene encodes a protein known as stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein family member 2, which plays a crucial role in the cellular response to stress. This protein is involved in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and is categorized as a stress response protein. It is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer and immune responses. The SERP2 protein's function in cellular stress responses makes it a significant factor in the pathogenesis of certain diseases, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children with Down syndrome and colon cancer, where its expression levels are linked to disease progression and prognosis (Lundin2011High; Zhai2017Colon). Additionally, its role in immune response is highlighted by its upregulation in dromedary camels with mastitis, suggesting a protective function against infection (Ateya2023Combining).

## Clinical Significance
The SERP2 gene, encoding a stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular stress responses. In the context of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children with Down syndrome (DS-ALL), recurrent deletions of the SERP2 gene have been identified, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of this leukemia subtype (Lundin2011High). Although SERP2 has not been previously associated with neoplasia, its deletion in DS-ALL cases indicates it may contribute to the genetic landscape of this condition (Lundin2011High).

In colon cancer, SERP2 has been identified as a differentially expressed gene associated with cancer recurrence. It is considered a vital prognostic indicator, with its expression linked to survival outcomes in colon cancer patients (Zhai2017Colon). The gene's involvement in pathways related to cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization underscores its significance in tumor progression and recurrence.

In dromedary camels, alterations in SERP2 expression have been associated with mastitis resistance. The gene is upregulated in mastitic camels, indicating its role in the immune response to infection (Ateya2023Combining).
