# EFCAB2

## Overview
EFCAB2 is a gene that encodes the EF-hand calcium binding domain 2 protein, which is involved in calcium ion binding and is characterized by its EF-hand motifs. This protein is categorized as a calcium-binding protein due to its structural features that facilitate calcium ion interaction. The EFCAB2 protein is predominantly expressed in spermatocytes and spermatids, where it localizes to the principal piece of the sperm flagellum, indicating a potential role in sperm motility (Shawki2019EFCAB2). The protein's structure includes seven α-helices and two EF-hand motifs, which are critical for its function in calcium binding (Shawki2019EFCAB2). The molecular weight of EFCAB2 is approximately 18.9 kDa, although it appears as 20 kDa on SDS-PAGE due to its acidic nature (Shawki2019EFCAB2).

## Structure
The EFCAB2 protein is characterized by its molecular structure, which includes seven α-helices and two EF-hand motifs, essential for its calcium-binding function (Shawki2019EFCAB2). The first EF-hand motif is located in the N-terminal region, comprising helix α1, a Ca2+-binding loop, and helix α2, while the second EF-hand motif is in the C-terminal region, involving part of helix α4, a Ca2+-binding loop, and helix α5 (Shawki2019EFCAB2). These motifs are crucial for the protein's ability to bind calcium ions, with specific residues identified as D29, E31, N33, T35, D37, and E40 in the first motif, and D107, A109, R111, F113, T115, and E118 in the second motif (Shawki2019EFCAB2).

The protein's tertiary structure features a V-shaped cleft formed by α1, α2, α4, and α5, which is conserved and located opposite the Ca2+-binding site (Shawki2019EFCAB2). The predicted molecular weight of EFCAB2 is 18.9 kDa, but it appears as 20 kDa on SDS-PAGE, likely due to its highly acidic nature (Shawki2019EFCAB2). The protein is specifically expressed in spermatocytes and spermatids and is localized to the principal piece of the sperm flagellum, suggesting a role in sperm motility (Shawki2019EFCAB2).
