# TRIR

## Overview
The TRIR gene encodes the protein known as telomerase RNA component interacting RNase, which plays a crucial role in the maintenance of telomere integrity. This protein is involved in the processing of telomerase RNA, a critical component of the telomerase complex responsible for the elongation of telomeres, thereby contributing to chromosomal stability and cellular longevity. As a ribonuclease, TRIR is categorized under the class of enzymes that degrade RNA molecules, facilitating the regulation of telomerase activity and ensuring proper telomere function. Dysregulation of TRIR has been implicated in various cellular processes and may have significant implications in aging and cancer biology, where telomere maintenance is often disrupted (Qiu2020aarFDC).
