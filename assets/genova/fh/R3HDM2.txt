# R3HDM2

## Overview
R3HDM2 is a gene that encodes the protein R3H domain containing 2, which is characterized by the presence of the R3H domain, a motif known for its ability to bind single-stranded nucleic acids. This protein is categorized as an RNA-binding protein, suggesting its involvement in RNA processing or regulation. The R3HDM2 protein exhibits a strong binding affinity to AU-rich elements (AREs) in mRNA, indicating a potential role in the metabolism of ARE-containing sequences (Patrucco2015Identification). Additionally, the protein contains the SUZ domain, another RNA-binding motif, which may enhance its interaction with RNA (Itisam2024The). The evolutionary conservation of these domains across species underscores the potential importance of R3HDM2 in conserved RNA-related processes (Cieśla2020The). The gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Pandey2023Differential; Nguyen2021Serine).

## Clinical Significance
The R3HDM2 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its genetic variations and expression alterations. It is associated with a shared risk locus for blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum urate, and sepsis, suggesting a genetic connection between kidney diseases and sepsis (Zhang2024Shared). The gene is also linked to uric acid transport, indicating its potential role in metabolic processes related to these conditions (Zhang2024Shared).

In cancer research, R3HDM2 is differentially expressed in amplified regions of certain tumors, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, glioblastoma multiforme, lung adenocarcinoma, and dedifferentiated liposarcoma. This suggests that R3HDM2 may contribute to tumorigenesis in these cancers (Nguyen2021Serine).

Additionally, R3HDM2 has been identified in studies of Alzheimer's disease, where it is among the genes with differential splicing patterns in a mouse model mimicking the disease. This points to its potential involvement in neurodegenerative processes (Pandey2023Differential).

While these associations highlight the clinical significance of R3HDM2, further research is needed to fully understand its role and implications in disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
R3HDM2 is a protein that contains the R3H domain, which is known for binding single-stranded nucleic acids. This domain suggests that R3HDM2 may play a role in RNA processing or regulation. The protein has been shown to have robust binding specificity to AU-rich elements (AREs) in mRNA, as confirmed by phage ELISA assays and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements, indicating a strong interaction with the ARE PTMA sequence (Patrucco2015Identification). Despite its strong in vitro binding affinity, in vivo studies using a secreted luciferase-based ARE reporter construct did not show significant RNA enrichment in immunocomplexes for R3HDM2, although it was able to enhance luciferase activity, suggesting a potential role in influencing the metabolism of ARE-containing sequences (Patrucco2015Identification).

R3HDM2 is also part of a group of proteins containing the SUZ domain, another RNA-binding motif, which may contribute to its interactions with RNA (Itisam2024The). The evolutionary conservation of the R3H and SUZ domains across various species, including humans, suggests that R3HDM2 may be involved in conserved RNA-related processes (Cieśla2020The). However, specific protein-protein interactions involving R3HDM2 have not been detailed in the provided context.
