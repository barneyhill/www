# FA2H

## Overview
The FA2H gene encodes the enzyme fatty acid 2-hydroxylase, a transmembrane protein integral to the endoplasmic reticulum. This enzyme is pivotal in the hydroxylation of fatty acids, specifically at the C-2 position, contributing to the synthesis of 2-hydroxy fatty acids in sphingolipids. These sphingolipids are essential components of cellular membranes, playing significant roles in various biological processes, including signal transduction and cell differentiation (Eckhardt2023Fatty; Hama2010Fatty). The FA2H protein is characterized by a helical catalytic cap domain and a cytochrome b5 domain, which facilitate its enzymatic activity (Zhu2015The; Uchida2007Fatty). FA2H is notably expressed in myelinating cells of the nervous system, where it is crucial for the maintenance of the myelin sheath, and in the epidermis, contributing to skin barrier function (Eckhardt2023Fatty; Hama2010Fatty). Mutations in the FA2H gene are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its importance in neurological health (Pierson2011Exome; Dick2010Mutation).

## Structure
The FA2H protein, encoded by the FA2H gene, is a transmembrane enzyme involved in the hydroxylation of fatty acids. It shares structural similarities with the yeast homolog Scs7p, which has been studied to provide insights into FA2H's structure. The protein is characterized by a helical catalytic cap domain situated atop four transmembrane helices, forming a mushroom-like shape (Zhu2015The). The catalytic domain contains a dimetal center, typically involving iron, but zinc has been observed in overexpressed structures, coordinated by conserved histidine residues (Zhu2015The). This dimetal center is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity.

FA2H also contains a cytochrome b5 domain, which is responsible for its redox activity, facilitating electron transfer necessary for the hydroxylation process (Uchida2007Fatty). The protein's structure includes 13 helical secondary structures, with the N- and C-termini located on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Zhu2015The). The enzyme's substrate specificity is influenced by the presence of specific residues, such as Tyr-322 and Asp-323, which are important for substrate binding and catalysis (Zhu2015The).

## Function
The FA2H gene encodes the enzyme fatty acid 2-hydroxylase, which is crucial for the synthesis of 2-hydroxy fatty acids (hFA) in sphingolipids. These sphingolipids are significant components of biological membranes and play roles in signal transduction, intracellular trafficking, apoptosis, and cell differentiation (Eckhardt2023Fatty). FA2H is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it catalyzes the hydroxylation of fatty acids at the C-2 position, contributing to the structural diversity of sphingolipids (Hama2010Fatty; Uchida2007Fatty).

In the nervous system, FA2H is highly expressed in myelinating cells such as oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, where it is involved in the synthesis of 2-hydroxy galactosylceramide and 2-hydroxy sulfatide, essential components of the myelin sheath. These lipids are crucial for the long-term maintenance and stability of myelin, supporting axonal integrity (Eckhardt2023Fatty; Hama2010Fatty). FA2H also plays a role in the epidermis, where it is involved in the formation of 2-hydroxy ceramides, contributing to the permeability barrier function of the skin (Uchida2007Fatty; Hama2010Fatty).

The enzyme's activity requires molecular oxygen, Mg2+, NADPH, and cytochrome P450 reductase, and it has two functional domains: an N-terminal cytochrome b5 domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain with transmembrane domains (Hama2010Fatty). FA2H's role in maintaining membrane structure and function is critical for healthy cellular and physiological processes (Eckhardt2023Fatty).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FA2H gene are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, including fatty acid hydroxylase-associated neurodegeneration (FAHN), hereditary spastic paraplegia type 35 (SPG35), and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). FAHN is characterized by spasticity, ataxia, cognitive problems, and leukodystrophy, with iron deposits in the basal ganglia (Eckhardt2023Fatty). SPG35, a subtype of hereditary spastic paraplegia, presents with spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability, and seizures, often accompanied by white matter abnormalities indicative of leukodystrophy (Dick2010Mutation). 

Mutations in FA2H can lead to a reduction in enzyme activity, affecting the hydroxylation of myelin galactocerebroside lipid components, which is crucial for myelin sheath maintenance (Dick2010Mutation). This disruption in myelin integrity can result in progressive neurodegenerative symptoms, including spasticity, dystonia, and cognitive decline (Pierson2011Exome). 

FA2H mutations have also been associated with atypical adult-onset spastic paraparesis, characterized by a thin corpus callosum and mild late-onset phenotype, suggesting partial retention of protein function (Tonelli2012Atypical). Additionally, FA2H gene deletions have been linked to cognitive impairments, highlighting its potential role in autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disabilities (Scheid2013Heterozygous).

## Interactions
The FA2H gene encodes the fatty acid 2-hydroxylase enzyme, which participates in several protein interactions. One significant interaction is with the progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), which binds heme and may function as a heme chaperone. PGRMC1 is involved in delivering heme to the cytochrome b5 domain of FA2H, and its antagonist can reduce FA2H activity (Eckhardt2023Fatty).

FA2H also interacts with the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase gene ALDH3A2. This interaction may inhibit FA2H through a proposed reaction involving a histidine residue in the enzyme's catalytic center, suggesting a close proximity between the two enzymes. This interaction potentially allows ALDH3A2 to protect FA2H (Eckhardt2023Fatty).

In the context of protein-protein interaction mapping, FA2H was studied for interactions using co-immunoprecipitation and BRET assays. These methods confirmed interactions with various proteins, indicating FA2H's involvement in complex protein networks (Sokolina2017Systematic).

These interactions highlight FA2H's role in lipid metabolism and its potential regulatory functions in cellular processes.
