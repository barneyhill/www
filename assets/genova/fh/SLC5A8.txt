# SLC5A8

## Overview
SLC5A8 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 5 member 8, a sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter (SMCT1). This integral membrane protein is characterized by its 13 transmembrane helices and is involved in the transport of short-chain fatty acids and other monocarboxylates, such as lactate and pyruvate, across cell membranes (Wright2013Glucose; Smorodina2022Study). SLC5A8 is expressed in various tissues, including the colon, kidney, and brain, where it plays a crucial role in metabolic regulation and cellular energy balance (Ganapathy2008Sodiumcoupled). The protein's function extends to drug transport, influencing the bioavailability of certain pharmacological agents (Ganapathy2008Sodiumcoupled). Notably, SLC5A8 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression often silenced in cancers due to promoter hypermethylation, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis (Ganapathy2008Sodiumcoupled; Zhang2010Identification).

## Structure
SLC5A8, also known as SMCT1, is a sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter involved in the transport of lactate, pyruvate, and nicotinate. The protein is characterized by its integral membrane structure, featuring 13 transmembrane helices that facilitate its function in transporting short-chain fatty acids across cell membranes (Wright2013Glucose; Smorodina2022Study). 

The structural analysis of SLC5A8 has been enhanced by the use of AlphaFold2, which predicts its three-dimensional structure with high accuracy. The native structure of SLC5A8 and its water-soluble QTY variant, which involves substituting hydrophobic amino acids with hydrophilic ones, show a high degree of structural similarity, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.593 Å (Smorodina2022Structural). This indicates that the QTY variant maintains the overall fold of the native protein, despite significant sequence substitutions (Smorodina2022Structural).

SLC5A8 contains a PDZ-binding motif at its C-terminus, which is crucial for its interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins such as PDZK1. This interaction enhances its transport activity and suggests a role in protein-protein interactions within the cell (Srivastava2019Identification). The expression of SLC5A8 is down-regulated in various tumors due to hypermethylation, indicating its potential involvement in cancer biology (Srivastava2019Identification).

## Function
The SLC5A8 gene encodes a sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter protein that plays a significant role in the uptake of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other monocarboxylates in healthy human cells. This transporter is expressed in various tissues, including the colon, small intestine, kidney, brain, and retina, where it facilitates the absorption and reabsorption of essential metabolites like lactate, pyruvate, and SCFAs (Ganapathy2008Sodiumcoupled; Sivaprakasam2017Short‐Chain).

In the colon, SLC5A8 is located on the apical membrane of epithelial cells, allowing it to access luminal SCFAs produced by bacterial fermentation. These SCFAs act as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, contributing to cellular homeostasis and potentially preventing tumorigenesis (Sivaprakasam2017Short‐Chain). In the brain, SLC5A8 is expressed in neurons, where it is involved in the uptake of lactate and ketone bodies, crucial for maintaining neuronal energy status (Ganapathy2008Sodiumcoupled).

The transporter also plays a role in drug transport, influencing the bioavailability and reabsorption of pharmacologically relevant monocarboxylates and drugs, such as benzoate and salicylate, in the small intestine and renal proximal tubule (Ganapathy2008Sodiumcoupled). Through these functions, SLC5A8 contributes to metabolic regulation and cellular energy balance.

## Clinical Significance
The SLC5A8 gene, encoding a sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter, plays a significant role in tumor suppression. Alterations in its expression, often due to promoter hypermethylation, have been linked to various cancers. In colon, thyroid, stomach, kidney, and brain tumors, SLC5A8 expression is frequently silenced, which is associated with the gene's tumor-suppressive function (Ganapathy2008Sodiumcoupled). This silencing is often due to DNA methylation, which prevents the gene from mediating the uptake of monocarboxylates like butyrate, propionate, and pyruvate, known inhibitors of histone deacetylases that can induce apoptosis in tumor cells (Ganapathy2008Sodiumcoupled).

In papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), SLC5A8 methylation is associated with aggressive tumor features, such as extrathyroidal invasion and lymph node metastasis, and is linked to the presence of the BRAF mutation (Khatami2020Hypermethylated; Hu2006Association). Similarly, in lung cancer, SLC5A8 is often silenced due to hypermethylation, contributing to tumor development and progression (Park2013Gene).

Helicobacter pylori infection has been associated with decreased expression of SLC5A8, potentially contributing to gastric cancer risk (OrellanaManzano2016Helicobacter). The gene's silencing in various cancers underscores its potential as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

## Interactions
SLC5A8, a sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter, is known to interact with the PDZ domain-containing protein PDZK1. This interaction is facilitated by the PDZ-binding motif located at the C-terminus of SLC5A8. The binding of PDZK1 to SLC5A8 enhances the transport activity of the latter, particularly in the context of nicotinate uptake in mammalian cells (Srivastava2019Identification). The interaction between SLC5A8 and PDZK1 is crucial for the formation of a tri-molecular complex with URAT1, which plays a significant role in lactate handling and urate reabsorption in the kidney (Srivastava2019Identification).

In addition to its role in the kidney, SLC5A8 has been implicated in cancer biology. It acts as a tumor suppressor, and its expression is often silenced in various cancers. The reexpression of SLC5A8 in cancer cells can lead to apoptosis and reduced colony formation, suggesting its involvement in regulatory pathways that suppress tumor growth (Zhang2010Identification). The regulation of SLC5A8 expression involves transcription factors such as C/EBPb and Sp1, which enhance its promoter activity and protein expression (Zhang2010Identification).
