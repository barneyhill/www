# PGD

## Overview
Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) is a gene that encodes the enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, a crucial component of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This enzyme is categorized as an oxidoreductase and is primarily involved in the oxidative decarboxylation of 6-phosphogluconate to ribulose-5-phosphate, a reaction that concurrently generates NADPH. NADPH is vital for various cellular processes, including biosynthetic reactions and the maintenance of redox balance, as it serves as a reducing agent in anabolic pathways and aids in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (Sun2019Functional). The PGD gene is expressed in the cytoplasm of human cells, where it supports metabolic flexibility and cellular adaptation to different physiological conditions by influencing glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Sun2019Functional). Alterations in PGD expression or function can have significant clinical implications, particularly in immune regulation, as evidenced by its role in maintaining the suppressive function of regulatory T cells (Daneshmandi20216Phosphogluconate).

## Structure
The human phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) enzyme is encoded by a cDNA clone from a human heart cDNA library. The primary structure of human PGD consists of an open reading frame encoding 483 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of 53,149 daltons and an isoelectric point of 6.85 (Tsui1996Identification). The secondary structure analysis reveals that the protein comprises 36% alpha-helix and 9% beta-sheet, as determined using PROSIS software (Tsui1996Identification).

The tertiary structure of PGD is characterized by its three-dimensional folding, which is crucial for its enzymatic function, although specific details on the tertiary structure are not provided in the context. The quaternary structure of PGD from sheep liver, which is closely related to the human enzyme, is known to form a dimer of identical monomers, each with a subunit molecular weight of 47,000 Da (Tsui1996Identification). This suggests that the human PGD may also form a similar dimeric structure.

The human PGD gene includes a 5' untranslated region of 7 base pairs and a 3' untranslated region of 394 base pairs, with the initiation codon located at nucleotide number 8 and the stop codon at nucleotide number 1457 (Tsui1996Identification). The presence of a consensus initiation sequence, RCCAUGG, at the start of the open reading frame is noted, which is typical for efficient translation initiation in eukaryotic genes (Tsui1996Identification).

## Function
Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), a metabolic pathway parallel to glycolysis. PGD catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of 6-phosphogluconate to ribulose-5-phosphate, producing NADPH in the process. NADPH is essential for various biosynthetic reactions and maintaining cellular redox balance, as it acts as a reducing agent in anabolic reactions and helps in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (Sun2019Functional).

In healthy human cells, PGD is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of redox homeostasis by replenishing NADPH levels. This is particularly important in cells with high biosynthetic demands, as NADPH is required for fatty acid synthesis, cholesterol synthesis, and the maintenance of reduced glutathione levels, which protect cells from oxidative damage (Sun2019Functional).

PGD's activity is also linked to the modulation of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as it influences the levels of metabolic intermediates and supports the metabolic flexibility of cells. This flexibility is crucial for adapting to varying energy demands and maintaining cellular function under different physiological conditions (Sun2019Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PGD gene, which encodes 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), have significant clinical implications. Deficiency in 6PGD within regulatory T cells (Tregs) leads to severe autoimmune conditions. This deficiency results in a loss of Treg suppressive function, causing a shift towards Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell subsets, and is associated with spontaneous fatal autoimmunity. This condition is characterized by enhanced effector phenotypes of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, increased activation markers, and elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-17A, IL-4, and IL-5. The deficiency also results in higher serum antibody titers and increased levels of these cytokines, indicating a profound inflammatory disorder (Daneshmandi20216Phosphogluconate).

In mouse models, the deletion of 6PGD in Tregs leads to a spontaneous fatal autoimmune phenotype, with symptoms including reduced body size, crusting of ears and eyelids, enlargement of peripheral lymphoid organs, and lymphoproliferation. These mice also exhibit a significantly shorter lifespan, highlighting the critical role of 6PGD in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing severe autoimmune conditions (Daneshmandi20216Phosphogluconate).

## Interactions
Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) is involved in several interactions that influence its activity and function within the pentose phosphate pathway. PGD plays a role in regulating the expression of Nrf2, a transcription factor, through a positive feedback loop. This interaction involves PGD promoting the degradation of Keap1, a negative regulator of Nrf2, via p62-dependent autophagy, which stabilizes Nrf2 by reducing its ubiquitination (Ong2020The). Nrf2 also directly binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter region of the PGD gene, enhancing its transcription. This interaction was confirmed through a Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, indicating a regulatory relationship between Nrf2 and PGD (Ong2020The).

PGD's role extends to influencing metabolic pathways, as its inhibition affects glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Inhibition of PGD suppresses glycolysis at the fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate step, impacting downstream glycolytic metabolites and leading to an accumulation of upstream metabolites like fructose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate (Sun2019Functional). These interactions highlight PGD's involvement in both regulatory and metabolic processes, affecting cellular proliferation and survival.
