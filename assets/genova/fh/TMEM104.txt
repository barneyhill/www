# TMEM104

## Overview
TMEM104 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 104, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is an orphan member of the amino acid and auxin permease transporter family, suggesting a potential role in transport processes within cells (Chapel2013An). Although its specific function remains largely unclear, TMEM104 has been localized to lysosomes, indicating a possible involvement in lysosomal function or transport (Chapel2013An). Phylogenetic analysis suggests a distant relationship to the SLC38 family of amino acid transporters, which are known for their dual role as transceptors (Gyimesi2022Systematic). Despite these associations, there is no experimental evidence confirming TMEM104's function as an amino acid transporter, and further research is necessary to fully understand its role in cellular processes.

## Function
TMEM104 is a transmembrane protein whose specific function in healthy human cells remains largely unclear. It has been identified as an orphan member of the amino acid and auxin permease transporter family, suggesting a potential role in transport processes (Chapel2013An). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that TMEM104 might be distantly related to the SLC38 family of amino acid transporters, which are known to function as transceptors, combining transport and receptor activities (Gyimesi2022Systematic). Despite these associations, there is no experimental evidence confirming TMEM104's function as an amino acid transporter.

TMEM104 has been localized to lysosomes, as its distribution overlaps extensively with the lysosomal/late endosomal marker LAMP1, indicating its residence in lysosomes (Chapel2013An). This localization suggests a potential role in lysosomal function or transport, although its precise activities within this organelle are not yet defined. The protein's involvement in lysosomal processes could imply a role in cellular homeostasis and communication, but further research is needed to elucidate its molecular activities and contributions to cell biology.
