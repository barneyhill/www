# OR1L1

## Overview
OR1L1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily L member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a critical role in the detection of odor molecules and the initiation of signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR1L1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is involved in binding specific odorants, contributing to the diversity and specificity of olfactory detection. Notably, OR1L1 is one of the olfactory receptors identified in both humans and chimpanzees, but not in other species such as mice, rats, or dogs, indicating a potential role in species-specific olfactory functions (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

## Function
OR1L1 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are crucial for the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR1L1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

The study by Gonzalez-Kristeller et al. identified OR1L1 as one of the 25 olfactory receptors present in both humans and chimpanzees, but not in other species like mice, rats, or dogs. This suggests a potential role in species-specific olfactory functions (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). The functional analysis of olfactory receptors, including OR1L1, involves the use of heterologous expression systems to screen these receptors against a panel of biologically relevant odorants. This approach helps in understanding the specificity and activation of these receptors by different odorants (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

In healthy human cells, OR1L1, like other olfactory receptors, is involved in the molecular processes of odor detection, which is essential for the sense of smell. This process involves the binding of odorant molecules to the receptor, leading to a cascade of intracellular events that result in the generation of a neural signal perceived as a distinct smell.
