# DYNC2I1

## Overview
The DYNC2I1 gene encodes the dynein 2 intermediate chain 1 protein, a non-catalytic component of the cytoplasmic dynein-2 complex. This protein is integral to the retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) system within cilia, which are essential organelles for cellular signaling and motility (Rao2024Structure). As part of the dynein-2 complex, DYNC2I1 contributes to the structural stability and regulatory functions necessary for the proper operation of cilia, facilitating the movement of IFT particles from the ciliary tip back to the cell body (Rao2024Structure). The protein's interactions with other dynein-2 subunits and its involvement in broader protein networks underscore its critical role in maintaining ciliary function and, consequently, normal cellular and organismal physiology (Rao2024Structure; Pajkos2023Entering).

## Function
The DYNC2I1 gene encodes the cytoplasmic dynein 2 intermediate chain 1 (DC2I1), also known as WDR60, which is a crucial component of the dynein-2 complex. This complex is involved in retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) within cilia, a process essential for the maintenance and function of these organelles (Rao2024Structure). Cilia are hair-like structures on the cell surface that play significant roles in cellular processes such as signal transduction and cellular motility. The dynein-2 complex, including DYNC2I1, facilitates the movement of IFT particles from the ciliary tip back to the cell body, ensuring proper ciliary function (Rao2024Structure).

DYNC2I1, as a non-catalytic subunit, contributes to the stability and regulation of the dynein-2 complex, targeting it to specific cellular locations and mediating interactions with other cofactors. This enhances the functionality of the complex beyond the catalytic heavy chain, which is vital for the proper functioning of cilia (Rao2024Structure). The activity of DYNC2I1 within the ciliary axoneme is crucial for maintaining healthy ciliary activity, which is essential for normal cellular and organismal physiology (Rao2024Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DYNC2LI1 gene are associated with a range of skeletal ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by defects in ciliary function. These conditions include short-rib thoracic dystrophy (SRTD), short rib-polydactyly syndrome (SRPS), Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD), Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EvC), and cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED) (Qiu2022Combinations). The gene encodes a component of the dynein-2 complex, crucial for retrograde trafficking within cilia. Pathogenic variants, particularly when combined with missense variants, can lead to significant ciliary defects (Qiu2022Combinations).

Specific combinations of DYNC2LI1 variants, such as p.(Thr221Ile) and p.(Arg208*), are linked to a spectrum of skeletal ciliopathies ranging from EvC to JATD (Qiu2022Combinations). In DYNC2LI1 knockout cells, some variant combinations result in abnormal cilia length and impaired ciliary function, contributing to the pathogenesis of these conditions (Qiu2022Combinations). The severity of these autosomal recessive ciliopathies is influenced by context-dependent mechanisms involving different combinations of gene variants (Qiu2022Combinations). These genetic variations impair ciliary function by affecting cilia biogenesis and the retrograde trafficking of the IFT machinery, as observed in fibroblasts from SRPS individuals (Qiu2022Combinations).

## Interactions
DYNC2I1, also known as dynein 2 intermediate chain 1, is a component of the cytoplasmic dynein-2 complex, which plays a crucial role in retrograde intraflagellar transport. This protein is involved in several interactions that are essential for its function within the dynein-2 complex. DYNC2I1 interacts with other subunits of the dynein-2 complex, including DYNC2H1 and DYNC2LI1, which are critical for the structural integrity and function of the complex (Rao2024Structure). 

DYNC2I1 is also associated with the force-generating machinery of motile cilia, specifically the inner and outer dynein arms, indicating its role in ciliary movement (Pajkos2023Entering). Although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, DYNC2I1 is part of a network of interactions facilitated by LC8, a protein that connects various ciliary and centrosomal proteins (Pajkos2023Entering). This suggests that DYNC2I1 may be involved in broader protein interaction networks within the ciliary and centrosomal systems, contributing to its role in ciliogenesis and ciliary function (Pajkos2023Entering).
