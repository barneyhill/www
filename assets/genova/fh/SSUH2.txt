# SSUH2

## Overview
The SSUH2 gene encodes the ssu-2 homolog protein, which is involved in various biological processes, including odontogenesis and vascular function. As a transcriptional regulator, the ssu-2 homolog protein plays a critical role in dental development and has been implicated in dentine dysplasia type 1 (DD-1), a hereditary dental disorder characterized by abnormal tooth development and premature tooth loss (Chen2024Abnormal; PitakArnnop2020Clinical). Beyond its dental implications, SSUH2 expression is notable in the kidney vasculature, particularly within endothelial cells of the afferent arteriolar cluster, marking it as a novel gene of interest in renal biology (Jafree2024A). Despite these associations, the broader clinical significance of SSUH2, particularly in non-dental contexts, remains to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to understand its potential roles in other physiological and pathological processes (Jafree2024A).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The SSUH2 gene, also known as ssu-2 homolog, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of dentine dysplasia type 1 (DD-1), a rare autosomal-dominant hereditary disorder affecting dental root development. Although the specific genetic mechanisms remain unclear, missense mutations in SSUH2 have been associated with DD-1, suggesting a role in the disorder's development (Chen2024Abnormal; PitakArnnop2020Clinical). DD-1 is characterized by premature tooth loss and abnormal tooth eruption, and SSUH2 mutations may contribute to these dental abnormalities (Chen2024Abnormal).

In addition to its role in dental disorders, SSUH2 has been identified as a transcriptional regulator associated with odontogenesis, and its expression has been observed in the kidney vasculature. Specifically, SSUH2 is expressed in endothelial cells of the kidney, particularly in the afferent arteriolar cluster, and is considered a novel marker gene in this context (Jafree2024A). However, the clinical significance of SSUH2 mutations in kidney-related conditions or other diseases has not been clearly established, and further research is needed to elucidate its potential impacts (Jafree2024A).
