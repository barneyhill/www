# SOD3

## Overview
SOD3 is a gene that encodes the protein superoxide dismutase 3, also known as extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD). This enzyme is a critical component of the body's antioxidant defense system, primarily functioning in the extracellular space to catalyze the conversion of superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, thereby mitigating oxidative stress (Zachariae2020Extracellular; Fattman2003Extracellular). As a tetrameric enzyme, SOD3 is categorized as an antioxidant enzyme and is predominantly found in the extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces, where it interacts with heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans to maintain its localization (Fattman2003Extracellular). The protein plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including the regulation of nitric oxide bioavailability in the vascular system and the modulation of inflammatory responses (Zachariae2020Extracellular; Fukai2011Superoxide). Alterations in the SOD3 gene have been associated with several diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue health (Griess2017Extracellular; Fattman2003Extracellular).

## Structure
The human SOD3 protein, also known as extracellular superoxide dismutase, is a tetrameric enzyme with a molecular weight of approximately 135 kDa (Nguyen2019Anti-oxidative; Zachariae2020Extracellular). The primary sequence of SOD3 consists of 240 amino acids, including an 18-residue signal peptide that facilitates its secretion into the extracellular space (Zachariae2020Extracellular). The mature form of SOD3 comprises 222 amino acids and is organized into three functional domains: a glycosylation domain (1-95 aa), a catalytic domain (96-193 aa), and a heparin-binding domain (HBD) (Nguyen2019Anti-oxidative).

The secondary structure includes an amphipathic α-helix in the N-terminal region, which supports tetramer formation through hydrophobic interactions (Zachariae2020Extracellular). The central part of SOD3 folds into a β-barrel structure, homologous to SOD1, and contains residues for coordinating Zn2+ and Cu2+ (Zachariae2020Extracellular). The C-terminal region is hydrophilic and adopts an α-helical structure, facilitating interactions with glycosaminoglycans and type I collagen (Zachariae2020Extracellular).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at Asn89, crucial for solubility, and the formation of disulfide bridges, which are essential for enzymatic activity (Nguyen2019Anti-oxidative; Zachariae2020Extracellular). The protein's quaternary structure is a homotetramer composed of disulfide-linked dimers (Nguyen2019Anti-oxidative).

## Function
Superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3), also known as extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD), is an enzyme that plays a critical role in maintaining redox balance in the extracellular space by catalyzing the dismutation of superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. This enzymatic activity is essential for protecting tissues from oxidative stress and maintaining cellular health (Zachariae2020Extracellular; Fattman2003Extracellular).

SOD3 is predominantly found in the extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces, where it interacts with heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which helps maintain its extracellular localization (Fattman2003Extracellular). It is highly expressed in tissues such as the vasculature, lung, kidney, and uterus, where it contributes to the regulation of the extracellular redox environment (Zachariae2020Extracellular).

In the vascular system, SOD3 plays a crucial role in preserving the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) by preventing its reaction with superoxide to form peroxynitrite, a damaging species. This function supports vascular health by maintaining NO levels, which are essential for smooth muscle relaxation and endothelial function (Zachariae2020Extracellular; Fukai2011Superoxide). SOD3 also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by reducing levels of proinflammatory cytokines and modulating the recruitment of inflammatory cells (Zachariae2020Extracellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SOD3 gene, which encodes extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD), have been linked to various diseases. The Arg213Gly mutation affects EC-SOD's heparin-binding affinity, leading to its loss from tissues and contributing to amyloid deposition in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy type 1 (FAP) (Fattman2003Extracellular). This mutation is also associated with increased plasma EC-SOD levels and altered tissue distribution, impacting conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and potentially offering protection against lung cancer in smokers (Griess2017Extracellular).

In diabetes, high glucose levels can lead to nonenzymatic glycation of EC-SOD, reducing its heparin affinity and contributing to vascular complications. The R231G mutation is linked to accelerated renal failure in diabetic patients undergoing hemodialysis (Fattman2003Extracellular). In idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), reduced EC-SOD activity is associated with worse clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with BMPR2 mutations (Zhang2020Alteration).

Altered EC-SOD expression is also implicated in cancer. Its downregulation is observed in various cancers, including breast and lung cancer, where it acts as a tumor suppressor. Low EC-SOD levels correlate with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness (Griess2017Extracellular).

## Interactions
Superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) is known to participate in several protein-protein interactions that influence its function and regulation. SOD3 interacts with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), where active MMP9 upregulates SOD3, while catalytically inactive MMP9 downregulates it. This interaction suggests a regulatory mechanism where MMP9 influences SOD3 levels through both enzymatic and non-enzymatic roles (Gawargi2024Deciphering).

SOD3 also binds to cell surface proteoglycans and components of the extracellular matrix, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans and type I collagen. These interactions facilitate its localization and function in the extracellular environment, acting as an antioxidant and modulating redox processes (Zachariae2020Extracellular; Hu2019The).

In macrophages, SOD3 is internalized through receptor-mediated endocytosis involving the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). This interaction is crucial for the uptake and release of SOD3 in response to inflammatory stimuli, affecting cytokine secretion and the inflammatory response (Hu2019The).

These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of SOD3 in cellular defense mechanisms and its regulation by other proteins.
