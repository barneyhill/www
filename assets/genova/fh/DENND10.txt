# DENND10

## Overview
DENND10 is a gene that encodes the protein DENN domain containing 10, which is a member of the DENN domain family. This protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and is involved in the regulation of endosomal trafficking and extracellular vesicle (EV) release. DENN domain containing 10 plays a critical role in cytoskeletal organization and cell motility by facilitating the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, which are essential for cell spreading and migration. It is also a component of the Commander complex, interacting with proteins such as CCDC22 and CCDC93 to influence endosomal recycling processes (Healy2023Structure; Sun2024Endosomal). The protein's involvement in EV biogenesis and its impact on cancer progression, particularly in breast and gastric cancers, underscore its clinical significance (Sun2024Endosomal).

## Function
DENND10 (DENN domain containing 10) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton and cell motility in healthy human cells. The protein plays a critical role in the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, which are essential for cell spreading and migration. These structures connect the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (ECM) through integrin receptors, maintaining the structural integrity and motility of cells (Sun2024Endosomal).

DENND10 also influences the composition of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which can rectify intracellular cytoskeleton organization when introduced to DENND10-deficient cells. This suggests that DENND10 may regulate cell motility and adhesion through autocrine signaling via EVs (Sun2024Endosomal). The protein is localized in multivesicular late endosomes and lysosomes, which are primary sources of EVs, and its depletion results in decreased EV quantity and altered composition, impairing cell migration due to reduced formation of cytoskeletal structures like focal adhesions and stress fibers (Sun2024Endosomal).

In summary, DENND10 is integral to maintaining cytoskeletal organization and cell motility, primarily through its role in stress fiber formation, focal adhesion assembly, and EV composition regulation.

## Clinical Significance
The DENND10 gene is clinically significant in the context of cancer, particularly breast and gastric cancers. High expression of DENND10 is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, especially those with the luminal B subtype, which is known for its aggressive nature and worse outcomes. This suggests that DENND10 may contribute to the progression of aggressive cancer subtypes (Sun2024Endosomal). In gastric cancer, elevated DENND10 expression correlates with poor overall survival and shorter time to progression, indicating its potential role in cancer advancement (Sun2024Endosomal).

DENND10 is crucial for extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis, which is important for cancer cell migration and metastasis. Knockout studies in breast cancer cells show that loss of DENND10 function leads to impaired EV production and reduced cell migration and invasion capabilities, highlighting its role in metastasis (Sun2024Endosomal). The gene influences the proteomic composition of EVs, affecting cell adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins, which are vital for cell migration (Sun2024Endosomal). Targeting DENND10 could be a promising strategy to inhibit tumor metastasis by altering EV biogenesis and composition (Sun2024Endosomal).

## Interactions
DENND10 is involved in several protein interactions, primarily within the context of endosomal trafficking and extracellular vesicle (EV) release. It is a component of the Commander complex, which is crucial for endosomal recycling. Within this complex, DENND10 interacts with the coiled-coil regions of CCDC22 and CCDC93, forming a stable trimer that is essential for the assembly of the Commander complex (Yong2023Commanding; Healy2023Structure). This interaction is confirmed through in vitro experiments, and mutations in the binding interface of CCDC22 and CCDC93 can disrupt this interaction (Healy2023Structure).

DENND10 also interacts with small GTPases, particularly Rab27a, in a nucleotide-dependent manner. This interaction is significant for its role as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which is crucial for activating Rab small GTPases involved in endosomal sorting and recycling (Sun2024Endosomal). The deletion of DENND10 results in phenotypes similar to Rab27a knockdown, such as reduced EV release and impaired cell migration, highlighting its functional importance in these processes (Sun2024Endosomal).

While DENND10 is part of the DENN domain family, its sequence is highly divergent, and no specific Rab effector proteins have been conclusively identified for it (Healy2023Structure).
