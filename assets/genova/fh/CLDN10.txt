# CLDN10

## Overview
The CLDN10 gene encodes the protein claudin-10, a member of the claudin family, which is integral to the formation and function of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. Claudin-10 is a tetraspan transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in regulating paracellular transport of ions and solutes, contributing to the maintenance of selective permeability barriers in various tissues, including the kidney, skin, and salivary glands. The protein exists in two splice variants, claudin-10A and claudin-10B, which differ in their ion selectivity due to variations in charge distribution. These variants are essential for processes such as sodium chloride reabsorption in the kidney and fluid secretion in glands. Mutations in CLDN10 can lead to significant clinical conditions, such as HELIX syndrome, underscoring its importance in maintaining electrolyte balance and epithelial integrity (HadjRabia2018Multiplex; Krause2008Structure; Yang2022Claudin10).

## Structure
Claudin 10 (CLDN10) is a member of the claudin family, characterized by a tetraspan transmembrane topology, which includes four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops (ECLs) (Krause2008Structure). The ECL1 of CLDN10 has two splice variants, claudin-10A and claudin-10B, which differ in their charge distribution. Claudin-10A has an excess of positive charges, making it more selective for chloride ions (Cl-), while claudin-10B has an excess of negative charges, making it more selective for sodium ions (Na+) (Krause2008Structure).

The secondary structure of claudins typically includes β-strands in ECL1 and α-helices in ECL2 (Krause2008Structure). The quaternary structure involves the formation of tight junction strands, where claudin-10a and -10b form interlocked pore barrels as part of a joined double (quadruple) rows arrangement of claudin subunits (Nagarajan2024Molecular). These arrangements contribute to the formation of tetrameric pore scaffolds, which are crucial for their function in tight junctions (Nagarajan2024Molecular).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and S-acylation regulate the function and localization of claudins, including CLDN10 (Krause2008Structure). The C-terminal of claudins often contains a PDZ-binding motif, facilitating interactions with scaffolding proteins like ZO-1 (Krause2008Structure).

## Function
The CLDN10 gene encodes the protein claudin-10, which is integral to the formation of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. These tight junctions are crucial for maintaining the selective permeability barrier that regulates paracellular transport of ions and solutes. Claudin-10 is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, skin, and salivary glands, where it plays a significant role in ion transport and homeostasis (HadjRabia2018Multiplex).

In the kidney, claudin-10 is particularly important in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of the loop of Henle, where it facilitates the reabsorption of sodium chloride (NaCl) through an electrogenic process that creates a lumen-positive transepithelial potential difference. This potential difference allows for the passive reabsorption of sodium ions along the paracellular pathway, which is essential for maintaining electrolyte balance (HadjRabia2018Multiplex).

Claudin-10 also plays a role in the function of sweat and salivary glands by facilitating the secretion of NaCl. It allows sodium ions to exit the cell across the basolateral membrane and be passively secreted into the lumen along the paracellular pathway, which is crucial for fluid secretion in these glands (HadjRabia2018Multiplex).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLDN10 gene, which encodes the claudin-10 protein, are associated with HELIX syndrome, a condition characterized by hypohidrosis, electrolyte imbalance, lacrimal gland dysfunction, ichthyosis, and xerostomia. These mutations lead to structural destabilization of claudin-10, resulting in its retention in the cytoplasm and impaired function in tight junctions across various tissues (HadjRabia2018Multiplex; MartínezRomero2024HELIX). The syndrome is linked to renal NaCl wasting, causing symptoms such as polyuria and hypermagnesemia, particularly in children (HadjRabia2018Multiplex).

Specific mutations, such as the p.N48K variant, disrupt tight junction strand formation, affecting paracellular cation permeability. This results in conditions like anhidrosis and kidney damage due to impaired Na+ transport in sweat glands and altered cation resorption in the kidneys (Klar2017Altered). The absence of functional claudin-10 in the thick ascending limb of the nephron leads to hypermagnesemia and nephrocalcinosis, highlighting its role in maintaining ion balance (Breiderhoff2012Deletion). These findings underscore the critical role of CLDN10 in epithelial function and its impact on human health when mutated.

## Interactions
Claudin-10 (CLDN10) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in tight junctions. It interacts with other claudins, such as CLDN16, CLDN18, and CLDN19, which are involved in tight junctions and cell-cell adhesion (Rao2021DownRegulated). These interactions are essential for the formation of tight junction strands and the regulation of paracellular transport.

Mutations in CLDN10 can affect its interaction capabilities. For instance, the N48K mutation in claudin-10b disrupts homophilic trans-interactions, which are critical for tight junction formation, leading to fewer and less complex tight junction strands (Klar2017Altered). The G165A mutation in claudin-10b also perturbs trans-interactions, resulting in a more even distribution of the protein and compromised tight junction strand assembly (Sewerin2022Defective).

In the context of cancer, CLDN10 interacts with ATP5O, a mitochondrial protein, in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). This interaction increases ATP5O expression and affects mitochondrial function, which is linked to the suppression of tumor growth and metastasis (Yang2022Claudin10). The interaction between CLDN10 and ATP5O is confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments, highlighting its role in mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer progression (Yang2022Claudin10).
