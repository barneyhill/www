# FGF14

## Overview
FGF14, or fibroblast growth factor 14, is a gene that encodes an intracellular protein belonging to the fibroblast growth factor family, which is known for its involvement in a variety of biological processes, including cell growth, development, and tissue repair. The protein encoded by FGF14 is particularly significant in the central nervous system, where it modulates neuronal excitability and function by interacting with voltage-gated sodium channels, such as Na v 1.2 and Na v 1.6 (Zhang2012Roles). This interaction is crucial for the proper initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. FGF14 is implicated in maintaining the intrinsic excitability of cerebellar Purkinje neurons and is involved in synaptic plasticity, which is essential for learning and memory (Zhang2012Roles). Mutations in the FGF14 gene have been associated with neurological disorders, including spinocerebellar ataxia, highlighting its critical role in neuronal function and health (Miura2019Spinocerebellar).

## Function
FGF14 (fibroblast growth factor 14) is an intracellular protein that plays a significant role in the central nervous system, particularly in modulating neuronal excitability and function. It interacts with voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically Na v 1.2 and Na v 1.6, which are essential for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons (Zhang2012Roles). FGF14 has two alternatively spliced variants, FGF14-1a and FGF14-1b, which differentially regulate these sodium channels, affecting their currents and the voltage dependence of their activation and inactivation (Zhang2012Roles).

FGF14 is crucial for maintaining the intrinsic excitability of cerebellar Purkinje neurons and is involved in the long-term potentiation of synapses in the hippocampal CA1 region, which is important for learning and memory (Zhang2012Roles). In animal models, FGF14 deficiency leads to impaired synaptic plasticity, reduced responses to dopamine receptor agonists, and abnormalities in motor coordination and cognitive functions (Zhang2012Roles). Mutations in FGF14, such as the F145S missense mutation, are associated with progressive spinocerebellar ataxia and cognitive impairment, highlighting its essential role in proper neuronal function and neurotransmission (Zhang2012Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FGF14 gene are linked to several neurological disorders. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 27 (SCA27) is caused by heterozygous variants in FGF14, leading to symptoms such as episodic ataxia, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and cerebellar atrophy (Miura2019Spinocerebellar). A novel nonsense variant, Lys177X, in FGF14 has been identified in a patient with SCA27, resulting in a truncated protein that likely disrupts normal FGF14 function (Miura2019Spinocerebellar).

FGF14 is also associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 50 (SCA50), or ATX-FGF14, due to a novel intronic GAA repeat expansion. This expansion causes adult-onset ataxia characterized by cerebellar dysfunction and impaired motor coordination (Rafehi2022A). The pathogenic threshold for this expansion is considered to be 250 or more repeat units (Bonnet2023Optimized).

Alterations in FGF14 expression are linked to cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia. The deletion of FGF14 in animal models results in a loss of parvalbumin interneurons in the hippocampus, affecting inhibitory neuronal circuits and leading to cognitive deficits (Alshammari2016Genetic). These findings suggest that FGF14 plays a significant role in both neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.

## Interactions
FGF14 interacts with voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels, particularly influencing neuronal excitability. It binds to the C-terminal tails of Nav channels, such as Nav1.6, forming a crucial part of the macromolecular complex that regulates sodium channel function (Wadsworth2020JAK2; Shavkunov2012Bioluminescence). Specific residues in FGF14, like Y153 and V155, are essential for this interaction, and mutations at these sites can disrupt the assembly of the FGF14:Nav channel complex (Shavkunov2012Bioluminescence).

The FGF14 F145S mutation acts as a dominant negative, interfering with the interaction between wild-type FGF14 and Nav channel α subunits, which affects the subcellular distribution of Nav channels and reduces neuronal excitability (Laezza2007TheFGF14F145SMutation). FGF14 also forms homodimers, a process regulated by phosphorylation at the Y158 site by JAK2, which influences its interaction with Nav1.6 (Wadsworth2020JAK2).

Phosphorylation by JAK2 at Y158 destabilizes FGF14 homodimers while promoting the FGF14:Nav1.6 complex, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that shifts the equilibrium towards monomeric FGF14, enhancing its binding to Nav1.6 (Wadsworth2020JAK2). This interaction is crucial for modulating sodium currents and neuronal firing (Wadsworth2020JAK2).
