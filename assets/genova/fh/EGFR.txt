# EGFR

## Overview
The EGFR gene encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, a transmembrane protein that is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family. This receptor plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Upon binding with its ligands, EGFR undergoes dimerization and autophosphorylation, activating its intrinsic kinase activity and triggering downstream signaling cascades. These pathways are crucial for normal cellular functions and are implicated in various physiological processes, including tissue development and repair. Dysregulation of EGFR signaling, often due to mutations or overexpression, is associated with several cancers, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions (Burgess2008EGFR; Gazdar2009Activating).

## Structure
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane protein encoded by the human EGFR gene. It consists of 1210 amino acids, excluding a 24-residue signal peptide, and is organized into several distinct domains (MartinFernandez2019Structure). The extracellular module (ECM) spans residues 1-617 and is responsible for ligand binding. This module includes domains I and III, which have a β-helical fold, and domains II and IV, which are cysteine-rich (Kovacs2015A; Ferguson2008StructureBased).

The transmembrane region is a single α-helix, connecting the ECM to the intracellular module (ICM) (MartinFernandez2019Structure; Kovacs2015A). The ICM includes a juxtamembrane (JM) domain, a kinase domain, and a C-terminal tail. The kinase domain, spanning residues 678-954, is highly conserved and features an N-lobe and a C-lobe, with an ATP-binding site located between them (MartinFernandez2019Structure; Tamirat2021Structural).

EGFR undergoes post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the C-terminal tail, which is crucial for activating downstream signaling pathways (MartinFernandez2019Structure; Tamirat2021Structural). The receptor can form homodimers or heterodimers with other ERBB family members, facilitating its activation and signaling functions (Tamirat2021Structural).

## Function
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in cellular signaling in healthy human cells. Upon binding with its specific ligands, EGFR undergoes a conformational change that leads to its dimerization and autophosphorylation, activating its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. This activation triggers several major intracellular signaling pathways, including the ras/Raf-1/MAPK, PI3Kinase/Akt/mTOR, src/NFKb, catenin/cytoskeleton, and PAK-1/rac systems, which are essential for regulating cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation (Burgess2008EGFR).

EGFR is involved in cross-talk with other signaling systems such as PKC, STATs, steroid receptors, integrins, and wnt pathways, highlighting its role in complex cellular networks (Burgess2008EGFR). In healthy cells, EGFR signaling is vital for normal cellular functions, including tissue development and repair, and is implicated in processes such as embryo implantation and the maturation of the central nervous system (Burgess2008EGFR). EGFR is generally dormant in most tissues until activated by an exogenous ligand, suggesting that its inhibition might not be as toxic as initially thought (Burgess2008EGFR).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EGFR gene are clinically significant in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where they are associated with increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib. The most common mutations that confer drug sensitivity include exon 19 deletions and the L858R point mutation in exon 21, which lead to constitutive activation of the EGFR kinase activity (da2011EGFR; Gazdar2009Activating). These mutations are more prevalent in adenocarcinomas, East Asian populations, women, and never smokers (John2009Overview).

Despite initial responsiveness to TKIs, resistance often develops, primarily due to the T790M mutation, which accounts for 50% to 60% of acquired resistance cases (da2011EGFR). This mutation increases the receptor's affinity for ATP, reducing the effectiveness of TKIs like gefitinib (da2011EGFR). Tumors driven by KRAS and MET oncogenes are typically insensitive to EGFR TKIs (Gazdar2009Activating).

EGFR overexpression is observed in over 60% of patients with metastatic NSCLC and is associated with poor prognosis (Gazdar2009Activating). High EGFR gene copy number, detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), is a predictor of efficacy for EGFR TKIs and is associated with better response rates and survival outcomes (da2011EGFR).

## Interactions
EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling. EGFR interacts with proteins such as Grb2 and Shc through its autophosphorylation sites, particularly tyrosines Y-1068 and Y-1173. Grb2 binds directly to Y-1068 and indirectly through Shc at Y-1173, facilitating the Ras signaling pathway (Batzer1994Hierarchy). EGFR also forms complexes with EphA2 and Ephexin1, where the interaction is enhanced by the phosphorylation of EphA2 at Ser897, mediated by the AKT pathway. This complex is associated with higher tumor grades and metastasis in lung and colorectal cancers (Kim2022Interactions).

EGFR can form homodimers or heterodimers with other ErbB family members, such as ErbB2 and ErbB3, affecting its endocytosis and degradation rates (Sebastian2006The). It also interacts with other cell surface receptors like the PDGF receptor and IGFR, and has been reported to associate with the Fas receptor, influencing cell survival and death (Sebastian2006The). These interactions highlight EGFR's role in diverse signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
