# UBE2O

## Overview
UBE2O is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 O, a unique member of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family. This enzyme is characterized by its dual functionality, acting as both an E2 and E3 ligase, which allows it to ubiquitinate substrates independently of other E3 ligases. The protein plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for protein degradation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. UBE2O is involved in various biological processes, including erythroid differentiation, circadian rhythm regulation, and DNA repair. Its ability to interact with a wide range of substrates and participate in diverse cellular pathways underscores its significance in both normal physiology and disease states, such as cancer and anemia (Nguyen2017UBE2O; Chen2018Ubiquitinconjugating; Ullah2018Diverse).

## Structure
UBE2O is a large ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme with a molecular mass of approximately 141 to 143 kDa, significantly larger than typical E2 enzymes, which range from 20 to 25 kDa (Nguyen2017UBE2O; Ullah2018Diverse). The primary structure of UBE2O consists of 1292 amino acids (Chen2018Ubiquitinconjugating). Its secondary structure includes a ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain with two alpha helices and an antiparallel beta-sheet, and a CR2 domain composed mostly of random coils (Ullah2018Diverse).

The tertiary structure of UBE2O is characterized by its flexibility, allowing interaction with various substrates. It contains several functional domains, including three conserved regions (CR1, CR2, CR3), a coiled-coil (CC) domain, and two nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) (Ullah2018Diverse). The CR1 and CR2 domains are implicated in substrate recognition, with CR2 playing a significant role in the ubiquitination of specific proteins like BMAL1 (Nguyen2017UBE2O; Chen2018Ubiquitinconjugating).

UBE2O functions as an E2/E3 hybrid enzyme, capable of ubiquitinating substrates independently of E3 ligases, which is unusual for E2 enzymes (Ullah2018Diverse). The enzyme's activity is facilitated by a critical cysteine residue in the UBC domain, which serves as the E2 active site (Ullah2018Diverse). The presence of multifunctional domains suggests UBE2O may target a broad spectrum of substrates, performing diverse biological functions (Ullah2018Diverse).

## Function
UBE2O is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a significant role in protein ubiquitination, a process crucial for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. It functions as both an E2 and E3 ligase, allowing it to ubiquitinate substrates independently of other E3 ligases. This enzyme is involved in various types of ubiquitination, including monoubiquitination, multi-monoubiquitination, and polyubiquitination, affecting a wide range of substrates (Ullah2018Diverse).

In healthy human cells, UBE2O is particularly important in erythroid differentiation, where it facilitates the elimination of ribosomal proteins and other substrates during the transition from reticulocytes to erythrocytes. This process is essential for the synthesis of globin and the remodeling of the proteome, which is necessary for proper erythropoiesis (Nguyen2017UBE2O; Ullah2018Diverse).

UBE2O also regulates the circadian clock by promoting the degradation of the transcription factor BMAL1. It interacts with BMAL1, leading to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, which modulates the amplitude of the circadian rhythm without affecting the period (Chen2018Ubiquitinconjugating).

UBE2O's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protein interactions, cellular localization, and degradation, impacting processes such as cell growth, immune response, and circadian rhythm regulation (Ullah2018Diverse).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2O is implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers, due to its role in protein ubiquitination and degradation. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), UBE2O negatively regulates IFIT3, impacting the effectiveness of interferon-α (IFN-α) treatment. High UBE2O expression correlates with resistance to IFN-α, affecting patient prognosis and treatment response (Li2023UBE2O). In prostate cancer, UBE2O targets AMPKa2 for degradation, promoting tumor initiation and progression. This interaction suggests UBE2O as a potential therapeutic target (Vila2017A).

UBE2O is also overexpressed in breast cancer, where it enhances cell proliferation and metastasis through the mTORC1 signaling pathway, indicating a poor prognosis for patients (Liu2020UBE2O). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), UBE2O overexpression is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and lower survival rates, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Chen2020&lt; p&gt; UBE2O).

Beyond cancer, UBE2O mutations can lead to anemia, as seen in erythroid differentiation, where its deficiency results in microcytic hypochromic anemia due to impaired ribosome elimination (Nguyen2017UBE2O). These findings underscore the clinical significance of UBE2O in disease development and progression.

## Interactions
UBE2O, an atypical ubiquitin ligase with both E2 and E3 activities, participates in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with RECQL4, a protein involved in DNA repair, through the Sld2-like domain of RECQL4 and the CR2 domain of UBE2O. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitinylation and subsequent degradation of RECQL4, affecting homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair (Huang2021UBE2O). UBE2O also interacts with USP7, a deubiquitinating enzyme, which counteracts UBE2O's effect on RECQL4, stabilizing the protein and promoting DNA repair (Huang2021UBE2O).

UBE2O is involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling by interacting with TRAF6. It disrupts the interaction between TRAF6 and MyD88, inhibiting TRAF6 polyubiquitination and subsequent NF-κB activation (Zhang2013UBE2O). UBE2O also interacts with the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) protein, leading to its degradation, which is significant for the proliferation of MLL leukemia cells (LV2022Regulatory).

Additionally, UBE2O interacts with PTRF, affecting exosome secretion by ubiquitinating PTRF and reducing its secretion via exosomes, which is important for tumor microenvironment modulation (Cen2022UBE2O). These interactions highlight UBE2O's role in regulating protein stability and function across various cellular pathways.
