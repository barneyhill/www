# FBXO25

## Overview
FBXO25 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 25, a member of the F-box protein family, which is characterized by an F-box motif that mediates protein-protein interactions. F-box protein 25 is a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by tagging proteins for degradation, thereby maintaining cellular protein homeostasis (He2019LncRNA). This protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it forms FBXO25-associated nuclear domains (FANDs), which are involved in protein ubiquitination (Manfiolli2008FBXO25-associated). FBXO25 is implicated in various biological processes, including histone modification and cardiac hypertrophy regulation, and has been associated with several diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Liao2023A; Fischer2023Identification).

## Function
FBXO25 is a member of the F-box protein family and functions as a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is involved in tagging proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, playing a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis within cells (He2019LncRNA). FBXO25 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it forms distinct subnuclear structures known as FBXO25-associated nuclear domains (FANDs). These domains are major sites of ubiquitination, indicating a role in protein degradation rather than gene expression (Manfiolli2008FBXO25-associated).

FBXO25 is involved in the regulation of histone modifications, specifically the monoubiquitination of histone H2BK120 and the subsequent trimethylation of H3K4. These modifications are important for chromatin structure and gene expression, particularly during the osteogenic differentiation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (He2019LncRNA). In the context of cardiac biology, FBXO25 has been implicated in modulating cardiac hypertrophy. It is involved in the degradation of growth factors and cardiac-specific transcription factors, suggesting a role in regulating cell size and hypertrophic responses in cardiomyocytes (Fischer2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
FBXO25 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in protein ubiquitination and degradation. Alterations in FBXO25 expression or mutations can contribute to cancer progression. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), FBXO25 promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis (Liao2023A). Conversely, disruption of the PRKCD-FBXO25-HAX-1 axis has been shown to reduce apoptosis and promote lymphomagenesis, indicating potential tumor-suppressive properties of FBXO25 (Liao2023A).

In the context of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a novel fusion between FBXO25 and SEPT14 was identified in a patient resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This fusion may represent a pathogenic mutation contributing to TKI resistance, highlighting the need for further research into its clinical significance (Liao2023A).

FBXO25 is also associated with neurodegenerative diseases. It may prevent the aggregation of polyglutamine-containing proteins, such as huntingtin, in the nucleus, suggesting a protective role against neurodegeneration (Manfiolli2008FBXO25-associated). Additionally, FBXO25 expression is upregulated in response to interferon β treatment and viral infections, linking it to inflammation and tumorigenesis (Manfiolli2008FBXO25-associated).

## Interactions
FBXO25 is involved in several protein interactions, primarily as part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. It interacts with Skp1, Cul1, and Roc1 to form a functional ubiquitin ligase complex, which is crucial for its role in protein ubiquitination and degradation (Manfiolli2008FBXO25-associated). FBXO25 also interacts with CUL3 and BARD1, which are part of the SCF complex, to regulate histone modifications, specifically H2BK120 monoubiquitination and H3K4 trimethylation, during osteogenic differentiation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) (He2019LncRNA).

FBXO25 is associated with FBXO25-associated nuclear domains (FANDs), which are distinct subnuclear structures involved in ubiquitination. These domains are dynamic and influenced by transcriptional activity, with FBXO25 maintaining interactions with Skp1 even under transcriptional inhibition (Manfiolli2008FBXO25-associated). FBXO25 also plays a role in preventing the aggregation of polyglutamine-containing proteins, such as huntingtin, by promoting their degradation through the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Manfiolli2008FBXO25-associated). These interactions highlight FBXO25's involvement in regulating protein stability and gene expression through ubiquitination pathways.
