# RP1L1

## Overview
The RP1L1 gene encodes the RP1-like 1 protein, a crucial component of the photoreceptor axoneme in the retina. This protein is integral to the development and maintenance of the photoreceptor outer segment, playing a significant role in microtubule assembly and stabilization. The RP1-like 1 protein is characterized by the presence of two doublecortin (DC) domains, which facilitate microtubule binding, and shares structural similarities with the RP1 protein, including coiled-coil domains and repetitive regions (Conte2003Identification; Noel2020RP1L1). Expressed exclusively in rod and cone photoreceptors, RP1-like 1 is essential for normal photosensitivity and the morphogenesis of the outer segment, contributing to the visual process (Yamashita2009Essential). Mutations in the RP1L1 gene are associated with retinal diseases such as occult macular dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa, highlighting its critical role in photoreceptor health and function (Zobor2018Phenotype; Noel2020RP1L1).

## Structure
The RP1L1 protein is a component of the photoreceptor axoneme, crucial for the development and maintenance of the photoreceptor outer segment. It contains two doublecortin (DC) domains in the N-terminal region, which are involved in microtubule binding and share high sequence homology with the RP1 protein (Conte2003Identification; Noel2020RP1L1). The protein also includes two putative coiled-coil domains in the C-terminal part, characterized by heptad repeats, and two imperfect amino acid repeats (Conte2003Identification). The first repeat, located between amino acids 1298 and 1443, is polymorphic and has a consensus sequence of EGLQEEGVQLEETKTE. The second repeat, from amino acids 1896 to 2307, is similar to the 'Plaid domain' of the RPGR protein (Conte2003Identification).

The RP1L1 protein can vary in length between 2400 and 2480 amino acids due to variability in one of the repeat regions (Noel2020RP1L1). It is expressed in rod and cone photoreceptors and has a predicted molecular weight of 252 kDa (Fujinami2016NovelRP1L1Variants). The protein's structure is not fully detailed, but its similarity to RP1 suggests it may share structural features related to the DC domains and N-terminal region (Conte2003Identification).

## Function
The RP1L1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the structure and function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. This protein is specifically localized to the axoneme of the outer segments and connecting cilia in rod photoreceptors, where it overlaps with the RP1 protein (Yamashita2009Essential). RP1L1 is involved in the assembly and stabilization of microtubules, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the photoreceptor axoneme (Noel2020RP1L1; Yamashita2009Essential). 

The protein contains two doublecortin domains, an RP1 domain, and two repetitive regions, which are thought to contribute to its role in microtubule binding and structural organization (Noel2020RP1L1). RP1L1 is expressed exclusively in retinal photoreceptors, indicating its unique role in these cells (Noel2020RP1L1). It is crucial for the development and maintenance of the photoreceptor outer segment, facilitating the transport of materials necessary for constructing outer segment discs and maintaining biochemical homeostasis (Noel2020RP1L1). 

In healthy human cells, RP1L1 is essential for normal photosensitivity and outer segment morphogenesis in rod photoreceptors, contributing to the proper functioning of the visual process (Yamashita2009Essential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RP1L1 gene are linked to several retinal diseases, most notably occult macular dystrophy (OMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). OMD is characterized by progressive visual decline without visible retinal abnormalities, often diagnosed through reduced amplitudes on focal macular ERG or multifocal ERG, while full-field ERG shows normal responses. The most common mutation associated with OMD is p.R45W, which affects the microtubule-binding domain of the RP1L1 protein, potentially disrupting axoneme microtubule association (Zobor2018Phenotype; Noel2020RP1L1). This mutation has been identified in various populations, including Japanese and Italian families, indicating its widespread impact (Fujinami2016NovelRP1L1Variants; PIERMAROCCHI2016Occult).

In addition to OMD, RP1L1 mutations are associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP), a condition that primarily affects rod photoreceptors, leading to night blindness and peripheral vision loss. Novel mutations such as c.3022C>T;p.Q1008* and c.1107G>A;p.W369* have been identified in patients with arRP, often presenting with mild symptoms and later onset (Albarry2019Novel; Zobor2018Phenotype). The RP1L1 gene's role in these diseases underscores its importance in maintaining photoreceptor structure and function.

## Interactions
The RP1L1 protein is known to interact with the RP1 protein, particularly in the context of rod photoreceptor function. Both RP1L1 and RP1 are localized along the axoneme of the outer segment in rod photoreceptors, suggesting a potential physical association. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that approximately 12% of FLAG-tagged RP1 can be coimmunoprecipitated with Myc/His-tagged RP1L1, indicating an interaction between these proteins (Yamashita2009Essential). This interaction is further supported by GST pull-down assays, which confirmed the coprecipitation of RP1L1 from transfected cells and retinal lysates (Yamashita2009Essential).

The interaction between RP1L1 and RP1 is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of the photoreceptor outer segment. In mice, the absence of RP1L1 leads to outer segment disorganization and photoreceptor degeneration, although these effects are less severe than in RP1-deficient mice. This suggests that RP1L1 and RP1 have synergistic roles in photoreceptor maintenance (Yamashita2009Essential). The interactions between these proteins are essential for normal photosensitivity and outer segment morphogenesis, highlighting their importance in photoreceptor health and function (Yamashita2009Essential).
