# STING1

## Overview
STING1, also known as TMEM173, is a gene that encodes the protein stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1, a critical component of the innate immune system. This protein is a transmembrane receptor located primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a pivotal role in detecting cytosolic DNA through the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) pathway. Upon activation by cyclic dinucleotides, such as cGAMP, the STING1 protein undergoes conformational changes and oligomerization, facilitating its translocation to the Golgi apparatus. This translocation is essential for the activation of downstream signaling molecules, including TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which lead to the production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Ishikawa2009STING; Zhang2022STING1a). Additionally, STING1 is involved in autophagy, a process that modulates immune responses and maintains cellular homeostasis (Liu2018STING). Mutations in the STING1 gene are linked to autoinflammatory disorders, highlighting its significance in immune regulation and disease pathogenesis (Drougkas2023STINGAssociated).

## Structure
The STING1 protein, also known as TMEM173, is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein involved in the innate immune response. It features a transmembrane domain with four helices, a cytosolic ligand-binding domain (LBD), and a C-terminal tail (CTT) (Hussain2022Activation). The LBD forms a constitutive dimer with a butterfly-like structure, consisting of a five-stranded sheet and four helices, and includes a dimerization motif, GXXXS, crucial for folding and signal transduction (Hussain2022Activation). 

The protein's quaternary structure involves a domain-swapped dimer with a V-shaped ligand-binding pocket for cyclic dinucleotide ligands (Hopfner2020Molecular). Upon binding with cGAMP, the STING1 dimer undergoes a conformational switch, promoting lateral oligomerization, which is essential for its signaling competence (Hopfner2020Molecular). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and palmitoylation, are critical for STING1's function. Phosphorylation by TBK1 facilitates the recruitment and activation of IRF3 (Hussain2022Activation). Palmitoylation at cysteine residues near the transmembrane domain is necessary for maximal signal transduction and STING1 cluster formation at the Golgi (Hopfner2020Molecular). These structural features and modifications are vital for STING1's role in immune signaling.

## Function
STING1, also known as TMEM173, is a critical component of the innate immune response in healthy human cells. It primarily resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is activated by cyclic dinucleotides, such as cGAMP, produced in response to cytosolic DNA detection by the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) pathway (Zhang2022STING1a; Hopfner2020Molecular). Upon activation, STING1 undergoes conformational changes and oligomerization, facilitating its translocation from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. This translocation is essential for the activation of TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to the production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Ishikawa2009STING; Zhang2022STING1a).

STING1 also plays a role in autophagy, a cellular degradation process that regulates immune signaling. It interacts with proteins involved in autophagosome formation, such as LC3, and can induce a non-canonical form of autophagy independent of typical autophagy regulators like Beclin1 and ULK1 (Liu2018STING). This dual role in immune activation and autophagy helps fine-tune the immune response, preventing excessive inflammation (Liu2018STING).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STING1 gene are associated with several autoinflammatory conditions, most notably STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI). SAVI is a monogenic disorder characterized by systemic inflammation, cutaneous vasculitis, and interstitial lung disease (ILD). It results from gain-of-function mutations in STING1, leading to constitutive activation of the STING protein and excessive production of type I interferons (Drougkas2023STINGAssociated; Li2020Familial). Common mutations include V155M, N154S, and V147M, which disrupt the protein's normal regulatory mechanisms, causing persistent immune activation (Drougkas2023STINGAssociated).

SAVI patients often present with severe cutaneous lesions, respiratory issues, and systemic inflammation. The condition is also linked to T-cell deficiency and peripheral lymphopenia due to excessive activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and autophagy (Drougkas2023STINGAssociated). In some cases, SAVI follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, as seen with the homozygous c.841C>T p.(Arg281Trp) variant, which leads to severe ILD and other symptoms (Wan2022Phenotypic).

The cGAS-STING pathway is also implicated in other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, DNase II deficiency, COPA syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In these conditions, STING1 mutations or dysregulation contribute to disease pathogenesis by enhancing type I interferon signaling (Decout2021The).

## Interactions
STING1, also known as TMEM173, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in immune signaling. It interacts with the ER calcium sensor STIM1, which retains STING1 in the ER under resting conditions. Upon activation, STING1 undergoes conformational changes that disrupt its interaction with STIM1, allowing it to exit the ER (Balka2020Molecular; Zhang2022STING1). STING1 also interacts with proteins involved in vesicular trafficking, such as members of the COPII coat family, including Sar1, Sec23, Sec24, Sec31, and Sec13, facilitating its exit from the ER (Balka2020Molecular).

In the Golgi apparatus, STING1 recruits TBK1 for the phosphorylation of IRF3, leading to immune responses such as type I IFN production (Zhang2022STING1). STING1's interaction with TBK1 is crucial for the activation of IRF3 and subsequent transcriptional upregulation of type I interferons (Balka2020Molecular). STING1 also interacts with MAP1LC3 to initiate autophagosome formation, a process enhanced by proteins like WIPI2 and ATG16L1 (Zhang2022STING1).

STING1 is involved in the regulation of its own degradation through interactions with the clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex AP-1, which facilitates its loading into clathrin-coated vesicles for degradation (Liu2022Clathrinassociated). These interactions highlight STING1's complex regulatory roles in immune responses and cellular homeostasis.
