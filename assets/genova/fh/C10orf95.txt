# C10orf95

## Overview
C10orf95 is a gene located on chromosome 10 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 10 open reading frame 95. This protein is currently not categorized into a specific functional class such as kinases or receptors, and its precise biological role remains to be fully elucidated. However, emerging research suggests that it may be involved in various cellular processes, potentially influencing disease mechanisms. The gene has been associated with several conditions, including lung squamous cell carcinoma and autism spectrum disorder, indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression and neurodevelopmental disorders (Huang2017Coexpression; Casey2011A). Despite these associations, the exact functions and mechanisms of action of the C10orf95 protein are still under investigation, necessitating further studies to better understand its role in health and disease.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
C10orf95 has been implicated in several diseases, although its specific clinical significance remains under investigation. In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), C10orf95 is one of the genes with notable co-expression with down-regulated long noncoding RNAs and tumor suppressor genes, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Huang2017Coexpression). In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), C10orf95 is identified as one of the 12 genes implicated by ASD-specific risk homozygous haplotypes (rHH), which are shared by multiple ASD patients but absent in parental controls, indicating its potential involvement in ASD risk (Casey2011A). 

In gastric cancer, C10orf95 was included in a clinical prediction model for peritoneal metastasis, although its specific role in this context is not detailed (Gong2023FMO). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), C10orf95 is listed among factors associated with sensitivity to histone deacetylase inhibitors, though its precise clinical implications are not specified (Miyanaga2008Antitumor). These findings suggest that C10orf95 may play a role in various diseases, but further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance.
