# RNF212B

## Overview
RNF212B is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 212B, a crucial component in the regulation of meiotic recombination in mammals. This protein is categorized as a RING finger protein, characterized by its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is essential for protein degradation and regulation. RNF212B plays a pivotal role in the designation and stabilization of crossover sites during meiosis, a process vital for genetic diversity and proper chromosomal segregation. The protein localizes to synaptonemal complexes and recombination sites, where it interacts with other proteins such as HEI10 and RNF212 to ensure the stability and localization of crossover-specific proteins. The absence of RNF212B results in impaired crossover formation, leading to sterility, as demonstrated in Rnf212b -/- mutant mice (Ito2023Distinct).

## Function
RNF212B is a protein involved in the regulation of recombination during mammalian meiosis, playing a critical role in crossover site designation and stabilization. It localizes to synaptonemal complexes and recombination sites, where it stabilizes ZMM proteins at nascent crossover sites. RNF212B is first detected in early zygonema and forms a punctate pattern along synaptonemal complexes, with its foci peaking in early pachynema. By late pachynema, RNF212B foci are reduced to one or two large, bright foci per synaptonemal complex, exclusively localizing to crossover sites (Ito2023Distinct).

The protein's function is closely linked to its interaction with other proteins, such as HEI10 and RNF212. RNF212B's crossover-specific patterning is largely dependent on HEI10, and it physically interacts with RNF212, with both proteins being mutually dependent for stability and chromosomal localization (Ito2023Distinct). The RING finger domain of RNF212B is essential for its self-interaction, stability, and pro-crossover functions (Ito2023Distinct).

In the absence of RNF212B, as observed in Rnf212b -/- mutant mice, there is a failure in crossover formation, leading to sterility due to diminished crossing over during meiosis (Ito2023Distinct).
