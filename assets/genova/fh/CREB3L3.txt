# CREB3L3

## Overview
CREB3L3 is a gene that encodes the cAMP responsive element binding protein 3 like 3, a transcription factor belonging to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family. This protein is primarily involved in regulating metabolic processes, particularly in the liver and small intestine, where it plays a crucial role in energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. CREB3L3 is activated under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum stress and is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes associated with gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and ketogenesis. The protein's activity is modulated through post-translational modifications and alternative splicing, which allow for diverse functional roles in different tissues or physiological conditions. CREB3L3's interactions with other proteins, such as Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs), further underscore its significance in maintaining lipid homeostasis and preventing metabolic disorders (Nakagawa2016CREB3L3; Nakagawa2021Enterohepatic).

## Structure
CREB3L3, also known as cAMP responsive element binding protein 3 like 3, is a transcription factor characterized by the presence of a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain. This domain is crucial for the protein's ability to bind DNA and facilitate dimerization, which is essential for its function in regulating gene expression. The bZIP domain is a common structural motif in transcription factors, allowing CREB3L3 to interact with specific DNA sequences and modulate transcriptional activity.

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and stability. These modifications are critical for the regulation of CREB3L3's function in metabolic processes. CREB3L3 is also subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functional roles or regulatory properties. The existence of these isoforms suggests a level of complexity in the regulation of CREB3L3 activity, potentially allowing for tissue-specific or condition-specific functions.

While detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of CREB3L3 is not provided, the presence of the bZIP domain indicates a likely alpha-helical structure typical of such domains, facilitating its role in DNA binding and dimerization.

## Function
CREB3L3, also known as cAMP responsive element binding protein 3 like 3, is a transcription factor primarily active in the liver and small intestine, where it plays a significant role in energy metabolism, particularly during fasting states. It is part of the CREB/ATF family and is activated under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, moving to the Golgi apparatus where it is cleaved to induce the expression of genes involved in systemic inflammatory responses (Nakagawa2016CREB3L3). In its nuclear form, CREB3L3 activates hepatic gluconeogenic genes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc), influencing triglyceride metabolism and contributing to the regulation of fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis (Nakagawa2016CREB3L3).

CREB3L3 directly regulates the expression of genes like Cpt1a and Bdh1, which are crucial for fatty acid transport into mitochondria and ketogenesis, respectively (Nakagawa2016CREB3L3). It works synergistically with PPARα, a key regulator of these metabolic processes, to activate Fgf21 expression, which is crucial for adapting to starvation (Nakagawa2016CREB3L3). CREB3L3's role in maintaining energy homeostasis is further highlighted by its involvement in triglyceride metabolism, where its deletion leads to hypertriglyceridemia due to reduced expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) coactivators and increased expression of the LPL inhibitor Apoc3 (Nakagawa2016CREB3L3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CREB3L3 gene are associated with several metabolic disorders. A novel nonsense mutation in CREB3L3, specifically c.359delG, has been linked to dominant hypertriglyceridemia, characterized by elevated plasma triglyceride levels. This mutation results in a truncated, non-functional protein, leading to severe hypertriglyceridemia in affected individuals (Cefalù2015Novel). CREB3L3 deficiency is also associated with increased liver lipid accumulation, inflammation, and markers of liver injury, resembling nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) phenotypes. This is due to suppressed expression of genes related to fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, exacerbating diet-induced hepatosteatosis (Nakagawa2016CREB3L3).

In liver-specific CREB3L3 knockout mice, hyperlipidemia is observed, characterized by increased plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. This condition is linked to dysfunctional triglyceride clearance and normal very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, indicating dysregulation of lipid metabolism (Nakagawa2016Hyperlipidemia). CREB3L3 also plays a protective role against atherosclerosis. Its deletion in LDL receptor-deficient mice leads to severe hyperlipidemia and increased atherosclerotic lesion formation, highlighting its importance in preventing atherosclerosis through its regulatory effects on lipid metabolism (Nakagawa2021Enterohepatic).

## Interactions
CREB3L3, also known as cAMP responsive element binding protein 3 like 3, participates in several protein-protein interactions that influence its role in lipid metabolism and inflammation. CREB3L3 interacts with Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs), sharing proteases involved in their cleavage process, which suggests a competitive inhibition mechanism. In particular, premature CREB3L3 (pCREB3L3) binds to components involved in SREBP translocation, such as INSIG1 and SCAP, retaining SREBPs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and preventing their transport to the Golgi for activation. This interaction inhibits SREBP processing and lipid synthesis (Nakagawa2021Enterohepatic).

CREB3L3 also forms complexes with INSIG1, SCAP, and SREBPs, which are crucial for maintaining lipid homeostasis and preventing atherosclerosis. This interaction is important for regulating lipid catabolism and anabolism, influencing whole-body energy balance (Nakagawa2021Enterohepatic). Additionally, CREB3L3 can heterodimerize with other Creb3 family members, affecting transcriptional activity and potentially regulating intramembrane proteolysis (Khan2019The). These interactions highlight CREB3L3's role in regulating metabolic responses and chromatin changes through direct protein-protein interactions.
