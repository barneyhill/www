# OR5B17

## Overview
The OR5B17 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily B member 17, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. The OR5B17 protein is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, a common feature of GPCRs, which allows it to interact with various ligands and transduce signals across the cell membrane. This gene is part of a large family of olfactory receptors, which are responsible for the vast diversity of odor detection in humans (Seo2012Differential; Hirata2023Exploring).

## Clinical Significance
The olfactory receptor gene OR5B17 has been implicated in several health conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In the context of pregnancy, OR5B17 is one of the olfactory receptor genes that have shown potential as biomarkers for predicting preeclampsia. Studies have identified OR5B17 as differentially expressed with high predictive capability for early preeclampsia, particularly before 20 weeks of gestation. This gene, along with others, demonstrated excellent diagnostic power for this condition (Hirata2023Exploring). Additionally, OR5B17 is part of a shared transcriptome between gestational hypothyroidism and preeclampsia, suggesting a link between these conditions and the expression of this gene (Hirata2023Exploring).

In another study, OR5B17 was found to be down-regulated in human bronchial epithelial cells following exposure to chrysotile, a type of asbestos. This suggests that environmental factors such as asbestos exposure can alter the expression of OR5B17, potentially affecting olfactory sensory neurons and contributing to respiratory conditions (Seo2012Differential). Furthermore, rare functional variants of OR5B17 have been associated with antidepressant remission in individuals with major depressive disorder, indicating its potential role in psychiatric conditions (Wong2021Rare).
