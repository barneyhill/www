# MAGEA9B

## Overview
MAGEA9B is a gene that encodes the protein MAGE family member A9B, which is part of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family. This family of proteins is known for its role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and immune response modulation. MAGE proteins are often categorized as cancer/testis antigens due to their restricted expression pattern, being predominantly expressed in the testis and various cancerous tissues, but not in normal somatic tissues. The MAGEA9B protein, like other members of the MAGE family, may be involved in tumorigenesis and is of interest in cancer research for its potential as a target for immunotherapy (Qiu2020aarFDC).
