# LMOD3

## Overview
Leiomodin 3 (LMOD3) is a gene that encodes the protein leiomodin-3, which is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues. Leiomodin-3 is a member of the tropomodulin protein family and plays a pivotal role in the organization and stabilization of sarcomeric thin filaments, essential components of the muscle's contractile apparatus. The protein is characterized by several actin-binding domains, including a WH2 domain, which contribute to its function in actin nucleation and filament length regulation. LMOD3's interactions with proteins such as tropomyosin, KLHL40, and nebulin are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle fibers. Mutations in the LMOD3 gene are linked to nemaline myopathy, a severe congenital muscle disorder, highlighting the gene's importance in muscle function and development (Cenik2015Severe; Yuen2014Leiomodin3).

## Structure
Leiomodin 3 (LMOD3) is a protein encoded by the LMOD3 gene, primarily expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The protein is approximately 65 kDa in size and plays a crucial role in the organization of sarcomeric thin filaments. LMOD3 contains several important domains, including three actin-binding domains: an actin-binding helix (residues 69-79), a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain (residues 237-402), and a Wiskott-Aldrich-syndrome protein homology 2 (WH2) domain (residues 534-553) (Yuen2014Leiomodin3). It also features a tropomyosin-binding helix (residues 29-40) (Yuen2014Leiomodin3).

The WH2 domain is a common actin monomer-binding motif, playing an auxiliary role in actin nucleation, while the ABS2 region is crucial for recruiting actin subunits for nucleation (Boczkowska2015How). LMOD3's structure is characterized by a C-terminal extension that includes a proline-rich region, which is not primarily responsible for its nucleation activity (Boczkowska2015How).

LMOD3 interacts with other proteins such as tropomyosin and KLHL40, which stabilizes LMOD3 and enhances its expression (Cenik2015Severe). The protein's interaction with nebulin and KLHL40 is essential for the stability of sarcomere thin filaments, with KLHL40 preventing LMOD3 ubiquitination (Yuen2014Leiomodin3). These interactions suggest a quaternary structure involving complex formation with other sarcomeric proteins.

## Function
The LMOD3 gene encodes the protein leiomodin-3, which is crucial for the organization and function of skeletal muscle in humans. Leiomodin-3 is involved in actin nucleation, a process essential for the formation and maintenance of actin filaments, which are key components of the muscle's contractile apparatus. In healthy cells, LMOD3 helps maintain the structural integrity of sarcomeres, the basic units of muscle fibers, by ensuring the correct length and organization of thin filaments (Yuen2014Leiomodin3). 

LMOD3 is expressed in skeletal muscle throughout life and is part of the tropomodulin protein family. It localizes to the actin thin filament, particularly at the thin filament pointed end and/or M line in muscle sarcomeres, and is absent from the Z-disc (Yuen2014Leiomodin3). The protein has strong actin filament-nucleating activity, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle fibers (Yuen2014Leiomodin3). 

LMOD3 also interacts with other proteins like KLHL40 and nebulin, which are crucial for the stability of thin filaments, highlighting its importance in maintaining muscle function (Yuen2014Leiomodin3). Its absence or dysfunction can lead to significant muscle pathology, such as nemaline myopathy, characterized by muscle weakness and structural abnormalities in muscle fibers (Yuen2014Leiomodin3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LMOD3 gene are associated with nemaline myopathy (NM), a severe congenital muscle disorder characterized by muscle weakness and the presence of nemaline bodies in muscle fibers. This condition, known as LMOD3-related nemaline myopathy (LMOD3-NM), presents with early-onset severe generalized muscle weakness, hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, and feeding difficulties. Clinical features may include arthrogryposis, congenital contractures, ophthalmoplegia, and a history of prematurity, reduced fetal movements, and polyhydramnios (Yuen2014Leiomodin3).

Most mutations in LMOD3 are nonsense or frameshift mutations that lead to a loss of LMOD3 expression, resulting in thin filament disorganization and muscle weakness. The absence or dysfunction of LMOD3 disrupts the organization of sarcomeric thin filaments, contributing to the pathology of NM (Yuen2014Leiomodin3). In some cases, compound heterozygous truncating variants have been identified, further linking LMOD3 mutations to severe NM (Wang2019Compound).

Research using animal models, such as zebrafish and mice, has confirmed that LMOD3 deficiency leads to muscle abnormalities similar to those seen in human NM, underscoring the gene's critical role in maintaining skeletal muscle structure and function (Cenik2015Severe; Yuen2014Leiomodin3).

## Interactions
Leiomodin 3 (LMOD3) is involved in several interactions critical for muscle function. It interacts with actin filaments, playing a significant role in actin nucleation and modulating thin filament length in skeletal muscle. LMOD3 is known to bind to tropomyosin, although it has a weaker binding affinity compared to LMOD2 (Yuen2014Leiomodin3). This interaction is important for the structural organization of thin filaments in muscle fibers.

LMOD3 also interacts with other proteins such as KLHL40 and nebulin. KLHL40 is crucial for the stability of LMOD3, as it prevents LMOD3 ubiquitination, thereby maintaining its protein levels in skeletal muscles. The interaction between LMOD3, nebulin, and KLHL40 is essential for maintaining the sarcomere structure, which is vital for muscle contraction and function (Yuen2014Leiomodin3).

LMOD3 shares structural similarities with other leiomodins and tropomodulins, possessing actin-binding domains that contribute to its function in muscle fibers. It is suggested that LMOD3 may bind near the pointed end of thin filaments to modulate filament length and stabilize thin filaments, although further research is needed to confirm these roles (Yuen2014Leiomodin3).
