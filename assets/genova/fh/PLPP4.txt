# PLPP4

## Overview
PLPP4, or phospholipid phosphatase 4, is a gene that encodes a member of the phospholipid phosphatase family, which is involved in the dephosphorylation of phospholipids. The protein product, phospholipid phosphatase 4, is categorized as a transmembrane enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by regulating the levels of bioactive lipids within the cell membrane (Tian2021Phospholipid). This regulation is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways. Alterations in the expression of PLPP4 have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis (Zhang2017Phospholipid). The gene's involvement in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target underscore its significance in medical research (Li2024N6methyladenosinemodified).

## Clinical Significance
PLPP4 (phospholipid phosphatase 4) has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In lung carcinoma, PLPP4 is significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (SQC) tissues compared to normal tissues, with a 12.03-fold increase in ADC and a 12.65-fold increase in SQC. High PLPP4 expression correlates with advanced clinicopathological features and poor prognosis, suggesting its role in tumor progression and as a potential therapeutic target (Zhang2017Phospholipid).

In glioma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), PLPP4 is also overexpressed, correlating with poor clinicopathological features and overall survival. Silencing PLPP4 in these cancers reduces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its role in tumor growth and progression. The gene's expression is associated with immune cell infiltration, particularly macrophages, which may contribute to cancer progression (Tian2021Phospholipid).

In ovarian cancer, circPLPP4, a circular RNA derived from PLPP4, is involved in sustaining cisplatin resistance. This resistance is mediated through the upregulation of PIK3R1, highlighting circPLPP4 as a potential therapeutic target for overcoming drug resistance in ovarian cancer (Li2024N6methyladenosinemodified).
