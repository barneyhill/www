# RNASEH2B

## Overview
RNASEH2B is a gene that encodes the ribonuclease H2 subunit B, a crucial component of the ribonuclease H2 (RNase H2) complex. This complex is essential for maintaining genomic stability by degrading RNA:DNA hybrids and removing misincorporated ribonucleotides from DNA, thereby preventing DNA damage and ensuring proper DNA replication and repair. The RNase H2 subunit B, characterized by its alpha-helical C-terminal region and winged helix-turn-helix motif, interacts with other proteins and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), indicating its involvement in DNA replication and repair processes (Hollis2011Structure; Hyjek2019RNases). Mutations in RNASEH2B are associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a genetic disorder with neurological and immunological manifestations, and have been linked to other conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and chronic kidney disease (Dragoni2022Characterization; Crow2015Characterization).

## Structure
The RNASEH2B protein is a component of the heterotrimeric RNase H2 complex, which includes subunits RNase H2A, RNase H2B, and RNase H2C. The RNase H2B subunit is characterized by a mostly alpha-helical C-terminal region, which facilitates interactions with other proteins and may aid in the bending of polynucleotide molecules (Hollis2011Structure). The N-terminal region of RNase H2B interacts with the smaller RNase H2C protein, contributing to the structural integrity of the complex (Hollis2011Structure).

RNase H2B, along with RNase H2C, forms a structural motif known as a 'triple-barrel,' which is crucial for the stability and activity of the enzyme complex. This motif is created by the interweaving of beta-strands from both RNase H2B and RNase H2C, establishing a pseudo twofold axis of symmetry (Hollis2011Structure). The structural arrangement of RNase H2B and H2C is similar to the RAP34-RAP70 subdomains of the transcription factor IIF (TFIIF) complex (Hollis2011Structure).

RNase H2B contains a winged helix-turn-helix motif and a C-terminal fragment that interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), indicating a role in DNA replication and repair (Hyjek2019RNases). The protein's interaction with PCNA suggests its involvement in DNA replication and repair processes (Hollis2011Structure).

## Function
RNASEH2B is a critical component of the ribonuclease H2 (RNase H2) complex, which plays a vital role in maintaining genome stability in healthy human cells. This complex is responsible for degrading RNA:DNA hybrids and removing ribonucleotides that are misincorporated into DNA during replication and repair processes. By performing these functions, RNASEH2B helps prevent double-strand DNA damage and maintains genomic integrity (Mackenzie2016Ribonuclease; Beyer2017Rare).

RNASEH2B is active in the nucleus, where it participates in DNA replication and repair. It is essential for ribonucleotide excision repair (RER), a process that removes single ribonucleotides embedded in DNA, thereby preventing the accumulation of aberrant nucleic acid species that could trigger autoimmunity (Mackenzie2016Ribonuclease). The RNase H2 complex also resolves co-transcriptional R-loops, which are RNA:DNA hybrids that can form during transcription. This activity is crucial for preventing DNA breaks and inflammation, as unresolved R-loops can lead to genome instability and activate immune responses (Cristini2022RNase).

In summary, RNASEH2B is essential for maintaining genomic stability and preventing inappropriate immune activation by ensuring the proper degradation of RNA:DNA hybrids and maintaining DNA integrity (Mackenzie2016Ribonuclease).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RNASEH2B gene are primarily associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by neurological and immunological abnormalities. AGS is marked by early-onset neurological symptoms such as microcephaly, spasticity, dystonia, seizures, and psychomotor delay, along with extraneurological symptoms like chilblains and lupus-like disease (Dragoni2022Characterization; Crow2015Characterization). Mutations in RNASEH2B can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which may trigger an inflammatory response through the activation of immunostimulatory DNA sensors (Dragoni2022Characterization).

In some cases, RNASEH2B mutations have been linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and chronic kidney disease, conditions not typically associated with AGS. These mutations can result in reduced enzyme activity and increased susceptibility to systemic inflammation (He2021Systemic). The clinical presentation of RNASEH2B mutations is variable, with some patients exhibiting mild phenotypes and others showing severe neurological and systemic symptoms (Garau2019Molecular). The presence of specific phenotypes, such as spastic paraparesis, has also been noted in patients with RNASEH2B mutations (Crow2015Characterization).

## Interactions
RNASEH2B is a subunit of the RNase H2 complex, which plays a critical role in maintaining genome stability by removing RNA-DNA hybrids. This subunit interacts with several proteins and complexes, notably the CoREST histone-modifying complex. RNASEH2B specifically interacts with ZMYM3, a MYM-type zinc finger protein, which acts as a scaffold within the CoREST complex. This interaction is crucial for the function of the KDM1A/RCOR1/HDAC2 LCH complex involved in transcriptional silencing (ShapsonCoe2019Aicardi–Goutières).

Mutations in RNASEH2B associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome impair its interaction with ZMYM3, potentially affecting the stability and function of the RNase H2 complex. These mutations do not impact the interaction with the A and C subunits of RNase H2, nor do they affect the abundance of RNASEH2B itself (ShapsonCoe2019Aicardi–Goutières). The interaction between RNASEH2B and ZMYM3 is mediated by a proline-rich region, and ZMYM3 may serve as a bridge in chromatin remodeling and silencing during ribonucleotide excision repair (ShapsonCoe2019Aicardi–Goutières). These interactions highlight the importance of RNASEH2B in coordinating chromatin modifications and nucleic acid processing to prevent inflammation and maintain genomic integrity.
