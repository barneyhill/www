# TTC7A

## Overview
TTC7A is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7A, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in the immune and gastrointestinal systems. The protein is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are crucial for the assembly of multiprotein complexes involved in phosphoinositide metabolism and actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Gajardo2021Actin; Mou2021A). TTC7A plays a significant role in maintaining chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation, impacting genome stability and transcriptional activity (ElDaher2018Tetratricopeptide). Mutations in the TTC7A gene are linked to severe disorders such as multiple intestinal atresia and combined immunodeficiency, underscoring its clinical significance (Bigorgne2013TTC7A; Notarangelo2014Multiple). The protein's interactions with various signaling pathways and its involvement in maintaining cellular architecture highlight its essential role in cellular homeostasis and function (Bigorgne2013TTC7A; Lees2017Architecture).

## Structure
The TTC7A protein is characterized by the presence of nine tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions through a helix-turn-helix structure (Gajardo2021Actin; Mou2021A). These TPR domains are located at the carboxy-terminal end of the protein and are composed of approximately 34 amino acids with a consensus sequence that includes specific motifs (Samuels2013Exome). The TPR domains in TTC7A are crucial for its function, as they mediate the assembly of multiprotein complexes, such as the TTC7A-PI4KIIIα-FAM126A-EFR3 complex (Mou2021A).

Mutations in the TPR domains can lead to significant structural disruptions. For instance, the missense mutation p.L823P, which occurs at a highly conserved residue, is predicted to be pathogenic due to its potential to disrupt the α-helical structure of the TPR repeats (Samuels2013Exome). The protein's structure has been modeled based on the crystal structure of its isoform, TTC7B, although specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TTC7A are not extensively detailed in the available literature (Lawless2017Bialellic).

## Function
The TTC7A gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis and cellular function by regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics. In healthy human cells, TTC7A is involved in the assembly and function of a multiprotein complex that includes PI4KIIIα, EFR3A, and FAM126, which is essential for phosphoinositide metabolism and the PI3K/AKT/RHOA regulatory axis. This pathway is critical for actin polymerization and cell motility, particularly in leukocyte migration through complex microenvironments (Gajardo2021Actin).

TTC7A also plays a significant role in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation. It binds to chromatin, particularly at actively transcribed regions, and is essential for maintaining chromatin organization and gene regulation. The protein's involvement in chromatin dynamics is crucial for genome stability and transcriptional activity, affecting pathways related to lymphocyte activation and inflammatory responses (ElDaher2018Tetratricopeptide).

In the cytoplasm, TTC7A is active in maintaining cell structure and function, particularly in intestinal epithelial cells and the immune system. Its deficiency can lead to impaired cell motility, DNA damage, and increased cell death, contributing to immunodeficiency and gastrointestinal disorders (Gajardo2021Actin; ElDaher2018Tetratricopeptide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TTC7A gene are associated with several severe disorders, primarily affecting the gastrointestinal and immune systems. These mutations can lead to multiple intestinal atresia (MIA), a congenital condition characterized by atresia at multiple levels of the gastrointestinal tract, often requiring surgical intervention (Bigorgne2013TTC7A; Notarangelo2014Multiple). Patients with MIA frequently experience combined immunodeficiency (CID), with defects in both T and B lymphocytes, increasing susceptibility to infections (Fayard2018TTC7A; Notarangelo2014Multiple).

TTC7A mutations also result in very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with apoptotic enterocolitis, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of the gene's impact (Chen2022Clinical; Notarangelo2014Multiple). The mutations disrupt normal cellular processes, including apicobasal polarity and RhoA signaling, leading to increased apoptosis and altered epithelial architecture (Bigorgne2013TTC7A; Mou2021A). These disruptions contribute to the severe clinical manifestations observed in affected individuals, such as chronic enterocolitis and severe T-lymphocyte deficiency (Fayard2018TTC7A).

The clinical outcomes of TTC7A mutations are severe, often resulting in early mortality despite aggressive medical interventions, highlighting the need for early diagnosis and potential new therapeutic approaches (Mou2021A).

## Interactions
TTC7A is a protein that participates in various interactions crucial for cellular functions. It is known to interact with the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5, a relationship that has been implicated in very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD). This interaction was demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which showed that variants in both TTC7A and UBR5 reduce their interaction, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis (Dhingani2020The).

TTC7A is also a component of the PI4KIIIα lipid kinase complex, where it interacts with proteins such as FAM126 and EFR3. These interactions are essential for the stability and function of the complex, which is involved in phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate production at the plasma membrane. Mutations in TTC7A can disrupt these interactions, leading to diseases like CID-MIA (Lees2017Architecture).

Additionally, TTC7A interacts with the ROCK signaling pathway, influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and cell polarity. Mutations in TTC7A can lead to increased phosphorylation of proteins involved in this pathway, affecting cell adhesion and migration (Bigorgne2013TTC7A). TTC7A's role in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation further highlights its involvement in complex cellular processes (ElDaher2018Tetratricopeptide).
