# ALCAM

## Overview
The ALCAM gene encodes the activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule, a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, by mediating both homophilic and heterophilic interactions. ALCAM is expressed in a wide array of tissues, such as epithelial cells, neurons, and hematopoietic cells, and plays a crucial role in neural development, organ branching, and immune responses. Its interactions with other proteins, such as CD6 and tetraspanins, underscore its importance in immunological synapse stabilization and cellular signaling pathways. Clinically, ALCAM expression is implicated in the progression and metastasis of several cancers, with its levels serving as potential prognostic markers for patient outcomes (Ferragut2021ALCAMCD166:; Bowen1995Cloning; Swart2002Activated).

## Structure
The activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) is a type I transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Its molecular structure includes a 27-amino acid NH2-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide, which is cleaved from the mature protein, followed by a 500-amino acid extracellular domain, a 24-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 32-amino acid cytoplasmic domain (Bowen1995Cloning). The extracellular domain is composed of five immunoglobulin-like domains: two amino-terminal variable (V) type Ig domains (V1, V2) and three constant (C) type Ig domains (C1, C2, C3) (van2001Molecular). The V1 domain is crucial for ligand binding and homophilic interactions, while the C2 and C3 domains are involved in lateral oligomerization, essential for stable cell adhesion (van2001Molecular).

ALCAM undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which accounts for the difference between its predicted molecular mass of approximately 65 kD and the observed 100-105 kD molecular mass. There are nine potential sites for N-linked glycosylation (Bowen1995Cloning). Alternative splicing of the ALCAM gene results in different isoforms, such as ALCAM-Iso1 and ALCAM-Iso2, which differ in their adhesive properties and susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage (Hebron2018Alternative).

## Function
The activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), also known as CD166, is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays a significant role in mediating cell-cell interactions through both homophilic (ALCAM-ALCAM) and heterophilic (ALCAM-CD6) binding. This protein is involved in various molecular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, which are crucial for maintaining tissue architecture and facilitating cellular communication (Bowen1995Cloning; Swart2002Activated).

ALCAM is expressed in a wide range of human tissues, including epithelial cells, neurons, and hematopoietic cells. It is particularly important in dynamic growth and migration processes, such as neural development, organ branching, and immune responses (Swart2002Activated). In the nervous system, ALCAM is involved in axonogenesis, axon guidance, and fasciculation, contributing to the growth and maintenance of both central and peripheral nervous systems (Swart2002Activated).

In the immune system, ALCAM is expressed by activated leukocytes, including T cells, B cells, and monocytes, and is involved in the adhesion processes essential for immune cell interactions and signaling (Bowen1995Cloning). It is also a component of endothelial junctions, playing a role in the transendothelial migration of monocytes, which is a critical aspect of the innate immune response (Masedunskas2006Activated).

## Clinical Significance
The ALCAM gene, also known as CD166, plays a significant role in the progression and metastasis of various cancers. Alterations in ALCAM expression are linked to different clinical outcomes across multiple cancer types. In breast cancer, high ALCAM expression is associated with better survival rates, particularly in patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, while its loss may facilitate invasive behavior (Varadi2011Genetic). In contrast, high ALCAM levels in colorectal cancer correlate with poor overall survival and increased metastasis (Yang2021The). 

In prostate cancer, ALCAM is primarily found on the membrane, with high transcript levels linked to shorter survival in metastatic cases (Yang2021The). In thyroid cancer, lower ALCAM expression is associated with poorly differentiated tumors and worse outcomes (Yang2021The). ALCAM's role in metastasis is also evident in non-small cell lung cancer, where high membrane staining is a poor prognostic indicator (Yang2021The).

ALCAM's interactions with other proteins, such as CD6 and L1CAM, influence tumor progression and metastasis, particularly in cancers with a tendency to metastasize to bone (Yang2021The). Additionally, ALCAM expression is linked to drug resistance in several cancers, including colorectal and bladder cancers, and its expression levels correlate with chemotherapy response in breast cancer (Yang2021The).

## Interactions
ALCAM (activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cell adhesion and signaling. ALCAM interacts with CD6, a protein expressed on thymocytes and mature T lymphocytes, which is crucial for immunological synapse stabilization and T-cell activation (Zimmerman2006Longterm; Bowen1995Cloning). This interaction is essential for the formation and stabilization of the immunological synapse between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (Zimmerman2006Longterm).

ALCAM also engages in homophilic interactions (ALCAM-ALCAM) and heterophilic interactions (ALCAM-CD6) (Ferragut2021ALCAMCD166:; Gilsanz2012ALCAMCD166). The protein's interaction with the tetraspanin CD9 enhances ALCAM-mediated adhesion by increasing the clustering of ALCAM molecules and regulating its surface expression (Gilsanz2012ALCAMCD166; von2019Modulation).

ALCAM interacts with the metalloproteinase ADAM17, which processes ALCAM, affecting its adhesion properties (Gilsanz2012ALCAMCD166). It also binds to S100B, a DAMP protein, inducing the expression of NF-kB family members, and associates with ezrin, linking transmembrane molecules to the actin cytoskeleton (Ferragut2021ALCAMCD166:). These interactions highlight ALCAM's role in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling pathways.
