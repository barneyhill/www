# CDK20

## Overview
Cyclin-dependent kinase 20 (CDK20) is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin-dependent kinase 20, a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, which is integral to cell cycle regulation. The CDK20 protein functions primarily as a kinase, playing a pivotal role in the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle by activating CDK2 through phosphorylation. This activation is crucial for cell cycle progression and is involved in regulating multiple cell cycle checkpoints. Beyond its role in cell cycle regulation, CDK20 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell survival and ciliogenesis, by modulating pathways such as the Hedgehog signaling pathway. The protein is expressed in several human tissues, with predominant activity in the brain and kidney, and is localized in the nucleus where it influences cell proliferation and differentiation (Lai2020The).

## Function
CDK20, also known as cyclin-dependent kinase 20, is a protein kinase that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the transition from the G1 to S phase. It functions as a cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase (CAK), primarily activating CDK2 by phosphorylating it on Thr-160, which is essential for cell cycle progression (Lai2020The). CDK20 is involved in regulating multiple cell cycle checkpoints, including the G1/S and S/G2 checkpoints, and influences the expression of cyclin D1, a partner of CDK4/6, in some cancer cells (Lai2020The).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, CDK20 is implicated in cell survival processes. It inhibits cell death mechanisms such as apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, particularly in cells with limited proliferation capabilities like cardiomyocytes and neural cells (Lai2020The). CDK20 is also involved in ciliogenesis, which is crucial for mammalian embryogenesis and neuron patterning, by modulating the Hedgehog signaling pathway (Lai2020The).

CDK20 is expressed in various human tissues, predominantly in the brain and kidney, and is active in the nucleus, where it participates in cell proliferation and differentiation processes (Lai2020The).

## Clinical Significance
CDK20 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation and survival. In lung cancer, CDK20 is frequently upregulated, promoting radiochemoresistance by interacting with KEAP1 and enhancing NRF2 activation. This interaction is crucial for cancer cell survival under stress conditions like chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Wang2017CDK20). Despite its upregulation, there is no significant correlation between CDK20 expression and lung cancer patient survival (Wang2017CDK20).

In ovarian carcinoma, CDK20 overexpression correlates with advanced cancer stages, promoting cell proliferation and tumor growth. Conversely, CDK20 knockdown leads to G1 phase cell cycle arrest (Lai2020The). CDK20 is also involved in glioblastoma, where its expression supports cell proliferation, and knockdown results in G1 phase arrest, suppressing tumor growth (Lai2020The).

CDK20's role extends to heart diseases, where a unique cardiac variant is linked to cell survival rather than cell cycle regulation. This variant protects cardiomyocytes from stress-induced cell death, suggesting potential therapeutic applications in ischemic cardiac diseases and heart failure (Lai2020The). CDK20's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CDK20, also known as cyclin-dependent kinase 20, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cell cycle regulation and ciliary protein trafficking. CDK20 interacts with BROMI/TBC1D32, a protein involved in ciliary retrograde protein trafficking. This interaction is essential for regulating the intraflagellar transport (IFT) turnaround process at ciliary tips, likely through the activation of ICK (intestinal cell kinase) (Noguchi2021CCRKCDK20). The interaction between CDK20 and BROMI requires both the C-terminal and N-terminal regions of BROMI, with the C-terminal region being essential for maintaining the interaction (Noguchi2021CCRKCDK20).

CDK20 also phosphorylates ICK at its TDY motif, which is crucial for regulating the turnaround process at ciliary tips (Noguchi2021CCRKCDK20). In the context of cell cycle regulation, CDK20 acts as an activator of CDK2 by phosphorylating it on Thr-160, promoting the transition from the G1 to S phase (Lai2020The). CDK20 is also known to interact with cyclin H and casein kinase 2 (CK2) to phosphorylate CDK2, and it is involved in signaling pathways such as Wnt signaling (Lai2020The).
