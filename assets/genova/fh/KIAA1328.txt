# KIAA1328

## Overview
KIAA1328 is a human gene that encodes the protein Hinderin, which is implicated in centrosomal and ciliary biology. The protein is known for its specific localization to basal bodies, structures that are integral to the organization of ciliary microtubule axonemes, suggesting a significant role in ciliary function and cell signaling (Drew2017Integration; Drew2016A). Hinderin interacts with the hinge domain of SMC3, a component of the cohesin complex, potentially influencing chromosome segregation during cell division (Patel2005Hinderin). The gene is expressed across various human tissues, with notable expression in the lung, liver, placenta, kidney, and pancreas, and contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal, indicating possible nuclear functions (Patel2005Hinderin). KIAA1328 is part of a large protein complex associated with centrosomal and ciliary processes, and its involvement in these pathways suggests a potential link to ciliopathies (Drew2017Integration; Drew2016A).

## Function
KIAA1328 is a human gene that encodes a protein involved in centrosomal and ciliary biology. The protein localizes specifically to basal bodies, which are components of the centrosome crucial for organizing ciliary microtubule axonemes. This localization suggests that KIAA1328 plays a significant role in the structure and function of cilia, which are essential for cell signaling and embryonic development (Drew2017Integration; Drew2016A).

The protein encoded by KIAA1328, also known as Hinderin, interacts with the hinge domain of SMC3, a component of the cohesin complex. This interaction may influence the dimerization of SMC3/SMC1, suggesting a role in cellular processes involving the cohesin complex, which is important for chromosome segregation during cell division (Patel2005Hinderin).

KIAA1328 is expressed ubiquitously across various human tissues, with the highest levels observed in the lung, liver, placenta, kidney, and pancreas. The protein contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal, indicating its potential involvement in nuclear processes (Patel2005Hinderin). These characteristics highlight its potential involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and contributing to organismal health.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
KIAA1328 is identified as part of a large, 18-subunit protein complex enriched in centrosomal proteins, with eight subunits linked to ciliopathies. This complex is involved in ciliary and centrosomal processes, which are crucial for cell signaling and development (Drew2017Integration; Drew2016A). The protein KIAA1328, also known as C1orf174, is one of the three uncharacterized proteins within this complex. Its involvement in ciliary and centrosomal functions was predicted using hu.MAP, a global map of human protein complexes, and validated through experiments showing its localization to basal bodies in multi-ciliated cells of Xenopus laevis embryos (Drew2017Integration; Drew2016A).

The study suggests that KIAA1328 may interact with other proteins involved in ciliary and centrosomal functions, potentially linking it to ciliopathies (Drew2017Integration). However, specific interaction partners for KIAA1328 have not been well-documented, and further research is needed to elucidate its precise role and interactions within these complexes (Drew2017Integration; Drew2016A).
