# INS

## Overview
The INS gene encodes the insulin protein, a pivotal peptide hormone in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin, categorized as a hormone, is synthesized in the pancreatic β-cells and plays a critical role in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis by facilitating glucose uptake into cells, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues. The gene's expression and the subsequent production of insulin are tightly regulated processes essential for energy production and metabolic balance. Insulin's interaction with its receptor, the insulin receptor (INSR), initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways that influence not only glucose metabolism but also lipid and protein metabolism. Mutations in the INS gene are linked to various forms of diabetes, highlighting its clinical significance in metabolic disorders (Kulkarni1999TissueSpecific; Bouche2010Insulin; Støy2007Insulin).

## Structure
The insulin protein, encoded by the human INS gene, is a peptide hormone composed of two polypeptide chains: the A chain with 21 amino acids and the B chain with 30 amino acids. These chains are linked by two inter-chain disulfide bridges between A7-B7 and A20-B19, and the A chain contains an intra-chain disulfide bridge between A7 and A11 (De2004Insulin). The primary structure of insulin is highly conserved, ensuring efficient folding and function (Liu2018Biosynthesis).

The secondary structure of insulin includes alpha helices, which are crucial for its biological activity and receptor binding (De2004Insulin). The tertiary structure is stabilized by the disulfide bonds, forming a hydrophobic core that is essential for its stability and function (Liu2018Biosynthesis). 

In terms of quaternary structure, insulin can dimerize at micromolar concentrations and further associate into hexamers in the presence of zinc ions. These hexamers can exist in different conformations, such as the T and R forms, which are important for its pharmaceutical formulations (De2004Insulin). The hexameric structure is symmetrical and involves the burial of nonpolar surfaces upon dimer and hexamer formation (De2004Insulin).

## Function
The INS gene encodes insulin, a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels. In healthy human cells, insulin facilitates glucose uptake by binding to insulin receptors on the cell surface, initiating a signaling cascade that promotes glucose transport into cells, particularly muscle and adipose tissue. This process is vital for energy production and maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Bouche2010Insulin).

Insulin also influences lipid and protein metabolism. It enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in β-cells, as demonstrated by studies showing that preexposure to exogenous insulin increases the endogenous insulin secretory response to glucose (Bouche2010Insulin). This indicates that insulin signaling is important for regulating insulin secretion within β-cells, which is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis (Kulkarni1999TissueSpecific).

In addition to its role in glucose metabolism, insulin has been shown to enhance the survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells by inhibiting apoptotic death, although it does not stimulate their proliferation. This pro-survival effect is observed across various progenitor lineages, indicating its importance in cell viability (Ratajczak1998The). Insulin's interaction with its receptor, INS-R, is also involved in the regulation of erythropoiesis, particularly in enhancing erythroid colony formation when combined with other growth factors (Ratajczak1998The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the INS gene, which encodes insulin, are associated with several forms of diabetes, including neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), and Mutant INS-gene Induced Diabetes of Youth (MIDY). These mutations can lead to misfolding of proinsulin, triggering endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and β-cell dysfunction, ultimately resulting in insulin deficiency (Liu2010Proinsulin; AtaieAshtiani2023A). 

Neonatal diabetes can be permanent (PNDM) or transient (TNDM), with INS mutations accounting for approximately 20% of PNDM cases. These mutations often disrupt normal disulfide bonds or introduce unpaired cysteine residues, leading to impaired insulin biosynthesis and ER stress (Støy2007Insulin). Recessive mutations in the INS gene can cause early-onset diabetes by reducing insulin biosynthesis through mechanisms such as gene deletion and altered mRNA stability (Garin2010Recessive).

Heterozygous mutations in the INS gene can have a dominant effect, preventing normal folding of proinsulin and leading to β-cell death through ER stress and apoptosis (Garin2010Recessive). These mutations are often de novo and can result in severe β-cell defects and early diabetes onset (Støy2007Insulin).

## Interactions
The INS gene encodes insulin, a hormone that plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism. Insulin interacts with the insulin receptor (INSR) on the cell surface, initiating a cascade of signaling pathways. Upon binding to INSR, insulin triggers the autophosphorylation of the receptor, which then recruits and phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, such as IRS1 and IRS2. These IRS proteins serve as docking sites for other signaling molecules, facilitating the activation of pathways like PI3K/AKT and MAPK, which are essential for glucose uptake and metabolism (Virkamäki1999Protein–protein; Sneha2018Probing).

Insulin also interacts with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its receptor, playing a role in glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. The interaction with IGF-1 is significant in regulating glucose homeostasis (Sneha2018Probing). Additionally, insulin is involved in the translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4 (GLUT4) to the cell membrane, a process facilitated by the PI3K/AKT pathway (Sneha2018Probing).

Insulin's interactions extend to other proteins such as AKT1, PIK3CA, and GCG, which are involved in various aspects of glucose metabolism and homeostasis (Sneha2018Probing). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein-protein interactions that insulin participates in to regulate metabolic processes.
