# EMILIN3

## Overview
EMILIN3 is a gene that encodes the protein elastin microfibril interfacer 3, which is a member of the EMILIN family of proteins. This family is characterized by the presence of a C1q domain and a collagen-like domain, which are crucial for the protein's role in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Elastin microfibril interfacer 3 is involved in cell adhesion, signaling, and the structural organization of the ECM, particularly within the dentin-pulp complex of teeth. It modulates growth factor activity and is implicated in developmental processes, such as early bone formation. The protein's expression is notably upregulated in response to dental caries, suggesting a role in inflammation and tissue repair. Additionally, EMILIN3 interacts with other ECM components, such as fibulin-1 and fibulin-2, and may influence signaling pathways through its modulation of growth factors like TGF-β and Hedgehog ligands (Imhof2020EMILIN; Schiavinato2017Fibulin4).

## Structure
EMILIN3, encoded by the EMILIN3 gene, is a protein that plays a role in the organization of the extracellular matrix. It is a member of the EMILIN family, which is characterized by the presence of a C1q domain and a collagen-like domain. These domains are integral to the protein's function in cell adhesion and signaling. The C1q domain is typically involved in protein-protein interactions, which may facilitate the binding of EMILIN3 to other extracellular matrix components. The collagen-like domain contributes to the structural integrity and elasticity of the matrix.

EMILIN3 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can influence its stability, localization, and interaction with other molecules. These modifications are common in proteins that are part of the extracellular matrix, as they often require additional processing to function effectively in the complex extracellular environment.

The specific structural details of EMILIN3, such as its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, are not detailed in the available context. However, the presence of distinct domains and potential post-translational modifications suggests a complex structure that supports its role in extracellular matrix organization and cell signaling.

## Function
EMILIN3, or elastin microfibril interfacer 3, is a protein involved in the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM). It plays a role in modulating cell behavior, growth factor activity, and ECM assembly. EMILIN3 is particularly noted for its involvement in the dentin-pulp complex of teeth, where it interacts with cell surface receptors and modulates growth factors such as TGF-β, Wnt, and Hedgehog ligands (Imhof2020EMILIN). 

In healthy human cells, EMILIN3 is weakly expressed in the odontoblast layer of the dentin-pulp complex, suggesting a limited role under normal conditions. However, its expression is significantly upregulated in response to dental caries, indicating a potential role in inflammation and the formation of reactionary tertiary dentin matrix (Imhof2020EMILIN). EMILIN3 is also found in CD68 and HLA-DR positive cells, which suggests a possible involvement in immune responses, although this role remains unexplored (Imhof2020EMILIN).

The protein is also expressed in embryonic mesenchymal cells and is present in early bone formation, indicating its involvement in developmental processes (Schiavinato2017Fibulin4).

## Interactions
EMILIN3, a member of the elastin microfibril interfacer family, is involved in various interactions within the extracellular matrix. It has been shown to interact with fibulin-1 and fibulin-2, as demonstrated through in vitro binding assays using recombinant proteins. These interactions suggest a role for EMILIN3 in the structural organization of the dentin-enamel junction and potentially in the dental pulp (Imhof2020EMILIN). EMILIN3 is also implicated in modulating the bioavailability of Hedgehog ligands, which indicates its involvement in signaling pathways (Imhof2020EMILIN).

In the context of disease, EMILIN3 expression is significantly upregulated in dentin caries lesions, suggesting a role in the response to dental tissue damage (Imhof2020EMILIN). Additionally, in silico analysis suggests that EMILIN3, like other EMILINs, may interact with the Ebola virus glycoprotein GP1 through shared informational frequencies, indicating possible direct interaction or immunological cross-reactivity (Veljkovic2015In). However, specific physical interactions of EMILIN3 with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature.
