# FFAR4

## Overview
The FFAR4 gene encodes the free fatty acid receptor 4, a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in metabolic regulation and inflammation. This receptor is primarily activated by long-chain free fatty acids, including omega-3 fatty acids, and is involved in various physiological processes such as anti-inflammatory responses, insulin sensitization, and energy homeostasis (Oh2014Omega3; Kiepura2021AntiAtherosclerotic). FFAR4 is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, and undergoes post-translational modifications that regulate its activity (Kimura2020Free; Oh2014Omega3). The receptor's activation influences macrophage polarization, enhances insulin secretion, and modulates inflammatory pathways, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions in metabolic and inflammatory disorders (Kimura2020Free; Ichimura2014Free). Variants of the FFAR4 gene, such as the p.R270H mutation, have been associated with metabolic conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Secor2021Free; Bonnefond2015Contribution).

## Structure
FFAR4, also known as GPR120, is a G-protein coupled receptor characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a common feature of GPCRs (Kimura2020Free). The primary structure of FFAR4 includes specific amino acid sequences that facilitate binding to long-chain fatty acids, which are its primary ligands (Kimura2020Free). 

The receptor is known to undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which is mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) and GPCR kinase 6 (GRK6), depending on the isoform and stimulus (Oh2014Omega3). These modifications play a crucial role in regulating its activity and signaling pathways. FFAR4 can form homodimers or heterodimers, contributing to its quaternary structure, which influences its signaling properties (Kimura2020Free).

In humans, FFAR4 exists as two splice variants, although only the shorter variant is found in rodents and cynomolgus monkeys (Oh2014Omega3). The receptor's structure and function are tissue-specific, which is important for its role in various physiological processes, including anti-inflammation and insulin sensitization (Oh2014Omega3).

## Function
FFAR4, also known as GPR120, is a G-protein coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in anti-inflammatory responses, insulin sensitization, and energy homeostasis. FFAR4 is activated by long-chain free fatty acids, particularly omega-3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (Oh2014Omega3; Kiepura2021AntiAtherosclerotic).

In adipose tissue, FFAR4 is highly expressed and contributes to adipocyte differentiation and maturation. Its activation leads to anti-inflammatory effects by shifting macrophage distribution towards the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, which is crucial for maintaining metabolic health and improving insulin sensitivity (Ichimura2014Free; Oh2014Omega3). FFAR4 also plays a role in the modulation of inflammatory responses in immune cells, such as macrophages, by inhibiting pro-inflammatory signaling pathways like NF-κB (Kimura2020Free; Hidalgo2021Long).

In the gastrointestinal tract, FFAR4 activation promotes the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), enhancing insulin secretion and glucose uptake, which are vital for glucose homeostasis (Kimura2020Free). FFAR4 is also involved in taste perception, particularly in the preference for fatty acids, which may influence dietary habits and energy intake (Kimura2020Free).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FFAR4 gene, also known as GPR120, have been linked to several metabolic and inflammatory disorders. The p.R270H mutation is a notable loss-of-function variant associated with increased fasting plasma glucose levels and a nominal decrease in pancreatic β-cell function, although it does not significantly impact the risk of type 2 diabetes (Bonnefond2015Contribution). This mutation is also linked to increased liver injury and inflammation, as evidenced by elevated alanine aminotransferase levels and higher ferritin in obese children (Secor2021Free). Additionally, the p.R270H variant is associated with obesity risk, particularly in European populations (Kimura2020Free; Ichimura2014Free).

Alterations in FFAR4 expression levels have been observed in obese individuals, with increased expression in adipose tissue linked to obesity and related metabolic issues (Ulven2015Dietary). FFAR4's role in insulin sensitivity and secretion is significant, as its expression in human islets correlates with insulin secretion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes (Kimura2020Free). The gene's involvement in anti-inflammatory processes further supports its potential as a target for treating metabolic and inflammatory diseases (Ulven2015Dietary).

## Interactions
FFAR4, also known as GPR120, is a G-protein coupled receptor that interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in metabolic regulation and inflammation. Upon activation by omega-3 fatty acids, FFAR4 undergoes phosphorylation, enabling interaction with β-arrestin-2. This interaction leads to the recruitment of β-arrestin-2 to the plasma membrane and the internalization of the FFAR4/β-arrestin-2 complex. β-arrestin-2 then associates with TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1) binding protein (TAB1), sequestering it from TAK1, which inactivates TAK1 and disrupts inflammatory signaling pathways involving IKKβ/NFκB and MKK4/JNK/AP1 (Oh2014Omega3).

FFAR4 also interacts with proteins such as TNF, IL1B, SRC, MYC, EGFR, and FN1, which are considered driver nodes in the type 2 diabetes mellitus pathway. The protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed significant nodes interacting with FFAR4, including NR1H4, KCNJ11, CASR, INSR, ABCC8, CCL2, MMP9, ADCY5, and PCSK1. These interactions are associated with pathways like inflammation, homeostasis, and calcium signaling (Jhinjharia2024Deciphering).

The receptor's splice variants, GPR120S and GPR120L, also show differential interactions. GPR120S is capable of eliciting intracellular calcium mobilization, while GPR120L recruits β-arrestin2, indicating a bias towards arrestin-dependent signaling (Watson2012Differential).
