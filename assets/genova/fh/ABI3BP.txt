# ABI3BP

## Overview
ABI3BP, or ABI family member 3 binding protein, is a gene that encodes an extracellular matrix protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell-extracellular matrix interactions, cellular senescence, and differentiation. The protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of mesenchymal stem cells and cardiac progenitor cells, influencing their differentiation, motility, and proliferation through specific signaling pathways (Hodgkinson2014Abi3bp; Hodgkinson2013Abi3bp). ABI3BP is also recognized for its tumor suppressor functions, particularly in thyroid cancer, where it promotes cellular senescence and inhibits tumor invasion (Latini2008Reexpression). Additionally, the gene is implicated in aging-related processes, such as renal and lung aging, by modulating pathways associated with cellular senescence and ferroptosis (Ji2024ABI3BP). These multifaceted roles underscore the significance of ABI3BP in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions.

## Function
ABI3BP, also known as ABI family member 3 binding protein, is an extracellular matrix protein that plays a significant role in cell-extracellular matrix interactions, cellular senescence, and differentiation processes. In mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), ABI3BP is involved in regulating differentiation, motility, and focal adhesion formation, which are crucial for cell spreading, migration, and proliferation. It influences the formation of focal complexes and adhesions, affecting the dynamics of cell adhesion and extracellular matrix interactions (Hodgkinson2013Abi3bp).

In cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), ABI3BP regulates proliferation and differentiation through integrin-β1, PKCζ, and Akt signaling pathways. It is essential for the expression of differentiation markers such as Gata4 and Gata6, and its absence leads to impaired differentiation and increased proliferation (Hodgkinson2014Abi3bp). ABI3BP is also expressed in the heart and vasculature, where it may help maintain the non-proliferative state of the myocardium and provide mechanical strength against blood flow (Delfín2019The).

In the context of cancer, ABI3BP acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting cellular senescence and inhibiting invasion, particularly in thyroid tumors. Its re-expression in malignant cells can restore normal cellular functions and prevent tumor progression (Latini2008Reexpression).

## Clinical Significance
The ABI3BP gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In cancer, ABI3BP is often underexpressed in malignant tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Its re-expression in thyroid cancer cells has been shown to suppress tumor growth by promoting senescence and inhibiting invasion, potentially through the p21 signaling pathway (Latini2008Reexpression). ABI3BP is also associated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint interactions in various cancers, indicating its role in tumor-immune interactions and potential as an immunotherapy target (Feng2023A).

In renal aging, ABI3BP is up-regulated in conditions like irradiation-induced aging and UUO injury, leading to down-regulation of the Klotho gene and promoting ferroptosis, a form of cell death. This suggests that ABI3BP contributes to renal aging by inducing cellular senescence through the Klotho-mediated ferroptosis pathway (Ji2024ABI3BP). The gene's expression is also linked to aging in lung tissues and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, indicating its broader role in age-related conditions (Ji2024ABI3BP). These findings highlight ABI3BP's potential as a biomarker for prognosis and treatment response in cancer and aging-related diseases.
