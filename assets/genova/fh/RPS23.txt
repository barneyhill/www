# RPS23

## Overview
RPS23 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein S23, a critical component of the 40S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes. This protein plays a pivotal role in the ribosomal decoding center, where it is involved in the accurate translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into proteins. Ribosomal protein S23 is subject to post-translational modifications, notably hydroxylation at a conserved proline residue, Pro-62, which is catalyzed by the enzyme OGFOD1. This modification is essential for maintaining translational fidelity and affects the protein's interaction with mRNA and transfer RNA (tRNA) during protein synthesis (Singleton2014OGFOD1; Loenarz2014Hydroxylation). The evolutionary conservation of RPS23 and its modifications across eukaryotes underscores its importance in cellular function and stress response. Mutations in the RPS23 gene have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Orgebin2020Ribosomopathies:).

## Structure
The RPS23 gene encodes a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, which plays a crucial role in protein synthesis. The primary structure of RPS23 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the RPS23 gene. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including hydroxylation, which is significant for its function in translational accuracy. Specifically, hydroxylation occurs at a conserved proline residue, Pro-62, catalyzed by the enzyme OGFOD1 in humans. This modification is crucial for maintaining translational fidelity and affects the protein's interaction with mRNA and tRNA during translation (Singleton2014OGFOD1; Loenarz2014Hydroxylation).

The tertiary structure of RPS23 involves its folding into a three-dimensional shape, which includes a loop that projects into the ribosomal decoding center. This loop is essential for the codon-anticodon interaction, impacting translation termination efficiency (Singleton2014OGFOD1). The quaternary structure of RPS23 involves its integration into the ribosome, where it forms part of the ribosomal decoding center, interacting with other ribosomal proteins and RNA to facilitate accurate protein synthesis (Loenarz2014Hydroxylation). The hydroxylation of RPS23 is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes, highlighting its importance in ribosomal function (Loenarz2014Hydroxylation).

## Function
RPS23 encodes a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, which is essential for protein synthesis in human cells. This protein plays a critical role in the ribosomal decoding center, where it is involved in the accurate translation of mRNA into proteins. RPS23 is subject to posttranslational modifications, specifically hydroxylation at the Pro-62 residue, which is catalyzed by the enzyme OGFOD1. This modification is crucial for maintaining translational accuracy and affects the readthrough of stop codons, thereby influencing translation termination (Loenarz2014Hydroxylation).

The hydroxylation of RPS23 is evolutionarily conserved and is important for normal cellular function, including translation control and stress response. In human cells, this modification is widespread and nearly complete across various tissues, indicating its significance in cellular processes (Singleton2014OGFOD1). The interaction between OGFOD1 and RPS23 is necessary for translation control and stress granule formation, which are critical for cellular homeostasis and response to stress (Singleton2014OGFOD1).

RPS23 is active in the cytoplasm, where ribosomes are located, and its proper function is essential for cellular growth and proliferation. The hydroxylation of RPS23 by OGFOD1 is a nonredundant function that supports normal translation processes and cellular stress responses (Singleton2014OGFOD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RPS23 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including microcephaly, hearing loss, growth deficits, and dysmorphic features. These conditions arise from mutations in genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, such as RPS23, which play a crucial role in protein synthesis (Orgebin2020Ribosomopathies:). Missense variants in RPS23, such as RPS23 p.Arg67Lys, have been identified in individuals with dysmorphism, autism, and intellectual disability. These variants do not typically present with a hematological phenotype but are known to impair translational fidelity by increasing frameshifting and stop codon readthrough, affecting pre-rRNA processing and polysome formation (Lezzerini2019Ribosomal).

While RPS23 mutations have not been directly linked to an increased risk of cancer, they are associated with a ribosomopathy characterized by increased amino acid misincorporation. This condition highlights the potential for ribosomal protein mutations to impact translation processes, although specific cancer risks related to RPS23 mutations have not been established (Sulima2019Cancer). The diverse clinical manifestations of ribosomopathies, including those involving RPS23, present challenges in treatment, necessitating new therapeutic approaches such as gene and cell therapy (Orgebin2020Ribosomopathies:).

## Interactions
Ribosomal protein S23 (RPS23) is known to participate in several interactions that are crucial for its function in the ribosome. RPS23 interacts with OGFOD1, a prolyl hydroxylase, which catalyzes the hydroxylation of RPS23 at the Pro-62 residue. This post-translational modification is essential for the formation of a 100-kDa complex between OGFOD1 and RPS23, indicating a high-affinity interaction. The interaction is context-dependent and linked to OGFOD1's catalytic function, which is necessary for cell growth and stress granule formation (Singleton2014OGFOD1).

RPS23 also plays a role in the antibacterial activity of ribosomal proteins. It interacts with bacterial signature molecules such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and peptidoglycan (PGN). These interactions suggest that RPS23 can bind to bacterial components, leading to membrane disruption and cytoplasmic leakage in bacteria, which highlights its potential role in immune defense (Ma2020Identification).

These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of RPS23 in both ribosomal function and antimicrobial activity, reflecting its evolutionary conservation and biological significance across different organisms.
