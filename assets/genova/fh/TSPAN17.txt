# TSPAN17

## Overview
TSPAN17 is a gene that encodes the protein tetraspanin 17, a member of the tetraspanin family, specifically the TspanC8 subgroup. Tetraspanin 17 is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of the metalloprotease ADAM10, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, signaling, and protein cleavage. The protein is involved in the maturation and trafficking of ADAM10, influencing its localization and activity within the cell. TSPAN17 has been implicated in the regulation of endothelial cell functions and is associated with pathological conditions such as glioblastoma multiforme and papillary thyroid carcinoma, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and prognosis (Wang2022Potential; Matthews2018Regulation; Guo2019miR‑378a‑3p).

## Function
TSPAN17, a member of the TspanC8 subgroup of tetraspanins, plays a crucial role in regulating the metalloprotease ADAM10, which is involved in various cellular processes. TSPAN17, along with other TspanC8 tetraspanins, facilitates the exit of ADAM10 from the endoplasmic reticulum, its maturation in the Golgi, and its trafficking to the cell surface or other membrane compartments (SaintPol2017Regulation; Matthews2018Regulation). TSPAN17 specifically targets ADAM10 to late endosomes, influencing its subcellular localization and activity (SaintPol2017Regulation; Eschenbrenner2019TspanC8).

In endothelial cells, TSPAN17, along with Tspan5, regulates the expression of VE-cadherin, a key adhesion molecule, thereby impacting cell adhesion and signaling processes (Matthews2018Regulation). This regulation is significant for T-cell transmigration, particularly in inflammatory conditions (Matthews2018Regulation). Despite its established roles in these processes, the specific function of TSPAN17 in healthy human cells remains less defined, and further research is needed to elucidate its full range of activities and interactions within the cellular environment (Matthews2018Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of TSPAN17 have been implicated in various cancers, notably glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). In GBM, TSPAN17 is upregulated, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis, larger tumor size, and higher WHO grade. The study by Guo et al. demonstrated that miR-378a-3p, a microRNA, targets TSPAN17, and its downregulation leads to increased TSPAN17 expression, promoting tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion. This suggests that TSPAN17 acts as an oncogene in GBM, and its expression levels could serve as a molecular indicator of poor prognosis (Guo2019miR‑378a‑3p).

In PTC, TSPAN17 is also upregulated and identified as a differentially expressed gene associated with various clinicopathological stages, including N, T, and TNM stages. This upregulation suggests a critical oncogenic role in PTC progression, potentially influencing tumor growth and metastasis through pathways like integrins and Hippo signaling (Wang2022Potential).

TSPAN17 is part of the TspanC8 subgroup of tetraspanins, which regulate the maturation and cell surface expression of ADAM10, a metalloprotease involved in cancer and other diseases. Alterations in TSPAN17 expression may affect ADAM10 activity, impacting processes like Notch signaling (Haining2012The; Matthews2018Regulation).

## Interactions
TSPAN17, a member of the tetraspanin family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is part of the TspanC8 subgroup of tetraspanins, which includes Tspan5, Tspan10, Tspan14, Tspan15, and Tspan33. These tetraspanins are known to interact with ADAM10, a metalloprotease, and regulate its maturation and cell surface expression. This interaction is crucial for ADAM10's role in cleaving the extracellular regions of numerous transmembrane proteins, impacting processes such as Notch signaling and amyloid precursor protein processing (Haining2012The).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), TSPAN17 is directly targeted by miR-378a-3p, a microRNA that binds to the 3' untranslated region of TSPAN17, reducing its expression. This interaction inhibits cellular proliferation and migration, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for miR-378a-3p in GBM treatment (Guo2019miR‑378a‑3p). TSPAN17's involvement in these interactions highlights its role in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Zhang2024Tspan).
