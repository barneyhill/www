# ABLIM2

## Overview
ABLIM2 (actin binding LIM protein family member 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining cellular structure and facilitating motility. The ABLIM2 protein is characterized by its LIM domains and a villin headpiece domain, which enable it to interact with other proteins and bind to actin, respectively (Klimov2005Genomic; Barrientos2007Two). This protein is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and brain tissues, suggesting its significant role in these areas (Barrientos2007Two). Functionally, ABLIM2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including the nuclear import of MKL1, stabilization of F-actin, and the regulation of SRF/MKL1 activity, which are essential for cellular development and differentiation (Schneider2015Identification; Elagib2022Relieving). Additionally, ABLIM2 is involved in endothelial cell proliferation and migration, contributing to angiogenesis during wound healing (Brönneke2015Genomewide). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as STARS and MS1, further highlight its role in muscle and neuronal tissues (jordan2015investigation; Barrientos2007Two).

## Structure
The ABLIM2 protein is characterized by a specific domain architecture that includes four LIM domains in the N-terminal region and a carboxyl-terminal villin headpiece (VHP) domain. The LIM domains are double zinc finger motifs involved in protein-protein interactions, while the VHP domain is associated with actin binding (Klimov2005Genomic; Barrientos2007Two). These structural features suggest that ABLIM2 plays a role in linking the actin cytoskeleton to cell signaling pathways (Krupp2006Actin).

The ABLIM2 gene produces two mRNA isoforms, a and b, which differ in their exon composition, with isoform a having 20 exons and isoform b having 18 exons (Klimov2005Genomic). These isoforms result in different protein variants, with the longer variant encoding 649 amino acids and the shorter one encoding 559 amino acids (Barrientos2007Two). The presence of these isoforms suggests functional diversity in different tissues.

Post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms can influence the activity and interactions of ABLIM2, although specific modifications are not detailed in the available context. The protein's expression is notably high in skeletal muscle and the brain, indicating its importance in these tissues (Barrientos2007Two).

## Function
ABLIM2 (actin binding LIM protein family member 2) is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, playing a crucial role in cellular structure and motility. It promotes the nuclear import of MKL1, a regulator that enters the nucleus upon activation of Rho-dependent actin polymerization, thereby enhancing SRF/MKL1 activity, which is important for the expression of Hedgehog (Hh) target genes (Schneider2015Identification). ABLIM2 is also implicated in stabilizing F-actin, contributing to the formation of cellular structures such as stress fibers, which are essential for maintaining cell shape and facilitating movement (Schneider2015Identification).

In the context of megakaryocyte morphogenesis, ABLIM2 is upregulated upon DYRK1A inhibition, leading to increased F-actin incorporation into cortical filaments, which is crucial for the morphogenetic transition of megakaryocytes (Elagib2022Relieving). ABLIM2's role in actin cytoskeletal remodeling is essential for the transition of megakaryocytes from a fetal to an adult-like phenotype, indicating its importance in cellular development and differentiation (Elagib2022Relieving). Additionally, ABLIM2 is involved in endothelial cell proliferation and migration, contributing to angiogenesis during wound healing (Brönneke2015Genomewide).

## Interactions
ABLIM2, a member of the actin-binding LIM protein family, is known for its interactions with various proteins, particularly in muscle and neuronal tissues. ABLIM2 interacts with the muscle-specific protein STARS, which is involved in actin binding and transcriptional regulation. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments and co-localization studies using immunofluorescence (Barrientos2007Two). ABLIM2 also binds strongly to F-actin, as demonstrated by actin co-sedimentation assays, indicating a direct association with the actin cytoskeleton (Barrientos2007Two).

In addition to its interaction with STARS, ABLIM2 is involved in the regulation of the serum-response factor (SRF)-dependent transcription. Knockdown experiments using siRNAs against ABLIM proteins, including ABLIM2, resulted in decreased activation of the SM22-luciferase reporter, suggesting that ABLIM2 is required for SRF-dependent transcription (Barrientos2007Two). ABLIM2 also interacts with the Myocyte Stress 1 (MS1) protein, co-precipitating with it in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and co-localizes with MS1 and α-actinin in mouse skeletal muscle tissue (jordan2015investigation).

Furthermore, ABLIM2 is a substrate of DYRK1A kinase, which phosphorylates ABLIM proteins, affecting the actin cytoskeleton and influencing Hedgehog (Hh) signaling (Schneider2015Identification).
