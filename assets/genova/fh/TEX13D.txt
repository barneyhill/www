# TEX13D

## Overview
TEX13D is a gene that encodes the protein TEX13 family member D, which is part of the testis-expressed protein family. This protein is primarily expressed in the testis, suggesting a role in male reproductive biology. While the specific function of TEX13 family member D remains to be fully elucidated, proteins in this family are often implicated in processes related to spermatogenesis and fertility. The TEX13D gene is located on chromosome X, and its expression pattern indicates it may have specialized functions in germ cell development. Further research is needed to clarify the molecular pathways and interactions involving TEX13 family member D, as well as its potential implications in reproductive health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
