# HLA-F

## Overview
HLA-F is a gene that encodes a non-classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I protein, known as major histocompatibility complex, class I, F. This protein is distinct from classical MHC class I molecules due to its unique structural and functional characteristics. Unlike typical MHC class I proteins, HLA-F has a truncated cytoplasmic domain and an open-ended peptide-binding groove, which allows it to present a diverse array of peptides, including noncanonical and phosphorylated ones (Goodridge2010HLAF; Dulberger2017Human). HLA-F is primarily involved in immune regulation, interacting with various immune receptors such as ILT2, ILT4, and KIR3DS1, thereby influencing the activation and function of lymphocytes, monocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells (GarciaBeltran2016Open; Lepin2000Functional). Its expression is upregulated upon lymphocyte activation, highlighting its role in the immune response (Lee2010HLA‐F). Additionally, HLA-F's involvement in immune surveillance and tolerance makes it a significant player in both normal immune function and pathological conditions, including cancer and viral infections (GarciaBeltran2016Open; Feng2019Correlation).

## Structure
HLA-F is a non-classical MHC class I molecule characterized by a unique molecular structure. The primary structure of HLA-F includes a heavy chain encoded by the HLA-F gene, which pairs with β2-microglobulin (Ishitani2006The). The heavy chain is shorter than typical HLA class I proteins due to the exclusion of exon 7, resulting in a truncated cytoplasmic domain (Ishitani2006The). 

The secondary structure of HLA-F involves α-helices and β-sheets that form a peptide-binding groove, although this groove may be partially open-ended, differing from the closed conformation seen in other MHC class I proteins (Goodridge2010HLAF). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a compact domain, with significant alterations in residues that are usually conserved in MHC class I proteins, suggesting fundamental structural differences (Goodridge2010HLAF).

In terms of quaternary structure, HLA-F can exist in multiple forms, including complexes with β2-microglobulin and MHC-I heavy chains in an open conformer form, free of peptide (Goodridge2010HLAF). HLA-F undergoes post-translational modifications such as high-mannose hybrid-type glycosylation, which is Endo H-sensitive (Lee2010HLA‐F). This glycosylation state is distinct from other MHC class I proteins and may influence its trafficking and function.

## Function
HLA-F is a non-classical MHC class I molecule involved in immune regulation. It is expressed on the surface of activated lymphocytes, including B cells, T cells, and NK cells, and plays a role in immune surveillance and tolerance (Lee2010HLA‐F). HLA-F interacts with various immune receptors, such as ILT2 and ILT4, on monocytes and B cells, influencing the activation threshold of these cells (Lepin2000Functional). It also binds to NK cell receptors like KIR3DS1, triggering NK cell activation and cytokine production, which is significant in antiviral responses (GarciaBeltran2016Open).

HLA-F has a unique open-ended groove that allows it to present long, noncanonical peptides, suggesting a specialized role in immune regulation (Dulberger2017Human). It can present a diverse array of peptides, including phosphorylated ones, which may influence immune responses through interactions with NK cell receptors (Dulberger2017Human). The protein's expression is upregulated upon lymphocyte activation, indicating its role in the activated immune response (Lee2010HLA‐F). HLA-F's ability to exist in both open conformations and peptide-bound states adds a layer of regulatory potential, unique among MHC-I molecules (Dulberger2017Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HLA-F gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In brain gliomas, HLA-F mRNA expression is upregulated in high-grade gliomas and downregulated in gliomas with IDH1 mutations. Higher HLA-F expression is linked to shorter overall survival in glioma patients, suggesting its role as an independent prognostic factor (Feng2019Correlation). In the context of cancer, high HLA-F expression has been associated with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer and esophageal cancer (Foroni2014HLAE). 

HLA-F also plays a role in immune responses against viral infections. It serves as a ligand for the activating NK-cell receptor KIR3DS1, which is involved in the immune response to HIV-1. The interaction between HLA-F and KIR3DS1 is crucial for NK cell-mediated antiviral activity, although HIV-1 infection can alter the expression of KIR3DS1 ligands, suggesting an immune-evasion strategy by the virus (GarciaBeltran2016Open).

In reproductive health, variations in HLA-F expression have been linked to fecundability and pregnancy outcomes. Lower HLA-F expression is associated with recurrent pregnancy loss and longer time-to-pregnancy, indicating its potential role in implantation success (Burrows2016Expression; Persson2020A).

## Interactions
HLA-F is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in immune regulation. It specifically binds to ILT2 and ILT4 receptors, as demonstrated by the use of recombinant HLA-F tetramers that stain CD19+ and CD14+ cells, but not T cells or natural killer cells. This binding is confirmed through surface plasmon resonance studies and is inhibited by the anti-ILT2 and ILT4 antibody 28C8, indicating a direct interaction (Lepin2000Functional).

HLA-F can also form complexes with MHC class I heavy chains (HC) in an open conformer form, which is likely free of peptide. This interaction occurs both intracellularly and on the cell surface, suggesting a role in stabilizing MHC-I HC and potentially aiding in their transport to the cell surface (Goodridge2010HLAF; Foroni2014HLAE).

HLA-F interacts with killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR), such as KIR3DL1, KIR3DL2, and KIR3DS1, influencing NK cell activity. These interactions may represent a new class of ligands, suggesting a deeper function in the activated immune response (Hò2020The; Foroni2014HLAE). HLA-F's interaction with KIR3DS1 is particularly significant in the context of HIV infection, where it leads to the secretion of antiviral cytokines (Hò2020The).
