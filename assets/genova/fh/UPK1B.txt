# UPK1B

## Overview
Uroplakin 1B (UPK1B) is a gene that encodes the tetraspanin protein uroplakin 1B, which is a critical component of the asymmetric unit membrane in the urothelium, the epithelial lining of the urinary tract. This protein is integral to the formation and maintenance of urothelial plaques, which are essential for the structural integrity and function of the urothelial barrier (Finch1999Cloning; Carpenter2016Uroplakin). UPK1B is located on chromosome 3q13.3-21 and is highly conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Finch1999Cloning). The protein interacts with other uroplakins to form complexes that stabilize the apical surface of urothelial cells, playing a significant role in maintaining the bladder's permeability barrier and cellular homeostasis (Goda2023Possible; Carpenter2016Uroplakin). Alterations in UPK1B expression are associated with various urinary tract conditions and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (wang2018upk1b; Jackson2020Roles).

## Structure
Uroplakin 1B (UPK1B) is a tetraspanin protein characterized by four transmembrane domains, which is typical of the tetraspanin family (Goda2023Possible). The protein is a component of the asymmetric unit membrane on the apical surface of the bladder, contributing to the structural integrity of urothelial plaques (Finch1999Cloning). The primary structure of UPK1B is highly conserved, showing 92% amino acid homology with bovine UPK1b and 93% with mink TI1 proteins (Finch1999Cloning).

The UPK1B gene is located on chromosome 3q13.3-21 and is expressed as part of the terminal differentiation products in the urothelial plaques of the bladder (Finch1999Cloning). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which is common in tetraspanins, although specific modifications for UPK1B are not detailed in the provided context.

UPK1B may form complexes with other uroplakins, indicating a quaternary structure, although specific details on these interactions are not provided (Goda2023Possible). The study of UPK1B's expression in normal and cancerous tissues suggests its role in advanced urothelial differentiation and potential involvement in cancer pathogenesis (Finch1999Cloning).

## Function
Uroplakin 1B (UPK1B) is a critical component of the asymmetric unit membrane on the apical surface of the urothelium, the epithelial lining of the urinary tract. This protein is part of the tetraspan family and plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the urothelial barrier. UPK1B is involved in forming urothelial plaques, which are essential for the permeability barrier of the urothelium, protecting underlying tissues from urine and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Yu1994Uroplakins; Carpenter2016Uroplakin).

In healthy human cells, UPK1B contributes to advanced urothelial differentiation and is highly expressed in normal urothelium, suggesting its importance in healthy bladder function (Finch1999Cloning). The protein interacts with other uroplakins, such as UPK3a, UPK3b, and UPK2, to form a stable complex that is crucial for the structural organization of the urothelial cells (Carpenter2016Uroplakin). UPK1B also plays a role in regulating membrane permeability and stabilizing the apical membrane through interactions with the cytoskeleton, which is vital for maintaining the integrity of the bladder surface during pressure fluctuations associated with urine storage and micturition (Carpenter2016Uroplakin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the UPK1B gene are associated with several urinary tract and urothelial conditions. In knockout mouse models, the absence of UPK1B leads to urothelial hyperplasia, hydronephrosis, and duplex kidneys, indicating its role in ureteric bud branching morphogenesis and urinary tract development (Carpenter2016Uroplakin; Jackson2020Roles). UPK1B is also implicated in congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), with its loss resulting in disrupted urothelial plaques, leading to dysplastic urothelia and compromised structural integrity (Carpenter2016Uroplakin).

In bladder cancer, UPK1B expression is significantly higher in cancerous tissues and is associated with advanced tumor stages, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. It promotes cancer progression through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (wang2018upk1b). Additionally, UPK1B expression is linked to gastric cancer, where high levels correlate with poorer overall survival and disease-free survival, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker (Zhu2020Comprehensive). These findings highlight the clinical significance of UPK1B in both developmental anomalies and cancer progression.

## Interactions
Uroplakin 1B (UPK1B) is a tetraspanin protein that plays a crucial role in the formation of urothelial plaques, which are essential for the structural integrity and function of the urothelium. UPK1B interacts with other uroplakin proteins, such as UPK1A, UPK2, and UPK3, to form heterodimers and heterotetramers. These complexes are critical for the assembly of the asymmetric unit membrane (AUM) plaques that stabilize and strengthen the epithelial cells lining the bladder (Kaczmarek2023Loss; Carpenter2016Uroplakin).

The interaction between UPK1B and other uroplakins is essential for the proper transport and surface expression of these proteins, which are packaged into vesicles and transported to the cell surface. This process is vital for the bladder's ability to stretch and maintain its barrier function (Kaczmarek2023Loss). The absence of UPK1B disrupts plaque formation, leading to urothelial dysmorphogenesis and loss of structural integrity, which can result in congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (Carpenter2016Uroplakin).

These interactions highlight the importance of UPK1B in maintaining urothelial homeostasis and its potential role in preventing bladder cancer progression (Carpenter2016Uroplakin).
