# TACR2

## Overview
The TACR2 gene encodes the tachykinin receptor 2 (NK2R), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, which is integral to various physiological processes. This receptor is primarily involved in binding neurokinin A (NKA), a neuropeptide that influences smooth muscle contractility, particularly within the gastrointestinal and reproductive systems (Steinhoff2014Tachykinins). Structurally, NK2R is characterized by seven α-helical transmembrane segments, a hallmark of GPCRs, and is a glycoprotein, indicating post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (Jakimiuk2017Characterisation). The gene's structure is evolutionarily conserved, with significant similarity across species, underscoring its biological importance (Jakimiuk2017Characterisation). TACR2's role extends to the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it influences cellular signaling pathways related to pain perception and immune response (Jianfeng2021TACR2). Alterations in TACR2 expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancers and inflammatory conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Jianfeng2021TACR2; Steinhoff2014Tachykinins).

## Structure
The TACR2 gene encodes the neurokinin-2 receptor (NK2R), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. The primary structure of NK2R consists of 381 amino acids (Jakimiuk2017Characterisation). The receptor is characterized by seven α-helical transmembrane segments, a common feature of GPCRs, which form the secondary structure (Jakimiuk2017Characterisation). These helices are arranged in a manner typical of GPCRs, contributing to the receptor's tertiary structure, which includes an extracellular amino-terminus and an intracellular carboxyl tail (Jakimiuk2017Characterisation).

The NK2R is a glycoprotein, indicating that it undergoes glycosylation, a post-translational modification that can affect receptor function and signaling (Jakimiuk2017Characterisation). The structural organization of the TACR2 gene includes five exons, with introns interrupting the protein-coding sequence at identical positions to those in other mammals, suggesting evolutionary conservation (Jakimiuk2017Characterisation). The receptor's structure is highly conserved across species, sharing significant similarity with human, cow, and mouse orthologs, although some differences exist in the amino- and carboxy-termini and transmembrane domain V (Jakimiuk2017Characterisation).

## Function
Tachykinin receptor 2 (TACR2) is a G-protein-coupled receptor primarily involved in binding neurokinin A (NKA), a neuropeptide that plays a significant role in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, TACR2 is implicated in smooth muscle contractility, particularly in the gastrointestinal and reproductive systems. It mediates excitatory transmission in smooth muscle and interstitial cells of Cajal, which are crucial for motility and peristalsis, especially in the colon (Steinhoff2014Tachykinins). TACR2 is also involved in uterine contraction, with its expression being regulated during pregnancy, and it plays a role in prostate contraction (Campo2022Tachykinins).

In the gastrointestinal tract, TACR2 is expressed by myocytes, neuronal varicosities, and epithelial cells, suggesting its involvement in regulating motility, secretion, inflammation, and pain (Steinhoff2014Tachykinins). The receptor is also active in the central and peripheral nervous systems, influencing cellular signaling pathways that contribute to organismal functions like pain perception and immune response (Jianfeng2021TACR2). Overall, TACR2's activity in these systems highlights its importance in maintaining normal physiological functions across various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TACR2 gene, which encodes the tachykinin receptor NK2, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In prostate cancer, TACR2 expression is significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with advanced clinical stages, higher Gleason scores, and poorer survival outcomes. Conversely, higher TACR2 expression correlates with better survival rates, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic protective factor and a therapeutic target in prostate cancer (Jianfeng2021TACR2).

TACR2 is also involved in the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). It is part of a network of co-altered genes that show significant correlation differences between tumor and non-tumor tissues. These genes, including TACR2, are considered potential prognostic targets and may serve as 'disease-specific systems biomarkers' for PTC (UNAL2022Bioinformatics).

In addition to cancer, TACR2 expression alterations have been linked to inflammatory diseases. For instance, NK2R, the receptor encoded by TACR2, is upregulated in inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting a role in modulating inflammatory responses (Steinhoff2014Tachykinins).
