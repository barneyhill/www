# ABCE1

## Overview
ABCE1 is a gene that encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily E member 1 protein, a crucial component of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. This protein is unique among ABC proteins as it lacks transmembrane domains and is primarily involved in intracellular processes. ABCE1 plays a pivotal role in ribosome biogenesis and recycling, facilitating the dissociation of ribosomal subunits during translation termination and ensuring efficient mRNA regulation (Zhu2020Ribosome; Barthelme2011Ribosome). Structurally, the protein is characterized by two nucleotide-binding domains and an N-terminal iron-sulfur cluster domain, which are essential for its function and stability (Barthelme2007Structural; Nürenberg‐Goloub2020Molecular). Beyond its fundamental role in translation, ABCE1 is implicated in viral replication and cancer progression, making it a significant focus of biomedical research (Liu2020Host; REN2012Role).

## Structure
The ABCE1 protein is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily and is characterized by its unique structural features. It contains two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) arranged in a head-to-tail orientation, which are crucial for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Nürenberg‐Goloub2020Molecular; Barthelme2011Ribosome). These NBDs are connected by a flexible hinge region, allowing the protein to undergo conformational changes necessary for its function in ribosome recycling (Barthelme2011Ribosome).

ABCE1 also features a distinctive N-terminal iron-sulfur cluster domain (FeSD), which coordinates two nonequivalent, diamagnetic [4Fe-4S] clusters. These clusters are essential for the protein's activity and are coordinated by conserved cysteine residues (Barthelme2007Structural). The FeSD is linked to the main twin-ATPase body via a flexible linker, which can form an alpha-helix or unfold into a loop depending on the protein's state (Nürenberg‐Goloub2020Molecular).

The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by a V-shaped architecture in its open conformation, with the NBDs facilitating a clamp-like motion during ATP binding and hydrolysis (Barthelme2011Ribosome). ABCE1 functions as a monomer and does not oligomerize upon nucleotide binding (Barthelme2011Ribosome). The protein's structure is further stabilized by interactions with ribosomal subunits, mediated by specific motifs such as the helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif and hinge regions (Nürenberg‐Goloub2020Molecular).

## Function
The ABCE1 protein, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in ribosome biogenesis and recycling. Unlike other ABC proteins, ABCE1 lacks transmembrane segments and is involved in intracellular activities. It is essential for the assembly of primate lentivirus capsids, such as HIV-1, and is involved in translation initiation, elongation, termination, and ribosome recycling in eukaryotic cells (Tian2012The).

ABCE1 is a key factor in the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, which degrades mRNA transcripts containing premature termination codons. It facilitates ribosome recycling by splitting the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, a process critical for maintaining mRNA regulation and preventing the accumulation of faulty transcripts (Zhu2020Ribosome). The protein's function is linked to its iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, which are essential for its stability and activity (Zhu2020Ribosome).

ABCE1 is also involved in histone biosynthesis and DNA replication, crucial for normal S phase progression in human cells. Its depletion leads to decreased cell growth and impaired DNA synthesis, highlighting its role in cell cycle progression and proliferation (Toompuu2016ABCE1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ABCE1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. Overexpression of ABCE1 is associated with tumor proliferation in several types of cancer, including lung adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (REN2012Role; Tian2010A; HUANG2014siRNAinduced). In lung adenocarcinoma, ABCE1 expression correlates with clinical stages, suggesting its role in cancer progression (REN2012Role). In breast cancer, ABCE1 overexpression promotes cell proliferation and invasion, while its knockdown increases apoptosis and reduces invasiveness (HUANG2014siRNAinduced).

ABCE1 also plays a role in drug resistance. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ABCE1 is linked to resistance against gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The microRNA miR-153 targets ABCE1, and its overexpression can reverse gefitinib resistance, highlighting ABCE1's involvement in drug resistance mechanisms (Wang2019MiR153).

ABCE1's function as an inhibitor of RNase L, a nuclease involved in apoptosis, further implicates it in cancer pathogenesis. Its inhibition can suppress tumor growth, making it a potential target for anticancer therapies (Chen2006The; Toompuu2016ABCE1).

## Interactions
The ABCE1 protein, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with eukaryotic initiation factors such as eIF2α and eIF5, forming part of the pre-initiation complex essential for mRNA translation. This interaction is crucial for translation initiation, as demonstrated by the inhibition of luciferase mRNA translation when ABCE1 is targeted by specific antibodies (Chen2006The).

ABCE1 also plays a significant role in ribosomal recycling by interacting with eukaryotic release factors eRF1 and eRF3. It binds to post-termination complexes, facilitating their dissociation into subunits, a process essential for efficient ribosome recycling (Pisarev2010The). The protein's interaction with ribosomal subunits is mediated through its Fe-S domain and nucleotide-binding domains, which undergo conformational changes upon ribosome splitting (Nürenberg‐Goloub2020Molecular).

In the context of viral replication, ABCE1 interacts with the Gag protein of HIV and other viruses, aiding in capsid assembly. It also interacts with the viral phosphoprotein of the rabies virus, enhancing viral replication by disrupting the host's immune response (Liu2020Host). Additionally, ABCE1 forms complexes with the cytoskeleton protein β-actin, which is implicated in cell motility and cancer metastasis (HAN2016Tumor).
