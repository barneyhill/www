# THEMIS2

## Overview
THEMIS2 is a gene that encodes the protein thymocyte selection associated family member 2, which functions as a signaling scaffold protein. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in the regulation of natural killer (NK) cell memory and macrophage toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. THEMIS2 is involved in various cellular processes, including the modulation of immune responses and the regulation of cytokine production. It interacts with several proteins, such as DAP12, ZAP70, and the MET receptor tyrosine kinase, influencing pathways that are critical for immune cell differentiation and cancer cell behavior. THEMIS2's expression and interactions have significant implications in cancer biology, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer, where it is associated with cancer stemness, chemoresistance, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Huang2022Novel; Nabekura2023Themis2; Gao2024Signatures).

## Function
THEMIS2 is a signaling scaffold protein that plays a significant role in the immune system, particularly in the regulation of natural killer (NK) cell memory function and macrophage toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. In NK cells, THEMIS2 negatively regulates memory formation by inhibiting Ly49H signaling, which is crucial for NK cell activation and memory differentiation. This regulation involves the formation of a protein complex with DAP12 and ZAP70, affecting transcriptional and epigenetic changes necessary for NK cell differentiation into effector and memory cells (Nabekura2023Themis2).

In macrophages, THEMIS2 selectively regulates TLR signaling and cytokine production, particularly enhancing TNF production in response to TLR4 engagement. It interacts with proteins such as Vav, Lyn, and Grb2, facilitating signaling pathways that lead to the activation of MAP kinases ERK and p38. This interaction is crucial for the modulation of immune responses, as it influences the production of inflammatory cytokines like TNF, while not significantly affecting others like IL-6 or Cox2 (Peirce2010Themis2ICB1). THEMIS2's role in these processes highlights its importance in immune regulation and response to infections.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the THEMIS2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including thyroid cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and ovarian cancer. In thyroid cancer, THEMIS2 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues and is associated with immune infiltration and prognosis. High THEMIS2 expression correlates with lower levels of CD8+ T cells and activated NK cells, but higher levels of Tregs, suggesting a role in immune response modulation (Liu2024Comprehensive).

In TNBC, THEMIS2 enhances cancer stemness and chemoresistance by interacting with the MET receptor, promoting its activation and phosphorylation. This interaction is crucial for the expression of cancer stem cell markers and contributes to chemoresistance, making THEMIS2 a potential target for MET-targeted therapies (Huang2022Novel). THEMIS2 overexpression in TNBC is associated with poor survival outcomes and increased sensitivity to MET inhibitors, indicating its role in cancer progression and treatment response (Huang2022Novel).

In ovarian cancer, THEMIS2 is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process associated with cancer progression and metastasis. High THEMIS2 expression correlates with poor prognosis, and its silencing suppresses EMT markers, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Gao2024Signatures).

## Interactions
THEMIS2 is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, THEMIS2 interacts with the MET receptor tyrosine kinase, promoting its activation and phosphorylation. This interaction is crucial for enhancing cancer stemness and chemoresistance by disrupting the association of protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) with phosphorylated MET (p-MET), thereby protecting p-MET from dephosphorylation (Huang2022Novel). THEMIS2's interaction with MET is constitutive and plays a significant role in regulating cancer cell behavior, including cell migration, invasion, and proliferation (Huang2022Novel).

In the context of natural killer (NK) cells, THEMIS2 interacts with transcription factors such as Zfp740, promoting transcriptional repression. This interaction is part of a mechanism that regulates NK cell memory formation and function (Nabekura2023Themis2). THEMIS2 also forms complexes with proteins like DAP12 and ZAP70, influencing NK cell activation signaling (Nabekura2023Themis2). These interactions highlight THEMIS2's role in modulating immune responses and cellular signaling pathways across different cell types.
