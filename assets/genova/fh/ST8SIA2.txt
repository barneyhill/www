# ST8SIA2

## Overview
ST8SIA2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 2, a type II transmembrane protein primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus. This enzyme is crucial for the polysialylation of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), a modification that plays a significant role in neuronal development and function (Huang2017The). The enzyme's activity is essential for processes such as synaptic plasticity, neural precursor cell migration, and brain wiring, which are vital for cognitive functions and the maintenance of neural networks (Ikegami2019Effect; Schuster2019Cell‐autonomous). Alterations in the ST8SIA2 gene have been linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (McAuley2012Identification). Additionally, ST8SIA2 is involved in cancer biology, where it interacts with nucleolin on the cell surface, suggesting potential therapeutic targets (Moe2021A).

## Structure
The ST8SIA2 gene encodes the enzyme ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 2, which is involved in the polysialylation of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), a process crucial for neuronal development and associated with various cancers (Huang2017The). The enzyme is a type II transmembrane protein localized to the Golgi apparatus, featuring a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a catalytic domain (Huang2017The). 

The primary structure of ST8SIA2 includes conserved sialyl motifs: the Large Sialyl Motif (SML), the Small Sialyl Motif (SMS), and the Very Small Sialyl Motif (SMVS), which are essential for its catalytic activity (Huang2017The). The secondary structure is characterized by α-helices and β-sheets, with antiparallel β-sheets and disulfide bonds contributing to its compact and stable conformation (Huang2017The). 

The tertiary structure of ST8SIA2 is more compact compared to other family members, with specific disulfide bonds at C157/C307 and C171/C371 enhancing its stability and substrate binding capabilities (Huang2017The). The enzyme's catalytic regions are divided into seven domains (A-G), with the C, E-F, and G domains forming the core region necessary for efficient polysialylation (Huang2017The). 

ST8SIA2 may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its function and stability. The enzyme's structure includes a sialyltransferase domain crucial for its enzymatic activity, and it may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (Anne2010Comprehensive).

## Function
The ST8SIA2 gene encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of polysialic acid (PSA), a carbohydrate polymer that modifies the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) (Ikegami2019Effect). This modification is crucial for reducing cell adhesion, which facilitates cell migration, a process essential for proper neuronal development and function (Huang2017The). The enzyme is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid residues to glycoproteins, forming α2,8-linked polysialic acid chains (Huang2017The; HarduinLepers2023The).

In healthy human cells, ST8SIA2 is involved in critical processes such as synaptic plasticity, migration of neural precursor cells, and brain wiring (Ikegami2019Effect). The polysialylation of NCAM by ST8SIA2 is significant for neuronal development, cognition, memory, and neural disorders (Huang2017The). The enzyme's activity is particularly important during brain development, where it influences the migration and distribution of cortical interneurons, affecting their directional persistence and leading process branching (Schuster2019Cell‐autonomous). These processes are vital for maintaining the inhibitory balance in the brain and are implicated in the pathophysiology of certain psychiatric disorders (Schuster2019Cell‐autonomous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ST8SIA2 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorders. Variations in ST8SIA2 are associated with an increased risk of these conditions, potentially due to their impact on neuronal plasticity and early neuronal network formation (McAuley2012Identification). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes within the ST8SIA2 gene have been linked to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, with certain risk haplotypes being over-represented in affected individuals (McAuley2012Identification).

In animal models, the absence of ST8SIA2 leads to significant neurodevelopmental abnormalities, such as reduced densities of parvalbumin-positive interneurons and altered migration patterns of cortical interneurons, which are associated with schizophrenia and autism (Schuster2019Cell‐autonomous). ST8SIA2 deficiency in mice also results in developmental delays, hydrocephalus, and gait disturbances, with these phenotypes being influenced by genetic background (Ikegami2019Effect).

Alterations in ST8SIA2 expression can affect brain connectivity, leading to changes in long-range connectivity and synaptic transmission, which are common findings in psychiatric disorders (Küçükerden2022Compromised). These changes may contribute to cognitive deficits and altered behaviors, such as impaired working memory and increased aggression (Küçükerden2022Compromised).

## Interactions
ST8SIA2 is involved in the expression of de-N-acetyl polysialic acid (dPSA) on the cell surface, particularly in cancer cells. It interacts with nucleolin, a protein that is typically nuclear but is found on the cell surface in many cancers. The presence of dPSA-nucleolin complexes on the surface of various cancer cell lines, such as pancreatic, gastric, and ovarian cancers, is dependent on the re-expression of the ST8SIA2 gene. This interaction suggests a novel cancer pathway that could be targeted for therapeutic intervention (Moe2021A).

ST8SIA2 also plays a role in the polysialylation of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). It is one of the polysialyltransferases responsible for adding polysialic acid to NCAM, which is crucial for various cellular functions, including oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination. The enzyme's interaction with NCAM involves specific structural domains, such as the fibronectin type III repeat (FN1), which serves as a recognition and docking site for polysialylation (Mühlenhoff2013Polysialic; Close2003The). These interactions highlight the enzyme's role in both cancer progression and neural development.
