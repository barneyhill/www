# KIR3DL1

## Overview
KIR3DL1 is a gene that encodes the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor, three Ig domains and long cytoplasmic tail 1, a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. This receptor plays a pivotal role in the immune system by modulating NK cell activity through its interaction with specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules, particularly those expressing the Bw4 epitope. The protein is characterized by three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and a long cytoplasmic tail containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which are crucial for transmitting inhibitory signals that prevent NK cells from attacking healthy cells (O’Connor2007Functional; Parham2011Variable). KIR3DL1 exhibits significant polymorphism, influencing its expression levels and binding affinity, which in turn affects immune responses and has clinical implications in contexts such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and cancer immunotherapy (Pando2003The; Feils2023Associations).

## Structure
KIR3DL1 is a member of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family, characterized by its three immunoglobulin-like domains: D0, D1, and D2. These domains are crucial for its interaction with HLA class I molecules, particularly those expressing the Bw4 epitope (Vivian2011Killer; Fu2011The). The D0 domain, unique to the KIR3D family, acts as an 'innate HLA sensor' by interacting with a conserved region of the HLA molecule, contributing significantly to the binding interface (Vivian2011Killer; Fu2011The). The D1 and D2 domains form a continuous binding interface with HLA-B*5701, with the D1 domain positioned over the Bw4 epitope and the D2 domain interacting with a region spanning residues 142-151 of HLA-B*5701 (Vivian2011Killer).

The protein's structure is defined by the E-type Ig fold topology, with the D0 domain extending towards β2-microglobulin (Vivian2011Killer). Specific aromatic residues in the D0 domain play a crucial role in the interaction with HLA molecules (Vivian2011Killer). KIR3DL1 exhibits polymorphism, with variations often located away from the binding site, suggesting evolutionary pressures such as pathogen-mediated immune evasion (Vivian2011Killer). The KIR3DL1*004 allele is poorly expressed on the cell surface due to substitutions affecting the D0 and D1 domains, impacting proper folding and receptor-ligand interaction (Pando2003The).

## Function
KIR3DL1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells, playing a crucial role in the immune system by regulating NK cell activity. It recognizes the Bw4 epitope on HLA class I molecules, which is essential for preventing NK cells from attacking normal, healthy cells (O’Connor2007Functional; Parham2011Variable). The receptor contains three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and a cytoplasmic tail with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which recruit protein tyrosine phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2 upon engagement. This recruitment leads to the dephosphorylation of key substrates, inhibiting NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production (O’Connor2013The).

KIR3DL1's interaction with HLA-Bw4 molecules is influenced by polymorphisms, affecting its expression levels and binding affinity. These polymorphisms contribute to the diversity of NK cell responses and are thought to correlate with differential immune responses to infections (Pando2003The; Campbell2011Structurefunction). The receptor's expression is regulated by a bidirectional promoter, which acts as a probabilistic switch, influencing the frequency of KIR3DL1 expression in the NK cell population (Li2008Genetic; O’Connor2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the KIR3DL1 gene can significantly impact clinical outcomes, particularly in the context of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Non-expressed KIR3DL1 alleles, such as KIR3DL1*004, are prevalent in European populations and have been associated with increased relapse risk in patients with myeloid malignancies undergoing haploidentical HSCT (hHSCT) (Legrand2023NonExpressed). These alleles may affect natural killer (NK) cell function, potentially leading to poorer transplant outcomes (Legrand2023NonExpressed).

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the reconstitution of KIR3DL1-expressing NK cells post-transplantation has been linked to reduced NK cell activity and disease relapse, suggesting that KIR3DL1 expression may suppress NK cell-mediated graft-versus-leukemia effects (Ureshino2019Reconstitution). Additionally, specific amino acid substitutions, such as L86S and S182P, can alter KIR3DL1 surface expression, which may influence relapse risk in HSCT (Legrand2023NonExpressed).

The interaction between KIR3DL1 and its ligand HLA-Bw4 is also clinically significant. In cancer immunotherapy, patients with KIR3DL1/HLA-Bw4 genotypes have shown improved responses to treatments like bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab, highlighting the potential for KIR genotyping to guide therapeutic strategies (Feils2023Associations).

## Interactions
KIR3DL1 is a receptor that interacts with HLA class I molecules, particularly those containing the Bw4 epitope, such as HLA-B*57:01. This interaction inhibits NK cell activation, playing a crucial role in immune regulation. The Bw4 epitope, characterized by residues 77-83, is essential for KIR3DL1 binding, with Ile 80 and Arg 83 being particularly important. Mutations at these positions can disrupt the interaction, underscoring their significance in maintaining the structural conformation necessary for binding (Saunders2015The).

KIR3DL1 also interacts with HLA-B27, forming both beta-2 microglobulin-associated heterotrimers and b2m-free homodimers. The binding of HLA-B27 heterotrimers to KIR3DL1 is peptide-dependent, whereas homodimers bind independently of the peptide sequence (Kollnberger2007Interaction).

CD8αα homodimers function as a coreceptor for KIR3DL1, enhancing its interaction with HLA-Bw4. This enhancement is crucial for the inhibitory signaling of KIR3DL1, which is important for NK cell education and function. CD8αα facilitates the clustering of KIR3DL1 at the immunological synapse, thereby strengthening the interaction with HLA-Bw4 (Geng2019CD8αα).
