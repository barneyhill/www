# DDX19B

## Overview
DDX19B is a gene that encodes the protein DEAD-box helicase 19B, a member of the DEAD-box protein family known for its role in RNA metabolism. DEAD-box helicase 19B is characterized by its ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including RNA splicing, ribosome assembly, and the regulation of gene expression. This protein is particularly significant in the context of viral infections, such as Influenza A, where it facilitates the nuclear export of viral mRNAs by interacting with the viral polymerase PB2 (Diot2016Influenza). Additionally, DEAD-box helicase 19B is involved in the nuclear import of the SRF coactivator MKL1, highlighting its role in protein transport and cellular signaling pathways (Rajakylä2015RNA). Through these interactions, DDX19B plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to viral challenges.

## Interactions
DDX19B, a member of the DEAD-box protein family, is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, particularly during Influenza A virus (IAV) infection. It interacts with the viral polymerase PB2 in an RNA-independent manner, a process modulated by its ATPase activity. This interaction is crucial for the nuclear export of viral mRNAs, which is essential for IAV replication (Diot2016Influenza). The interaction between DDX19B and PB2 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating a direct interaction that occurs regardless of RNA presence (Diot2016Influenza).

DDX19B also plays a role in the nuclear import of the SRF coactivator MKL1. It binds directly to the MKL1-RPEL domain, facilitating MKL1's interaction with Importin-b for efficient nuclear import. This interaction is independent of DDX19B's helicase activity but requires its RNA-binding capacity (Rajakylä2015RNA). DDX19B's interaction with MKL1 is crucial for the nuclear localization of longer MKL1 constructs, suggesting that DDX19B may regulate MKL1's conformation to promote its nuclear import (Rajakylä2015RNA). These interactions highlight DDX19B's multifaceted role in RNA metabolism and protein transport.
