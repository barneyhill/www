# FAM177B

## Overview
FAM177B is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 177, specifically member B. This protein is involved in various biological processes, although its precise functions remain to be fully elucidated. The FAM177B protein is not currently categorized under a specific class such as kinases or receptors, indicating that its role may be more nuanced or context-dependent. Research has shown that FAM177B is implicated in several health conditions, including coronary artery disease and neurocognitive health, as well as in animal models of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and soft tissue sarcomas (Joshua2023Feline; Lam2022Comparative; Hariharan2021Mapping). These associations suggest that FAM177B may play a role in disease pathophysiology and could serve as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target, warranting further investigation.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The FAM177B gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its association with genetic variants and expression patterns. In the context of coronary artery disease (CAD), FAM177B was identified as a significant gene through gene-based association analyses using VEGAS2 and MAGMA methods. Variants in FAM177B, including a missense variant, were associated with an increased risk of CAD, with an odds ratio of 1.07, suggesting a potential role in CAD pathophysiology (Hariharan2021Mapping).

FAM177B has also been linked to neurocognitive health and self-reported educational attainment, although these associations did not reach genome-wide significance (Hariharan2021Mapping). In feline models of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), FAM177B was among the top differentially expressed genes in the left atrium, indicating its involvement in cardiac remodeling and fibrosis (Joshua2023Feline).

Additionally, FAM177B was identified in a study of canine soft tissue sarcomas, where its expression pattern suggested a potential role in distinguishing perivascular wall tumors from other sarcoma types (Lam2022Comparative). These findings highlight the gene's potential clinical significance across various conditions, although further research is needed to fully understand its role.
