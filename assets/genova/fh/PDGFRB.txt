# PDGFRB

## Overview
The PDGFRB gene encodes the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ), a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, and survival, particularly in cells of mesenchymal origin such as fibroblasts, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells (Guérit2021PDGF). PDGFRβ is activated upon binding with its ligands, PDGF-BB and PDGF-DD, leading to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, which subsequently triggers various downstream signaling pathways, including the MAP kinase cascade and PI3K-Akt pathway (Demoulin2014PDGF). These pathways are essential for processes such as wound healing, blood vessel formation, and tissue homeostasis (Andrae2008Role). Dysregulation of PDGFRB, through mutations or gene rearrangements, is implicated in several pathological conditions, including myeloid neoplasms and primary familial brain calcification, highlighting its significance as a therapeutic target (Di2021Genomic; Vanlandewijck2015Functional).

## Structure
The PDGFRB protein, also known as platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, is a receptor tyrosine kinase with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein chain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Guérit2021PDGF).

The tertiary structure of PDGFRB involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which includes several distinct domains: five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (D1-D5), a transmembrane helix, an inhibitory juxtamembrane domain, a split tyrosine kinase domain, and a C-terminal tail (Lenglez2021Distinct). The extracellular domain is glycosylated and composed of five immunoglobulin-like modules that bind the ligand (Guérit2021PDGF).

The quaternary structure of PDGFRB is characterized by receptor dimerization upon ligand binding, which is essential for its activation. This dimerization is stabilized by conformational changes in the extracellular region, favoring interactions between Ig-like domains 4 and 5 (Guérit2021PDGF). The active kinase domain adopts an asymmetric dimer conformation, facilitating the transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to a tyrosine residue of the substrate (Guérit2021PDGF).

Common post-translational modifications of PDGFRB include phosphorylation, which is crucial for its activation and subsequent signaling cascades (Lenglez2021Distinct). The protein may also exist in splice variant isoforms, which can alter its function or localization.

## Function
PDGFRB, or platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in cells of mesenchymal origin, such as fibroblasts, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells (Guérit2021PDGF). Upon binding with its ligands, PDGF-BB and PDGF-DD, PDGFRB undergoes dimerization and autophosphorylation, which activates several downstream signaling pathways, including the MAP kinase cascade, phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), and SRC family kinases (Demoulin2014PDGF; Guérit2021PDGF).

These pathways are involved in regulating cell proliferation, migration, and survival, contributing to processes such as wound healing, blood vessel formation, and tissue homeostasis (Andrae2008Role; Guérit2021PDGF). PDGFRB signaling is essential for the recruitment of pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, which are critical for vascular stability and development (Andrae2008Role). The receptor also plays a role in actin filament reorganization and calcium ion mobilization, influencing cell movement and communication (Andrae2008Role). PDGFRB's activity is tightly regulated through mechanisms such as receptor internalization and degradation to ensure proper cellular responses (Heldin1999Mechanism).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and rearrangements in the PDGFRB gene are implicated in several diseases. In myeloid neoplasms, PDGFRB rearrangements are associated with conditions such as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). These rearrangements often involve translocations with various partner genes, leading to constitutive activation of the receptor and are highly sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib (Baxter2003Novel; Di2021Genomic).

In the context of primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), mutations in PDGFRB, such as L658P and R987W, result in defective receptor autophosphorylation and impaired signaling, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Nicolas2013Mutation; Vanlandewijck2015Functional). These mutations lead to a loss of function in the PDGFRB gene, which is crucial for normal cellular signaling processes (Vanlandewijck2015Functional).

PDGFRB mutations are also linked to a novel overgrowth syndrome characterized by accelerated growth, distinctive facial features, and neurological symptoms. The mutation c.1751C>G p.Pro584Arg affects the juxtamembrane domain, altering the receptor's catalytic activity (Takenouchi2015Novel). These diverse clinical manifestations underscore the critical role of PDGFRB in various cellular and developmental processes.

## Interactions
PDGFRB (platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling. It interacts with SH2-domain-containing proteins, such as SHP-2, PI3K, and PLCγ, which are recruited following PDGFRB autophosphorylation. These interactions activate signaling pathways like MAP kinase, PI3K-Akt, and PLCγ, which are essential for cell proliferation, survival, and migration (Papadopoulos2018The).

PDGFRB also forms receptor dimers upon binding with specific PDGF ligands, such as PDGF-BB and PDGF-DD, which initiate downstream signaling cascades (Papadopoulos2018The). The receptor is involved in gene fusions, particularly in myeloid neoplasms, where it partners with various genes like PDE4DIP and BIN2, resulting in constitutive activation of its tyrosine kinase activity (AppiahKubi2017Plateletderived).

The adaptor protein Lnk binds to PDGFRB, inhibiting PDGF-dependent signaling. This interaction is primarily mediated by the SH2 domain of Lnk, although Lnk can still bind PDGFRB independently of the SH2 site, suggesting other domains contribute to the interaction (Gueller2011Adaptor). These interactions highlight PDGFRB's central role in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
