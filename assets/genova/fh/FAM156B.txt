# FAM156B

## Overview
FAM156B is a gene located on the X chromosome at position Xp11.22, encoding a protein that is part of the family with sequence similarity 156 member B. This protein is implicated in various biological processes, although its precise function remains to be fully elucidated. FAM156B has been identified as a candidate gene for X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), suggesting a potential role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Lombard2011A). Additionally, alterations in FAM156B have been observed in cancer research, particularly in castration-resistant prostate cancer and early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, indicating its possible involvement in tumorigenic pathways (ILNYTSKYY2023Genomewide; Cheng2020Identification). Despite these associations, further research is necessary to clarify the functional roles and clinical implications of FAM156B.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
FAM156B has been identified as a candidate gene for X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) through computational approaches that prioritize genes based on annotation and sequence motifs. Although its function is not well understood, FAM156B is located at Xp11.22 and has been highlighted as a strong candidate for XLMR, suggesting a potential role in mental retardation phenotypes (Lombard2011A). The gene was identified among 201 X-linked genes annotated in multiple categories related to XLMR, despite not being previously associated with the condition (Lombard2011A).

In cancer research, FAM156B has been noted for its genetic alterations in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). It was found to have one of the highest alteration frequencies, primarily through amplification, indicating a possible role in tumorigenicity (Cheng2020Identification). Additionally, FAM156B was mentioned in the context of a fusion with ERBB2IP in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although the clinical significance of this fusion remains unclear (ILNYTSKYY2023Genomewide). These findings suggest that FAM156B may be involved in various disease mechanisms, warranting further investigation into its clinical significance.
