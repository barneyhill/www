# HACD2

## Overview
HACD2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 2, which plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in humans. This enzyme is categorized as a dehydratase and is integral to the fatty acid elongation cycle, specifically catalyzing the dehydration step within the endoplasmic reticulum. The activity of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 2 is essential for the elongation of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, contributing to the structural diversity and functional roles of VLCFAs in cellular processes such as membrane composition and signaling pathways. The enzyme is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, highlighting its importance in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis (Sawai2017The).

## Function
HACD2 (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 2) is a crucial enzyme in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in humans. It catalyzes the dehydration step in the fatty acid elongation cycle, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. This process is essential for increasing the chain length of fatty acids, contributing to lipid diversity and the physiological roles of VLCFAs, which are critical for various cellular functions such as membrane structure and signaling (Sawai2017The).

HACD2 is identified as the major 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase, showing greater activity than its homolog HACD1. It is involved in the elongation of both saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids. The enzyme is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, indicating its broad role in fatty acid metabolism (Sawai2017The). Disruption of HACD2 in human cell lines significantly reduces fatty acid elongation activities, underscoring its essential function in maintaining normal fatty acid elongation processes (Sawai2017The).

HACD2's activity is crucial for the production of VLCFAs, which are necessary for normal cellular growth and function. The enzyme's role in the elongation of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids contributes to the production of essential VLCFAs in cells (Sawai2017The).
