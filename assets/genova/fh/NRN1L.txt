# NRN1L

## Overview
The NRN1L gene encodes the protein neuritin 1 like, which is a member of the neuritin family of proteins. These proteins are known for their roles in neural development and plasticity. Neuritin 1 like is involved in various cellular processes, including neuronal growth and differentiation, and is thought to play a role in the modulation of synaptic connections. The protein is categorized as a growth-associated protein, which suggests its involvement in the regulation of neuronal growth and repair mechanisms. Research has indicated that NRN1L may be implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
