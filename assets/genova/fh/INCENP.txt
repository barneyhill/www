# INCENP

## Overview
The INCENP gene encodes the inner centromere protein, a pivotal component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which is essential for proper mitotic progression and chromosome segregation. As a scaffold protein, INCENP facilitates the localization and activation of Aurora B kinase, a critical regulator of mitosis, by forming a complex with other CPC components such as Survivin and Borealin (Samejima2015The). The protein's structure includes a single α-helix (SAH) domain that binds to microtubules, allowing dynamic interactions necessary for the phosphorylation of kinetochore substrates (Samejima2015The). INCENP's role extends beyond mitosis, as its dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, including neuroblastoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis (Sun2019Targeting). The gene's expression and function are modulated by post-translational modifications and alternative splicing, highlighting its complexity and significance in cellular division and cancer biology (Mackay1993Molecular).

## Structure
The inner centromere protein (INCENP) is a multidomain protein that plays a crucial role in mitosis as part of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC). The protein structure includes several distinct regions. The N-terminal domain forms a three-helix bundle with Survivin and Borealin, which targets the CPC to the inner centromere (Samejima2015The). The central region of INCENP, previously thought to be a coiled-coil domain, is now identified as a single α-helix (SAH) domain. This SAH domain is highly extendable and directly binds to microtubules, acting as a flexible linker that allows the CPC to interact dynamically with its substrates (Samejima2015The). The C-terminal IN box region binds and activates Aurora B kinase, facilitating its role in phosphorylating kinetochore components (Samejima2015The).

INCENP undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which are important for its function and localization during mitosis (Mackay1993Molecular). The protein is encoded by a single gene, and alternative splicing results in different mRNA variants, suggesting the presence of multiple isoforms (Mackay1993Molecular). These structural features and modifications are essential for INCENP's role in chromosome segregation and mitotic progression.

## Function
The inner centromere protein (INCENP) is a crucial component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which plays a significant role in mitosis. INCENP acts as a scaffold within the CPC, regulating the localization and activity of the complex. During early mitosis, the N-terminal region of INCENP forms a three-helix bundle with Survivin and Borealin, directing the CPC to the inner centromere, where it is essential for chromosome alignment and the spindle assembly checkpoint (Samejima2015The). The C-terminal IN box region of INCENP binds and activates Aurora B kinase, a key player in mitosis (Samejima2015The).

INCENP contains a single α-helix (SAH) domain that directly binds to microtubules, allowing it to act as a flexible linker. This flexibility enables Aurora B to phosphorylate dynamic substrates in the outer kinetochore while being anchored to the inner centromere (Samejima2015The). The SAH domain's microtubule-binding activity is crucial for the CPC's function, ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation (Samejima2015The).

INCENP is also involved in the activation of Aurora B kinase by promoting its clustering in the inner centromere and on spindle microtubules, facilitating the trans-phosphorylation necessary for full kinase activation (Samejima2015The). This activity is vital for maintaining genomic stability during cell division.

## Clinical Significance
The INCENP gene is clinically significant due to its role in various cancers, particularly neuroblastoma (NB). High expression levels of INCENP are associated with poor prognosis in NB patients, especially those with high-risk features such as MYCN amplification. Silencing INCENP in NB cells leads to reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and cellular senescence, indicating its critical role in tumor growth and survival (Sun2019Targeting). INCENP is also overexpressed in other cancers, including high-grade non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas and non-small cell lung cancer, where it correlates with poor survival rates (Sun2019Targeting).

The gene's dysregulation in NB is partly due to its regulation by MYCN, which binds to the promoter regions of INCENP and other chromosomal passenger complex components (Sun2019Targeting). INCENP's location at chromosomal region 11q12.3, near a commonly deleted area in high-risk MYCN subgroups, may also affect its regulation (Sun2019Targeting). Genome-wide association studies have linked SNPs in INCENP to breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer susceptibility, although not directly to NB (Sun2019Targeting). These findings suggest that INCENP could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in these cancers.

## Interactions
INCENP is a critical component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which includes Aurora B kinase, Survivin, and Borealin. This complex is essential for proper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis during mitosis. INCENP interacts with Aurora B, facilitating its activation and localization. The C-terminal region of INCENP binds to Aurora B through a conserved IN box, partially activating the kinase. Full activation is achieved through phosphorylation of a TSS motif near the INCENP C-terminus (Xu2009INCENP–aurora; Honda2003Exploring).

INCENP also forms a ternary subcomplex with Borealin and Survivin, which is crucial for centromere targeting. Borealin binds directly to the N-terminal domain of INCENP, specifically the first 58 amino acids, while Survivin interacts with Borealin, forming a heterotrimeric complex necessary for CPC function (Klein2006Centromere). This subcomplex can target the centromere independently of Aurora B kinase activity (Klein2006Centromere).

INCENP's interactions extend to microtubules, where its single α-helix (SAH) domain binds directly, playing a role in CPC localization and function during mitosis (Samejima2015The). These interactions highlight INCENP's multifaceted role in regulating mitotic progression through its associations with various proteins and structures.
