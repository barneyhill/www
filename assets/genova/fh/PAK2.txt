# PAK2

## Overview
PAK2 (p21-activated kinase 2) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein involved in a variety of cellular processes, including mechanotransduction, cell survival, and metabolism. The PAK2 protein, activated by small GTPases such as Rac1 and Cdc42, plays a critical role in cellular responses to mechanical stress, contributing to cell contractility and adhesion. Structurally, PAK2 comprises a C-terminal kinase domain responsible for its enzymatic activity and an N-terminal regulatory domain that modulates its activation. The protein is implicated in several signaling pathways, including those related to cell survival and mechanosignaling, and interacts with various proteins to mediate its effects. Clinically, mutations in the PAK2 gene have been associated with conditions such as Knobloch syndrome type 2 and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in human health (Campbell2019PAK2; Antonarakis2020Dominant; Dobrigna2023The).

## Structure
PAK2 (p21-activated kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. The protein structure of PAK2 includes a C-terminal kinase domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain, which features a p21-binding domain and an autoinhibitory domain (Kumar2017Structure). The kinase domain is responsible for its enzymatic activity, while the regulatory domain controls its activation through interactions with small GTPases like Cdc42 and Rac (Wu2003Evaluation).

The PAK2 protein interacts with the SH3 domain of the bPIX protein through a high-affinity binding motif, PxxxPR, which is critical for its function. This interaction involves a salt bridge between Arg186 of PAK2 and Asp23 of the bPIX-SH3 domain, as well as hydrophobic interactions with other residues (Hoelz2006Crystal). The crystal structure of the bPIX-SH3 domain in complex with a PAK2-derived peptide reveals a five-stranded β-barrel structure with three grooves that accommodate the peptide (Hoelz2006Crystal).

PAK2 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the gene containing 15 exons and generating three transcripts. Two of these encode proteins of 524 and 221 amino acids, while the third is a non-coding transcript (Kumar2017Structure).

## Function
PAK2 (p21-activated kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in mechanotransduction, cell survival, and metabolism in healthy human cells. It is activated in response to mechanical forces, such as shear stress, and is recruited to the cadherin adhesion complex through E-cadherin, a cell-cell adhesion molecule. This activation is crucial for cellular contractility and adhesion, helping maintain cell structure and function under mechanical stress (Campbell2019PAK2).

PAK2 is involved in the E-cadherin mechanosignaling pathway, which is essential for cell contractility and stiffening. It binds directly to AMPK and Abl, acting as an intermediate in the signaling cascade initiated by force on E-cadherin. This cascade involves AMPK activation, leading to Abl-mediated phosphorylation of vinculin and subsequent activation of RhoA-mediated contractility, cell stiffening, and glucose uptake (Campbell2019PAK2).

PAK2 also plays a role in cell survival by counteracting apoptotic stimuli, particularly in cells subjected to mechanical stress. It is protected from proteolysis through interactions with AMPK, which prevents its cleavage and thus protects cells from apoptosis. This protection is crucial for cell survival under force-induced stress (Campbell2019PAK2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PAK2 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. A dominant monoallelic variant in PAK2, specifically the p.(Glu435Lys) mutation, has been linked to Knobloch syndrome type 2. This mutation affects the kinase domain of PAK2, leading to reduced kinase activity and is associated with symptoms such as retinal detachment and developmental delay (Antonarakis2020Dominant). 

PAK2 is also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. The 3q29 duplication syndrome, which includes PAK2, is associated with intellectual disability, microcephaly, and epilepsy. Missense mutations or deletions in PAK2 can lead to haploinsufficiency, contributing to autism spectrum disorder and other neurodevelopmental issues (Dobrigna2023The).

In the context of cardiovascular health, alterations in PAK2 expression can impact heart function. PAK2 plays a protective role in the heart by regulating the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and oxidative stress. Its depletion can lead to increased reactive oxygen species, cardiac dysfunction, and cell death under stress conditions, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for heart diseases (Binder2019Pak2; Binder2022Pak2).

## Interactions
PAK2 interacts with various proteins and plays a significant role in multiple cellular processes. It is essential for the association of the lentiviral Nef protein with the exocyst complex (EXOC) in T lymphocytes. This interaction is mediated by PAK2's ability to bind small GTPases, such as Rac1 and Cdc42, rather than its kinase activity (Imle2015Association). PAK2 also forms a complex with Nef to phosphorylate and inactivate cofilin, an actin-severing factor, which is crucial for actin dynamics and T cell function (Imle2015Association).

PAK2 interacts with the eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), phosphorylating it and inhibiting cap-dependent translation. This phosphorylation disrupts the interaction between eIF4G and eIF4E, reducing the formation of the eIF4F complex necessary for translation initiation (Ling2005Inhibition).

Huntingtin (Htt) protein binds to PAK2 and prevents its cleavage by caspases, which is crucial for cell survival. This interaction is independent of PAK2's kinase activity and involves specific domains of Htt, highlighting its protective role against apoptosis (Luo2009Huntingtin).
