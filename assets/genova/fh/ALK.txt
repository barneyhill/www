# ALK

## Overview
The ALK gene encodes the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the development and function of the nervous system. As a member of the insulin receptor subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases, ALK is characterized by its extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic domain with catalytic activity. The ALK protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival, primarily within the central and peripheral nervous systems (Morris1997ALK; Motegi2004ALK). Dysregulation of ALK, through mutations or chromosomal translocations, is implicated in several cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer and anaplastic large cell lymphoma, making it a significant target for therapeutic intervention (Hallberg2013Mechanistic; Huang2018Anaplastic).

## Structure
The ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) receptor tyrosine kinase is a protein encoded by the ALK gene, characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of ALK consists of 1619 amino acids in humans, forming a polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 177,155 daltons (Iwahara1997Molecular; Morris1997ALK). The secondary structure includes α-helices and β-strands, with the kinase domain featuring a small amino-terminal lobe and a large carboxy-terminal lobe (Roskoski2013Anaplastic).

The tertiary structure of ALK involves a single transmembrane segment and a cytoplasmic domain, with the extracellular domain containing 16 consensus N-glycosylation sites, indicating glycosylation as a post-translational modification (Morris1997ALK). The quaternary structure is monomeric, as ALK exists as a single 200 kDa glycoprotein without disulfide-linked subunits (Morris1997ALK).

ALK contains several specific domains, including a signal peptide, an extracellular domain, a transmembrane segment, and a kinase domain. The kinase domain shares 64% identity with leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK) and includes conserved motifs typical of protein tyrosine kinases (Morris1997ALK). The protein also features a juxtamembrane segment with an NPXY motif involved in receptor internalization (Morris1997ALK). The presence of potential phosphotyrosine residues in the carboxy-terminal tail suggests additional post-translational modifications (Morris1997ALK).

## Function
The ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) receptor tyrosine kinase is a critical component in the development and function of the nervous system. In healthy human cells, ALK is primarily expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it plays a significant role in neural development, including processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and neurite outgrowth (Iwahara1997Molecular; Motegi2004ALK). ALK is involved in various cellular processes, including division, differentiation, survival, metabolism, and motility, and is believed to be crucial for the normal development and function of the nervous system (Morris1997ALK).

The receptor is a member of the insulin receptor subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases and is characterized by an extracellular ligand-binding region, a hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment, and a cytoplasmic domain with catalytic function (Morris1997ALK). ALK activation triggers downstream signaling cascades, including the MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and JAK/STAT pathways, which influence cellular responses such as proliferation and differentiation (Motegi2004ALK). The receptor's expression begins on embryonic day 11 and continues into neonatal and adult stages, underscoring its importance throughout development (Morris1997ALK).

## Clinical Significance
The ALK gene is implicated in various cancers due to mutations, expression level alterations, or interaction alterations. ALK fusion proteins, resulting from chromosomal translocations, are significant oncogenic drivers in cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) (Hallberg2013Mechanistic; Huang2018Anaplastic). In NSCLC, the EML4-ALK fusion is a notable subtype, often found in younger, non-smoking patients, and ALK inhibitors like crizotinib have shown better performance over standard chemotherapy in ALK-translocation-positive cases (Hallberg2013Mechanistic). ALK rearrangements are also present in 60-80% of ALCL cases, with the NPM-ALK fusion being the most common (Solomon2009ALK).

In neuroblastoma, both activating mutations and high expression levels of ALK contribute to the disease's pathogenesis. Mutations such as ALK F1174L and ALK R1275Q are associated with aggressive tumor development and poor prognosis (Hallberg2013Mechanistic; Schulte2011High). ALK overexpression, regardless of mutation status, is linked to an unfavorable neuroblastoma phenotype (Schulte2011High). ALK mutations and amplifications are also noted in other cancers like rhabdomyosarcomas and thyroid cancer (Hallberg2013Mechanistic; Huang2018Anaplastic).

## Interactions
The ALK receptor tyrosine kinase interacts with various proteins as part of its signaling pathways. It associates with proteins such as IRS-1, Shc, PLCγ, and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase upon activation, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Shc. These interactions are crucial for the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the MEK/ERK pathway, which is essential for transmitting ALK signals (Motegi2004ALK).

Midkine (MK) binds to ALK and acts as a growth factor, inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK, which is necessary for its signaling function. This interaction is specific, as demonstrated by the reduction of phosphorylation with an anti-MK antibody (Stoica2002Midkine). MK binding to ALK is also inhibited by αLBD monoclonal antibodies, which block the ligand/receptor interaction and inhibit MK-stimulated colony formation (Stoica2002Midkine).

ALK also interacts with ligands augmentor α (AUG-α) and augmentor β (AUG-β), which stimulate robust autophosphorylation of ALK, indicating their role as ligands. AUG-α acts as a dual-specific ligand for both ALK and LTK, while AUG-β is specific for LTK (Reshetnyak2015Augmentor). These interactions highlight the complexity and specificity of ALK's role in cellular signaling.
