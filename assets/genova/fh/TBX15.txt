# TBX15

## Overview
TBX15 is a gene that encodes the T-box transcription factor 15, a member of the T-box family of transcription factors, which are characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain known as the T-box. This transcription factor plays a crucial role in regulating developmental processes, particularly in mesodermal development, and is involved in the differentiation and metabolism of muscle and adipose tissues. TBX15 influences pathways such as AMPK signaling, which is essential for muscle fiber type determination and metabolism, and is also implicated in adipocyte browning and thermogenesis, impacting body weight and metabolic health (Lee2015Tbx15; Sun2019Tbx15). Additionally, TBX15 is involved in cancer biology, where it modulates chemoresistance and tumor cell proliferation through various signaling pathways (Jiang2020TBX15miR152KIF2C; Yan2023The). Mutations in the TBX15 gene are associated with clinical conditions such as Cousin syndrome, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Ghosh2017TBox).

## Structure
TBX15 is a member of the T-box family of transcription factors, characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain known as the T-box. The primary structure of TBX15 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. The secondary structure includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its interaction with DNA and other molecular partners. TBX15 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions. Additionally, TBX15 can exist in different splice variant isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing of its mRNA. These isoforms may have distinct functions or regulatory roles within the cell. The quaternary structure of TBX15, if applicable, would involve the assembly of multiple subunits, although specific details on this aspect are not provided in the context.

## Function
TBX15 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regulation of developmental processes, particularly in mesodermal development. It is highly expressed in glycolytic myofibers and is crucial for determining muscle fiber type and metabolism. TBX15 influences the AMPK signaling pathway, which is essential for transforming glycolytic muscle fibers into oxidative fibers, thereby affecting muscle metabolism and whole-body physiology (Lee2015Tbx15). The gene's ablation leads to a decrease in glycolytic fibers and an increase in oxidative fibers, resulting in muscles with slower contraction and relaxation properties (Lee2015Tbx15).

In adipose tissue, TBX15 is involved in adipocyte browning and thermogenesis. It regulates the expression of Prdm16, a critical factor for adipocyte browning, which in turn promotes the expression of thermogenic genes like Ucp1, Dio2, and Cidea (Sun2019Tbx15). TBX15 is also identified as a master trans regulator of genes associated with abdominal obesity, influencing adipocyte differentiation, lipogenesis, and lipolysis (Pan2021Identification). Its expression is modulated by weight changes and is crucial for maintaining homeostasis in adipose tissue, impacting body weight and metabolic health (Pan2021Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBX15 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably Cousin syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder. This syndrome is characterized by craniofacial dysmorphism, hypoplasia of the scapula and pelvis, and short stature. Additional features include macrocephaly, frontal bossing, deep-set eyes, hypertelorism, low-set dysplastic ears, a short webbed neck, and a low hairline. Skeletal abnormalities such as fixed flexion deformities at the elbows, bilateral hip dislocation, brachydactyly, humeroradial synostosis, shortened femurs, and hypoplasia of the scapula and iliac bones are also observed (Ghosh2017TBox).

Alterations in TBX15 expression levels are linked to obesity and metabolic disorders. In humans, TBX15 expression is higher in visceral adipose tissue in non-obese individuals but lower in overweight and obese individuals. This gene plays a role in adipocyte browning and thermogenesis, and its dysregulation can lead to increased body weight and decreased energy expenditure (Sun2019Tbx15).

In cancer, TBX15 overexpression is associated with the proliferation and survival of tumor cells, contributing to malignant transformation. In gliomas, high TBX15 expression correlates with poor prognosis and is involved in immune evasion and angiogenesis (Yan2023The).

## Interactions
TBX15, a T-box transcription factor, is involved in various interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. In the context of breast cancer, TBX15 is part of the TBX15/miR-152/KIF2C pathway, where it modulates doxorubicin resistance. TBX15 overexpression leads to increased miR-152 expression, which targets the 3'-UTR regions of KIF2C, reducing its expression. KIF2C is known to promote chemoresistance by stabilizing PKM2, a glycolytic enzyme, through the prevention of its ubiquitination. This interaction is crucial for maintaining PKM2 stability and function, which TBX15 indirectly influences by modulating miR-152 levels (Jiang2020TBX15miR152KIF2C; Jiang2021TBX15miR152KIF2C).

In gliomas, TBX15 is implicated in pathways such as ECM-receptor interaction and PI3K-Akt signaling, which are essential for tumor cell proliferation and immune regulation. The expression of TBX15 is influenced by NF-κB signaling, which enhances its anti-apoptotic activity, suggesting a regulatory interaction with this signaling pathway (Yan2023The).

These interactions highlight TBX15's role in modulating gene expression and cellular responses, contributing to its involvement in cancer progression and resistance mechanisms.
