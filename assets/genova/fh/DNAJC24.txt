# DNAJC24

## Overview
DNAJC24 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C24, which functions as a co-chaperone involved in protein folding and stabilization. This protein is part of the DnaJ/Hsp40 family, known for its role in assisting Hsp70 proteins in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and responding to stress conditions (Heldens2010Cochaperones). DNAJC24 is particularly significant in the biosynthesis of diphthamide, a unique post-translational modification of histidine residues in elongation factor-2, which is crucial for protein synthesis (Solana2022The). The gene's expression and function are implicated in various cellular processes, including stress response, autophagy, and ammonia metabolism, with notable relevance in pathological conditions such as hepatocellular carcinoma and certain neurodevelopmental disorders (Li2022DNAJC24; Wawrocka2018The).

## Function
DNAJC24, a member of the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40), functions as a co-chaperone that assists in protein folding and stabilization by interacting with Hsp70 proteins. It plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular function and integrity by participating in cellular stress responses and protein homeostasis (Heldens2010Cochaperones). DNAJC24 is involved in diphthamide biosynthesis, a post-translational modification of histidines found in the translation elongation factor-2, which is essential for protein synthesis. This modification process is critical for the proper functioning of elongation factors, which are vital for the translation process in cells (Solana2022The).

In healthy human cells, DNAJC24 is believed to contribute to the cellular response to environmental changes, helping cells survive by preventing apoptosis through various mechanisms (Li2022DNAJC24). Although specific details about its function in non-cancerous cells are limited, DNAJC24, like other heat shock proteins, likely plays a role in stress response and cellular protection (Li2022DNAJC24). Its activity is associated with the regulation of autophagic processes, which are crucial for cellular maintenance and survival under stress conditions (Li2022DNAJC24).

## Clinical Significance
DNAJC24 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DNAJC24 expression is elevated and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes the proliferation and motility of HCC cells, contributing to tumor growth and progression. The gene's expression is upregulated in response to stress stimuli such as increased temperature, starvation, and hypoxia, with the heat shock transcription factor 2 (HSF2) acting as a transcriptional regulator. This upregulation correlates with advanced tumor stages and shorter overall survival in patients, suggesting DNAJC24 as a potential therapeutic target in HCC (Li2022DNAJC24).

In the context of genetic disorders, DNAJC24 has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Microdeletions in the 11p13 region, which may include DNAJC24, have been linked to conditions such as autism spectrum disorders, speech/language disorders, epilepsy, and developmental delay. A specific case involved a 681 kb deletion downstream of the PAX6 gene, including DNAJC24, found in a patient with ocular coloboma (Wawrocka2018The). Additionally, a familial pericentric inversion of chromosome 11, involving a deletion of part of DNAJC24, was associated with intellectual disability and autistic behaviors (Wawrocka2018The).

## Interactions
DNAJC24, a member of the DnaJ heat shock protein family, is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, DNAJC24 interacts with CPS1, a key enzyme in the urea cycle. This interaction is significant because CPS1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the urea cycle, and its expression is decreased when DNAJC24 is knocked down, leading to intracellular ammonia accumulation. This accumulation affects autophagy and cell proliferation, highlighting the role of DNAJC24 in ammonia metabolism and its potential as a therapeutic target in HCC (Li2022DNAJC24).

DNAJC24 is also regulated by heat shock factors, particularly HSF2, which binds to a specific segment of the DNAJC24 promoter. This interaction upregulates DNAJC24 expression in response to stress stimuli such as increased temperature, starvation, and hypoxia, promoting HCC cell proliferation and motility (Li2022DNAJC24).

While the study does not provide specific details on the physical interactions of DNAJC24 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond these examples, it suggests that DNAJC24's interactions are crucial for its role in protein synthesis and stress response in cancer cells (Li2022DNAJC24).
