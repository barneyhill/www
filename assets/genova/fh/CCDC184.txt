# CCDC184

## Overview
CCDC184 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 184 protein, which is characterized by its structural motif known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. This protein is primarily involved in cell-cell adhesion processes, particularly within the nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of neural circuits. The CCDC184 protein is highly expressed in postmitotic interneurons, suggesting its involvement in neuronal migration and morphological differentiation. It is associated with genes related to homophilic cell adhesion, indicating its potential role in maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating interactions in specific brain regions, such as the preoptic area (Pensold2018SingleCell; Cacabelos2019Epigenetics). Additionally, CCDC184 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its potential clinical significance (AviñaPadilla2022Deciphering; Liao2022Identification; Li2020Evaluating).

## Function
CCDC184 is a gene that encodes a coiled-coil domain protein, which is implicated in cell-cell adhesion processes, particularly in postmitotic interneurons. The protein is highly expressed in these cells and is positively correlated with genes associated with cell adhesion, suggesting its involvement in neuronal migration and morphological differentiation (Cacabelos2019Epigenetics). Gene Ontology analysis indicates that CCDC184 is enriched in genes related to homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules, such as cadherins and their interaction partners, hinting at a role in maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating protein interactions in the preoptic area (POA)-derived interneurons (Pensold2018SingleCell).

The expression of CCDC184 in the nervous system suggests its potential involvement in the structural and functional development of neural circuits, which are essential for cognitive and sensory functions (Cacabelos2019Epigenetics). Although the specific molecular functions of CCDC184 remain to be fully elucidated, its association with cell adhesion processes indicates a significant role in the development and maintenance of neural networks.

## Clinical Significance
CCDC184 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its differential expression and potential involvement in cellular processes. In colon cancer, CCDC184 is identified as a transmembrane protein undergoing differential expression, suggesting a role in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, which share genomic features and transcription factor-guided genetic regulation (AviñaPadilla2022Deciphering). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CCDC184 is included in an immune risk score model, with a noted coefficient indicating its potential prognostic value in the context of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (Li2020Evaluating).

In the context of brain development, CCDC184 is highly expressed in postmitotic interneurons and is associated with cell adhesion processes, indicating a possible role in neuronal migration and morphological differentiation. This suggests that alterations in CCDC184 expression could impact neurological development, although specific diseases are not directly mentioned (Pensold2018SingleCell).

Additionally, CCDC184 has been associated with dementia in the context of Alzheimer's disease, although the specific mechanisms or implications of this association are not detailed (Liao2022Identification). Further research is needed to clarify the clinical significance of CCDC184 in these and other conditions.
