# NETO2

## Overview
The NETO2 gene encodes the neuropilin and tolloid-like 2 protein, a transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in the brain. This protein functions as an auxiliary subunit of kainate receptors (KARs), which are integral to excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. NETO2 modulates the activity of KARs by affecting their sensitivity to glutamate and altering their desensitization kinetics, thereby playing a crucial role in synaptic plasticity and signaling (Fisher2012The; Li2016Pharmacological). Structurally, NETO2 is characterized by extracellular CUB domains and a low-density lipoprotein class A (LDLa) domain, which facilitate its interactions with KAR subunits (He2021Kainate). Beyond its neurological functions, NETO2 is implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels correlate with tumor progression and prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (NETO2&lt; p&gt; &lt; Liu2019NETO2; em&gt; Li2019&lt).

## Structure
The NETO2 protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein characterized by a complex structure that includes several distinct domains. It features two extracellular CUB domains, a low-density lipoprotein class A (LDLa) domain, and a transmembrane region (He2021Kainate; Griffith2015Identification). The CUB domains are involved in interactions with kainate receptor (KAR) subunits, while the LDLa domain influences channel kinetics (Lomash2017Phosphorylation). The protein's structure is approximately 140 Å in height and includes a horizontal helix termed a1 before the transmembrane domain (TM1) (He2021Kainate).

The tertiary structure of NETO2 shows that the CUB1, CUB2, and LDLa domains are closely packed, with the CUB1 domain speculated to connect the ATD with the LBD of GluK2 (He2021Kainate). The quaternary structure of NETO2 in complex with GluK2 reveals an asymmetrical interaction, with the CUB1 and CUB2 domains engaging differently on each side of the complex (He2021Kainate).

Post-translational modifications of NETO2 include phosphorylation, particularly at serine 409, which is regulated by kinases such as CaMKII and PKA. This modification affects the synaptic targeting of KAR subunits (Lomash2017Phosphorylation). The intracellular C-terminus of NETO2 contains several serine and threonine residues that can be phosphorylated, influencing synaptic localization and function (Lomash2017Phosphorylation).

## Function
NETO2 is a brain-specific transmembrane protein that functions as an auxiliary subunit of kainate receptors (KARs), such as GluK1 and GluK2, which are involved in excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. NETO2 modulates the function of these receptors by influencing their sensitivity to glutamate, enhancing the glutamate-evoked responses, and altering desensitization kinetics (Li2016Pharmacological). The presence of NETO2 reduces inward rectification of the current-voltage relationship in kainate receptors, which is typically caused by intracellular polyamines (Fisher2012The).

The intracellular C-terminal domain of NETO2, containing positively charged residues, plays a crucial role in reducing inward rectification by potentially acting as a charge screen (Fisher2012The). NETO2 also affects the localization of kainate receptor subunits at synapses, which is important for synaptic plasticity and signaling (Wyeth2014Neto). The modulation of KARs by NETO2 is significant for synaptic function, contributing to processes like learning and memory by regulating synaptic transmission and plasticity (Li2016Pharmacological).

## Clinical Significance
The NETO2 gene is implicated in various cancers, including pancreatic, gastric, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. In pancreatic cancer, NETO2 is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis. It promotes cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration through the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway (NETO2&lt; p&gt; &lt; em&gt; Li2019&lt). In gastric cancer, NETO2 overexpression is associated with increased invasion and metastasis via the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB/Snail axis, and high NETO2 levels are linked to lower survival rates (Liu2019NETO2). 

In breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, NETO2 expression is deregulated, with both upregulation and downregulation observed. Its overexpression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, while knockdown reduces proliferation, invasion, and migration (Fedorova2020NETO2). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, NETO2 is upregulated by the lncRNA FAM225A, promoting cancer progression and metastasis (Zhang2020Exosomal). These findings suggest that NETO2 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could serve as a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
NETO2 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in neuronal function and synaptic transmission. It is a key interacting partner of the KCC2 cotransporter, essential for maintaining chloride homeostasis in neurons. This interaction is vital for proper KCC2-mediated chloride extrusion in hippocampal neurons, and the absence of NETO2 leads to compromised chloride regulation, potentially causing GABAergic transmission to become excitatory (Ivakine2013Neto2).

NETO2 also interacts with kainate-type glutamate receptors, specifically the GluK2 subunit. It modulates the desensitization kinetics and recovery from desensitization of these receptors. The interaction involves multiple sites, including the N-terminal domain (NTD) and CUB1 domain of NETO2, which are crucial for regulating GluK2 gating. NETO2 significantly slows the desensitization of GluK2, affecting receptor response to glutamate (Li2019Neto; He2021Kainate).

The M3-S2 linker and ligand-binding domain dimer interface of GluK2 are critical for NETO2's modulatory effects. Mutations in these regions can alter NETO2's ability to modulate receptor desensitization and cation sensitivity, highlighting the importance of these structural interactions (Griffith2015Identification).
