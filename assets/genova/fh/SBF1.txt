# SBF1

## Overview
The SBF1 gene encodes the protein SET binding factor 1, which is classified as a pseudophosphatase due to its structural similarity to phosphatases but lack of catalytic activity. This protein is a member of the myotubularin family and is involved in cellular growth regulation and differentiation. SET binding factor 1 is characterized by several domains, including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a GEF homology domain, and DENN domains, which contribute to its role in modulating growth and interacting with other proteins. Although primarily localized in the cytoplasm, SBF1 can influence phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) levels and interact with various proteins, such as MTMR2 and SET domain proteins, affecting their function and localization. Mutations in the SBF1 gene have been linked to neurological disorders, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B3, and reproductive issues, including male infertility, highlighting its clinical significance (Shi2023Identification; Firestein2001Pseudophosphatase; Manole2016SBF1).

## Structure
The SBF1 gene encodes a pseudo-phosphatase protein that is part of the myotubularin family, characterized by a phosphatase-like domain that lacks catalytic activity (Firestein2001Pseudophosphatase). The protein is composed of 1930 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 215 kDa (Firestein2001Pseudophosphatase). The N-terminal region of SBF1 includes a conserved domain similar to signaling proteins, featuring a heptad leucine repeat (HLR) and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, as well as a GEF homology domain (Firestein2001Pseudophosphatase). These domains are involved in modulating the protein's growth regulatory properties and are necessary for its growth-inhibitory effects (Firestein2001Pseudophosphatase).

SBF1 also contains DENN domains, which are involved in the regulation of Rab GTPases, crucial for membrane trafficking (Manole2016SBF1). The protein's structure includes coiled-coil domains that facilitate interaction with active homologues through heterodimerization (Manole2016SBF1). The N-terminal region is significant for its role in suppressing oncogenic potential, as deletions in this region can convert SBF1 from a growth inhibitor to a transforming protein (Firestein2001Pseudophosphatase).

## Function
SBF1 (SET binding factor 1) is a pseudophosphatase that plays a role in cellular growth and differentiation. Although it is structurally similar to myotubularin-related phosphatases, SBF1 lacks catalytic activity due to germline-encoded alterations in its myotubularin homology domain (Firestein2001Pseudophosphatase). SBF1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it may regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) levels by acting as a substrate trapping mutant, potentially opposing the activity of functional myotubularin phosphatases (Firestein2001Pseudophosphatase).

In NIH 3T3 cells, SBF1 exhibits growth inhibitory properties, reducing the number of cells entering the S phase of the cell cycle and altering cell morphology (Firestein2001Pseudophosphatase). The protein's growth regulatory effects are dependent on the integrity of its pleckstrin homology (PH), GEF homology, and myotubularin homology domains (Firestein2001Pseudophosphatase). The N-terminal GEF homology domain is particularly important, as its deletion converts SBF1 from a growth inhibitor to a transforming protein, suggesting it may sequester SBF1 to the cytoplasm and inhibit its transforming effects (Firestein2001Pseudophosphatase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SBF1 gene have been linked to several neurological and reproductive disorders. Notably, SBF1 mutations are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B3 (CMT4B3), a rare genetic neuropathy characterized by severe demyelinating neuropathy with focal myelin outfoldings and secondary axonal loss. Patients with CMT4B3 often exhibit symptoms such as progressive limb weakness, sensory-motor axonal neuropathy, and developmental abnormalities (Berti2021Biallelic; Gang2020A). 

In addition to neuropathies, SBF1 mutations have been implicated in male infertility. Studies in mice have shown that disruption of the Sbf1 gene leads to impaired spermatogenesis and azoospermia, suggesting a critical role for SBF1 in male reproductive health (Firestein2002Male).

SBF1 has also been identified as a novel pathogenic gene associated with childhood epileptic encephalopathies, including Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Mutations in SBF1 have been linked to increased seizure susceptibility and epileptic electrophysiological activity, as demonstrated in zebrafish and Drosophila models (Shi2023Identification).

Furthermore, alterations in the SBF1 gene, such as a (GCC)-repeat in the 5′ untranslated region, have been associated with late-onset neurocognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (Khamse2022A).

## Interactions
SBF1 (SET binding factor 1) is known to participate in several protein interactions that influence its function and cellular localization. SBF1 interacts with MTMR2, a lipid phosphatase, through heterodimerization, which is crucial for regulating MTMR2's activity and distribution. Mutations in SBF1 can disrupt this interaction, potentially affecting MTMR2's cellular localization and function (Manole2016SBF1).

SBF1 also interacts with SET domain proteins, which are nuclear factors. This interaction was initially identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen, suggesting potential interactions with nuclear proteins. The subcellular localization of SBF1, which is primarily cytoplasmic, can be altered by N-terminal deletions, leading to partial nuclear localization. This suggests that SBF1's interactions with SET domain proteins may be modulated by its localization (Firestein2001Pseudophosphatase).

In the context of spermatogenesis, SBF1 is implicated in phosphatidylinositol-mediated signaling, potentially interacting with proteins like MLL and Suv39h1. These interactions may modulate the properties of these proteins, as evidenced by a protein complex containing Drosophila trithorax (homologue of MLL) and dSbf1 (Firestein2002Male).
