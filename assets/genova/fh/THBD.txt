# THBD

## Overview
The THBD gene encodes thrombomodulin, a transmembrane glycoprotein predominantly expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. Thrombomodulin plays a pivotal role in the regulation of coagulation and inflammation, acting as a cofactor for thrombin-mediated activation of protein C, which is crucial for anticoagulation. The protein's structure includes a signal peptide, an extracellular domain with a lectin-like domain, six epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail, with the EGF-like domains being essential for its anticoagulant function (Koeppe2008Mutations; Prieto2005Dynamics). Beyond its role in coagulation, thrombomodulin modulates inflammatory responses and cellular proliferation, contributing to vascular homeostasis and integrity (Conway2011Thrombomodulin; Weiler2003Thrombomodulin). Mutations in the THBD gene have been linked to various thrombotic and bleeding disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Delvaeye2009Thrombomodulin; Anastasiou2012Thrombomodulin).

## Structure
Thrombomodulin (THBD) is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. Its primary structure includes a signal peptide, an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domain is composed of an N-terminal lectin-like domain, six epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, and a serine/threonine-rich region. The EGF-like domains are crucial for its function, with the fourth, fifth, and sixth domains being necessary for thrombin binding and protein C activation (Koeppe2008Mutations).

The fourth EGF-like domain is particularly important for protein C activation, while the fifth and sixth domains are involved in thrombin binding. Mutations in these domains can significantly affect the protein's function, as shown by alanine scanning mutagenesis studies (Koeppe2008Mutations). The dynamics of the fourth and fifth domains, especially the linker region containing Met 388, are essential for maintaining the structure and function of the TMEGF45 fragment, which is the smallest fragment with full anticoagulant cofactor activity (Prieto2005Dynamics).

Post-translational modifications of thrombomodulin include glycosylation, which is important for its stability and function. Glycosylation at Asn 364 in the fourth domain stabilizes the structure through intramolecular interactions (Prieto2005Dynamics).

## Function
Thrombomodulin (THBD) is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. It functions as a cofactor for thrombin-mediated activation of protein C (PC), significantly enhancing this process by more than 1,000-fold compared to thrombin alone. Activated protein C (APC) then exerts anticoagulant effects by inactivating coagulation factors Va and VIIIa, thus reducing thrombin generation and promoting anticoagulation (Conway2011Thrombomodulin; Weiler2003Thrombomodulin).

THBD also plays a role in inflammation and immune response regulation. Its lectin-like domain is involved in modulating inflammation by interacting with proteins such as high mobility group box B1 protein (HMGB1) and the Lewis Y antigen, reducing pro-inflammatory signaling and neutrophil adhesion (Conway2011Thrombomodulin). Additionally, THBD influences cell proliferation and adhesion, with its epidermal growth factor-like domains having mitogenic effects on fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells (Conway2011Thrombomodulin).

In healthy human cells, THBD contributes to vascular health by modulating coagulation, inflammation, and cellular proliferation, thereby protecting against tissue damage and maintaining vascular integrity (Conway2011Thrombomodulin; Weiler2003Thrombomodulin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the THBD gene, which encodes thrombomodulin, have been implicated in several thrombotic and bleeding disorders. Polymorphisms in the THBD gene, such as the À33G/A mutation, have been associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis, although its effect on thrombomodulin expression is mild (Anastasiou2012Thrombomodulin). The 127G/A mutation is linked to a higher risk of myocardial infarction, particularly when combined with other cardiovascular risk factors (Anastasiou2012Thrombomodulin). The Ala455Val polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of early-onset ischemic stroke in young women, especially among black women (Cole2004Thrombomodulin).

Thrombomodulin mutations also play a role in atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS), where they impair complement regulation, leading to endothelial injury and microvascular thrombosis (Delvaeye2009Thrombomodulin). In familial collapsing glomerulopathy, a specific THBD variant, p.A43T, has been identified, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Riguetti2024Thrombomodulin). Additionally, a novel G250R variant in the THBD gene has been linked to venous thromboembolism, affecting the protein's anticoagulant properties (D’Apolito2022Identification). These findings underscore the clinical significance of THBD mutations in various thrombotic and bleeding disorders.

## Interactions
Thrombomodulin (THBD) is involved in several critical interactions with proteins that influence its role in coagulation and inflammation. It forms a complex with thrombin, which significantly enhances the activation of protein C (PC), leading to anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory effects (Conway2011Thrombomodulin). This interaction also prevents thrombin from activating protease-activated receptors (PARs), thereby reducing pro-inflammatory signaling (Conway2011Thrombomodulin).

THBD interacts with high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein through its N-terminal lectin-like domain, sequestering HMGB1 and preventing it from binding to the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). This interaction inhibits pro-inflammatory pathways and leukocyte activation (Abeyama2005The).

In the context of the complement system, THBD binds to complement factor H (CFH) and C3b, facilitating the inactivation of C3b by complement factor I (CFI). Mutations in THBD can impair this function, contributing to conditions like atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS) (Delvaeye2009Thrombomodulin).

THBD also interacts with the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), enhancing the activation of PC and modulating inflammatory responses (Conway2011Thrombomodulin). These interactions highlight THBD's multifaceted role in regulating coagulation and inflammation.
