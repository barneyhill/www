# LYG2

## Overview
The LYG2 gene encodes the lysozyme g2 protein, which is categorized as an antimicrobial peptide. This protein plays a significant role in the immune system by contributing to the body's defense mechanisms against bacterial infections. Lysozyme g2 is involved in the degradation of bacterial cell walls, thereby exhibiting bacteriolytic activity. The gene's expression is notably responsive to immune challenges, as evidenced by its upregulation in certain pathological conditions in chickens, such as femoral head separation, and its altered expression during Salmonella Enteritidis infection (Hul2021Differentially; Sekelova2017Differential). While the specific functions and implications of LYG2 in humans remain to be fully elucidated, its role in avian immune responses suggests a potential importance in broader immune-related processes.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The LYG2 gene has been implicated in various immune response processes and conditions. In chickens, LYG2 is upregulated in the femur cartilage of those affected by femoral head separation (FHS), suggesting its involvement in immune responses potentially triggered by bacterial infections (Hul2021Differentially). This upregulation indicates a broader activation of the immune system in response to FHS, although specific diseases directly linked to LYG2 mutations or expression changes in humans are not detailed in the available studies.

In the context of Salmonella Enteritidis infection, LYG2, identified as an antimicrobial peptide, shows decreased abundance in chicken heterophils post-infection, which may affect the immune response (Sekelova2017Differential). This suggests that alterations in LYG2 expression could influence susceptibility to infections.

While the gene's role in human diseases is not explicitly detailed in the provided studies, its involvement in immune processes in chickens highlights its potential significance in immune-related conditions. The gene's expression and interaction with other immune components may be crucial in understanding its clinical implications, although further research is needed to establish direct links to specific human diseases.
