# EIF2AK4

## Overview
EIF2AK4, also known as GCN2, is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4, a serine/threonine-protein kinase. This kinase is integral to the cellular response to stress, particularly in the context of amino acid deprivation. EIF2AK4 is a key player in the integrated stress response (ISR), where it senses uncharged transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and subsequently phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). This phosphorylation event leads to a reduction in general protein synthesis, allowing cells to conserve resources and adapt to stress conditions by selectively translating stress-related proteins. The protein's activity is modulated through interactions with other proteins, such as GCN1 and IMPACT, and it is involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy and transcriptional regulation. Clinically, mutations in EIF2AK4 are associated with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH), highlighting its significance in both cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis (Machado2015Pulmonary; Best2014EIF2AK4; Wek2018Role).

## Structure
EIF2AK4, also known as GCN2, is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein synthesis. The protein contains a kinase domain, which is responsible for its catalytic activity, and a histidyl-tRNA synthetase-like domain, which may contribute to its function in amino acid sensing and response. EIF2AK4 can form homodimers, a feature of its quaternary structure, which is important for its functional activity.

Post-translational modifications of EIF2AK4 include phosphorylation, which is a key regulatory mechanism of its kinase activity. This modification can influence the protein's function and its interaction with other cellular components. The existence of splice variants of EIF2AK4 suggests the presence of different isoforms, which may have distinct functions or regulatory properties, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

The structural domains and modifications of EIF2AK4 highlight its complex regulation and functional versatility in cellular processes, particularly in response to amino acid availability and stress conditions.

## Function
The EIF2AK4 gene encodes the protein kinase GCN2, which is a critical component of the integrated stress response (ISR) in human cells. GCN2 is activated by the accumulation of uncharged tRNAs, a condition that typically arises during amino acid deprivation. Upon activation, GCN2 phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) on serine 51. This phosphorylation event leads to a global reduction in protein synthesis, allowing cells to conserve resources under stress conditions while selectively enhancing the translation of specific stress-related proteins, such as activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (Yu2022The; Wek2018Role).

GCN2's activity is modulated by its interaction with other proteins, such as GCN1, which facilitates access to uncharged tRNAs, and IMPACT, which can inhibit GCN2 by competing for its association with GCN1 (Wek2018Role). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and adaptation to nutrient stress (Yu2022The; Wek2018Role). GCN2 is also involved in autophagy induction, particularly in response to nutrient deprivation, highlighting its role in cellular adaptation to environmental changes (Humeau2020Phosphorylation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EIF2AK4 gene are linked to pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH), both of which are rare forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). These conditions are characterized by the proliferation of capillaries in the lungs, leading to the occlusion of pulmonary vasculature and are inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner (Machado2015Pulmonary; Best2014EIF2AK4). Biallelic pathogenic variants in EIF2AK4 are found in nearly all familial cases of PVOD and in a significant portion of sporadic cases (Lechartier2022Screening). 

In patients with PCH, EIF2AK4 mutations have been identified in both familial and sporadic cases, suggesting a strong genetic component in the etiology of the disease (Abou2019Novel; Best2014EIF2AK4). The presence of biallelic EIF2AK4 mutations is considered diagnostic for PVOD/PCH, and these mutations are associated with a severe phenotype and poor prognosis (Zhang2022A; Zeng2020Clinical). The gene's role in regulating angiogenesis and stress response pathways is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of these conditions (Machado2015Pulmonary).

## Interactions
EIF2AK4, also known as GCN2, is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a crucial role in the integrated stress response by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. GCN2 is activated by binding to uncharged tRNAs that accumulate during amino acid starvation. This interaction occurs through a regulatory region homologous to histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HARS), leading to conformational changes that trigger autophosphorylation and increased phosphorylation of eIF2α (Wek2018Role).

GCN2 requires the GCN1 protein for its function, as GCN1 binds to the amino-terminal RWD domain of GCN2, facilitating access to uncharged tRNAs (Wek2018Role). The regulatory protein IMPACT (YIH1) can inhibit GCN2 by competing with GCN1 for binding, thus modulating GCN2's activity (Wek2018Role).

GCN2 also interacts with components of the BMPR2 pathway, including SMAD1, SMAD4, ACVRL1, and ENG, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation within this pathway (Eichstaedt2016EIF2AK4). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving GCN2, uncharged tRNAs, GCN1, IMPACT, and the cytoskeleton in response to cellular stress (Wek2018Role).
