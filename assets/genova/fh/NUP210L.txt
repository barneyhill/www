# NUP210L

## Overview
NUP210L is a gene that encodes a protein similar to nucleoporin 210 (NUP210), which is a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The protein encoded by NUP210L is involved in the structural organization of the nuclear envelope, particularly during spermatid development in humans. It plays a critical role in nuclear remodeling and chromatin packaging by localizing to the caudal nuclear pole of elongating spermatids and spermatozoa. NUP210L interacts with other proteins, such as SUN1 and nesprin-3, to form chromatin-cytoskeleton links, which are essential for maintaining nuclear integrity and proper microtubule organization. The absence of NUP210L is associated with male infertility, characterized by severe oligozoospermia and immotile spermatozoa, highlighting its importance in spermiogenesis and male reproductive health (Al2024Nucleoporin).

## Function
NUP210L is a gene encoding a protein similar to nucleoporin 210 (NUP210), which is part of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). In healthy human cells, NUP210L plays a crucial role in spermatid development, particularly in nuclear remodeling during spermiogenesis. It is involved in concentrating nuclear pores at the flagellar pole and organizing the manchette cytoskeleton, which is essential for preventing nuclear invagination by microtubules (Al2024Nucleoporin). NUP210L localizes to the caudal nuclear pole of elongating spermatids and spermatozoa, indicating its specific role in maintaining nuclear integrity and proper chromatin packaging during spermatid maturation (Al2024Nucleoporin).

The protein is suggested to interact with other proteins, such as SUN1 and nesprin-3, to form chromatin-cytoskeleton links, potentially regulating gene expression (Al2024Nucleoporin). Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, NUP210L's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining the structural integrity of the spermatid nucleus and ensuring proper microtubule organization. In humans, the absence of NUP210L is associated with severe oligozoospermia and immotile spermatozoa, underscoring its critical role in spermiogenesis and male fertility (Al2024Nucleoporin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NUP210L gene have been linked to male infertility, particularly in cases characterized by severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. This condition involves a low sperm count, poor motility, and abnormal sperm morphology, often with large heads due to uncondensed nuclear DNA. A specific homozygous truncating variant in NUP210L has been identified in an infertile man, leading to the absence of the NUP210L protein in sperm and resulting in uncondensed chromatin and numerous flagellar defects (Arafah2020Defect). This variant affects a splice acceptor site, likely preventing functional protein production, and is absent from large population databases, indicating its rarity (Arafah2020Defect).

Studies in mice have shown that the absence of NUP210L leads to compromised nuclear integrity and reduced sperm quality, with similarities to the human condition, suggesting a critical role for NUP210L in spermatogenesis (Al2024Nucleoporin). The gene's role in organizing the manchette cytoskeleton and preventing nuclear invagination by microtubules is crucial for maintaining nuclear shape and proper chromatin remodeling during spermatid development (Al2024Nucleoporin).

## Interactions
NUP210L, a paralogue of the nucleoporin NUP210, is involved in several interactions crucial for spermatid nuclear remodeling. It localizes to the caudal nuclear pole of elongating spermatids and spermatozoa, where it plays a role in organizing the manchette cytoskeleton and preventing nuclear invagination by microtubules (Al2024Nucleoporin). NUP210L is proposed to interact with the LINC complex proteins, such as SUN1 and nesprin-3, suggesting a mechanosensitive chromatin-cytoskeletal link, although SUN2, a known partner of NUP210, is not present in spermatids (Al2024Nucleoporin).

NUP210L also interacts with BAF-L, a paralogue of the chromatin protein BAF. BAF-L can form heterodimers with BAF, potentially regulating BAF function. This interaction is significant for maintaining nuclear integrity and microtubule organization in spermatids (Al2024Nucleoporin). The absence of NUP210L leads to disorganized nuclear pore complex (NPC) localization and inefficient manchette microtubule organization, indicating its role in the proper localization of NPC components like NUP153 (Al2024Nucleoporin).

These interactions highlight the critical role of NUP210L in linking chromatin, the nuclear pore complex, and the cytoskeleton, ensuring the structural integrity and proper development of spermatids.
