# SLC38A5

## Overview
SLC38A5 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 38 member 5, a sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter. This transmembrane protein is primarily involved in the transport of amino acids such as glutamine, asparagine, and histidine across cell membranes, playing a vital role in maintaining amino acid homeostasis in various tissues (Bhutia2016Glutamine). SLC38A5 is predominantly expressed in renal tubular epithelial cells and periportal hepatocytes, where it contributes to acid-base balance and urea synthesis, respectively (Bhutia2016Glutamine). Additionally, it is involved in the glutamate-glutamine cycle in the retina and supports cellular nutrient uptake through macropinocytosis (Bhutia2022Unconventional; Umapathy2008Expression). The protein's interactions with other transporters and signaling pathways, such as mTORC1, highlight its significance in cancer cell metabolism and survival, making it a potential therapeutic target in oncology (Sniegowski2023Amino).

## Function
SLC38A5, also known as SNAT5, is a sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter involved in the transport of amino acids such as glutamine, asparagine, and histidine across cell membranes. It plays a crucial role in maintaining amino acid homeostasis in various tissues. In healthy human cells, SLC38A5 is predominantly expressed in renal tubular epithelial cells, where it is essential for maintaining acid-base balance. During metabolic acidosis, its expression is upregulated to facilitate the active transport of Na+/glutamine into cells from the blood, aiding in the excretion of excess hydrogen ions and maintaining acid-base homeostasis (Bhutia2016Glutamine).

SLC38A5 is also expressed in periportal hepatocytes, where it mediates the influx of Na+/glutamine from the portal blood, crucial for transferring NH3 in the form of glutamine for conversion into urea in the liver (Bhutia2016Glutamine). In the retina, SLC38A5 is involved in the glutamate-glutamine cycle, particularly in retinal ganglion cells and Müller cells, contributing to neurotransmitter recycling (Umapathy2008Expression). The transporter is also implicated in macropinocytosis, a process that supports cellular nutrient uptake and signaling (Bhutia2022Unconventional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC38A5 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In pancreatic cancer, SLC38A5 is significantly upregulated, and its increased expression is associated with decreased overall survival and disease-specific survival in patients. This gene is linked to resistance to chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatin and gemcitabine, suggesting its role in drug resistance mechanisms (Sniegowski2023Amino; Kim2023SLC38A5). Knockout studies have shown that the loss of SLC38A5 can significantly reduce tumor growth, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Sniegowski2023Amino).

In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SLC38A5 is overexpressed and promotes macropinocytosis, a process that supports cancer cell metabolism and growth by facilitating nutrient uptake (Ramachandran2021Expression). This transporter is involved in the transport of amino acids crucial for metabolic pathways that are accelerated in cancer, such as glutaminolysis and one-carbon metabolism (Ramachandran2021Expression).

SLC38A5 also plays a role in retinal angiogenesis, where its expression is regulated by the Wnt signaling pathway. Deficiency in SLC38A5 leads to impaired retinal vessel development and reduced pathological neovascularization, suggesting its involvement in conditions like retinopathy (Wang2021Amino).

## Interactions
SLC38A5, a sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter, is involved in several interactions that influence cancer cell metabolism and survival. It is functionally coupled with the cystine/glutamate exchanger SLC7A11 and the H+-coupled lactate transporter MCT1 (SLC16A1) in cancer cells. These interactions enhance amino acid influx, supporting cancer cell survival and proliferation, particularly in tumors with KRAS mutations (Sniegowski2021SLC6A14). SLC38A5 also interacts with the mTORC1 signaling pathway, where its knockout leads to the downregulation of amino acids that activate mTORC1, resulting in inhibited mRNA translation and mTORC1 signaling (Sniegowski2023Amino).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SLC38A5 is involved in selenium nutrition by delivering Se-Met into cells, which is crucial for the antioxidant function in tumor cells. This process influences Nrf2 signaling, which upregulates SLC7A11, suggesting a functional coupling between SLC38A5 and SLC7A11 with Se-Met as an intermediate (Mathew2024Induction). Niclosamide, an FDA-approved drug, inhibits both SLC38A5 and SLC7A11, reducing their expression and impairing the antioxidant machinery of TNBC cells (Mathew2024Induction).
