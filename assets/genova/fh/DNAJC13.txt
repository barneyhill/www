# DNAJC13

## Overview
DNAJC13 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C13, also known as RME-8. This protein is a member of the DNAJ/HSP40 family, which is characterized by the presence of a J domain that facilitates interaction with the chaperone protein Hsc70. DNAJC13 is primarily involved in endosomal membrane processes, playing a critical role in retromer-mediated cargo transport and endosomal trafficking. It interacts with components of the WASH complex and sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) to regulate the formation of tubular structures on endosomes, which are essential for protein sorting and recycling. The protein is widely expressed, with significant abundance in nervous tissue, and is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. Mutations in DNAJC13, particularly the c.2564A>G (p.N855S) mutation, have been associated with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease, highlighting its clinical significance in neurological health (Dilliott2022DnaJC7; Puschmann2017New; Hasegawa2018DnaJHsp40).

## Structure
DNAJC13, also known as RME-8, is a large protein with a molecular mass of 254 kDa, consisting of 2243 amino acids. It is a member of the DNAJ/HSP40 protein family and contains a central J domain, which is crucial for its interaction with Hsc70 in the presence of ADP (Besemer2020Receptormediated; Hasegawa2018DnaJHsp40). The J domain typically consists of approximately 70 amino acids forming four α-helices, with a conserved His-Pro-Asp (HPD) motif essential for ATP hydrolysis (Solana2022The).

DNAJC13 is associated with the endosomal membrane and interacts with the FAM21 tail in the WASH complex, as well as sorting nexin 1 (SNX1). This interaction is important for controlling the formation of tubular structures on the endosome surface, which are involved in retromer-mediated cargo transport (Hasegawa2018DnaJHsp40). DNAJC13 also interacts with phosphoinositides through its N-terminal sequence, playing a role in endosomal functions such as protein sorting and endosomal tubulation (Besemer2020Receptormediated).

The protein may have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, and post-translational modifications like phosphorylation can regulate its function. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
DNAJC13, also known as RME-8, is a large protein with a molecular mass of 254 kDa that is widely expressed and particularly abundant in nervous tissue. It plays a crucial role in endosomal membrane processes, where it interacts with the FAM21 tail in the WASH complex and sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) to control the formation of tubular structures on the endosome surface. This interaction is essential for retromer-mediated cargo transport, such as the cation-independent mannose phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) (Hasegawa2018DnaJHsp40).

DNAJC13 is involved in the cell surface recycling and lysosomal degradation of transferrin and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It has been shown to bind to Hsc70 in the presence of ADP, indicating a role in protein folding or transport. These functions suggest that DNAJC13 is integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis through its involvement in endosomal trafficking and protein recycling processes (Hasegawa2018DnaJHsp40).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, DNAJC13 is associated with late-onset Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, highlighting its importance in neurological health (Dilliott2022DnaJC7).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAJC13 gene have been implicated in autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly the c.2564A>G (p.N855S) mutation. This mutation has been identified in a large family with autosomal dominant PD and in additional familial and sporadic cases, especially among individuals of Dutch-German-Russian Mennonite origin, suggesting a common founder. The clinical phenotype associated with this mutation includes symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor, with some patients not requiring levodopa treatment despite long disease durations. The age of onset ranges from 40 to 85 years. Neuropathological examinations of affected individuals reveal alpha-synuclein-positive Lewy body pathology and tau pathology in some cases (Puschmann2017New; Hasegawa2018DnaJHsp40).

DNAJC13-linked PD, designated as PARK21, is characterized by slowly progressive, late-onset, doparesponsive parkinsonism with autosomal dominant inheritance. The N855S mutation has also been observed in patients with essential tremor, indicating clinical heterogeneity (Hasegawa2018DnaJHsp40). DNAJC13 is involved in endosomal transport, and mutations may impair this process through a toxic gain-of-function mechanism (Puschmann2017New). Variants in DNAJC13 have been identified as PD susceptibility factors, although coding variants were not detected in a large cohort of Caucasian PD cases (Puschmann2017New).

## Interactions
DNAJC13, also known as RME-8, is a large protein involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and is widely expressed, particularly in nervous tissue. It has a high molecular mass of 254 kDa and contains a J domain that binds to Hsc70 in the presence of ADP, indicating a physical interaction with this chaperone protein (Hasegawa2018DnaJHsp40). DNAJC13 interacts with the FAM21 tail in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and Scar homolog (WASH) complex and sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) on the endosomal membrane. This interaction is crucial for controlling the formation of tubular structures on the endosome surface, which are involved in retromer-mediated cargo transport (Hasegawa2018DnaJHsp40).

DNAJC13 also plays a role in modulating autophagy through its interactions with proteins such as ATG9A and VPS35. It partially co-localizes with ATG9A, suggesting that they reside within the same cellular compartment, and may interfere with ATG9A transport through the retromer and possibly the WASH complex (Besemer2020Receptormediated). DNAJC13 affects the trafficking of ATG9A to and from the recycling endosome, which is crucial for autophagosome biogenesis (Besemer2020Receptormediated).
