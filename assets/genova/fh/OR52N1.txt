# OR52N1

## Overview
OR52N1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily N member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in olfactory transduction, playing a crucial role in the sensory perception of smell by detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways. The olfactory receptor encoded by OR52N1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and contributes to the diversity of odor detection in humans (Zhao2015Latent). Beyond its primary function in olfaction, OR52N1 has been implicated in various physiological processes, including behavior regulation and immune system activity, and may also play a role in pain perception through pathways such as MAPK signaling (Lee2019Genomewide; Xu2021Enterochromaffin). The gene's expression and potential mutations have clinical significance, particularly in cancer treatment and pain modulation, although further research is needed to elucidate its full range of functions and implications (Jin2022Ensemble; Xu2021Enterochromaffin).

## Structure


## Function
OR52N1 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. In healthy human cells, OR52N1 is active in the olfactory epithelium, contributing to the diversity of odor detection (Zhao2015Latent).

The protein encoded by OR52N1 is involved in olfactory transduction, a process that is crucial for the sensory perception of smell. This function is supported by its significant enrichment in pathways related to sensory perception, particularly the sensory perception of smell, plasma membrane, and olfactory receptor activity (Zhao2015Latent). The olfactory receptors, including OR52N1, are part of a larger family of receptors that are involved in various physiological processes beyond olfaction, such as behavior regulation, immune system activity, and inflammation (Lee2019Genomewide; Xu2021Enterochromaffin).

While the primary role of OR52N1 is in olfactory transduction, studies suggest potential involvement in other pathways, such as pain perception, through mechanisms like the MAPK signaling pathway, although this is not fully understood in healthy human cells (Lee2019Genomewide; Xu2021Enterochromaffin).

## Clinical Significance
The gene OR52N1 has been implicated in various clinical contexts due to its altered expression and potential mutations. In the realm of cancer treatment, increased expression of OR52N1 has been associated with enhanced sensitivity to PD1/PD-L1 suppressors in metastatic urothelial cancer and metastatic melanoma. This suggests that patients with higher OR52N1 expression may respond better to these immunotherapeutic treatments, highlighting its potential clinical significance in improving treatment outcomes (Jin2022Ensemble).

OR52N1 is also involved in pain perception, as indicated by a genome-wide association study linking its activity to pain experienced after adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer patients. This suggests a possible role for OR52N1 in modulating pain, although the specific mechanisms remain unclear (Xu2021Enterochromaffin).

In the context of genetic studies, deletions in the OR52N1 gene have been identified, but there is insufficient evidence to directly link these structural variations to specific phenotypes or conditions (S2019Wholegenome). Overall, while OR52N1 is associated with various physiological and pathological processes, further research is needed to fully understand its clinical implications.
