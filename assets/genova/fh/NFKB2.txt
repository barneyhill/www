# NFKB2

## Overview
The NFKB2 gene encodes the nuclear factor kappa B subunit 2, a critical component of the NF-kB family of transcription factors involved in regulating immune responses and inflammation. The protein encoded by NFKB2 is initially synthesized as a 100-kDa precursor, p100, which undergoes proteolytic processing to form the active p52 subunit. This processing is essential for the noncanonical NF-kB signaling pathway, which plays a pivotal role in immune system development and function, particularly in the maturation and differentiation of B-lymphocytes (BEINKE2004Functions; Sun2012The). The NFKB2 protein functions as a transcription factor, influencing the expression of genes that control immune responses, including those encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Mutations in the NFKB2 gene have been linked to immunodeficiency disorders such as Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) and DAVID syndrome, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Brue2014Mutations; Klemann2019Clinical).

## Structure
The NFKB2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the NF-kB family, which plays a crucial role in immune response regulation. The protein is initially synthesized as a 100-kDa precursor known as p100, which contains several key structural domains. The N-terminal region includes a Rel homology domain (RHD) responsible for DNA binding and dimerization (Chang1995Rearranged). The C-terminal region contains ankyrin repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and function similarly to IκB proteins by inhibiting NF-kB activity through cytoplasmic retention (Ishikawa1997Gastric; Beg1993The).

The p100 precursor undergoes proteolytic processing to generate the active p52 subunit, which retains the RHD but loses the ankyrin domain (Chang1995Rearranged). This processing is mediated by the proteasome and involves sequences downstream of the glycine-rich region (GRR), which are crucial for efficient processing (Heusch1999The). The p52 protein can form heterodimers with other NF-kB subunits, such as RelA (p65), enhancing its DNA-binding affinity and transcriptional activity (Duckett1993Dimerization).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, regulate the activity of NFKB2, influencing its processing and function within the NF-kB signaling pathway (Duckett1993Dimerization).

## Function
The NFKB2 gene encodes a precursor protein, NF-κB2 p100, which is processed into the active transcription factor NF-κB2 p52. This processing is crucial for the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway, which plays a significant role in immune responses and the development of secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes and Peyer's patches (BEINKE2004Functions; Sun2012The). In healthy human cells, NF-κB2 is involved in the regulation of peripheral lymphoid organogenesis and B-lymphocyte differentiation, contributing to the immune response by activating and differentiating B-lymphocytes (BEINKE2004Functions).

The NF-κB2 protein functions as a transcription factor, influencing the expression of genes that regulate immune responses, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. These are essential for recruiting immune cells to infection sites (BEINKE2004Functions). The processing of p100 to p52 involves the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and IKKα, which are critical for the activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway (Sun2012The). This pathway is activated by specific receptors, such as the lymphotoxin-beta receptor and BAFF receptor, which are important for B cell maturation and survival (Sun2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NFKB2 gene are associated with several immunodeficiency disorders, most notably Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) and DAVID syndrome. CVID is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, poor antibody response, and increased susceptibility to infections. Patients with NFKB2 mutations often exhibit T cell dysfunction and autoimmune phenomena, such as alopecia and lymphocytic organ infiltration, without the common CVID features like auto-antibodies or lymphoproliferation (Klemann2019Clinical; Tuijnenburg2019Pathogenic). 

DAVID syndrome, linked to NFKB2 mutations, presents with variable endocrine and immune deficiencies, including ACTH deficiency and combined variable immunodeficiency. These mutations suggest a critical role in pituitary development, particularly in the differentiation of ACTH-producing corticotrope cells (Brue2014Mutations). 

Mutations in NFKB2 can also lead to a combined immunodeficiency phenotype, characterized by increased nuclear translocation of the NF-κB2 protein and enhanced non-canonical NF-κB signaling, which disrupts normal immune responses (Kuehn2017Novel). Additionally, these mutations can result in autoimmune conditions and impaired B cell maturation, contributing to immune dysregulation (Slade2019Fatal; Tucker2007A).

## Interactions
NFKB2, also known as nuclear factor kappa B subunit 2, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the NF-kB signaling pathway. NFKB2 forms heterodimers with RelA (p65), which significantly enhances its DNA-binding affinity and transcriptional activation, particularly for the HIV enhancer. This interaction results in a higher affinity for the KB site compared to the NFKB2 homodimer, leading to increased transcriptional activation (Duckett1993Dimerization).

The protein also interacts with IκB-α (MAD-3), which inhibits the DNA-binding activity of the NFKB2/RelA heterodimer. MAD-3 specifically inhibits the binding of heterodimers containing RelA but stimulates the binding of homodimeric NFKB2 and NFKB1, suggesting a regulatory role in modulating DNA-binding properties (Duckett1993Dimerization).

In the context of lymphoid neoplasms, rearranged NFKB2 proteins, such as lyt-10Cα and p85, can heterodimerize with RelA, leading to transactivation of B-driven transcription. These aberrant proteins exhibit impaired transrepressing activity compared to normal p52 homodimers, indicating altered regulatory functions in disease states (Chang1995Rearranged).
