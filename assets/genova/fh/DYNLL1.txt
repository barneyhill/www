# DYNLL1

## Overview
DYNLL1, or dynein light chain LC8-type 1, is a gene that encodes a small, highly conserved eukaryotic protein involved in a variety of cellular processes. The protein, categorized as a light chain component of the dynein motor complex, plays a critical role in intracellular transport by facilitating the movement of cargo along microtubules. Beyond its function in the dynein complex, DYNLL1 is a multifunctional hub protein that interacts with numerous partners, influencing processes such as DNA repair, cell signaling, and immune cell development. It is particularly significant in the context of DNA double-strand break repair, where it modulates the balance between nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination pathways. DYNLL1's interactions and regulatory roles are crucial for maintaining genomic stability, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease (He2018DYNLL1; Berkel2022DYNLL1).

## Structure
DYNLL1, also known as dynein light chain LC8-type 1, is a small, highly conserved eukaryotic protein consisting of 89 amino acids. It forms a homodimer under physiological conditions, which is essential for its function in binding various protein partners (Rapali2011LC8). The primary structure of DYNLL1 includes motifs that are recognized by its binding partners, often involving a central glutamine residue flanked by threonines or hydrophobic residues (GarcíaMayoral2010Structural).

The secondary structure of DYNLL1 is characterized by five β-strands that form two core β-sheets, flanked by two α-helices on one side. The β3-strand of one subunit pairs with the β2"-strand of the other subunit in an antiparallel mode, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and side chain hydrogen bonds (Bodor2014DYNLL2).

In terms of tertiary structure, DYNLL1 has a compact, folded dimeric form with parallel binding grooves at the dimerization interface. These grooves recognize short linear motifs in partner proteins, which adopt a β-strand conformation upon binding (Rapali2011LC8).

The quaternary structure of DYNLL1 involves the formation of stable dimer-to-dimer complexes, which is a preferred interaction mode due to the bivalency of the ligands (Bodor2014DYNLL2). DYNLL1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its dimerization and interaction with other proteins (He2018DYNLL1).

## Function
The DYNLL1 gene encodes the dynein light chain LC8-type 1 protein, which is involved in various cellular functions beyond its role in microtubule motor complexes. DYNLL1 is essential for the assembly of dyneins, motor proteins that facilitate movement along microtubules, and is crucial for the structural integrity of the dynein particle and cargo attachment (King2008DyneinIndependent). It functions as a dimer, with each monomer having specific structural features that allow it to bind target proteins, and its dimerization is regulated by factors such as pH and phosphorylation (King2008DyneinIndependent).

DYNLL1 is also involved in DNA repair processes, particularly in the context of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. It influences the choice between error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and error-free homologous recombination (HR) repair pathways, promoting NHEJ and limiting HR (Berkel2022DYNLL1). In BRCA1-deficient cells, DYNLL1 binds to the MRE11 protein to limit DNA end resection, a critical step in HR repair, thus maintaining genomic stability (He2018DYNLL1).

In the immune system, DYNLL1 plays a role in B cell development, particularly in the establishment of B-1a cells and the ongoing development of B-2 cells. It operates in a linear pathway with its transcriptional activator ASCIZ, and its loss leads to defects in B cell development (King2017Dynein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DYNLL1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly in the context of DNA repair mechanisms. In BRCA1-deficient cells, DYNLL1 plays a crucial role in limiting DNA end resection, a process essential for homologous recombination (HR) repair. Loss of DYNLL1 in these cells can restore HR, leading to resistance to platinum drugs and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, which are used in treating high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) (He2018DYNLL1; Becker2018The). 

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), DYNLL1 is involved in modulating apoptotic signaling. The DLEU1/DYNLL1 axis prevents DYNLL1 degradation, which is associated with increased levels of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2, contributing to cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy (Li2022DLEU1).

DYNLL1 mis-splicing, associated with SF3B1 mutations, has been linked to genome instability in certain leukemia cell lines. This mis-splicing results in a longer DYNLL1 isoform, which may contribute to DNA damage observed in these cells (Tam2021DYNLL1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DYNLL1 in cancer progression and treatment resistance.

## Interactions
DYNLL1, also known as dynein light chain LC8-type 1, is a hub protein that interacts with a variety of other proteins, influencing their functions and cellular processes. It is involved in DNA repair by interacting with DNA end resection factors such as MRE11, RAD50, NBN, DNA2, and BLM. These interactions are crucial for regulating DNA end resection, particularly in BRCA1-deficient cells, where DYNLL1 limits nucleolytic degradation of DNA ends, impacting the sensitivity of these cells to PARP inhibitors (He2018DYNLL1).

DYNLL1 also interacts with the ATM-interacting protein (ATMIN), binding to its C-terminal domain. This interaction involves multiple SQ/TQ motifs and affects the subcellular localization of both proteins, potentially interfering with their functions following DNA damage (Rapali2011LC8).

Additionally, DYNLL1 binds to the large myelin-associated glycoprotein (L-MAG), promoting the dimerization of its cytoplasmic domain. This interaction is significant for myelin-to-axon signaling and adhesion, with a high-affinity binding characterized by a 2:2 heterotetrameric stoichiometry (Myllykoski2018High‐affinity).
