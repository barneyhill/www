# DPYD

## Overview
The DPYD gene encodes the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), which is a critical component in the catabolism of pyrimidines, such as uracil and thymine. DPD is a homodimeric enzyme that functions primarily in the cytoplasm, where it catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step of pyrimidine degradation. This enzyme is essential for maintaining nucleotide balance and preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites. DPD is also significant in pharmacology due to its role in metabolizing the chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), converting it into inactive metabolites and thereby influencing drug efficacy and toxicity. Genetic variations in the DPYD gene can lead to reduced or nonfunctional DPD activity, which is associated with severe toxic side effects in patients undergoing 5-FU treatment (Henricks2015Translating; Hirota2012Dihydropyrimidine). Understanding the structure, function, and interactions of DPD is crucial for developing personalized treatment strategies and mitigating adverse drug reactions (Mattison2002A; Kato2021DPYD).

## Structure
The DPYD gene encodes the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme, which is crucial for the catabolism of pyrimidines. The DPD enzyme is a homodimeric protein, meaning it consists of two identical subunits, each approximately 100 kDa in size (Mattison2002A). The primary structure of DPD includes binding sites for flavin mononucleotide (FMN), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), as well as four iron-sulfur motifs (Mattison2002A).

The secondary structure of DPD features alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a complex tertiary structure that facilitates its enzymatic function. The enzyme's quaternary structure involves the interaction of its subunits to form a functional dimer (Mattison2002A).

Key domains within the DPD enzyme include the NADPH-binding and FAD-binding sites, which are essential for its catalytic activity. The enzyme also contains a special electron transfer pathway involving its iron-sulfur clusters (Gross2003Detailed). Specific mutations in these domains can affect the enzyme's stability and function, impacting its role in drug metabolism (van2002Novel). The DPYD gene is known to have several splice variants, which may influence the enzyme's activity and stability (Mattison2002A).

## Function
The DPYD gene encodes the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of pyrimidines, such as uracil and thymine, in human cells. This enzyme is responsible for the initial and rate-limiting step of pyrimidine degradation, converting these bases into their dihydro derivatives (Lu1992Purification). DPD is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it facilitates the breakdown of pyrimidines, maintaining nucleotide balance and preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites (Hirota2012Dihydropyrimidine).

In the context of pharmacology, DPD is significant for its role in the metabolism of the chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). It metabolizes over 80% of administered 5-FU in the liver into an inactive metabolite, 5,6-dihydro-5-fluorouracil, which is essential for controlling the inactivation of 5-FU and preventing the accumulation of active metabolites that could lead to toxicity (Henricks2015Translating). Genetic variations in the DPYD gene can lead to reduced or nonfunctional DPD enzyme activity, affecting drug metabolism and increasing the risk of severe toxic side effects from 5-FU treatment (Hirota2012Dihydropyrimidine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DPYD gene, which encodes the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), are clinically significant due to their association with severe toxicity in patients undergoing fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine. DPD deficiency, resulting from these mutations, impairs the metabolism of these drugs, leading to toxic accumulation and severe side effects (Gross2003Detailed; van2004Dihydropyrimidine).

Several specific mutations in the DPYD gene have been linked to this toxicity. The IVS14+1G>A splice-site mutation is particularly common and has been observed in patients experiencing lethal toxicity (van2004Dihydropyrimidine). Other mutations, such as c.2197insA, result in truncated DPD proteins that lack essential domains for drug metabolism, contributing to severe toxicity (Villalvazo2021DPYD).

Genetic screening for DPYD variants is crucial for personalizing treatment plans to prevent adverse reactions. Current pharmacogenetic panels test for a limited number of variants, but comprehensive sequencing can identify additional rare and novel variants that significantly increase the risk of severe toxicity (De2024Clinical). Identifying these variants allows for tailored chemotherapy regimens, reducing the risk of life-threatening side effects (De2024Clinical).

## Interactions
The DPYD gene encodes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), an enzyme that plays a crucial role in pyrimidine catabolism. DPD is involved in several interactions that influence its function and stability. It forms part of a multiprotein complex and interacts with cofactors such as NADPH, FAD, and FMN, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Dobritzsch2002Crystal; Hishinuma2022Importance). The enzyme's activity is modulated by its ability to form dimers, which is necessary for effective electron transport (Hishinuma2022Importance).

DPD also interacts with phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) in the context of pancreatic cancer. The interaction between DPYD and STAT3 is significant for understanding the mechanisms of cancer progression. Luteolin, a flavonoid, has been shown to down-regulate DPYD and pSTAT3, thereby inhibiting pancreatic cancer cell proliferation (Kato2021DPYD). This interaction suggests a regulatory loop between DPYD and pSTAT3, where high DPYD expression correlates with high pSTAT3 levels, influencing cell proliferation and cancer progression (Kato2021DPYD). These interactions highlight the potential of targeting the STAT3-DPYD pathway for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Kato2021DPYD).
