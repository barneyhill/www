# KAT8

## Overview
KAT8, also known as lysine acetyltransferase 8, is a gene that encodes a histone acetyltransferase enzyme involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. The KAT8 protein is a member of the MYST family of acetyltransferases and is characterized by its ability to acetylate lysine residues on histone proteins, particularly histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac), which plays a critical role in transcriptional activation and chromatin remodeling (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent; Li2020Lysine). KAT8 functions as part of two major multiprotein complexes, the male-specific lethal (MSL) and non-specific lethal (NSL) complexes, which are essential for transcriptional regulation and cellular homeostasis (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent). The enzyme's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, including autoacetylation and deacetylation, which are crucial for its role in various biological processes such as cell differentiation, tissue development, and stress responses (Li2020Lysine; Yoo2024KAT8).

## Structure
KAT8, also known as lysine acetyltransferase 8, is a histone acetyltransferase that plays a crucial role in histone modification, particularly in the acetylation of lysine 16 on histone H4 (H4K16ac) (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent; Li2020Lysine). The protein contains a chromobarrel domain and an acetyltransferase core, which are conserved in its Drosophila ortholog, Mof (Li2020Lysine). The acetyltransferase domain includes a KAT8/Mof-specific region and a MYST domain, which features an acetyl-CoA binding site essential for its enzymatic activity (Li2020Lysine).

KAT8 forms part of two multiprotein complexes, the MSL (male-specific lethal) and NSL (non-specific lethal) complexes, which are involved in chromatin regulation and transcription (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent). The NSL complex, which includes KAT8, KANSL2, and KANSL3, is particularly important for transcription initiation and is enriched at transcription start sites (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent). KAT8's activity is regulated by autoacetylation and deacetylation by SIRT1, highlighting the role of post-translational modifications in its function (Li2020Lysine).

The enzyme operates via a ping-pong mechanism, where Ac-CoA acts as an acetyl donor, transferring the acetyl group to a residue on the enzyme before the histone substrate binds (Wapenaar2015Enzyme). Despite these insights, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of KAT8 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
KAT8, also known as lysine acetyltransferase 8, is a crucial enzyme in human cells involved in histone acetylation, particularly targeting histone H4 at lysines 5, 8, and 16 (H4K5ac, H4K8ac, and H4K16ac). This acetylation is essential for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, facilitating RNA polymerase II recruitment to transcription start sites and promoting gene expression (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent). KAT8 operates within two major protein complexes: the non-specific lethal (NSL) complex and the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex. In the NSL complex, KAT8 is vital for cell survival and proliferation, as it regulates the expression of essential genes by acetylating histones at transcription start sites (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent; Yoo2024KAT8). The MSL complex, where KAT8 is responsible for the majority of H4K16ac, is associated with transcriptionally active chromatin but is not essential for cell survival (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent; Yoo2024KAT8). KAT8 also plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal health by modulating chromatin dynamics and gene expression, impacting processes such as cell differentiation, tissue development, and stress responses (Yoo2024KAT8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KAT8 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Variants in KAT8 have been linked to syndromic intellectual disability, characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and language impairment. These variants often affect the chromobarrel and catalytic domains, impairing histone H4 lysine 16 (H4K16) acetylation, which is crucial for cerebral development (Li2020Lysine). 

KAT8 is also implicated in Parkinson's Disease (PD) as a candidate risk gene. It plays a role in PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, a process essential for mitochondrial quality control. Dysfunctional mitophagy due to KAT8 alterations is a significant pathomechanism in PD (de2024KAT8). 

In addition, KAT8 is associated with metabolic traits and neurological disorders. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KAT8, such as rs9925964 and rs59735493, are linked to body mass index fluctuations, Alzheimer's disease, and anxiety (Yoo2024KAT8). 

KAT8 dysregulation may also contribute to chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, and is involved in the immune response to viral infections, potentially affecting autoimmune disorders and cancer (Yoo2024KAT8).

## Interactions
KAT8, also known as lysine acetyltransferase 8, is a key component of two distinct chromatin complexes: the NSL (Non-Specific Lethal) and MSL (Male-Specific Lethal) complexes. Within the NSL complex, KAT8 interacts with several proteins, including KANSL1, KANSL2, KANSL3, MCRS1, PHF20, PHF20L1, HCFC1, and WDR5. This complex is crucial for transcription initiation at transcription start sites (TSSs) through the acetylation of histone H4 at lysines 5 and 8 (H4K5ac and H4K8ac) (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent).

In the MSL complex, KAT8 interacts with MSL1, MSL2, and MSL3, which are noncatalytic subunits that activate its acetyltransferase activity, particularly towards histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac). This interaction is essential for maintaining global H4K16ac levels, which are important for chromatin structure and gene expression (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent; Li2020Lysine).

KAT8 also forms associations with other proteins, such as OGT, HSPA5, and PPM1G, suggesting roles beyond the NSL complex (Radzisheuskaya2021Complexdependent). These interactions highlight KAT8's multifaceted role in transcription regulation and cellular homeostasis.
