# ANO9

## Overview
ANO9 is a gene that encodes the protein anoctamin 9, which is a member of the anoctamin family of transmembrane proteins. Anoctamin 9 functions primarily as a cation channel, activated by the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, and is involved in ion transport with a preference for cations over anions. It is predominantly expressed in the digestive system, particularly in the small intestine, colon, and stomach. The protein plays a crucial role in cellular processes by modulating phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface, influencing the activity of sheddases such as ADAM10 and ADAM17, and affecting the release of growth factors. These functions are significant in cell signaling and membrane dynamics, with implications in cancer biology, particularly in pancreatic, colorectal, and esophageal cancers (Kim2018Anoctamin; Leitzke2022Influence).

## Function
ANO9, also known as anoctamin 9, functions as a cation channel activated by the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. It is primarily expressed in the digestive system, with high mRNA levels in the small intestine, colon, and stomach. ANO9 is involved in ion transport, specifically showing a preference for cations over anions, and is more permeable to Ca2+ than to monovalent cations (Kim2018Anoctamin).

The protein is activated by phosphorylation at the Ser245 residue by PKA, which is crucial for its function. This activation is enhanced by calcium, although calcium alone does not significantly activate ANO9 (Kim2018Anoctamin). ANO9 also plays a role in cellular processes by modulating phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on the cell surface, which influences the sheddase activity of ADAM10 and ADAM17, affecting the release of growth factors like amphiregulin (AREG) and TGFα. This activity is linked to cell proliferation and may have implications in cancer biology (Leitzke2022Influence).

In healthy human cells, ANO9's precise physiological role remains largely unknown, but it is implicated in processes related to cell signaling and membrane dynamics (Oh2016Cellular; Kim2018Anoctamin).

## Clinical Significance
ANO9 (anoctamin 9) has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In pancreatic cancer, ANO9 is overexpressed in several cell lines and tissues, while it is not expressed in normal pancreatic tissues. This overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation and activation of the ERK/EGFR signaling pathway, which promotes tumorigenesis. ANO9 forms protein complexes with EGFR, enhancing its activation, which is distinct from transcriptional regulation. Knockdown of ANO9 in pancreatic cancer cell lines inhibits cell proliferation and decreases EGFR activation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Jun2017ANO9TMEM16J).

In colorectal and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, ANO9 expression is linked to cancer progression. In colorectal cancer, downregulation of ANO9 is associated with tumorigenesis, while in esophageal cancer, its depletion reduces cell proliferation and migration. High ANO9 expression correlates with poor survival in patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Leitzke2022Influence).

Overall, ANO9's role in cancer biology is significant, as it influences cell proliferation and survival pathways, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancers with high ANO9 expression (Jun2017ANO9TMEM16J; Leitzke2022Influence).

## Interactions
ANO9, also known as anoctamin 9, is involved in several protein interactions that are significant in cellular processes and disease mechanisms. ANO9 has been shown to physically associate with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a key player in cell signaling pathways. This interaction is crucial for promoting cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in pancreatic cancer, as ANO9 enhances the activation of the ERK/EGFR signaling pathway (Jun2017ANO9TMEM16J). Immunoprecipitation assays have demonstrated a potential interaction between ANO9 and EGFR, where PANC-1 cells co-transfected with Myc-tagged ANO9 and HA-tagged EGFR plasmids showed the formation of immune complexes (Jun2017ANO9TMEM16J).

ANO9 also plays a role in the regulation of ADAM sheddase activity, particularly influencing the shedding of substrates like amphiregulin (AREG) through its scramblase activity. This process is linked to phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on the cell surface, which is crucial for ADAM sheddase function. ANO9's overexpression enhances the release of ADAM substrates, indicating its involvement in modulating ADAM-dependent cellular functions (Leitzke2022Influence). These interactions highlight ANO9's role in cellular signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
