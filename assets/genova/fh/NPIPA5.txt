# NPIPA5

## Overview
The NPIPA5 gene encodes the nuclear pore complex interacting protein family member A5, which is part of a family of proteins involved in the regulation of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. This protein is categorized as a nuclear pore complex-associated protein, playing a crucial role in the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The NPIPA5 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including the maintenance of nuclear envelope integrity and the regulation of gene expression. Its interactions with other nuclear pore complex proteins suggest a role in modulating the transport efficiency and selectivity of the nuclear pore complex, which is essential for proper cellular function and response to environmental signals (Qiu2020aarFDC).
