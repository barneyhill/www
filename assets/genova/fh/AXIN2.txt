# AXIN2

## Overview
AXIN2 is a gene that encodes the axin 2 protein, a pivotal component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and tissue homeostasis. The axin 2 protein functions primarily as a scaffold protein, facilitating the assembly of the β-catenin destruction complex, thereby promoting the degradation of β-catenin and preventing its accumulation in the nucleus (Jho2002Wnt/β-Catenin/Tcf; Dong2001Genomic). Structurally, axin 2 contains several domains, including an N-terminal RGS domain and a C-terminal DIX domain, which are essential for its interactions within the signaling pathway (Chen2023Structural). The gene is also implicated in various clinical conditions, such as familial tooth agenesis and colorectal cancer, due to mutations that disrupt its normal function (Liu2000Mutations; Lammi2004Mutations). Understanding the role of AXIN2 and its encoded protein is critical for elucidating the mechanisms of Wnt signaling and its implications in human health and disease.

## Structure
The AXIN2 protein is a key component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and contains several important structural domains. It features a conserved N-terminal RGS domain and a C-terminal DIX domain, which are crucial for its interactions and functions within the signaling pathway (Chen2023Structural). The AXIN2 protein also includes a GSK3 binding domain (GBD), composed of 99 amino acids (residues 334-432), which is evolutionarily conserved and plays a significant role in its interaction with other proteins, such as SIAH1 (Chen2023Structural).

The AXIN2-GBD region interacts with the SBD of SIAH1, forming a complex that was structurally resolved at 2.53 Å resolution. This interaction involves the AXIN2 peptide 361-368, which includes the VxP motif, binding to a groove in the SIAH1-SBD (Chen2023Structural). The AXIN2 protein is primarily composed of irregular coil-coiled structures outside of its defined domains, which often bind to target proteins as small fragments (Chen2023Structural).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, poly-ADP-ribosylation, and ubiquitination regulate AXIN2's activity, influencing its role in the Wnt signaling pathway and its potential as a drug target (Chen2023Structural). AXIN2 can also exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function (Chen2023Structural).

## Function
AXIN2 is a critical component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, acting as a negative regulator by facilitating the degradation of β-catenin. This process is essential for maintaining appropriate levels of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, preventing its accumulation and subsequent translocation to the nucleus, where it would otherwise activate target gene expression (Jho2002Wnt/β-Catenin/Tcf; Dong2001Genomic). AXIN2 functions as a scaffold protein, promoting the phosphorylation of β-catenin by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), which marks β-catenin for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Dong2001Genomic).

In addition to its cytoplasmic role, AXIN2 is also localized in the nucleus, where it forms a complex with β-catenin and TCF transcription factors. This nuclear complex represses the expression of the MYC gene, a key target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, by altering chromatin structure at the MYC promoter (Rennoll2014Nuclear). The dual localization of AXIN2 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus underscores its multifaceted role in regulating Wnt signaling and gene expression, which is crucial for cellular proliferation, differentiation, and maintaining tissue homeostasis (Rennoll2014Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AXIN2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in the Wnt signaling pathway. One of the most notable conditions linked to AXIN2 mutations is familial tooth agenesis, particularly oligodontia, which is characterized by the congenital absence of multiple teeth. This condition has been observed in families with specific AXIN2 mutations, such as the nonsense mutation Arg656Stop and a frameshift mutation 1994-1995insG, which lead to severe tooth agenesis (Wong2014Novel; Lammi2004Mutations).

AXIN2 mutations also predispose individuals to colorectal cancer. The same mutations that cause tooth agenesis can lead to colorectal neoplasia, suggesting a shared genetic basis for these conditions (Lammi2004Mutations). In colorectal cancer, AXIN2 mutations are often found in tumors with defective DNA mismatch repair, contributing to the activation of β-catenin/T-cell factor signaling, which is crucial in cancer development (Liu2000Mutations).

Additionally, AXIN2 mutations have been implicated in other cancers, including medulloblastomas, hepatocellular carcinoma, and ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma, where they lead to aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway (Koch2007Mutations). These findings highlight the clinical significance of AXIN2 in both dental anomalies and cancer predisposition.

## Interactions
AXIN2, also known as conductin, is a scaffold protein that plays a significant role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. It interacts with several key proteins, including GSK3β, β-catenin, and APC, forming the β-catenin destruction complex. This complex is crucial for the regulation of β-catenin levels, as AXIN2 facilitates its phosphorylation and subsequent degradation (Behrens1998Functional; Fagotto1999Domains).

AXIN2 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH1. This interaction is mediated by the Axin2-GSK3 binding domain (GBD), which is sufficient for SIAH1 binding. The crystal structure of the Axin2/SIAH1 complex reveals that Axin2 binds to SIAH1 via a conserved peptide within the GBD, forming a loop that interacts with a groove on SIAH1. This interaction is important for regulating the Wnt signaling pathway, as SIAH1 targets components of the pathway, including Axin2, for degradation (Chen2023Structural).

In the TGF-β signaling pathway, AXIN2 interacts with Arkadia and Smad7, forming a ternary complex that promotes the degradation of Smad7. This interaction enhances TGF-β signaling by facilitating the polyubiquitination and degradation of Smad7, a process dependent on Arkadia (Liu2006Axin).
