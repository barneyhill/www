# RHOQ

## Overview
RHOQ, also known as TC10, is a gene that encodes the protein ras homolog family member Q, a small GTPase belonging to the Rho family. This protein functions as a molecular switch, cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states, and is involved in various cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton reorganization, vesicle trafficking, and glucose transport (Saliani2021RHO). RHOQ is particularly significant in maintaining cell shape, motility, and intracellular signaling pathways. The protein's activity is modulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which regulate its transition between active and inactive states (Saliani2021RHO). RHOQ's interactions with other proteins, such as Exo70 and Golgi-associated PDZ domain proteins, further highlight its role in cellular transport and protein stabilization, underscoring its importance in normal cellular function and signaling (Bridges2020RHOQ).

## Structure
RHOQ, also known as TC10, is a member of the Rho family of GTPases, which are small GTP-binding proteins involved in various cellular processes. The primary structure of RHOQ consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, including a GTP-binding domain essential for its function as a molecular switch cycling between active and inactive states (Van1997Rho). 

The secondary structure of RHOQ likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of GTPases, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is stabilized by interactions such as hydrogen bonds and disulfide bridges. This folding is crucial for the protein's function and interaction with other molecules.

RHOQ undergoes post-translational modifications, notably isoprenylation at the C-terminal CAAX motif, which involves the addition of a prenyl group, C-terminal cleavage, and methylation. This modification is critical for the protein's association with lipid membranes, influencing its intracellular localization and signaling capabilities (Boulter2011Off). The protein may also form quaternary structures through interactions with other proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
RHOQ, also known as TC10, is a member of the CDC42 subfamily of Rho GTPases, which are part of the larger RAS superfamily. These proteins function as molecular switches, cycling between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state, and are involved in various cellular processes (Saliani2021RHO). RHOQ plays a significant role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which affects cell adhesion, polarity, and migration. This reorganization is crucial for processes such as cell trafficking, wound healing, immune response, embryonal development, and neuronal plasticity (Saliani2021RHO).

RHOQ is active at the plasma membrane, where it is involved in vesicle trafficking and glucose transport, contributing to the maintenance of cell shape and motility. The protein's activity is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which accelerate GTP hydrolysis, returning the protein to its inactive state (Saliani2021RHO). Although specific details about RHOQ's function in healthy human cells are limited, its involvement in these fundamental cellular processes suggests a critical role in maintaining normal cellular function and signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
RHOQ, also known as TC10, is a small GTPase that participates in various protein interactions crucial for cellular processes. It interacts with Exo70, a component of the exocyst complex, which is involved in vesicle transport and nuclear protein interactions. This interaction is significant in the context of angiogenesis, where RHOQ, Exo70, and Notch1 components form a complex that influences the localization and trafficking of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) to the nucleus (Bridges2020RHOQ).

RHOQ also interacts with Golgi-associated PDZ domain proteins to stabilize the expression of the β1-adrenergic receptor, preventing its degradation. This interaction highlights RHOQ's role in intracellular trafficking and protein stabilization (Bridges2020RHOQ). In the absence of RHOQ, NICD is sequestered in the cytoplasm and degraded in lysosomes, indicating RHOQ's protective role against lysosomal degradation (Bridges2020RHOQ).

Additionally, RHOQ is involved in the regulation of actin polymerization on membrane transport vesicles and interacts directly with COPI coat proteins, which are part of the vesicle trafficking processes between the Golgi and plasma membrane (Delprato2012Topological). These interactions underscore RHOQ's critical role in cellular transport and signaling pathways.
