# GPR156

## Overview
GPR156 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 156, a transmembrane receptor involved in the orientation of hair cells within mechanosensory epithelia, particularly in the auditory and vestibular systems. This receptor is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a pivotal role in cellular signal transduction. GPR156 interacts with Gαi proteins to reverse the orientation of hair cells, a process essential for proper auditory and vestibular function. The receptor is involved in a signaling cascade with the transcription factor EMX2 and Gαi, crucial for establishing the line of polarity reversal in otolith organs and ensuring the correct orientation of hair cells. Mutations in the GPR156 gene have been linked to recessive congenital hearing loss, highlighting its clinical significance in auditory health (Kindt2021EMX2GPR156Gαi; Greene2022Genetic).

## Function
GPR156 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a critical role in the orientation of hair cells (HCs) within mechanosensory epithelia, particularly in the auditory and vestibular systems. It functions by interacting with Gαi proteins to reverse the orientation of hair cells, a process essential for proper auditory and vestibular function (Kindt2021EMX2GPR156Gαi). GPR156 is involved in a signaling cascade with the transcription factor EMX2 and Gαi, which is crucial for establishing the line of polarity reversal in otolith organs and ensuring the correct orientation of hair cells (Kindt2021EMX2GPR156Gαi; Ma2022G).

In the cochlea, GPR156 is expressed in all hair cells and is necessary for the uniform orientation of outer hair cells, which is vital for hearing function (Ma2022G). The receptor is enriched at the medial junctions of hair cells and works in conjunction with other polarity proteins to maintain proper cell orientation (Kindt2021EMX2GPR156Gαi). GPR156's activity is primarily localized to the cell membrane, where it acts as a conventional GPCR with Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) activity, activating the heterotrimeric Gαiβγ complex to direct hair cell orientation (Kindt2021EMX2GPR156Gαi).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GPR156 gene are associated with recessive congenital hearing loss. High-impact variants, such as a one base pair deletion (p.S207Vfs*113) and a one base pair insertion (p.P718Lfs*86), have been identified as responsible for this condition. Affected individuals often exhibit either homozygous or compound heterozygous genotypes for these truncating alleles, leading to a loss-of-function mechanism that disrupts the expression of the GPR156 protein. This disruption affects the orientation of stereocilia on hair cells in the inner ear, a critical factor for hearing, resulting in congenital nonsyndromic bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (Greene2023Genetic; Greene2022Genetic).

In addition to hearing loss, GPR156 is implicated in the orientation of hair cells within mechanosensory epithelia. Mutations in GPR156 can lead to misorientation of outer hair cells in the cochlea, contributing to auditory dysfunction. This misorientation is due to the disruption of the normal cellular architecture and the interaction of GPR156 with core planar cell polarity proteins, which are essential for proper auditory function (Kindt2021EMX2GPR156Gαi).

## Interactions
GPR156, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in several key interactions that influence hair cell orientation in mechanosensory epithelia. It physically interacts with the Gαi3 protein, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cell extracts, where Gαi3 was pulled down with 2HA-GPR156. This interaction suggests that Gαi signals downstream of GPR156 at the hair cell junction, playing a crucial role in hair cell orientation and hair bundle morphogenesis (Kindt2021EMX2GPR156Gαi).

GPR156 also interacts with core planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins such as FZD6 and VANGL2 at the medial hair cell junction. These interactions are essential for maintaining proper hair cell orientation and cochlear mechanics. The study indicates that GPR156's interaction with these proteins is crucial for its function in reversing hair cell orientation, independent of other GEFs like DAPLE (Kindt2021EMX2GPR156Gαi).

In the context of hair cell orientation, GPR156 is distinct from the GPSM2-Gαi complex, which is involved in hair bundle morphogenesis. The GPR156-Gαi pathway specifically regulates hair cell orientation reversal, highlighting its unique role in cellular orientation processes (Kindt2021EMX2GPR156Gαi).
