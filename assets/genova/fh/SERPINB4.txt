# SERPINB4

## Overview
SERPINB4 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family B member 4, which is part of the serpin superfamily of proteins. This family is characterized by its role as protease inhibitors, with SERPINB4 specifically functioning as a cross-class inhibitor of serine and cysteine proteases. The protein is primarily involved in regulating protease activity within cells, contributing to processes such as inflammation and maintaining skin barrier function. It is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it helps protect cells from protease-mediated damage and may play a role in cellular stress responses and gene regulation. The evolutionary divergence of SERPINB4, particularly in great apes, suggests adaptive evolution and functional specialization (Gomes2014Adaptive; Gatto2013Serpins). Elevated expression of SERPINB4 in certain tumor tissues, such as lung and prostate, indicates its potential as a biomarker for specific cancers (Badola2006Correlation).

## Structure
SERPINB4 is a member of the serpin superfamily, characterized by a conserved tertiary structure consisting of three β-sheets and eight or nine α-helices, with a reactive center loop (RCL) that is crucial for its inhibitory function (Kryvalap2022The; Gatto2013Serpins). The RCL acts as a pseudo-substrate for target proteases, determining specificity and forming a covalent complex that irreversibly inhibits the protease (Gomes2014Adaptive). The molecular structure of SERPINB4 was modeled using the crystal structure of SERPINB3 as a template, showing a low root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.22 Å, indicating a similar protein backbone (Gomes2014Adaptive).

SERPINB4 is a cross-class serpin, capable of inhibiting both serine and cysteine proteases, although it primarily targets serine proteases like cathepsin G and mast cell chymase (Gatto2013Serpins; Gomes2014Adaptive). The protein is typically intracellular, localized in the cytoplasm or associated with cytoplasmic organelles, and does not usually form quaternary structures (Gatto2013Serpins). Post-translational modifications may include phosphorylation, contributing to its functional diversity. The evolutionary divergence of SERPINB4, along with its paralog SERPINB3, suggests adaptive evolution and functional specialization in great apes (Gomes2014Adaptive).

## Function
SERPINB4, a member of the serpin family, functions primarily as a serine protease inhibitor, regulating protease activity within cells. It is known to inhibit proteases such as cathepsin G and chymase, which are involved in inflammatory responses and maintaining skin barrier function. This protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to cellular protection against protease-mediated damage (Catanzaro2014Oncogenic).

In healthy human cells, SERPINB4 plays a crucial role in modulating inflammatory responses. By inhibiting specific proteases, it helps control the degradation of extracellular matrix components and prevents excessive tissue damage during inflammation. This regulatory function is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and protecting cells from protease-induced injury (Catanzaro2014Oncogenic).

SERPINB4's activity in the cytoplasm and nucleus suggests its involvement in various cellular processes beyond protease inhibition. Its presence in these cellular compartments indicates a potential role in regulating gene expression and cellular stress responses, although the specific mechanisms in healthy cells remain less well-defined in the available literature (Catanzaro2014Oncogenic).

## Interactions
SERPINB4, also known as squamous cell carcinoma antigen 2, is a member of the serpin superfamily that interacts with various proteases. In vitro studies have shown that SERPINB4 can interact with cathepsins S, L, and K, as well as cathepsin G and chymase, although the precise biological roles of these interactions remain unclear (Badola2006Correlation). These interactions suggest that SERPINB4 may play a role in regulating protease activity, which is crucial in processes such as inflammation and immune response.

The expression of SERPINB4 is notably elevated in lung and prostate tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, indicating its potential role as a marker for certain types of cancer (Badola2006Correlation). Despite its known interactions with specific proteases, the exact physiological and pathological implications of these interactions in vivo are not fully understood. The study by Badola et al. suggests that expression profiling correlation could help identify novel in vivo functions of SERPINB4 and its potential target proteases, which may contribute to understanding its role in disease states (Badola2006Correlation).
