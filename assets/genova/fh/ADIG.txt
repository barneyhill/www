# ADIG

## Overview
The ADIG gene encodes the protein adipogenin, a small transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. Adipogenin is primarily expressed in adipose tissues and is integral to the formation and growth of lipid droplets by interacting with the seipin protein complex. This interaction is crucial for the assembly and stabilization of a dodecameric seipin complex, which is essential for effective lipid storage and adipose tissue expansion. The protein's structure includes a significant transmembrane helix, classifying it as a single-pass transmembrane protein, with its C-terminal tail located in the cytosol. Adipogenin's involvement in lipid metabolism extends to regulating fat mass accrual and energy balance, with its expression being upregulated during adipocyte differentiation (Li2024Adipogenin; AlvarezGuaita2021Phenotypic).

## Structure
The ADIG (adipogenin) protein is composed of 81 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 9696.2 Da and a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 4.03 (Liu2017Cloning). The primary structure of ADIG includes a significant transmembrane helix from amino acids 18 to 36, with a hydrophobic region from amino acids 25 to 32 (Liu2017Cloning). The protein is characterized as a transmembrane protein with a conserved hydrophobic α-helix at the N-terminus, suggesting its role as a single-pass transmembrane protein (Li2024Adipogenin). The C-terminal tail of ADIG is cytosolic (Li2024Adipogenin).

The secondary structure of ADIG includes large helices and sheets distributed randomly, with β-turns and random coils mainly in the central area (Liu2017Cloning). The tertiary structure is implied by its transmembrane nature, with the N-terminus embedded into the seipin complex and an α-helical stretch intercalating with the transmembrane regions of seipin (Li2024Adipogenin). The quaternary structure involves ADIG's role in the assembly and stabilization of a dodecameric seipin complex, where it acts as a bridge to connect and stabilize the transmembrane segments of seipin (Li2024Adipogenin).

## Function
The ADIG gene, also known as adipogenin, encodes a small membrane protein that plays a critical role in adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. In healthy human cells, ADIG is primarily expressed in adipose tissues and is involved in the formation and growth of lipid droplets (LDs) by interacting with the seipin protein complex. ADIG facilitates the assembly of a dodecameric seipin complex, which is crucial for effective lipid storage and adipose tissue expansion (Li2024Adipogenin).

ADIG acts as a stabilizing agent for the seipin complex, enhancing its structural integrity and function. This interaction is essential for the proper formation of LDs, as ADIG promotes the assembly of seipin oligomers, thereby supporting triglyceride synthesis and storage (Li2024Adipogenin). The presence of ADIG in the seipin complex increases the stability and expression levels of both proteins, contributing to efficient lipid droplet growth and adipose tissue function (Li2024Adipogenin).

In addition to its role in lipid metabolism, ADIG is involved in regulating fat mass accrual and energy balance. Its expression is upregulated during adipocyte differentiation, and it is associated with body mass index-adjusted leptin levels, indicating its role in energy homeostasis (Liu2017Cloning; AlvarezGuaita2021Phenotypic).

## Interactions
The ADIG (adipogenin) protein is known to interact with seipin, a key protein involved in lipid droplet formation and adipose tissue expansion. ADIG forms a complex with seipin, stabilizing it and promoting the assembly of a dodecameric seipin complex, which is more stable than the undecameric complex formed in the absence of ADIG (Li2024Adipogenin). This interaction involves the transmembrane segments of seipin, which provide a hydrophobic channel accommodating the α-helix of ADIG. The N-terminus of ADIG is embedded in the seipin oligomers, interacting with the TM2 segments of adjacent seipin monomers (Li2024Adipogenin).

ADIG's interaction with seipin is crucial for lipid droplet (LD) formation, as it co-elutes with the seipin complex in differentiated adipocytes, indicating a direct involvement in LD formation (Li2024Adipogenin). The presence of ADIG in the seipin complex enhances the structural rigidity and stability of the complex, supporting triglyceride synthesis and LD growth (Li2024Adipogenin). These interactions suggest that ADIG acts as a 'chaperone-like' regulator for the seipin complex, influencing its oligomerization and function (Li2024Adipogenin).
