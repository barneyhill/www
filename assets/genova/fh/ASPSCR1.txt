# ASPSCR1

## Overview
The ASPSCR1 gene encodes a protein known as ASPSCR1 tether for SLC2A4, UBX domain containing, which is involved in various cellular processes, including protein-protein interactions and splicing regulation. The ASPSCR1 protein, also referred to as ASPL or UBXD9, is characterized by its unique structural domains, such as the UBX and ubiquitin-like domains, which facilitate its interaction with other proteins like p97. These interactions are crucial for its role in cellular stress responses and tumor progression (kostova2021functional). Clinically, ASPSCR1 is significant due to its involvement in the formation of the ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion gene, resulting from a chromosomal translocation, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of alveolar soft part sarcoma and certain renal cell carcinomas. This fusion protein plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis by regulating genes associated with angiogenesis and intracellular trafficking (Tanaka2023ASPSCR1::TFE3; Tanaka2021ASPSCR1TFE3).

## Structure
The ASPSCR1 gene encodes the ASPL protein, also known as UBXD9, which is characterized by a unique structural composition. The wild-type ASPL protein is a 553 amino acid polypeptide that includes a UBX domain, distinct for its extended UBX (eUBX) domain. This eUBX domain features an additional β-grasp fold and two α-helices forming a lariat preceding the UBX domain, followed by two more α-helical extensions. These structural elements enable ASPL to disrupt the stable hexameric structure of the p97 protein, forming a new oligomeric structure, likely a heterotetramer consisting of two ASPL and two p97 molecules (kostova2021functional).

The ASPL protein also contains a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) at its N-terminus, characterized by an elevated negative electrostatic potential and increased backbone mobility, suggesting potential protein-protein interaction sites. However, this domain lacks the structural features for recognizing polyubiquitinated substrates (kostova2021functional). Specific mutations, such as those at Asp351 and Pro437-Pro438, affect ASPL's ability to disassemble p97 hexamers, indicating the importance of these residues in its functional capacity (kostova2021functional). The ASPL protein is involved in forming complexes with various proteins, including p97, U2AF2, and others, highlighting its role in cellular processes like splicing regulation (kostova2021functional).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The ASPSCR1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in the formation of the ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion gene, which results from a t(X;17) chromosomal translocation. This fusion is causatively associated with alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), a rare malignancy primarily affecting adolescents and young adults. ASPS is characterized by a highly integrated vascular network and high metastatic potential, with the ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion playing a crucial role in tumor development through angiogenesis (Tanaka2023ASPSCR1::TFE3; Tanaka2021ASPSCR1TFE3). The fusion gene is also implicated in a subset of renal cell carcinomas, particularly translocation renal cell carcinoma (tRCC), where it contributes to tumorigenesis and poor prognosis (Prakasam2024Comparative; Argani2001Primary).

In ASPS, the ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion protein regulates genes involved in angiogenesis, such as PDGFB, ANGPTL2, and GPNMB, and is associated with super-enhancers that modulate gene expression critical for tumor growth (Tanaka2023ASPSCR1::TFE3; Tanaka2021ASPSCR1TFE3). The fusion gene's role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression modulation underscores its importance in the pathogenesis of ASPS and highlights potential therapeutic targets for this refractory disease (Tanaka2023ASPSCR1::TFE3).

## Interactions
ASPSCR1 is known to participate in several protein interactions. It interacts with the recombinant Clonorchis sinensis nitric oxide synthase interacting protein (rCsNOSIP), as confirmed by GST-pull down assays. This interaction suggests a role in oxidative stress and tumor progression in cholangiocarcinoma cells (Bian2023ASPSCR1). ASPSCR1 also interacts with Sirt-5, another protein involved in cellular stress responses, and this interaction was similarly confirmed using GST-pull down assays (Bian2023ASPSCR1).

In the context of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), ASPSCR1 forms a fusion protein with TFE3, known as ASPSCR1::TFE3. This fusion protein is crucial for tumorigenesis in vivo and regulates genes involved in angiogenesis by binding to DNA through TFE3-derived domains. The ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion protein interacts with chromatin and histone modifications, particularly influencing super-enhancers associated with angiogenesis-related pathways (Tanaka2021ASPSCR1TFE3). The fusion protein also regulates the expression of genes like Rab27a and Sytl2, which are involved in intracellular trafficking and angiogenesis, highlighting its role in promoting tumor growth and vascular development (Tanaka2021ASPSCR1TFE3).
