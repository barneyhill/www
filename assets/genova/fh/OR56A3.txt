# OR56A3

## Overview
The OR56A3 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 56 subfamily A member 3, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which facilitates the detection and transduction of odorant signals. The OR56A3 protein is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it plays a critical role in the olfactory signaling pathway by binding specific odor molecules and initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. Beyond its primary function in olfaction, OR56A3 has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including its potential role as a biomarker in cancer and its association with eating behavior and adiposity (Fontanesi2012A; kizilaslan2024weibull; Cardoso2020Wholegenome).

## Structure
The OR56A3 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of GPCRs. The primary structure of the OR56A3 protein consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function as an olfactory receptor. The secondary structure includes alpha helices, which are integral to the receptor's ability to span the cell membrane. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a specific three-dimensional shape, essential for the receptor's interaction with odorant molecules. 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, influencing the receptor's function and stability. These modifications can affect the receptor's ability to bind to ligands and initiate signal transduction. The OR56A3 protein does not typically form quaternary structures, as it functions as a monomer within the olfactory system. The gene is not single-exon, indicating potential for alternative splicing, which may result in different isoforms of the protein with varied functional properties (Tobar2009Highly). However, specific details about splice variant isoforms of OR56A3 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
OR56A3 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR56A3 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to olfactory sensation. The olfactory receptor family, including OR56A3, plays a crucial role in the olfactory signaling pathway, which is essential for odor perception, food recognition, and the identification of sexual partners, among other survival aspects (Cardoso2020Wholegenome).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR56A3 has been identified in various studies as a potential biomarker for cancer. Its transcript abundance has been examined in invasive breast carcinoma populations, although the specific roles of OR genes in breast cancer remain understudied (kizilaslan2024weibull). The gene has also been associated with eating behavior and adiposity in humans, suggesting a potential role in regulating food intake and body fat distribution (Fontanesi2012A).
