# SYT7

## Overview
The SYT7 gene encodes the protein synaptotagmin 7, a member of the synaptotagmin family, which is characterized by its role as a calcium sensor in various cellular processes. Synaptotagmin 7 is a transmembrane protein with two C-terminal calcium-binding C2 domains, C2A and C2B, which are integral to its function in calcium-dependent membrane interactions and exocytosis (MacDougall2018The). The protein is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and hormone secretion, playing a critical role in synaptic transmission and neuroendocrine cell function (Wang2021Synaptotagmin7–mediated; MacDougall2018The). Synaptotagmin 7's high calcium sensitivity and ability to bind anionic phospholipids make it essential for processes that require precise calcium signaling, such as asynchronous synaptic vesicle release and short-term synaptic plasticity (Wang2021Synaptotagmin7–mediated; MacDougall2018The). Additionally, alterations in SYT7 expression have been linked to various cancers and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Zhang2023SYT7; Shen2020Synaptotagmin7).

## Structure
Synaptotagmin 7 (SYT7) is a protein characterized by its N-terminal transmembrane domain and two C-terminal calcium-binding C2 domains, known as C2A and C2B (MacDougall2018The). The C2 domains are part of the protein kinase C family and are crucial for calcium sensing and membrane binding (MacDougall2018The). The C2A domain of SYT7 is particularly important for its function, as it binds to phospholipids with higher affinity than the C2B domain under Ca2+-saturating conditions (Voleti2017Exceptionally). This domain exhibits a β-sandwich architecture typical of C2 domains, with three Ca2+ binding sites (Voleti2017Exceptionally).

The C2A domain of SYT7 contains specific amino acid substitutions, such as a methionine-to-phenylalanine change, which enhance its hydrophobic interactions and membrane-binding capability (Voleti2017Exceptionally). The C2B domain, while structurally similar to that of synaptotagmin-1, binds more tightly to membranes and is involved in stabilizing and promoting fusion pore expansion (MacDougall2018The).

SYT7's structure allows it to interact with anionic phospholipids, facilitating its role in membrane fusion and neurotransmitter release. The protein's high calcium sensitivity and strong membrane-binding properties are attributed to these structural features (MacDougall2018The).

## Function
Synaptotagmin 7 (SYT7) is a high-affinity calcium sensor involved in various forms of regulated exocytosis in healthy human cells. It plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release and hormone secretion by facilitating vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. SYT7 is particularly important in synaptic transmission and neuroendocrine cell secretion, where it modulates exocytosis kinetics and allows for fine-tuning of secretory outputs in response to calcium signals (MacDougall2018The).

In synapses, SYT7 contributes to asynchronous synaptic vesicle release and short-term synaptic plasticity, such as synaptic facilitation and vesicle replenishment (Wang2021Synaptotagmin7–mediated). It is localized to the peripheral active zone membrane in presynaptic terminals, where it triggers action potential-evoked glutamate release, crucial for maintaining normal synaptic activity and plasticity (Wang2021Synaptotagmin7–mediated).

SYT7 also plays a role in the regulation of fusion pore expansion during exocytosis, particularly in chromaffin cells, where it stabilizes areas of high membrane curvature and affects the release kinetics of cargo proteins (MacDougall2018The). Its high calcium sensitivity allows it to bind anionic phospholipids and stimulate membrane fusion at low calcium concentrations, making it well-suited for processes operating at low intracellular calcium levels (MacDougall2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SYT7 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), SYT7 is overexpressed, promoting malignant behaviors such as proliferation and migration of CLL cells. Knockdown of SYT7 in these cells inhibits these malignant behaviors, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2023SYT7). In colorectal cancer, SYT7 is also overexpressed, correlating with increased tumor growth and cell proliferation. Knockdown of SYT7 in colorectal cancer cells results in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating its role in cancer progression (Wang2018Synaptotagmin7).

In gastric cancer, high SYT7 expression is associated with poor prognosis and hepatic metastasis. SYT7 knockout in gastric cancer cells leads to reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis, highlighting its role in metastasis and as a potential therapeutic target (Kanda2018SYT7). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SYT7 promotes proliferation and metastasis while inhibiting apoptosis. Its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Liu2019Synaptotagmin).

SYT7 is also implicated in bipolar disorder, where its reduced expression is associated with mood abnormalities. This suggests a potential role in the pathogenesis of the disorder and its comorbidity with metabolic syndrome (Shen2020Synaptotagmin7).

## Interactions
Synaptotagmin 7 (SYT7) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in exocytosis and neurotransmitter release. SYT7 interacts with SNARE complexes, particularly with SNAP-23, which enhances the docking of SYT7-containing vesicles and influences fusion kinetics (MacDougall2018The). This interaction is distinct from that of synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1), which pairs with SNAP-25, highlighting the specificity of SYT7's role in vesicle fusion (MacDougall2018The).

SYT7 also interacts with phospholipid membranes, showing robust membrane penetration regardless of phospholipid acyl chain structure. This property is crucial for promoting the formation of large, stable fusion pores (Courtney2023Synaptotagmin7). The C2 domains of SYT7 bind anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate, which are essential for membrane fusion (MacDougall2018The).

SYT7's interactions with SNARE proteins and phospholipids are critical for its function as a high-affinity calcium sensor, facilitating asynchronous neurotransmitter release and other exocytosis processes (MacDougall2018The; Courtney2023Synaptotagmin7). These interactions underscore SYT7's role in regulating vesicle fusion and maintaining synaptic transmission.
