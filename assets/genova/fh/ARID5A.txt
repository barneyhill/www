# ARID5A

## Overview
ARID5A is a gene that encodes the AT-rich interaction domain 5A protein, which is a member of the ARID family of proteins known for their roles in DNA and RNA recognition. The ARID5A protein is characterized by its ability to bind both DNA and RNA, facilitated by its ARID domain and intrinsically disordered regions, which contribute to its function in transcriptional regulation and chromatin processing (von2024Arid5a). This protein is primarily located in the nucleus, where it co-localizes with heterochromatin, indicating its involvement in transcriptional repression and gene regulation (von2024Arid5a). ARID5A plays significant roles in various biological processes, including cartilage development, adipose tissue homeostasis, and immune regulation, by interacting with transcription factors and stabilizing mRNA (Chalise2019Feedback; Amano2011Arid5a). Its expression and function are implicated in several diseases, such as autoimmune disorders and cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Nyati2022Recent; Zhou2021Expression).

## Structure
The ARID5A protein is characterized by its ARID domain, which is central to its function in DNA and RNA recognition. The ARID domain is approximately 100 amino acids long and features a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif, which is crucial for DNA interaction. This motif includes helices H1 to H6, with the H5 helix acting as the DNA recognition helix (Korn2022Structures; von2024Arid5a). The ARID domain can be extended by additional helices at the N-terminal (H0) and C-terminal (H7), known as eARID, which can influence DNA-binding affinity and specificity (Korn2022Structures).

The ARID5A protein also contains intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) flanking the ARID domain. These IDRs contribute to the protein's ability to bind both DNA and RNA, enhancing its nucleic acid interaction capabilities (von2024Arid5a). The C-terminal IDR, in particular, plays a significant role in RNA interaction, suggesting its involvement in mRNA regulation (von2024Arid5a).

The ARID5A protein is primarily nuclear and co-localizes with heterochromatin, indicating a role in transcriptional repression (von2024Arid5a). The protein's structure and function are influenced by its domain architecture, which is less conserved compared to other ARID family members, reflecting its distinct roles in gene regulation (von2024Arid5a).

## Function
The ARID5A gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin processing. It is part of the ARID family of proteins, which are involved in DNA and RNA recognition. ARID5A is unique among ARID proteins due to its ability to bind both DNA and RNA, facilitated by disordered extensions of its core ARID domain. This dual binding capability allows ARID5A to participate in gene regulation by interacting with DNA/chromatin and protecting against mRNA degradation (von2024Arid5a).

In healthy human cells, ARID5A is active in the nucleus, where it co-localizes with heterochromatin, indicating its role in gene regulation. It interacts with transcription factors such as Sox9 to stimulate chondrocyte-specific transcription, which is essential for cartilage development (Amano2011Arid5a). ARID5A also plays a significant role in maintaining adipose tissue homeostasis by regulating energy metabolism and inhibiting the differentiation of fibroblasts into adipocytes. It represses the transcription of Ppar-γ2, a key facilitator of adipogenesis, thus influencing lipid metabolism and protecting against obesity (Chalise2019Feedback).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ARID5A gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly immune diseases and cancer. In immune diseases, ARID5A is crucial for the regulation of inflammatory responses. Its deficiency in mice has shown protective effects against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis, by reducing IL17-producing T cells and Stat3-regulated genes (Amatya2018IL-17; Nyati2022Recent). ARID5A also plays a role in acute lung injury (ALI) and septic shock, where its deficiency leads to reduced inflammation and proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting a protective role (Nyati2022Recent).

In cancer, ARID5A is associated with various types, including glioma, breast, pancreatic, lung, and colorectal cancer. In glioma, high ARID5A expression correlates with increased tumor malignancy and poor prognosis, particularly in higher WHO grades and IDH-wildtype gliomas (Zhou2021Expression). In lung cancer, ARID5A is involved in the transition of tumor-associated macrophages from an M1-like to an M2-like phenotype, promoting tumor progression (Nyati2022Recent). In breast cancer, lower ARID5A expression is linked to poor overall survival, indicating its prognostic value (Nyati2022Recent). These findings highlight ARID5A's role in cancer progression and immune regulation, making it a potential target for therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
ARID5A is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in immune regulation and mRNA stabilization. It binds to the 3′UTR of Stat3 mRNA, stabilizing it by preventing the binding of Regnase-1, an RNase that degrades mRNA. This interaction is facilitated by the residue R128 of ARID5A, which binds to a specific stem-loop region within the STAT3 3′UTR (Masuda2016Arid5a). ARID5A also interacts with the E3 ligase WWP1, which ubiquitinates ARID5A in response to TLR4-p38 signaling, affecting IL-6 mRNA stabilization (Nyati2017TLR4induced).

In the context of IL-17 signaling, ARID5A expression is enhanced and it associates with TRAF2, a protein involved in immune response pathways (Amatya2018IL-17). ARID5A also interacts with UPF1, a protein involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, suggesting a role in mRNA stability and decay processes (Higa2018Regulation). Additionally, ARID5A binds to both DNA and RNA, utilizing its ARID domain and disordered extensions to interact with nucleic acids, which may influence transcriptional regulation (von2024Arid5a).
