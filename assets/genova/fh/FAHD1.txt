# FAHD1

## Overview
FAHD1 is a gene that encodes the protein fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase domain containing 1, which is categorized as a mitochondrial enzyme. This protein plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism, particularly as an oxaloacetate decarboxylase, influencing the PEP-PYR-OAA node that connects glycolysis with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Heberle2024Mitochondrial). The enzymatic activity of FAHD1 is essential for modulating oxaloacetate levels, thereby impacting mitochondrial function and energy production. The protein's structure includes a fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase domain, which is vital for its metabolic functions. FAHD1 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including mitochondrial biogenesis, cellular senescence, and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Baraldo2019Modulation; Salti2021High).

## Structure
FAHD1 encodes a protein that contains a fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain is a key structural feature that contributes to the protein's function in metabolic processes. The primary structure of FAHD1 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-level structures. The secondary structure of the protein likely includes elements such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are common in proteins with enzymatic functions. These secondary elements contribute to the protein's overall stability and functionality.

The tertiary structure of FAHD1 involves the three-dimensional folding of its secondary elements, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This folding pattern allows the protein to maintain its functional conformation and interact with other molecules. While specific details about the quaternary structure are not provided, proteins with similar domains often function as monomers or form complexes with other proteins.

Post-translational modifications may influence the function and stability of FAHD1, although specific modifications are not detailed in the available information. Potential isoforms resulting from alternative splicing could also affect the protein's activity and interactions, contributing to its role in metabolic pathways.

## Function
FAHD1 is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a significant role in cellular metabolism by functioning as an oxaloacetate decarboxylase. This enzyme is involved in the regulation of the PEP-PYR-OAA node, a critical sub-cycle that connects glycolysis with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, influencing cellular energetics and mitochondrial function (Heberle2024Mitochondrial). FAHD1's activity helps modulate the levels of oxaloacetate, which affects the succinate dehydrogenase reaction and the generation of mitochondrial GDP from GTP, thereby impacting the TCA cycle flux (Heberle2024Mitochondrial).

In healthy human cells, FAHD1 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function, particularly in endothelial cells, where its depletion leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence (Salti2021High). The enzyme's role in reducing oxaloacetate levels is crucial for fine-tuning the TCA cycle, which is a central metabolic pathway for energy production and biosynthesis (Baraldo2019Modulation). FAHD1's activity is also linked to the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and function, as evidenced by its involvement in the metabolic shifts observed during the reprogramming and differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (Salti2021High).

## Clinical Significance
The FAHD1 gene has been implicated in several conditions related to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disorders. Alterations in FAHD1 expression or mutations can impact cellular metabolism, particularly in the context of cancer and aging. In osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, overexpression of FAHD1 has been shown to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. Variants of FAHD1, such as T192S, are associated with enhanced catalytic activity and increased resistance to oxidative stress, which may contribute to cancer resistance and longevity (Heberle2024Mitochondrial).

FAHD1 has also been studied in relation to Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), a mitochondrial disorder leading to vision loss. Variants in FAHD1 were identified as potential nuclear modifier genes that may influence the penetrance of LHON-associated mtDNA mutations, suggesting a role in maintaining essential mitochondrial functions (Cheng2022Candidate).

Disruption of FAHD1 activity can lead to impaired mitochondrial function, as evidenced by studies in model organisms like C. elegans, where FAHD1 deletion resulted in reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption, affecting locomotion and physical performance (Taferner2015FAH).
