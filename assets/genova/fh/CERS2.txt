# CERS2

## Overview
CERS2, or ceramide synthase 2, is a gene that encodes the enzyme ceramide synthase 2, a critical component in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids. This enzyme is categorized as an integral membrane protein and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. It is responsible for the synthesis of ceramides with very-long-chain fatty acids, such as C20-C26, which are essential for maintaining cellular membrane integrity and function (Mullen2012Ceramide; Spassieva2009Disruption). The CERS2 gene is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and apoptosis, and its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and protein interactions (Stiban2010Ceramide; Park2014Ceramide). Alterations in CERS2 expression or function have been linked to several diseases, including neurological disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Qian2020Ceramide; Imgrund2009Adult).

## Structure
Ceramide synthase 2 (CERS2) is a key enzyme in sphingolipid metabolism, responsible for synthesizing ceramides with very-long-chain fatty acids, such as C20-C26. The protein is an integral membrane protein localized primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope (Mullen2012Ceramide; Spassieva2009Disruption). CERS2 is predicted to have five to six transmembrane domains, with the N-terminus inside the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and the C-terminus in the cytosol (Stiban2010Ceramide; Park2014Ceramide).

CERS2 contains a Tram-Lag-CLN8 (TLC) domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This domain includes a conserved Lag1p motif essential for ceramide synthase function (Stiban2010Ceramide; Park2014Ceramide). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can modulate its activity (Stiban2010Ceramide; Park2014Ceramide). CERS2 is N-glycosylated, a modification that may influence its stability and function (Mullen2012Ceramide).

CERS2 has two transcript variants, resulting from alternative splicing events, which may lead to differences in its regulatory functions and tissue-specific expression (Mullen2012Ceramide). These structural features and modifications highlight the complexity and regulatory potential of CERS2 in cellular processes.

## Function
Ceramide synthase 2 (CERS2) is a crucial enzyme in the synthesis of very-long-chain ceramides, particularly those with C22 to C24 acyl chains. These ceramides are essential for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of cellular membranes, contributing to the formation of ordered membrane domains that are vital for proper membrane fluidity and the functioning of membrane-associated proteins (Park2014Ceramide). CERS2 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope, where it utilizes very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs to produce diverse ceramide and complex sphingolipid species (Spassieva2009Disruption).

In healthy human cells, CERS2 activity is critical for maintaining the balance of ceramide species, which is important for cellular homeostasis. This balance is necessary to prevent cellular dysfunction, as shifts in ceramide composition can lead to severe pathologies (Park2014Ceramide). CERS2 also plays a role in regulating cellular stress responses and cell death, influencing processes such as cell differentiation and apoptosis (Spassieva2009Disruption). The enzyme's activity is modulated by various mechanisms, including post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, ensuring its proper function in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Park2014Ceramide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CERS2 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In mice, CERS2 deficiency leads to myelin sheath defects, cerebellar degeneration, and hepatocarcinomas. These mice exhibit reduced levels of very long chain ceramides, which are crucial for maintaining myelin integrity and liver function (Imgrund2009Adult). In humans, a de novo heterozygous deletion of CERS2 has been associated with progressive myoclonic epilepsy, characterized by generalized tonic-clonic seizures, ataxia, and dysarthria. This condition is linked to decreased levels of very long chain ceramides and increased levels of long chain ceramides in fibroblasts (Astudillo2014Human; Dubot2019Inherited).

CERS2 is also implicated in cancer. It is known as the tumor metastasis suppressor gene 1 (TMSG1) and is involved in the synthesis of long acyl chain ceramides. Altered expression of CERS2 has been observed in various cancers, including liver, breast, and bladder cancers. In bladder cancer, low CERS2 expression is associated with poorer prognosis, while in non-small cell lung cancer, high CERS2 mRNA expression correlates with improved survival (Qian2020Ceramide; Aldoghachi2019Evaluation). These findings suggest that CERS2 plays a significant role in both neurological and oncological pathologies.

## Interactions
Ceramide synthase 2 (CERS2) is involved in several interactions with other proteins that influence its activity and function. CERS2 interacts with acyl-coa-binding protein (ACBP), forming a functional complex that enhances ceramide synthesis. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the levels of very-long-chain acyl-CoA substrates, which are preferred by CERS2 and CERS3. ACBP mutants that cannot bind ligands fail to stimulate ceramide synthase activity, highlighting the importance of this interaction (Ferreira2017Regulation).

CERS2 also interacts with elongation of very-long chain fatty acid protein 1 (ELOVL1), which is necessary for its full activity. This interaction affects the synthesis of C24-CoA, a substrate for ceramide production (Ferreira2017Regulation; Park2014Ceramide). Additionally, CERS2 activity is modulated by its interaction with other ceramide synthases, such as CERS5 and CERS6. Co-expression with these proteins enhances CERS2 activity, indicating a cooperative relationship (Park2014Ceramide).

CERS2 is also regulated by sphingosine-1-phosphate, which inhibits its activity through a receptor-like motif unique to CERS2 (Stiban2010Ceramide; Park2014Ceramide). These interactions underscore the complex regulatory network involving CERS2 in lipid metabolism.
