# INPP5K

## Overview
INPP5K is a gene that encodes the protein inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase K, a crucial enzyme involved in cellular signaling and homeostasis. This protein is categorized as a phosphatase and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in regulating ER morphology and function. It achieves this by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), which is essential for processes like membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal organization (Hathazi2021INPP5K; IJUIN2021PIP<sub>3</sub>). The protein's structure includes a catalytic 5-phosphatase domain and a C-terminal SKICH domain, which facilitate its interactions with microtubules and the ER membrane, respectively (Shukla2023Duplicated; IJUIN2021PIP<sub>3</sub>). Mutations in the INPP5K gene have been linked to congenital muscular dystrophy and other neuromuscular disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining proper cellular function and structure (Hathazi2021INPP5K; D’Amico2020A).

## Structure
The INPP5K protein, also known as skeletal muscle and kidney-enriched inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (SKIP), is characterized by a catalytic 5-phosphatase domain and a C-terminal SKICH domain. The 5-phosphatase domain, located between amino acids 16-318, is responsible for the enzyme's phosphatase activity, which involves dephosphorylating phosphoinositides such as PI(4,5)P2 and PIP3 (Shukla2023Duplicated; IJUIN2021PIP<sub>3</sub>). This domain contains basic amino acid clusters that facilitate interaction with tubulin, crucial for connecting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to microtubules and maintaining ER morphology (IJUIN2021PIP<sub>3</sub>).

The SKICH domain, spanning amino acids 321-448, is involved in anchoring the protein to the ER membrane through interaction with the ER membrane protein Arl6IP1 (Shukla2023Duplicated; IJUIN2021PIP<sub>3</sub>). This domain is also implicated in the protein's association with the plasma membrane following growth factor stimulation (Dyson2012Phosphoinositide).

Mutations in INPP5K, particularly those affecting the phosphatase domain, have been linked to congenital muscular dystrophy, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity for proper function (D’Amico2020A). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in cellular signaling and ER morphology.

## Function
INPP5K, also known as inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase K, is a crucial enzyme involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. It primarily resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in regulating ER morphology by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) (Hathazi2021INPP5K; sub&gt; IJUIN2021PIP&lt; 3&lt). This activity is essential for various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, and signal transduction.

INPP5K interacts with β-tubulin through its 5-phosphatase domain, which is crucial for its localization to microtubules and the ER. This interaction helps maintain ER morphology by connecting the ER to microtubules, preventing ER swelling and promoting the formation of ER tubules (sub&gt; IJUIN2021PIP&lt; 3&lt). The protein also interacts with the ER membrane protein Arl6IP1 via its C-terminal SKICH domain, anchoring it to the ER membrane (sub&gt; IJUIN2021PIP&lt; 3&lt).

INPP5K is involved in ER homeostasis functions, including calcium homeostasis, lipid transfer, and protein quality control. It is also associated with neuronal growth and regeneration, enhancing neurite outgrowth and branching in neurons (sub&gt; IJUIN2021PIP&lt; 3&lt). Its role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining proper cellular function and structure.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the INPP5K gene are associated with a syndromic form of congenital muscular dystrophy characterized by limb girdle muscle weakness, bilateral cataracts, short stature, and intellectual disability. Biallelic pathogenic variants, such as the missense variant c.67G > A (p.Val23Met), have been identified in patients, particularly from Southern Italy, suggesting a founder effect (D’Amico2020A). Other mutations, including p.Val23Ala and p.Leu55Phe, expand the mutational spectrum and are linked to congenital myopathy and mild intellectual disability (Hathazi2021INPP5K).

The clinical phenotype of INPP5K-related disorders overlaps with Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome (MSS), as both conditions can present with cerebellar degeneration and muscle weakness. However, the absence of cataracts in some patients differentiates these conditions (Hathazi2021INPP5K; Nelson2017A). INPP5K mutations are also implicated in defective lysosome reformation during autophagy, contributing to muscle disease (McGrath2021Defective). The gene's interaction with proteins like BiP and PHGDH suggests a common pathophysiological pathway with other neuromuscular diseases, potentially offering therapeutic targets (Hathazi2021INPP5K).

## Interactions
INPP5K, also known as inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase K, is involved in several protein interactions, particularly with components of the cytoskeleton and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A significant interaction is with β-tubulin, a protein associated with microtubule dynamics. This interaction was confirmed through immunoprecipitation assays, indicating that INPP5K partially co-localizes with tubulin at the cell periphery, suggesting a role in microtubule dynamics and ER morphology regulation (sub&gt; IJUIN2021PIP&lt; 3&lt).

INPP5K interacts with tubulin through its 5-phosphatase domain, which contains a cluster of basic amino acids. Although direct binding was not observed in vitro, this suggests possible indirect interactions or the need for posttranslational modifications. The SKICH domain of INPP5K is necessary for its localization to the ER and plasma membrane, facilitating its interaction with microtubules (sub&gt; IJUIN2021PIP&lt; 3&lt).

INPP5K also interacts with the ER membrane protein Arl6IP1 via its C-terminal SKICH domain. This interaction is crucial for anchoring INPP5K to the ER membrane. Mutations in INPP5K, such as the p.I363T mutant, disrupt its interaction with Arl6IP1, leading to ER swelling and defects in ER morphology (sub&gt; IJUIN2021PIP&lt; 3&lt).
