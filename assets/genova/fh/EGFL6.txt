# EGFL6

## Overview
EGFL6, or epidermal growth factor-like domain multiple 6, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, characterized by multiple EGF-like domains. These domains are integral to the protein's role in cell signaling and development, facilitating interactions that are crucial for various biological processes. The protein encoded by EGFL6 is involved in angiogenesis, osteogenesis, and adipose tissue function, acting through pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and interacting with receptors like EGFR and integrins. EGFL6's interactions and modifications, such as glycosylation, contribute to its functional diversity and adaptability in different physiological contexts. Clinically, EGFL6 is significant in cancer biology and vascular malformations, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and prognosis, making it a potential therapeutic target (Tang2020Thalidomide; Shen2021EGFL6; Garrett2024EGFL6).

## Structure
EGFL6 encodes a protein characterized by multiple EGF-like domains, which are crucial for its role in cell signaling and development. These domains are defined by a conserved sequence and structure that facilitate protein-protein interactions, contributing significantly to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures. The presence of these EGF-like domains suggests a complex folding pattern that is essential for the protein's functional conformation.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are likely to occur in EGFL6, impacting its function and stability. Glycosylation can influence the protein's folding, solubility, and interactions with other molecules, thereby playing a critical role in its biological activity.

EGFL6 is known to have splice variant isoforms, which can lead to structural and functional diversity. These isoforms may differ in the number or arrangement of EGF-like domains, potentially altering the protein's interaction capabilities and its role in cellular processes. The existence of these variants underscores the complexity and adaptability of EGFL6 in various physiological contexts. The structural diversity introduced by these isoforms allows EGFL6 to participate in a wide range of cellular functions, highlighting its importance in human biology.

## Function
EGFL6, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, plays a significant role in angiogenesis and osteogenesis, particularly through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In endothelial cells, EGFL6 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and capillary tube formation, enhancing angiogenic activity. This is evidenced by increased expression of angiogenesis-related factors such as VEGF-A, CD31, and EMCN, which are markers for type H vessels, crucial for bone homeostasis and regeneration (Shen2021EGFL6).

In bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), EGFL6 enhances osteogenic differentiation, increasing mineralization deposits and the expression of osteogenic markers like RUNX2, CXCR4, and BMP2. This process is mediated through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which influences the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts (Shen2021EGFL6).

EGFL6 is also involved in adipose tissue function, where its expression is associated with adipocyte size and differentiation. It is upregulated during adipocyte differentiation and is linked to pathways related to extracellular structural organization and angiogenesis, indicating its role in adipose tissue biology and function (Landgraf2022Transcriptome).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EGFL6 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and vascular malformations. In endometrial cancer, EGFL6 is upregulated, especially in copy-number high tumors, and is associated with poor prognosis. Its increased expression promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis. Knockdown of EGFL6 in endometrial cancer models has been shown to significantly restrict tumor growth, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Garrett2024EGFL6).

EGFL6 is also overexpressed in small bowel vascular malformation (SBVM), where it promotes angiogenesis, a critical process in the formation of new blood vessels. This overexpression is linked to the development and bleeding incidents in SBVM. The EGFL6/PAX6 axis plays a significant role in this angiogenesis, and thalidomide has been identified as a potential therapeutic agent that targets EGFL6 for degradation, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis in SBVM (Tang2020Thalidomide).

In congenital heart defects, particularly ventricular septal defects, EGFL6 has been identified as a candidate gene due to its involvement in cell cycle regulation and developmental processes. A de novo deletion involving EGFL6 has been associated with these defects, suggesting its potential role in heart development (An2015Genomewide).

## Interactions
EGFL6 interacts with several proteins and participates in various signaling pathways. It physically interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase cereblon (CRBN) as part of the CUL4-DDB1-CRBN ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction is enhanced by thalidomide, leading to the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFL6, which is crucial for thalidomide's anti-angiogenic effects (Tang2020Thalidomide). EGFL6 also interacts with the PAX6 protein, which is involved in angiogenesis and cell migration. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays (Tang2020Thalidomide).

In colorectal cancer, EGFL6 interacts with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and integrin receptors, particularly αvβ3 integrin. These interactions activate signaling pathways such as ERK and AKT, promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration (Sung2021EGFL6). EGFL6 also influences the phosphorylation of kinases like FAK and Src, which are involved in cell migration and invasion (Sung2021EGFL6).

In the context of ovarian cancer, EGFL6 interacts with β3 integrin, enhancing the migration of myeloid cells and promoting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This interaction is linked to the activation of signaling pathways involving Syk and p38 (Hamze2024Egfl6).
