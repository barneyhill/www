# FOXH1

## Overview
FOXH1, or forkhead box H1, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor protein belonging to the forkhead family, characterized by a distinct forkhead (FH) DNA-binding domain. This protein plays a pivotal role in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, particularly during embryonic development, by acting as a cofactor in the NODAL signaling pathway. The FOXH1 protein is integral to the regulation of gene expression necessary for the formation of mesoderm and endoderm, as well as the development of the heart and other axial structures. It achieves this by interacting with phosphorylated Smad proteins to modulate tissue-specific gene expression. Mutations in the FOXH1 gene have been associated with various developmental disorders, including congenital heart defects and holoprosencephaly, highlighting its clinical significance (Roessler2008Reduced; Pluta2022Molecular; Zhu2016Forkhead).

## Structure
The FOXH1 protein is characterized by a unique forkhead (FH) DNA-binding domain, which is essential for its function as a transcription factor. The FH domain of FOXH1 is larger than those found in other FOX proteins due to an extended fold that nearly doubles its length. This extended fold is crucial for DNA recognition, allowing interactions with both the major and minor grooves of DNA (Pluta2022Molecular). The core domain of FOXH1 consists of a three-helical bundle (H1-H2-H3) followed by a pair of antiparallel β strands (S1, S2), with additional regions including the N-terminal loop and an unusually long Wing2 (Pluta2022Molecular).

Specific amino acid modifications, such as Asp versus Asn and Leu/Ile versus Tyr, are critical for major groove recognition and binding to GG and GT sites. The Asp residue, in particular, forms hydrogen bonds with cytosine and adenine bases, enhancing DNA binding affinity (Pluta2022Molecular). The Wing2 region of FOXH1 is compact and well-structured, a form not observed in other FOX proteins, contributing to its unique DNA-binding properties (Pluta2022Molecular).

The FOXH1 protein also contains an engrailed homology 1 motif and a SMAD-interacting domain, which are important for its interactions with other proteins and regulatory elements (Pluta2022Molecular). The presence of these domains and specific structural features distinguishes FOXH1 from other members of the FOX family, allowing it to function effectively during embryonic development.

## Function
FOXH1 (forkhead box H1) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, particularly in the context of embryonic development. It functions as a cofactor in the NODAL signaling pathway, where it binds to Smad proteins to regulate tissue-specific gene expression. This interaction is essential for the transcriptional activation of target genes within the TGF-beta superfamily, which are crucial for proper tissue development (Roessler2008Reduced; Zhu2016Forkhead).

In healthy human cells, FOXH1 is involved in the regulation of gene expression necessary for mesoderm and endoderm formation. It binds to DNA at specific sites, modulating gene transcription primarily in the nucleus. The protein's activity is dependent on the presence of phosphorylated Smad proteins, which facilitate its DNA-binding capability and biological activity (Roessler2008Reduced).

FOXH1's role in cell biology includes its involvement in heart development, where it regulates the expression of genes critical for the formation of the anterior heart field, influencing the development of the right ventricle and outflow tract during heart looping (Zhu2016Forkhead). Its function is crucial for early embryonic patterning and organogenesis, ensuring proper development of axial structures and midline formation (Hoodless2001FoxH1(Fast) page 0 of 8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FOXH1 gene are associated with several developmental disorders and diseases. Variants in FOXH1 have been linked to congenital heart defects and holoprosencephaly (HPE), a condition characterized by the failure of the forebrain to properly divide into two hemispheres. Specific mutations such as P35L, V112M, and S113T in the forkhead domain of FOXH1 can affect its biological function, contributing to these conditions. The S113T variant is notably associated with both HPE and congenital heart defects like transposition of the great arteries (TGA) and tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) (Roessler2008Reduced).

The study of FOXH1 also highlights its role in the NODAL signaling pathway, where mutations can lead to reduced signaling strength, further implicating FOXH1 in congenital heart defects and HPE. These mutations are more frequently observed in patients with conotruncal heart defects compared to those with isolated laterality defects or HPE (Roessler2008Reduced).

In the context of cancer, FOXH1 is involved in mutant p53-driven myeloid leukemia. It acts as a critical effector of the p53 R172H mutation, promoting aberrant self-renewal in leukemic cells. This suggests a functional mutant p53-FOXH1 axis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where FOXH1 expression is upregulated, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Loizou2019A).

## Interactions
FOXH1 is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in embryonic development. It forms a complex with phosphorylated Smad2/3 (pSmad2/3) to act as a transcriptional activator for genes targeted by Nodal signaling, including Nodal itself, Lefty2, and Pitx2 (Halstead2015Disrupting). FOXH1 also interacts with the Groucho (Grg) co-repressors through its Engrailed homology-1 (EH1) motif, allowing it to toggle between transcriptional activation and repression (Halstead2015Disrupting).

In the context of human embryonic stem cells, FOXH1 associates with the SMAD2/3 complex, HEB, and E2A proteins. This interaction is independent of DNA binding, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Yoon2011HEB). FOXH1 also binds to DNA at specific forkhead binding sites, with a preference for GK and TT sites, and exhibits a higher affinity for mononucleosomes compared to linear DNA (Pluta2022Molecular).

The protein's interaction with Goosecoid (Gsc) is essential for the repression of Mixl1 expression during early mouse development. FOXH1 recruits Gsc to the Mixl1 promoter, facilitating transcriptional repression through the recruitment of histone deacetylases (Izzi2007Foxh1).
