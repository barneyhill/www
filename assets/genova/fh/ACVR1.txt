# ACVR1

## Overview
The ACVR1 gene encodes the activin A receptor type 1, also known as activin receptor-like kinase 2 (ALK2), which is a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor. This protein is a critical component of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily signaling pathways, particularly the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway, which is essential for various developmental and physiological processes, including bone and cartilage formation, as well as organ development (Katagiri2021Accumulated; Giacopelli2013Identification). The ACVR1 protein functions by forming receptor complexes with type II receptors, facilitating the phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules that regulate gene expression (Valer2019ACVR1). Mutations in the ACVR1 gene have been linked to several disorders, most notably fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) and certain cancers, due to aberrant signaling activity (Kaplan2008Classic; Valer2019ACVR1). The study of ACVR1 continues to provide insights into its role in both normal physiology and disease pathogenesis.

## Structure
The ACVR1 protein, also known as Activin receptor-like kinase 2 (ALK2), is a transmembrane protein composed of 509 amino acids. It is structured into several key domains: a signal peptide (amino acids 1-20), an extracellular ligand-binding domain (amino acids 21-123), a transmembrane domain (amino acids 124-146), a glycine/serine (GS) domain (amino acids 178-207), and an intracellular kinase domain (amino acids 208-502) (Katagiri2021Accumulated). The GS domain acts as a regulatory switch for the kinase, serving as a phosphorylation site by type II receptors, which activates the kinase activity of type I receptors, including ACVR1 (Katagiri2021Accumulated).

The ACVR1 protein is involved in various biological activities, such as embryonic development and tissue maintenance, through its interaction with ligands of the TGF-β family (Katagiri2021Accumulated). Mutations in the ACVR1 gene, such as the p.R206H mutation, are associated with disorders like fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) (Katagiri2021Accumulated). The kinase activity of ACVR1 is regulated by FKBP12, which suppresses its activity (Katagiri2021Accumulated). The protein's structure is highly conserved across vertebrates, with significant homology observed between human and mouse ALK2/ACVR1 proteins (Katagiri2021Accumulated).

## Function
The ACVR1 gene encodes the activin receptor-like kinase 2 (ALK2), a type I receptor in the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family, which plays a crucial role in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for various cellular processes, including bone and cartilage development, as well as the development of organs such as the heart, brain, and lungs (Katagiri2021Accumulated; Giacopelli2013Identification). In healthy human cells, ALK2/ACVR1 functions as a transmembrane receptor that binds to BMPs, leading to the phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules like Smad1 and Smad5, which are involved in regulating gene expression related to cell growth and differentiation (Katagiri2021Accumulated).

The protein consists of several domains, including a signal peptide, an extramembrane ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, a glycine/serine (GS) domain, and an intracellular kinase domain. The GS domain acts as a regulatory switch for the kinase activity, maintaining the receptor in an inactive state until activated by ligand binding (Katagiri2021Accumulated). Proper functioning of ALK2/ACVR1 is essential for normal skeletal development and tissue maintenance, as it ensures balanced BMP signaling (Mura2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACVR1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. One of the most notable is fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification, where soft tissues transform into bone. The most common mutation in FOP is c.617G>A, resulting in the R206H variant, which enhances receptor signaling and leads to the disease's characteristic symptoms (Kaplan2008Classic; Hatsell2015ACVR1).

ACVR1 mutations are also implicated in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), a pediatric brainstem tumor. These mutations, found in 20-32% of DIPG cases, often co-occur with other genetic alterations and lead to increased BMP signaling (Pacifici2016Common; Valer2019ACVR1).

In cardiac development, ACVR1 mutations can result in congenital heart defects, such as atrioventricular septum defects. Specific mutations like ACVR1-L343P and H286N affect protein structure and kinase activity, disrupting normal heart morphogenesis (Valer2019ACVR1).

ACVR1 is also involved in various cancers. In ovarian cancer, it interacts with stress-induced phosphoprotein 1, promoting cancer cell proliferation, while in prostate cancer, it can either inhibit or promote cell migration depending on its interactions (Valer2019ACVR1).

## Interactions
The ACVR1 protein, also known as activin A receptor type 1, is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate its signaling pathways. ACVR1 forms heterotetrameric receptor complexes with type II receptors such as BMPR2, ACVR2A, and ACVR2B. These complexes consist of two type I and two type II receptors, which are essential for ligand binding and subsequent signal transduction (Valer2019ACVR1). 

A key interaction of ACVR1 is with FKBP12, a cytoplasmic FK506-binding protein that acts as a negative regulator by binding to the GS domain of type I BMP receptors, including ACVR1. This binding suppresses kinase activity and prevents leaky activation in the absence of a ligand. Mutations in ACVR1, such as R206H, can impair FKBP12 binding, leading to dysregulated signaling (Chaikuad2012Structure; Valer2019ACVR1).

In the context of cancer, ACVR1 interacts with stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) in ovarian cancer, promoting SMAD1/5 phosphorylation and cancer cell proliferation. In prostate cancer, ACVR1 interacts with endoglin, modulating TGFβ responses and affecting cell migration (Valer2019ACVR1). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of ACVR1 in cellular signaling and disease.
