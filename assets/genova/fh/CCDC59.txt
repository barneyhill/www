# CCDC59

## Overview
CCDC59, or coiled-coil domain containing 59, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains. These domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for various cellular processes. The CCDC59 protein plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis by participating in the early stages of pre-rRNA processing, essential for the synthesis and stability of pre-rRNA intermediates (Tafforeau2013The). Beyond its involvement in ribosome assembly, CCDC59 is implicated in transcription regulation, mRNA trafficking, and cytoskeleton organization, highlighting its multifaceted role in maintaining cellular architecture (Chiarelli2019Molecular). Clinically, CCDC59 has been associated with genetic studies indicating its potential involvement in autosomal recessive diseases and cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression levels correlate with patient prognosis (Oddsson2023Deficit; Li2023Identification).

## Structure


## Function
CCDC59 is involved in the early stages of pre-rRNA processing, which is crucial for ribosome biogenesis in human cells. The depletion of CCDC59 leads to a downregulation of 47S, 45S, and 41S pre-rRNA intermediates, indicating its role in the synthesis or stability of these intermediates (Tafforeau2013The). This suggests that CCDC59 is essential for the proper processing of pre-rRNA, a critical step in the formation of functional ribosomes, which are necessary for protein synthesis.

In addition to its role in ribosome biogenesis, CCDC59 has been identified as having a strong deficit of homozygosity in a large cohort study, suggesting its importance in early development and potential involvement in autosomal recessive diseases (Oddsson2023Deficit). This indicates that CCDC59 may be essential for viability, as evidenced by its association with embryonic lethality in animal models.

Furthermore, CCDC59 is down-regulated in classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (cEDS) patients, where it is involved in transcription regulation and other cellular processes such as mRNA trafficking and cytoskeleton organization (Chiarelli2019Molecular). This highlights its potential role in maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating protein-protein interactions.

## Clinical Significance
CCDC59 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in relation to genetic and cancer studies. A study by Oddsson et al. identified CCDC59 as one of the genes with a significant deficit of homozygosity, suggesting its potential role in recessive lethality. This indicates that variants in CCDC59 may be crucial for early development and viability, although no specific Mendelian diseases have been directly associated with it (Oddsson2023Deficit). A specific splice donor variant in CCDC59, c.561_564+4delACAAGTAA, was found to cause exon skipping and a frameshift, leading to significant changes in gene expression, though it is not linked to any specific diseases (Oddsson2023Deficit).

In the context of cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CCDC59 is part of a group of coiled-coil domain-containing genes that are upregulated in tumors. High expression levels of CCDC59 are associated with poor overall survival in HCC patients. The gene is part of a prognostic model, the CCDC score, which correlates with activation of the hypoxia pathway and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, suggesting its role in cancer progression and as a potential therapeutic target (Li2023Identification).
