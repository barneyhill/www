# ANKRD40CL

## Overview
ANKRD40CL is a gene that encodes the ANKRD40 C-terminal like protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains. These domains are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the ANKRD40 C-terminal like protein may play a role in cellular signaling pathways or structural organization within the cell. While the specific biological functions of ANKRD40CL remain to be fully elucidated, its structural features imply potential involvement in various cellular processes. Further research is needed to determine its precise role and any implications in human health and disease.
