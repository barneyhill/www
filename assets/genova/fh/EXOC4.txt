# EXOC4

## Overview
EXOC4 is a gene that encodes the protein exocyst complex component 4, also known as Sec8, which is a vital part of the exocyst complex. This complex is integral to vesicle trafficking, particularly in the tethering of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes such as exocytosis, cell growth, and neuronal development. The protein encoded by EXOC4 is characterized by its interactions with other exocyst components and various cellular proteins, facilitating its involvement in maintaining cell polarity and synaptic function. EXOC4 is notably expressed in the brain and placenta, where it contributes to neuronal development and polarized secretion, respectively (Cullell2022Altered; Gonzalez2014Exocyst).

## Structure
EXOC4, also known as Sec8, is a crucial component of the exocyst complex, which plays a significant role in vesicle trafficking. The primary structure of EXOC4 is defined by its specific amino acid sequence, which dictates its function and interactions within the cell. The secondary structure of EXOC4 includes characteristic alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation.

The tertiary structure of EXOC4 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with other components of the exocyst complex. This folding is critical for the protein's ability to participate in the precise docking and fusion of vesicles with target membranes. The quaternary structure of EXOC4 is characterized by its interaction with other proteins within the exocyst complex, facilitating the assembly and function of this multi-protein complex.

Post-translational modifications of EXOC4, such as phosphorylation, may influence its activity and localization within the cell, affecting its role in vesicle trafficking. Additionally, splice variants of EXOC4 may exist, potentially leading to isoforms with distinct functional properties or localization patterns. These structural and functional attributes underscore the importance of EXOC4 in cellular processes related to vesicle transport.

## Function
The EXOC4 gene encodes a subunit of the exocyst complex, a crucial protein complex involved in the tethering of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane. This complex plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including exocytosis, cell growth, cytokinesis, and neuronal development. EXOC4 is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in axon growth cones and dendritic branches, highlighting its importance in neuronal development and synaptic function (Cullell2022Altered).

In the context of cellular function, the exocyst complex, including EXOC4, is involved in the regulation and coordination of endocytosis and exocytosis, which are essential for maintaining cell polarity and other cellular functions. EXOC4 is also implicated in the synaptic targeting and insertion of glutamate receptors, which are vital for synaptic function and plasticity (Cullell2022Altered).

In the human placenta, EXOC4 is part of the exocyst complex that regulates polarized secretion through vesicular trafficking, tethering, and fusion. It is predominantly expressed in syncytiotrophoblast cells, where it facilitates the delivery of Golgi-derived secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, contributing to cell growth, division, polarization, and motility (Gonzalez2014Exocyst).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the EXOC4 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D), polymorphisms near the EXOC4 gene on chromosome 7q32 have been linked to the disease and fasting glucose levels. Specifically, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12531707, located in an intron of EXOC4, is significantly associated with an increased risk of diabetes, with an odds ratio of 1.79 (p = 0.009) under a dominant model of the minor allele. Conversely, the SNP rs7457999, which is in linkage disequilibrium with a deletion polymorphism, shows a protective effect against diabetes (Laramie2008Polymorphisms).

In stroke outcomes, altered DNA methylation patterns in the EXOC4 gene have been implicated. Higher methylation at the cg00039070 site within EXOC4 is associated with decreased gene expression and worse stroke outcomes. This methylation pattern is enriched for brain-specific regulatory signals, suggesting a role in specific brain regions. The study indicates that these epigenetic modifications may affect the regulation of glutamate receptors, which are involved in excitotoxicity during stroke, potentially influencing the neurological course of stroke patients (Cullell2022Altered).

## Interactions
EXOC4, also known as Sec8, is a component of the exocyst complex, which is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with multiple proteins. EXOC4 interacts with other exocyst components such as Sec6, Exo70, and Sec10, with Sec10 being its strongest binding partner (Tanaka2016Diverse). It also binds to IQGAP1, a scaffold protein involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation, and SH3BP1, a negative regulator of Rac1, which is crucial for cell migration (Zago2017A). 

In the context of neuronal function, EXOC4 interacts with NCAM140, promoting its recruitment to the growth cone plasma membrane, and with atypical PKC protein PAR-3, essential for neuronal polarization and cell polarity (Tanaka2016Diverse). It also plays a role in synaptic plasticity by binding to PSD95 and competing with cypin for this interaction (Tanaka2016Diverse).

EXOC4 is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion by interacting with MyRIP, linking protein kinase A to the exocyst complex (Tanaka2016Diverse). In the context of HIV-1 pathogenesis, EXOC4 interacts with the Nef protein, suggesting a role in enhancing intercellular nanotube formation (Mukerji2012Proteomic).
