# PRSS58

## Overview
PRSS58 is a gene that encodes the protein serine protease 58, which is a member of the serine protease family. Serine proteases are a class of enzymes known for their role in catalyzing the cleavage of peptide bonds in proteins, a process that is critical for numerous physiological functions, including digestion, immune response, and blood coagulation. The PRSS58 gene is expressed in various tissues, and its encoded protein is involved in specific proteolytic activities that contribute to cellular and molecular processes. Understanding the structure and function of serine protease 58 can provide insights into its role in health and disease, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target.
