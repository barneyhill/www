# CEP85

## Overview
CEP85, or centrosomal protein 85, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in the process of centriole duplication, a critical step in cell division. The protein encoded by CEP85 is categorized as a centrosomal protein and is integral to the proper functioning of centrosomes, which are key organelles involved in organizing microtubules and ensuring accurate cell cycle progression. The CEP85 protein interacts directly with the N-terminal domain of the STIL protein, facilitating its recruitment to centrosomes and promoting the activation of PLK4, a kinase essential for centriole assembly (Liu2018Direct). This interaction is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of centrioles, thereby ensuring proper cell division and stability. Mutations or dysregulation of CEP85 have been linked to various clinical conditions, particularly those affecting neuronal development, such as lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia, highlighting its significance in both cellular and developmental contexts (Contrò2021Posterior; Tsai2020Pathogenic).

## Structure
The CEP85 protein is characterized by its interaction with the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the STIL protein, which is crucial for centriole assembly. The binding region of CEP85 is located within a coiled-coil domain in its C-terminal region, known as cc4. This domain forms a parallel coiled-coil dimer, stabilized by hydrophobic residue packing, and has a binding affinity with STIL's NTD of approximately 14-65 μM (Liu2018Direct). The interaction between CEP85 and STIL occurs in a 2:2 binding ratio, with one STIL NTD bound to each of the two coiled-coil strands of the CEP85 dimer. This interaction is facilitated by subdomain 1 of STIL, particularly involving the β-barrel capping helix and the crossover hairpin-loop (Liu2018Direct).

The structural integrity of the CEP85 coiled-coil region is maintained by additional sidechain-sidechain hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. Key residues involved in this interaction include L47 and R50 in STIL and Q640 and E644 in CEP85. Mutations in these residues significantly reduce binding affinity, highlighting their importance in the protein's function (Liu2018Direct). The structural data suggest that the CEP85-STIL interaction is essential for PLK4 activation and efficient centriole assembly (Liu2018Direct).

## Function
CEP85 (centrosomal protein 85) is a crucial component in the process of centriole duplication, which is essential for proper cell division. It functions by directly interacting with the N-terminal domain of the protein STIL, stabilizing it and facilitating its recruitment to centrosomes. This interaction is vital for the activation of PLK4, a kinase critical for centriole assembly (Liu2018Direct). The binding between CEP85 and STIL occurs in a 2:2 stoichiometry, with each STIL NTD interacting with both helices of the CEP85 coiled-coil dimer, a process stabilized by hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (Liu2018Direct).

CEP85 is necessary for maintaining adequate levels of STIL, which is required for centriole duplication. Depletion of CEP85 results in decreased cellular levels of STIL, indicating its role in stabilizing STIL for centriole biogenesis (Liu2018Direct). The interaction between CEP85 and STIL is also essential for the robust activation of PLK4, ensuring efficient centriole assembly and proper cell cycle progression (Liu2018Direct). CEP85 localizes near CEP192 at the proximal end of mother centrioles during interphase and associates with STIL during S-phase, highlighting its role in the spatiotemporal regulation of centriole duplication (Liu2018Direct).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP85 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving neuronal development and function. Alterations in CEP85 expression or function can lead to significant clinical outcomes due to its role in centrosome function and cell cycle regulation. In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, CEP85 mutations have been associated with lissencephaly, a condition characterized by a smooth brain surface due to abnormal neuronal migration. This condition can manifest as posterior predominant lissencephaly, which is linked to developmental delays, intractable epilepsy, and intellectual disabilities (Tsai2020Pathogenic).

CEP85 mutations can also result in subcortical band heterotopia, a condition where neurons are improperly positioned, leading to a "double cortex" appearance on brain imaging. This is often associated with epilepsy and varying degrees of intellectual disability (Contrò2021Posterior). The pathogenic variants in CEP85 are often clustered in a constrained coding region that is highly intolerant to missense variation, suggesting a critical role in maintaining normal protein function (Tsai2020Pathogenic).

In addition to its role in neurodevelopmental disorders, CEP85 dysregulation has been studied in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, where its misregulation may contribute to cell destabilization and death (ValdebenitoMaturana2021Locusspecific).

## Interactions
CEP85 (centrosomal protein 85) is involved in several critical protein interactions that are essential for centriole duplication and centrosome function. One of the primary interactions of CEP85 is with the protein STIL. CEP85 directly binds to the N-terminal domain of STIL, a crucial interaction for the activation of PLK4 kinase and efficient centriole assembly. This binding is dependent on the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of CEP85, specifically the cc4 domain, and involves a 2:2 binding ratio with STIL (Liu2018Direct).

Mutations in CEP85, such as Q640A and E644A, impair its ability to recruit STIL to microtubules, highlighting the importance of these residues in the interaction. Similarly, mutations in STIL, like L64A and R67A, reduce its binding to CEP85, affecting centriole localization and biogenesis (Liu2018Direct).

CEP85 also interacts with NEK2, a kinase involved in centrosome disjunction, and is implicated in regulating the centriole duplication network. This interaction suggests that CEP85 acts as a positive regulator of centriole duplication, influencing the recruitment and activation of other centrosomal proteins (Liu2018Direct). Additionally, CEP85 has been identified as an interactor of MOSPD1 and MOSPD3, which are involved in forming membrane contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles (James2021The).
