# PSCA

## Overview
The PSCA gene encodes the prostate stem cell antigen, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes such as signaling, proliferation, and adhesion. This protein is primarily expressed in prostate tissue but is also found in other tissues, including the kidney, bladder, and gastric mucosa. As a member of the Thy-1/Ly-6 family, PSCA is characterized by its cysteine-rich structure, which contributes to its function in cell adhesion and signaling pathways. Notably, PSCA is implicated in various cancers, including prostate, bladder, gastric, and pancreatic cancers, where its expression levels and genetic polymorphisms are associated with disease progression and risk. Due to its limited expression in normal tissues and overexpression in certain cancers, PSCA is considered a promising target for antibody-based therapies and a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis (Nayerpour2024Significance; Olafsen2007Targeting).

## Structure
The prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface protein primarily expressed in prostate tissue. It is a cysteine-rich glycoprotein consisting of 123 amino acids, which makes it a suitable target for antibody-based therapies due to its expression in prostate cancer and limited expression in normal tissues (Olafsen2007Targeting). The primary structure of PSCA includes a sequence of amino acids that contribute to its role in cell adhesion and signaling.

While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of PSCA are not provided in the context, it is known that PSCA is related to the Thy-1/Ly-6 family, which often features structural motifs such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Olafsen2007Targeting).

PSCA shares approximately 30% homology with stem cell antigen-2, indicating some structural similarities that may be relevant for its function and potential as a therapeutic target (DONG2013Expression). However, specific domains or prominent folds within the PSCA protein are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The PSCA (prostate stem cell antigen) gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface protein that is involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in the basal cells of the prostate, which are considered progenitor cells necessary for the differentiation of secretory cells (Nayerpour2024Significance). PSCA is also expressed in other tissues, including the kidney, bladder, gastric mucosa, colon, pancreas, brain, gallbladder, oral squamous cells, and esophagus (Nayerpour2024Significance).

The PSCA protein is implicated in cellular signaling, cell proliferation, and cell cycle regulation. It may form complexes with other proteins to activate downstream targets and has extracellular receptors that bind to TGFβ, playing a role in key cellular functions (Nayerpour2024Significance). In the prostate, PSCA expression is regulated by androgen interaction, with the androgen receptor influencing its expression through an androgen-responsive element (Nayerpour2024Significance).

In gastric tissues, PSCA is considered a tumor suppressor, as it is down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues, suggesting it prevents excessive cell proliferation (Nayerpour2024Significance). The protein's expression in normal tissues, such as the gastric mucosa, indicates its role in maintaining cellular differentiation and tissue homeostasis (Zhang2015The).

## Clinical Significance
The PSCA (prostate stem cell antigen) gene is implicated in various cancers due to mutations, expression alterations, and interactions with other cellular components. In prostate cancer, PSCA is overexpressed in cancerous tissues and is associated with tumor grade, stage, and progression to androgen independence, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Nayerpour2024Significance). In bladder cancer, PSCA expression is higher in tumors compared to normal tissue, particularly in carcinoma in situ, and is linked to tumor grade and differentiation. The rs2294008 polymorphism affects PSCA expression and is associated with bladder cancer risk, especially in Asian and Caucasian populations (Nayerpour2024Significance).

In gastric cancer, PSCA acts as a tumor suppressor with low expression levels in tumor tissues. Polymorphisms such as rs2294008 and rs2976392 are associated with increased gastric cancer risk, particularly in certain populations (Nayerpour2024Significance). In breast cancer, PSCA expression is linked to undesirable histopathological grades and increased proliferation activity, correlating with Her2/neu receptor status (Nayerpour2024Significance). PSCA is also overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, where its expression is associated with tumor size and nodal metastasis, suggesting potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications (Nayerpour2024Significance).

## Interactions
Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA) is involved in several protein interactions that influence prostate cancer progression. PSCA promotes the adhesion of prostate cancer cells to bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs) by upregulating integrin alpha 4 (ITGA4) expression through the activation of NF-kB transcriptional activity. NF-kB binds to the ITGA4 promoter, enhancing its transcription, which is crucial for cell adhesion (Zhao2020A). 

Progranulin (PGRN) has been identified as a potential interacting partner of PSCA. Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that PGRN interacts specifically with PSCA in prostate cancer cells. This interaction was confirmed through Western blotting and Co-IP assays. PGRN is known to regulate cellular proliferation and invasion and is expressed at higher levels in prostate cancer cells compared to normal prostate tissue. The interaction between PSCA and PGRN enhances ITGA4 expression and cell adhesion through NF-kB, suggesting that PGRN cooperates with PSCA to regulate these processes (Zhao2020A).

These interactions highlight the role of PSCA in prostate cancer metastasis, particularly to bone, and suggest that the PSCA/PGRN axis could be a therapeutic target for prostate cancer (Zhao2020A).
