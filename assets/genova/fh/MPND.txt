# MPND

## Overview
The MPND gene encodes the MPN domain-containing protein, which is categorized as a deubiquitinase. This protein is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), a critical pathway for protein degradation and regulation within the cell. The MPN domain, a defining feature of the protein, facilitates protein-protein interactions and is often implicated in the formation of multiprotein complexes. MPND has been identified in studies as interacting with the E7 oncoprotein of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16), although this interaction is relatively weak compared to others within the UPS (Poirson2017Mapping). Additionally, MPND has been suggested as a potential deubiquitinating enzyme involved in oncogenic processes, such as the modulation of the PLZF/RARA fusion protein, although its precise role in these contexts remains to be fully elucidated (Clague2013Deubiquitylases; Yang2012The).

## Interactions
MPND, a protein encoded by the MPND gene, is involved in interactions with the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). In a study mapping the interactions of HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins with UPS components, MPND was identified as a deubiquitinase that interacts with the E7 protein. This interaction was characterized as weaker compared to other interactions observed in the study, suggesting a potential but less prominent role in the UPS interactions with HPV16 E7 (Poirson2017Mapping).

The MPN domain, which is a characteristic feature of MPND, is known for its role in protein-protein interactions, often participating in multiprotein complexes. Although specific interactions involving MPND were not detailed in other studies, the MPN domain is generally associated with roles in protein degradation pathways and cellular signaling processes (Clague2013Deubiquitylases).

In the context of oncogenic regulation, MPND was identified as a candidate deubiquitinating enzyme in a study screening for modulators of the PLZF/RARA fusion protein, although its specific role in this context was not further elaborated (Yang2012The).
