# OR1E1

## Overview
The OR1E1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily E member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure and are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. The OR1E1 protein is part of a large family of olfactory receptors that are responsible for the recognition and transduction of odorant signals through G-protein-mediated pathways. While primarily associated with olfactory function, emerging research suggests that OR1E1 may have additional roles in the brain and other tissues, potentially influencing neurological conditions and cancer metastasis (Li2021RTP4; Wang2009A; GarciaEsparcia2013Functional).

## Clinical Significance
The OR1E1 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in several conditions due to its altered expression. In Parkinson's disease (PD), OR1E1 is notably downregulated in the frontal cortex, suggesting a potential role in the nonmotor symptoms of PD, such as impaired olfaction. This downregulation indicates that OR1E1, along with other olfactory receptors, may have novel physiological functions in the cerebral cortex that are disrupted in PD (GarciaEsparcia2013Functional).

In the context of Aicardi syndrome, a study identified a copy number variation (CNV) involving a loss on chromosome 17 that includes the OR1E1 gene. Although the study aimed to identify genetic alterations associated with Aicardi syndrome, it did not provide specific information on diseases directly caused by mutations in OR1E1 (Wang2009A).

Additionally, OR1E1 has been noted in research on cutaneous melanoma, where its expression was highlighted in the comparison of metastatic tumors with primary tumors, suggesting a potential role in tumor metastasis (Li2021RTP4). However, the specific clinical implications of OR1E1 mutations in melanoma remain to be fully elucidated.
