# KLF4

## Overview
KLF4 (Kruppel-like factor 4) is a gene that encodes a zinc finger transcription factor, which is a member of the Sp/KLF family of transcription factors. The KLF4 protein is characterized by its three C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which enable it to bind to GC/GT-rich regions of DNA and regulate gene expression. This transcription factor is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and plays a critical role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and integrity. KLF4 is highly expressed in differentiated epithelial cells and is essential for embryonic development and stem cell biology, particularly in maintaining pluripotency and reprogramming somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. Clinically, KLF4 is significant due to its dual role as a tumor suppressor and promoter in different cancer types, such as gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancers, and its involvement in ocular surface integrity (Swamynathan2007Conditional; Li2012Deficiency; He2023KLF4).

## Structure
KLF4 is a transcription factor characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for its DNA-binding function. The primary structure of KLF4 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with three C2H2-type zinc finger domains located at the C-terminus. These zinc fingers are responsible for binding to GC/GT-rich regions of DNA, facilitating transcription regulation (Alawad2016Molecular; Schuetz2011The).

The secondary structure of KLF4 features a conserved ββα structure within each zinc finger, which is typical of the Sp/KLF superfamily (Schuetz2011The). The tertiary structure is stabilized by the coordination of zinc ions, which are bound by cysteine and histidine residues within the zinc fingers (Schuetz2011The).

KLF4's quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed in the provided context, but its functional domains include an N-terminal poly proline and acidic amino acid stretch, an inhibitory region, and a nuclear localization signal sequence (Schuetz2011The). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context. KLF4 also has several splice variant isoforms, which can influence its function and localization (Liu2014Structural).

## Function
KLF4 (Kruppel-like factor 4) is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to modulate the transcription of target genes (He2023KLF4). KLF4 is crucial in maintaining cellular functions and is involved in embryonic development, tissue maturation, and the maintenance of normal tissue homeostasis (Li2012Deficiency).

In healthy human cells, KLF4 is highly expressed in differentiated epithelial cells, such as those in the skin and gastrointestinal tract, where it regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, including CDKN1A (p21), cyclin D1, and cyclin B. This regulation leads to cell cycle arrest and inhibition of cell proliferation, highlighting its role in maintaining tissue integrity and preventing uncontrolled cell growth (Li2012Deficiency).

KLF4 also plays a role in stem cell biology by inhibiting embryonic stem cell differentiation and enhancing self-renewal capacity. It is involved in the reprogramming of adult somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, contributing to the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency (Li2012Deficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KLF4 gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In gastrointestinal cancers, such as colorectal, gastric, and esophageal cancers, KLF4 often acts as a tumor suppressor. Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 9q31, where KLF4 is located, is frequently observed, leading to reduced or lost expression of KLF4. This downregulation is associated with increased cellular proliferation and malignant transformation (Wei2005Emerging). In colorectal cancer, KLF4 expression is typically reduced, correlating with increased tumor growth and poor prognosis. It inhibits cell proliferation by upregulating N-Myc downstream regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) and repressing GINS complex subunit 4 (GINS4) (TarachaWisniewska2020Recent).

KLF4 also plays a role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and promoter, depending on the context. Its expression decreases with increasing tumor malignancy, and low levels are associated with poor prognosis (He2023KLF4). In ocular conditions, the conditional deletion of KLF4 in mice leads to corneal epithelial fragility and stromal edema, suggesting its importance in maintaining ocular surface integrity (Swamynathan2007Conditional).

## Interactions
KLF4 is a transcription factor that engages in various physical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. KLF4 directly interacts with the transcription factors Oct4 and Sox2, forming a complex essential for the reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal zinc finger motifs of KLF4, which are crucial for binding to Oct4 and Sox2 (Wei2009Klf4).

KLF4 also interacts with Tip60, a potential corepressor, through its middle region. This interaction is confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays and is involved in the regulation of the hdc promoter activity (Ai2007Tip60). KLF4 can disrupt Tip60-mediated transcriptional activation, indicating a functional interaction that influences gene expression (Ai2007Tip60).

In the context of chromosomal interactions, KLF4 is involved in organizing long-range interactions with the Oct4 locus in embryonic stem cells. It recruits the cohesin complex to the Oct4 enhancer region, facilitating DNA looping necessary for chromosomal interactions (Wei2013Klf4).

KLF4's stability and function are regulated by PRMT5-mediated arginine methylation, which affects its ubiquitylation by VHL. This interplay is crucial for maintaining genome stability and cellular response to genotoxic stress (Hu2015Interplay).
