# RNPC3

## Overview
RNPC3 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding region (RNP1, RRM) containing 3 protein, also known as the U11/U12-65K protein. This protein is a critical component of the U12-dependent spliceosome, a specialized molecular machinery responsible for the splicing of minor class introns in pre-mRNA. The RNPC3 protein is categorized as an RNA-binding protein due to its two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which facilitate its interaction with small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) involved in the splicing process. The proper function of RNPC3 is essential for the maturation of mRNA transcripts, influencing gene expression and cellular processes such as DNA replication, RNA processing, and cell cycle regulation. Mutations in the RNPC3 gene can lead to significant clinical conditions, including congenital hypopituitarism and growth hormone deficiencies, and have been implicated in cancer pathogenesis (Bezen2022A; Doggett2018Early; Doggett2021The).

## Function
The RNPC3 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the U12-dependent spliceosome, which is responsible for the splicing of minor class introns in pre-mRNA. This process is crucial for the proper maturation of mRNA transcripts, influencing gene expression and cellular function. The RNPC3 protein, also known as the U11/U12-65K protein, plays a significant role in RNA processing by forming a molecular bridge that facilitates the splicing of U12-type introns, which are rare but essential for various biological pathways, including the cell cycle, DNA replication and repair, and RNA processing (Doggett2018Early; Doggett2021The).

In healthy human cells, RNPC3 is active in the nucleus, where it ensures the correct expression of minor intron-containing genes (MIGs). These genes are involved in critical cellular processes such as DNA replication, RNA processing, and cell cycle regulation. The proper functioning of RNPC3 is particularly important in tissues with rapid and continuous cell cycling, such as the gastrointestinal epithelium and hematopoietic compartment (Doggett2021The). Disruption of RNPC3 function can lead to the accumulation of aberrant pre-mRNA transcripts, potentially resulting in frameshifts, premature stop codons, and truncated proteins, which can severely affect cell growth and proliferation (Doggett2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RNPC3 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in the minor spliceosome, which is crucial for the splicing of minor introns in pre-mRNA. A homozygous Y443C variant in RNPC3 has been linked to severe syndromic congenital hypopituitarism and diffuse brain atrophy. Patients with this mutation exhibit severe growth, neuromotor, and developmental delays, along with dysmorphic features and hormonal deficiencies (Bezen2022A). 

Another study identified a homozygous missense variant, c.1328A > G; p.(Tyr443Cys), in RNPC3 in fetuses with severe growth delay and brain anomalies, suggesting a link to developmental issues affecting growth and brain structure (Jacquemin2023Congenital). RNPC3 mutations have also been associated with familial isolated growth hormone deficiency, a condition characterized by treatable growth retardation (Doggett2018Early).

In cancer research, RNPC3 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target. Its knockdown in cancer cells leads to aberrant splicing of minor introns, affecting genes involved in crucial pathways like ERK/MAPK and PI3/AKT, which are essential for cell proliferation and survival (Doggett2021The). Additionally, an RNPC3-JAK2 fusion has been implicated in B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, contributing to leukemogenesis through the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway (Chen2019Identification).

## Interactions
The RNPC3 gene encodes the U11/U12-65K protein, a crucial component of the minor spliceosome involved in the splicing of U12-type introns. This protein contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), with the carboxy-terminal RRM (C-RRM) specifically binding to the 3' terminal stem-loop of the U12 snRNA and interacting with the U6atac snRNA. The amino-terminal part of the 65K protein interacts with the U11 snRNP-specific 59K protein, which further interacts with U11-48K, a protein involved in recognizing the U12-type 5' splice site with U11 snRNA. These interactions are essential for the stability of the U11/U12 di-snRNP complex, which is responsible for recognizing the 5' and 3' ends of U12-type introns (Norppa2017Mutations).

Mutations in RNPC3, such as P474T and R502X, disrupt these interactions by affecting the structural integrity and function of the U11/U12-65K protein. The P474T mutation affects the folding of the C-RRM domain, reducing its binding affinity to U12 and U6atac snRNAs, while the R502X mutation leads to nonsense-mediated decay of RNPC3 mRNA, reducing protein levels and resulting in the loss of the C-terminal tail crucial for snRNA binding (Norppa2017Mutations).
