# KCTD12

## Overview
KCTD12 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 12, which is a crucial auxiliary subunit of the GABA_B receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in inhibitory neurotransmission within the central nervous system. The KCTD12 protein is characterized by its multidomain structure, including a POZ/BTB domain and an H1 domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and oligomerization (Correale2013A; Zheng2019Structural). Functionally, KCTD12 modulates synaptic transmission by influencing the kinetics of GABA_B receptor-mediated GIRK channel activity, thereby impacting neuronal excitability and various physiological processes (Li2017KCTD12). Beyond its neurological roles, KCTD12 is implicated in cancer progression, interacting with key cell cycle regulators to promote tumor growth (Zhong2017KCTD12). Its involvement in both cancer and neurological disorders highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Li2016KCTD12; Sand2012Resequencing).

## Structure
The KCTD12 protein is a multidomain protein composed of 325 amino acids, featuring a POZ/BTB domain in its N-terminal region and an H1 domain in its C-terminal region (Correale2013A). The POZ/BTB domain, located between residues 30 and 135, consists of three β-strands and five α-helices, adopting an α/β structure (Correale2013A). This domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and oligomerization, forming a tetrameric structure in solution (Correale2013A).

The H1 domain, spanning residues 202 to 325, is predominantly β-structured and forms a pentameric assembly (Correale2013A; Zheng2019Structural). It interacts with Gβγ subunits, forming a β-propeller-like fold, with each H1 domain contributing a blade to the propeller (Zheng2019Structural). The interaction with Gβγ involves basic residues in the H1 domain, crucial for binding (Zheng2019Structural).

The KCTD12 protein's structure is characterized by its ability to oligomerize independently of the POZ/BTB domain, suggesting an intrinsic tendency to form higher-order structures (Correale2013A). The protein's quaternary structure and interactions are essential for its role in modulating GABA B receptor signaling (Correale2013A).

## Function
KCTD12 is a protein that functions as an auxiliary subunit of the GABA_B receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. It plays a crucial role in modulating synaptic transmission by influencing the kinetics of GABA_B receptor-mediated GIRK channel activity, specifically by accelerating both activation and desensitization rates (Li2017KCTD12). KCTD12 enhances the effects of the positive allosteric modulator CGP7930 on GABA_B receptor activation and desensitization, indicating its role in fine-tuning receptor responses (Li2017KCTD12).

The protein is involved in the desensitization of GABA_B receptor responses, a process mediated by its H1 domain, which contains a specific sequence motif, T/NFLEQ, essential for this function (Seddik2012Opposite). KCTD12's interaction with the GABA_B receptor is critical for maintaining synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability, impacting various physiological and behavioral processes (Seddik2012Opposite).

In addition to its role in the central nervous system, KCTD12 may also influence cell proliferation through its interaction with GABA_B signaling pathways, potentially affecting gastrointestinal cell proliferation (Skoblov2013Protein).

## Clinical Significance
KCTD12 has been implicated in various cancers and neurological disorders due to its role in modulating cellular processes. In colorectal cancer (CRC), KCTD12 is down-regulated in cancer stem cell-like cells, and low expression levels are associated with poor prognosis. It regulates CRC cell stemness characteristics, such as self-renewal and drug resistance, through the ERK pathway, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Li2016KCTD12).

In cervical and lung cancers, KCTD12 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. High expression correlates with shorter survival, indicating its role as a prognostic marker. KCTD12 promotes tumorigenesis by facilitating the G2/M transition in the cell cycle through interactions with CDK1 and Aurora A, which are crucial for cell cycle progression (Zhong2017KCTD12).

KCTD12 is also involved in chronic tinnitus, a hearing disorder. Variations in the KCTD12 gene, particularly the rs34544607 variant, have been associated with tinnitus, although the association is not strong. KCTD12 may act as a risk modifier in this condition, affecting GABA B receptor signaling, which is implicated in tinnitus pathology (Sand2012Resequencing).

## Interactions
KCTD12 interacts with several proteins, playing significant roles in both cancer progression and neuronal signaling. In the context of cancer, KCTD12 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and cell division cycle 25B (CDC25B), facilitating the G2/M transition in the cell cycle. This interaction promotes cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. KCTD12 is phosphorylated by Aurora kinase A (Aurora A) at serine 243, which is crucial for its interaction with CDK1 and its cancer-promoting effects (Zhong2017KCTD12).

In neuronal signaling, KCTD12 is an auxiliary subunit of GABA B receptors, which are G-protein coupled receptors for the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. KCTD12 forms both homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with other KCTD proteins, such as KCTD16, influencing the kinetics of GABA B receptor-induced potassium currents. KCTD12 accelerates current deactivation, while KCTD16 slows it down. These interactions modulate the signaling properties of GABA B receptors, affecting neuronal excitability (Ivankova2013Upregulation; Fritzius2016KCTD).

KCTD12 also interacts with the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GABA B2, enhancing the surface expression and signaling capacity of GABA B receptors by reducing their constitutive endocytosis (Ivankova2013Upregulation).
