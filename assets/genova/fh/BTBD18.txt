# BTBD18

## Overview
BTBD18 is a gene that encodes the protein BTB domain containing 18, which is categorized as an E3 CRL adaptor protein. This protein is characterized by the presence of a BTB (POZ) domain, a structural motif known for facilitating protein-protein interactions (Poirson2017Mapping). BTBD18 plays a crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of pachytene piRNA clusters, which are essential for spermatogenesis. The protein enhances the expression of primary piRNA precursors by promoting transcriptional elongation, thereby influencing chromatin accessibility and piRNA biogenesis (Yu2021Long). Disruption of BTBD18 function, as observed in Btbd18 Null homozygous mice, leads to significant reproductive consequences, including spermatogenesis arrest and male infertility (Du2024The).

## Interactions
BTBD18 is involved in the transcription of pachytene piRNA clusters, particularly those with long unspliced or long-first-exon transcripts. It binds to the promoters of 51 pachytene piRNA clusters, and for 48 of these loci, the levels of precursor transcripts and piRNAs decrease significantly in Btbd18 Null homozygous testes. This suggests that BTBD18 facilitates transcription by increasing chromatin accessibility (Yu2021Long). BTBD18 and A-MYB bind to a common, bidirectional promoter for some piRNA clusters, but only the piRNA-producing arm requires BTBD18 for transcription (Yu2021Long).

BTBD18 enhances the expression level of primary piRNA precursors by promoting transcriptional elongation. Mice lacking Btbd18 experience a massive loss of spermatocytes due to apoptosis, leading to spermatogenesis arrest, azoospermia, and male infertility (Du2024The). The THO complex, including THOC1 and THOC2, also binds to transcripts from these piRNA clusters, indicating a role in piRNA biogenesis (Yu2021Long).

BTBD18 is categorized as an E3 CRL adaptor with a BTB (POZ) domain, which is known for mediating protein-protein interactions (Poirson2017Mapping). However, specific physical interactions of BTBD18 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available context.
