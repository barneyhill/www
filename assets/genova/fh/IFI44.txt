# IFI44

## Overview
IFI44 is a gene that encodes the interferon-induced protein 44, which plays a critical role in the immune response to viral infections. The protein is categorized as an interferon-induced protein and is primarily involved in modulating antiviral responses within human cells. It achieves this by interacting with FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5), influencing key signaling pathways such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), which are essential for the production of type I and III interferons and proinflammatory cytokines (DeDiego2019InterferonInduced). IFI44 acts as a negative regulator, helping to maintain cellular homeostasis by preventing excessive immune responses that could be harmful to the host (DeDiego2019InterferonInduced). The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, with minor activity in the nucleus (Busse2020InterferonInduced). Alterations in IFI44 expression have been associated with various diseases, including cancer and viral infections, highlighting its clinical significance (Pan2020InterferonInduced).

## Function
IFI44 (interferon-induced protein 44) is a protein that plays a significant role in modulating the immune response in human cells. It is primarily involved in the regulation of antiviral responses by interacting with FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5), which is crucial for the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) pathways. These pathways are essential for the production of type I and III interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, which are key components of the antiviral defense mechanism (DeDiego2019InterferonInduced).

IFI44 negatively regulates these immune responses by decreasing the phosphorylation of IRF-3 and IκBα, thereby reducing the activation of NF-κB and the subsequent production of interferons. This modulation helps maintain cellular homeostasis by preventing excessive immune responses, which can be detrimental to the host (DeDiego2019InterferonInduced). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, although low levels can be found in the nucleus (Busse2020InterferonInduced).

In healthy human cells, IFI44 acts as a negative regulator of interferon responses, balancing the immune response to viral infections. This regulation is part of a feedback mechanism to prevent excessive interferon production, which could be harmful to the host (DeDiego2019InterferonInduced).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IFI44 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions, particularly in the context of cancer and viral infections. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), high expression of IFI44 is associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival times. This overexpression is more prevalent in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues and is particularly higher in HPV-negative HNSC patients, correlating with a worse prognosis (Pan2020InterferonInduced). IFI44 expression is also linked to immune infiltration, affecting CD4+ and CD8+ cell levels, which may influence the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy (Pan2020InterferonInduced).

In the context of viral infections, IFI44 has been shown to negatively regulate host antiviral responses, supporting virus replication. It interacts with FKBP5, affecting the phosphorylation of IRF-3 and IκBα, which are involved in interferon responses. This modulation can potentially control cytokine storms during viral infections, such as influenza A virus and coronaviruses (DeDiego2019InterferonInduced). Additionally, IFI44 and its like protein, IFI44L, have been identified as having antiviral properties, restricting the replication of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Busse2020InterferonInduced).

## Interactions
IFI44, an interferon-induced protein, is known to interact with FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5). This interaction has been demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses, confirming that IFI44 specifically associates with FKBP5 but not with other control proteins such as IFI6 and IFI27 (DeDiego2019InterferonInduced). The interaction between IFI44 and FKBP5 is significant because FKBP5 is involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly through its association with IκB kinases (IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ), which are crucial for activating transcription factors like NF-κB and interferon regulatory factors (IRF-3 and IRF-7) (DeDiego2019InterferonInduced).

IFI44's interaction with FKBP5 affects the phosphorylation of IRF-3 and IκBα, mediated by IKK and IKKβ, respectively. This interaction results in decreased phosphorylation levels, thereby negatively regulating host antiviral responses (DeDiego2019InterferonInduced). The presence of IFI44 reduces the kinase activities of IKKβ and IKK, which are responsible for phosphorylating IRF-3 and IκBα, indicating that IFI44 modulates these pathways through its binding to FKBP5 (DeDiego2019InterferonInduced). This modulation is crucial for the regulation of interferon responses and highlights IFI44's role in supporting virus replication by negatively regulating host antiviral mechanisms (DeDiego2019InterferonInduced).
