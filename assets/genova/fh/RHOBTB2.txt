# RHOBTB2

## Overview
RHOBTB2 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho-related BTB domain containing 2, which is a member of the RhoBTB subfamily of atypical Rho GTPases. Unlike typical Rho GTPases, RHOBTB2 is characterized by a unique domain structure that includes an N-terminal GTPase domain, a proline-rich region, two tandem BTB domains, and a conserved C-terminal region. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, protein degradation, and vesicle transport. It functions primarily as an adaptor in cullin 3-dependent ubiquitin ligase complexes, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. RHOBTB2 is expressed at low levels across various tissues, with higher expression in neural and fetal tissues, suggesting its involvement in developmental processes. Clinically, RHOBTB2 is significant as a tumor suppressor gene, particularly in breast cancer, and is associated with neurological disorders such as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (ASPENSTRÖM2004Rho; BERTHOLD2008Rho; Wilkins2004RhoBTB2).

## Structure
RHOBTB2 is a member of the RhoBTB subfamily of atypical Rho GTPases, characterized by a unique domain architecture. The protein consists of an N-terminal GTPase domain, a proline-rich region, two tandem BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domains, and a conserved C-terminal region (BERTHOLD2008Rho; Wilkins2004RhoBTB2). The GTPase domain is divergent and does not effectively bind GTP, suggesting impaired enzyme activity (BERTHOLD2008Rho). The proline-rich region serves as a potential site for protein-protein interactions, possibly binding SH3 domains (BERTHOLD2008Rho).

The BTB domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and are crucial for the recruitment of cullin3, a component of ubiquitin ligase complexes (BERTHOLD2008Rho; Wilkins2004RhoBTB2). The first BTB domain is responsible for binding to the N-terminal region of Cul3 (Wilkins2004RhoBTB2). RHOBTB2 can form dimers, including both homodimers and heterodimers, which may have different functional roles (McKinnon2017The; BERTHOLD2008Rho).

The C-terminal region of RHOBTB2 is conserved and likely folds into four consecutive α-helices, although it does not contain a typical prenylation signal (BERTHOLD2008Rho). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which regulates its stability and degradation (Wilkins2004RhoBTB2).

## Function
RHOBTB2, also known as Deleted in Breast Cancer 2 (DBC2), is a member of the RhoBTB subfamily of Rho GTPases, which are involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, RHOBTB2 is implicated in transcriptional regulation and protein degradation. It interacts with the Cul3 ubiquitin ligase complex, suggesting a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis by targeting proteins for degradation (McKinnon2017The; Wilkins2004RhoBTB2).

RHOBTB2 is expressed at low levels in various tissues, with relatively higher expression in neural and fetal tissues, indicating its potential involvement in developmental processes (Mao2009A; BERTHOLD2008Rho). The protein is involved in regulating cell growth and apoptosis, as its overexpression in certain cell lines can suppress cell growth, potentially through the downregulation of cyclin D1 (BERTHOLD2008Rho).

RHOBTB2 is also associated with vesicle transport, particularly in the transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, and is distributed in a vesicular pattern within the cell (BERTHOLD2008Rho). Despite being a member of the Rho family, RHOBTB2 does not significantly affect the actin filament system, indicating a distinct role from typical Rho GTPases (ASPENSTRÖM2004Rho).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RHOBTB2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, particularly in the context of cancer and neurological disorders. In breast cancer, RHOBTB2 acts as a tumor suppressor gene, and its expression is frequently lost due to promoter methylation, leading to poor prognosis. This silencing is a significant mechanism contributing to breast cancer development and progression (TANG2013RhoBTB2; Mao2009A). RHOBTB2 expression is also reduced in other cancers, such as lung, bladder, and gastric cancers, often due to epigenetic changes rather than mutations (Ji2016Atypical; BERTHOLD2008Rho).

In neurological disorders, RHOBTB2 mutations are linked to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) and paroxysmal movement disorders. Patients with RHOBTB2 variants often exhibit early-onset epilepsy, developmental delays, and various movement disorders. These mutations can lead to phenotypic variability, with some patients experiencing movement disorders without epilepsy (Niu2021RHOBTB2; Knijnenburg2020Acute). The BTB domains of RHOBTB2, where many variants are located, are involved in protein interactions affecting proteasomal degradation, potentially leading to severe neurological symptoms (Niu2021RHOBTB2).

## Interactions
RHOBTB2 interacts with several proteins, primarily through its involvement in cullin 3-dependent ubiquitin ligase complexes. It specifically binds to cullin 3 (Cul3) via its BTB domain, a crucial interaction for its function as an adaptor in these complexes. This interaction is specific to Cul3 and does not occur with other cullin family members (BERTHOLD2008Rho; Wilkins2004RhoBTB2). The first BTB domain of RHOBTB2 binds to the N-terminal region of Cul3, and mutations in this domain, such as Y284D, can disrupt this interaction, affecting the protein's stability and function (BERTHOLD2008Rho; Wilkins2004RhoBTB2).

RHOBTB2 also interacts with the Hsp90 chaperone machinery, which facilitates its activation by enabling GTP binding and interaction with Cul3. This interaction is essential for the formation of ubiquitin ligase complexes and is significantly reduced by the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (Ji2016Atypical). Additionally, RHOBTB2 can form homo- and heterodimers and interact with proteins such as MUF1, cyclin E, and HIFα, which have implications in tumorigenesis (Ji2016Atypical). These interactions highlight RHOBTB2's role in protein degradation pathways and its potential function as a tumor suppressor.
