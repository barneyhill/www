# GLDN

## Overview
The GLDN gene encodes gliomedin, a type II transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of the nodes of Ranvier in the peripheral nervous system. Gliomedin is characterized by its complex structure, which includes collagenous and olfactomedin domains, and is essential for the proper conduction of nerve impulses along myelinated axons. This protein is secreted by Schwann cell microvilli and interacts with cell adhesion molecules such as neurofascin-186 (NF186) and NrCAM, facilitating the clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels at the nodes of Ranvier. These interactions are crucial for efficient nerve signal transmission and are mediated by specific domains within gliomedin and its binding partners (Eshed2007Secreted; Labasque2011Fibronectin). Mutations in the GLDN gene have been implicated in neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining nerve structure and function (Wambach2017Survival).

## Structure
Gliomedin (GLDN) is a type II transmembrane protein with a complex molecular structure essential for the formation of nodes of Ranvier. The primary structure of gliomedin includes an N-terminal intracellular region, a transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane coiled-coil region, two collagenous repeats, and a C-terminal olfactomedin domain (Maertens2007Cleavage; Eshed2007Secreted). The secondary structure features a juxtamembrane α-helical, coiled-coil sequence that facilitates trimerization (Eshed2007Secreted).

The tertiary structure of gliomedin is characterized by the formation of triple helices in the collagen-like domain, contributing to its multimerization (Eshed2007Secreted). The olfactomedin domain forms a 5-bladed β-propeller with broken symmetry, providing a structural basis for its function (Han2015The). Gliomedin's quaternary structure involves self-association into trimers and potentially higher-order structures (Eshed2007Secreted).

Post-translational modifications include N-linked glycosylation, which contributes significantly to its molecular mass, and prolylhydroxylation, which stabilizes the triple helical conformation (Maertens2007Cleavage; Eshed2007Secreted). Gliomedin is unique among vertebrates for possessing both collagen and olfactomedin domains (Maertens2007Cleavage).

## Function
The GLDN gene encodes gliomedin, a protein essential for the formation and maintenance of the nodes of Ranvier in the peripheral nervous system. These nodes are critical for the proper conduction of nerve impulses along myelinated axons, facilitating rapid and efficient neural communication (Labasque2011Fibronectin; Wambach2017Survival). Gliomedin is secreted by Schwann cell microvilli and interacts with the axonal protein neurofascin-186 (NF186) and NrCAM, both of which are cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This interaction is crucial for the nodal clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav), which are essential for nerve signal transmission (Labasque2011Fibronectin).

The binding between gliomedin and NF186 is mediated by the fibronectin type III domains of NF186, which are necessary for the clustering of gliomedin and Nav at the nodes of Ranvier (Labasque2011Fibronectin). This process is vital for the organization and stabilization of the nodes, ensuring efficient nerve impulse conduction. In the absence of gliomedin, as observed in Gldn-null mice, Nav clustering is affected during development, indicating the protein's critical role in nodal assembly and function (Labasque2011Fibronectin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the GLDN gene can lead to neurological disorders, most notably Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. This condition is characterized by peripheral nerve damage, which results in muscle weakness and sensory loss. The GLDN gene encodes a protein crucial for the formation and maintenance of nodes of Ranvier in peripheral nerves, and any disruption in its function can significantly impact nerve conduction and myelination. Changes in GLDN expression levels may also affect these processes, potentially leading to similar neurological symptoms. The precise mechanisms by which GLDN mutations contribute to these disorders are still under investigation, but the gene's role in maintaining nerve structure and function is critical for normal neurological health.

## Interactions
Gliomedin (GLDN) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation of nodes of Ranvier by interacting with several other proteins. It binds to neurofascin-186 (NF186) and NrCAM, which are cell adhesion molecules at the nodes of Ranvier. The fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains of NF186 mediate direct interaction with gliomedin, with the first FnIII domain being essential for this binding, while the fourth domain is not necessary (Labasque2011Fibronectin). NrCAM also interacts with gliomedin using its FnIII domains, and both NF186 and NrCAM bind gliomedin with high affinity (Labasque2011Fibronectin).

Gliomedin also interacts with perlecan, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, which is crucial for the clustering of sodium channels. This interaction is mediated by the collagen-like domain of gliomedin, which is necessary and sufficient for binding to perlecan. The heparan sulfate chains of perlecan contribute to this binding, as evidenced by reduced binding in the presence of heparin (Colombelli2015Perlecan). Gliomedin's olfactomedin domain is involved in extracellular protein interactions, playing roles in nervous system development and intercellular adhesion (Han2015The). These interactions are significant for gliomedin's function in clustering voltage-gated sodium channels at the nodes of Ranvier, essential for nerve impulse propagation (Han2015The).
