# ZNF99

## Overview
ZNF99 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 99, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs. These motifs are typically involved in binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby playing a crucial role in gene expression regulation. Zinc finger protein 99 is categorized as a transcription factor, which suggests its involvement in the regulation of various genetic pathways and cellular processes. The precise biological functions and interactions of ZNF99 remain an active area of research, with implications for understanding its role in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
