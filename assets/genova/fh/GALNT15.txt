# GALNT15

## Overview
The GALNT15 gene encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 15, which is a member of the glycosyltransferase family. This enzyme is involved in the initial step of O-linked glycosylation, a critical post-translational modification process that attaches N-acetylgalactosamine to serine and threonine residues on proteins. The activity of GALNT15 is essential for the proper function and stability of glycoproteins, influencing various biological processes and cellular interactions. Alterations in the expression of GALNT15 have been associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer and osteoarthritis, where it may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target (Yoshimoto2023Bioinformatic; Dingerdissen2021Differential).

## Clinical Significance
The GALNT15 gene, encoding the enzyme N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 15, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In cancer, particularly endometrial cancer, high expression levels of GALNT15 are associated with worse survival outcomes, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic biomarker. Despite being typically underexpressed in cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, higher expression within tumor samples correlates with poorer prognosis, indicating that individuals with inherently higher GALNT15 expression may have a worse prognosis (Dingerdissen2021Differential).

In osteoarthritis (OA), GALNT15 is significantly upregulated in chondrocytes, especially in the late stages of the disease. This upregulation is linked to increased OA grades and pathways involved in OA pathogenesis, such as apoptosis and oxidative stress. These findings suggest that GALNT15 may contribute to OA progression by affecting the O-linked glycosylation pathway, which is crucial for chondrocyte function and survival (Yoshimoto2023Bioinformatic).

The role of GALNT15 in these conditions highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention and underscores the need for further research to elucidate the mechanisms by which GALNT15 expression affects disease outcomes.
