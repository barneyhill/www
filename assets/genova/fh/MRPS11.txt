# MRPS11

## Overview
MRPS11 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S11, a crucial component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a vital role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, thereby supporting cellular energy metabolism (Kaushal2014CryoEM; Koc2012Regulation). MRPS11 is involved in mRNA and tRNA binding, contributing to the stability and assembly of the ribosomal subunit (Emdadul2008The). The protein's interactions with other ribosomal proteins, such as MRPS16 and MRPS22, are critical for its incorporation into the ribosome, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function (Emdadul2008The). Additionally, MRPS11 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders, due to its role in mitochondrial integrity and cellular processes (Gopisetty2016Mammalian; Revathi2021Expression).

## Function
MRPS11 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is part of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. It plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in cells (Kaushal2014CryoEM; Koc2012Regulation). MRPS11 is located on the platform of the small subunit and is involved in mRNA and tRNA binding during translation, contributing to the stability and assembly of the ribosomal subunit (Koc2012Regulation; Emdadul2008The).

The protein's incorporation into the ribosome is dependent on the presence of other ribosomal proteins, such as MRPS16 and MRPS22, which are necessary for the proper assembly of the ribosomal subunit (Emdadul2008The). In healthy cells, MRPS11 is phosphorylated, which may modulate mRNA-binding to the ribosome at the initiation stage, influencing protein synthesis (Koc2012Regulation). The phosphorylation of MRPS11 and its interactions with other ribosomal proteins suggest a role in stabilizing mitochondrial mRNAs on the 28S subunit, which is critical for efficient translation and cellular energy metabolism (Koc2012Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
MRPS11 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in mitochondrial function. Alterations in MRPS11 expression are associated with several types of cancer. In colorectal cancer, MRPS11 expression correlates with prolonged survival after surgery, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, downregulation of MRPS11 is linked to decreased expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex subunits, indicating a mitochondrial translation defect (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). MRPS11 is also overexpressed in uveal melanoma, where it is considered a potential prognostic indicator (Huang2020Abnormal).

In ankylosing spondylitis, a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, MRPS11 is significantly downregulated, which is associated with changes in the respiratory electron transport chain (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). Additionally, MRPS11's interactions with other proteins, such as ROS1, suggest its involvement in tumorigenic processes (Revathi2021Expression).

Mutations in related mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, such as MRPS16, can significantly reduce MRPS11 levels, affecting its assembly into the ribosome and potentially leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (Emdadul2008The). These findings underscore the importance of MRPS11 in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and its potential role in disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
MRPS11, a component of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit, engages in various protein-protein interactions that suggest roles beyond its primary function in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It has been shown to interact with several proteins, including Branched Chain Keto Acid Dehydrogenase E1 Subunit Beta (BCKDHB), FK506 binding protein 12-rapamycin associated protein 1 (FRAP1), and Receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1), a known proto-oncogene (Revathi2021Expression). MRPS11 also interacts with Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2), which is involved in circadian rhythm and gene expression (Revathi2021Expression).

The interactions of MRPS11 with ROS1 have been validated using GST pull-down assays and nLC/MS analysis, confirming its role in protein interactome networks that are involved in various cellular processes and pathways, including the p53 pathway and MAPK6/MAPK4 signaling (Revathi2021Expression). MRPS11's stable incorporation into the mitochondrial ribosome is dependent on the presence of other ribosomal proteins such as MRPS16 and MRPS22, as mutations in these proteins lead to a significant reduction in MRPS11 levels, affecting ribosome assembly (Emdadul2008The). Additionally, MRPS11 has been identified as an interacting partner of C4orf14, a protein involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis and mtRNA metabolism (He2012Human).
