# NKX6-3

## Overview
NKX6-3 is a gene that encodes the NK6 homeobox 3 protein, a transcription factor primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression within gastric epithelial cells. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis by modulating DNA replication and repair processes, as well as controlling reactive oxygen species production. NK6 homeobox 3 acts as a tumor suppressor, inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis to protect against gastric carcinogenesis. It is also involved in the regulation of key signaling pathways, such as Wnt/β-catenin and Rho-GTPase, which are crucial for cell migration and invasion. The gene's expression is critical for preventing intestinal metaplasia and maintaining the gastric phenotype by regulating the expression of genes like SOX2 and CDX2. Clinically, NKX6-3 is significant in gastric cancer, where its depletion is associated with increased genetic mutations, advanced cancer stages, and poorer survival outcomes, making it a potential therapeutic target (Yoon2021Depletion; Yoon2016NKX6.3; Yoon2016Inactivation).

## Function
The NKX6-3 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the differentiation and function of gastric epithelial cells. It is involved in maintaining genomic stability by regulating DNA replication and repair processes through transcriptional control of CDT1 and RPA1, which are essential for these cellular functions (Yoon2021Depletion). NKX6-3 also acts as a tumor suppressor in gastric tissues by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis, thereby protecting against gastric carcinogenesis (Yoon2021Depletion).

In the context of gastric epithelial differentiation, NKX6-3 regulates the expression of key genes such as SOX2 and CDX2, which are critical for maintaining the gastric phenotype and preventing transdifferentiation to an intestinal phenotype, a process known as intestinal metaplasia (Yoon2016Inactivation). It achieves this by directly binding to the promoter regions of these genes, modulating their expression at both mRNA and protein levels (Yoon2016Inactivation).

NKX6-3 also plays a significant role in controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by suppressing NF-kB and DNMT1 activities, which helps protect gastric epithelial cells from oxidative stress and potential DNA damage (Yoon2017NKX6.3). This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the progression of precancerous conditions (Yoon2017NKX6.3).

## Clinical Significance
NKX6-3 plays a significant role in gastric cancer, acting as a tumor suppressor. Its depletion is associated with increased genetic mutations and poor clinical outcomes. Loss of NKX6-3 expression leads to the activation of the AICDA/APOBEC family, resulting in a higher mutation rate in genes such as TP53, CDH1, and PIK3CA, which are crucial in cancer development (Yoon2018Multiple). This depletion also correlates with increased expression of mutagenic genes and shorter survival times in gastric cancer patients (Yoon2018Multiple).

NKX6-3 is involved in regulating DNA replication and repair. Its depletion causes DNA replication stress and genomic instability, contributing to gastric carcinogenesis through copy number alterations (Yoon2021Depletion). The gene also suppresses gastric cancer progression by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin and Rho-GTPase signaling pathways, which are involved in cell migration and invasion (Yoon2016NKX6.3).

Reduced NKX6-3 expression is linked to advanced gastric cancer stages, lymph node metastasis, and poorer survival outcomes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yoon2016NKX6.3). The gene's role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis underscores its clinical significance in gastric cancer.

## Interactions
NKX6-3 is a transcription factor that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression, particularly in the context of gastric cancer. It binds to the promoter regions of several genes involved in the Wnt/β-catenin and Rho-GTPase signaling pathways, such as Skp2, c-Myc, Wnt3a, Wnt5a, CTNNB1, APC, and CDH1, thereby modulating their transcriptional activity (Yoon2016NKX6.3). NKX6-3 also interacts with the Myc-Skp2-Miz1-p300 transcriptional complex, inhibiting its formation and thus reducing RhoA transcription and cell migration (Yoon2016NKX6.3).

In addition to its role in transcriptional regulation, NKX6-3 influences the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by binding to the promoter regions of SNAI2 and VIM, which are crucial for tumor invasion (Yoon2016NKX6.3). It also facilitates the formation of the E-cadherin/p120-catenin/α-catenin/β-catenin complex, promoting the degradation of cytoplasmic β-catenin (Yoon2016NKX6.3).

NKX6-3 interacts with the AICDA/APOBEC gene family, NFκB, and CBFβ, regulating their expression and activity. This interaction is significant in preventing genetic mutations associated with gastric cancer (Yoon2018Multiple). NKX6-3 also binds to the promoter regions of NF-kB subunits p65 and p50, reducing the expression of NF-kB target genes (Yoon2017NKX6.3).
