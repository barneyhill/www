# ZFX

## Overview
ZFX, or Zinc Finger Protein X-linked, is a gene that encodes a zinc finger transcription factor involved in various biological processes, including stem cell maintenance and immune cell regulation. The ZFX protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, classifying it as a transcription factor (Ni2020Characterization; Schneider-Gädicke1989ZFX). It plays a pivotal role in the self-renewal and pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells and the long-term maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (GalanCaridad2007Zfx; Harel2012ZFX). Additionally, ZFX is implicated in the regulation of peripheral T cells and is involved in various cancer-related pathways, influencing tumor growth and resistance to therapies (SmithRaska2018The; Cai2018ZFX). The gene's ability to escape X inactivation allows it to be expressed from both X chromosomes, contributing to its functional significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Schneider-Gädicke1989ZFX).

## Structure
The ZFX protein is characterized by a two-domain structure, consisting of an acidic amino-terminal region and a carboxy-terminal domain containing 13 zinc fingers (Mardon1990Mouse; Schneider-Gädicke1989ZFX). These zinc fingers are organized into six and one-half tandem repeats of a two-finger unit, a structure unique to ZFX and its homolog ZFY (Schneider-Gädicke1989ZFX). The zinc finger domains are crucial for DNA binding, with zinc fingers 11-13 being necessary and sufficient for this function (Ni2020Characterization).

The primary structure of ZFX includes a sequence of amino acids forming these zinc finger motifs, which are typical of DNA-binding proteins (Schneider-Gädicke1989ZFX). The protein also contains a nuclear localization signal between the acidic domain and the zinc finger domains, facilitating its function as a transcription factor (Ni2020Characterization). The ZFX gene is known to escape X inactivation, allowing it to be transcribed from both active and inactive X chromosomes (Schneider-Gädicke1989ZFX). The presence of splice variant isoforms and potential post-translational modifications like phosphorylation may further influence its function and localization, although specific details on these aspects are not provided in the context.

## Function
The ZFX gene encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the self-renewal and maintenance of stem cells, including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In hESCs, ZFX is essential for maintaining the undifferentiated state and promoting self-renewal. Knockdown of ZFX in hESCs results in decreased colony size and number, indicating its importance in clonal growth and pluripotency. Overexpression of ZFX enhances self-renewal and prevents spontaneous differentiation, acting as a molecular rheostat to balance self-renewal and differentiation (Harel2012ZFX).

In HSCs, ZFX is vital for long-term maintenance and survival. ZFX-deficient HSCs exhibit increased apoptosis and impaired self-renewal, although erythromyeloid progenitors remain unaffected. This suggests that ZFX is specifically required for the survival and self-renewal of HSCs under steady-state conditions (GalanCaridad2007Zfx).

ZFX is also involved in the regulation of peripheral T cells, where it is necessary for the maintenance and proliferation of naïve and memory T cells. ZFX-deficient T cells show impaired homeostatic proliferation and reduced antigen-specific expansion, highlighting its role in immune cell homeostasis (SmithRaska2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZFX gene have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance. In gallbladder cancer (GBC), ZFX is a significant prognostic indicator associated with increased malignant potential. High ZFX expression correlates with poorer survival outcomes post-surgery, and its overexpression is linked to aggressive tumor phenotypes, affecting proliferation, invasion, and migration of cancer cells (Weng2015Zinc).

In gastric cancer, the miR-144-ZFX axis plays a crucial role, with ZFX overexpression associated with disease progression. ZFX is identified as a target gene for miR-144, and its expression increases from early to advanced stages of the disease, suggesting a role in maintaining cancer stem cells or niche cells (Akiyoshi2012Clinical).

ZFX also contributes to the growth and drug resistance of leukemic cells. Its silencing in leukemia cell lines results in decreased growth and increased sensitivity to treatments like imatinib, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Wu2016ZFX; Wu2017ZFX).

In pancreatic cancer, ZFX promotes tumor growth and metastasis through the MAPK pathway. High ZFX expression is associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival times, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Song2018ZFX).

## Interactions
ZFX, a zinc finger transcription factor, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene regulation. In glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), ZFX binds to a specific sequence on the c-Myc promoter, up-regulating c-Myc expression, which is crucial for maintaining the tumorigenic potential and self-renewal properties of GSCs (Fang2014The). 

In castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), ZFX interacts with the androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7). It co-occupies unique AR-V7 binding sites at target gene promoters, distinct from those occupied by the full-length androgen receptor. This interaction is essential for the upregulation of genes associated with autophagy and non-canonical WNT signaling, contributing to prostate tumorigenesis and castration resistance (Cai2018ZFX). ZFX's role as a cofactor for AR-V7 is highlighted by its ability to enhance AR-V7 binding to specific genomic regions, promoting CRPC cell growth (Cai2018ZFX).

ZFX also binds to CpG island promoters, particularly at +240 bp downstream from the transcription start site, influencing gene expression by maintaining nucleosome-free regions and positioning nucleosomes (Rhie2018ZFX). This binding pattern is associated with transcriptional activation in various human tumors.
