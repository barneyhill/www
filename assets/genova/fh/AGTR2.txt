# AGTR2

## Overview
The AGTR2 gene encodes the angiotensin II receptor type 2, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is integral to the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. Unlike its counterpart, the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1), which primarily mediates vasoconstriction and blood pressure elevation, the AGTR2 receptor is involved in counter-regulatory processes such as vasodilation, inhibition of cell proliferation, and promotion of apoptosis. This receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, ovary, and adrenal gland, and plays a role in diverse physiological and pathological processes, including muscle differentiation, reproductive function, and response to injury. The AGTR2 receptor's ability to form homodimers and heterodimers with other receptors, such as the angiotensin II type 1 receptor and the B2 bradykinin receptor, further underscores its complex role in cellular signaling pathways (Recarti2015AT2; Mustafina2014AGTR2).

## Structure
The AGTR2 (angiotensin II receptor type 2) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in cardiovascular regulation. Its primary structure is composed of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. The secondary structure of AGTR2 includes alpha helices, which are characteristic of GPCRs. These helices fold into a specific three-dimensional conformation, constituting the tertiary structure of the protein. AGTR2 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and activity. The receptor can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, allowing for variations in its structure and potentially its function. These structural features are crucial for the receptor's ability to interact with ligands and transduce signals across the cell membrane.

## Function
The AGTR2 gene encodes the angiotensin II type 2 receptor, which is part of the renin-angiotensin system. This receptor is involved in various molecular processes, including the regulation of skeletal muscle growth and differentiation. In healthy human cells, AGTR2 mediates the effects of angiotensin II on cellular differentiation and growth, contrasting with the vascular role of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1) (Mustafina2014AGTR2). AGTR2 is expressed in specific tissues such as the brain, ovary, and adrenal gland, and its expression is upregulated in certain pathological conditions like hypertension and inflammation (Mustafina2014AGTR2).

In the context of muscle development, AGTR2 is associated with muscle fiber composition and athletic performance. The C allele of the AGTR2 gene is linked to a higher proportion of slow-twitch muscle fibers, which are associated with endurance athlete status, while the A allele is linked to fast-twitch fibers and power-oriented disciplines (Mustafina2014AGTR2). Additionally, AGTR2 is expressed in human sperm cells, where it plays a role in enhancing sperm motility, which is crucial for fertility (Gianzo2016Angiotensin). The receptor's presence in sperm cells suggests its involvement in reproductive processes, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Gianzo2016Angiotensin).

## Clinical Significance
The AGTR2 gene, encoding the angiotensin II type 2 receptor, plays a significant role in various pathological conditions due to its involvement in the renin-angiotensin system. Alterations in AGTR2 expression and function have been implicated in neuropathic pain and cystic fibrosis (CF).

In neuropathic pain, particularly following peripheral nerve injuries, the expression of the AT2 receptor is reduced near the injury site but remains high in chronic painful neuromas. This suggests that the receptor's altered expression contributes to pain persistence. The AT2 receptor is involved in pathways that enhance neuronal excitability and pain signaling, and its antagonism has shown promise in reducing pain by interfering with these pathways (Smith2016Selective).

In cystic fibrosis, genetic studies have identified variants in the AGTR2 gene associated with pulmonary disease severity. The absence or antagonism of AGTR2 has been shown to improve lung function in CF mouse models, suggesting that reduced AGTR2 signaling may be beneficial for CF patients. This highlights the potential of targeting AGTR2 as a therapeutic strategy for improving pulmonary outcomes in CF (Darrah2019AGTR2).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of AGTR2 in both neuropathic pain and cystic fibrosis, suggesting potential therapeutic avenues through modulation of its signaling pathways.

## Interactions
The angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its signaling pathways. AGTR2 can form homodimers through disulfide bonds between conserved cysteine residues, leading to constitutive cell signaling. It also forms heterodimers with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), inhibiting AT1R signaling independently of angiotensin II binding, which is significant in tissues like the myometrium (Recarti2015AT2).

AGTR2 interacts with the B2 bradykinin receptor (B2R), leading to specific phosphorylation/dephosphorylation pathways and increased production of nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) (Recarti2015AT2). It also forms a heterodimer with the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TRKB), affecting TRK/FYN coupling and TRKB surface levels, which is relevant in the context of antidepressant-like effects (Diniz2018Antidepressantlike).

AGTR2 interacts with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3), forming a complex that inhibits cell proliferation and angiogenesis by blocking the phosphorylation of Akt and endothelial NO synthase (Kang2008Tissue). This interaction enhances apoptosis through increased caspase-3 activity (Kang2008Tissue). These interactions highlight AGTR2's role in diverse physiological processes.
