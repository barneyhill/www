# PSMD1

## Overview
PSMD1 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 1, a critical component of the 26S proteasome complex involved in protein degradation. This non-ATPase subunit is part of the 19S regulatory particle, which plays a pivotal role in recognizing and processing ubiquitinated proteins for degradation by the proteasome. The protein encoded by PSMD1 is essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis, influencing processes such as antigen processing, cell-cycle regulation, and signal transduction (Xuan2021Prognostic; Kim2024Depletion). PSMD1 is implicated in various cellular pathways, including ubiquinone metabolism and immune system functions, highlighting its broader role beyond protein degradation (Xuan2021Prognostic). Dysregulation of PSMD1 expression has been associated with several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (BencomoAlvarez2021Proteasome; Okumura2017Proteasome).

## Structure
PSMD1 is a non-ATPase regulatory subunit of the 26S proteasome, which plays a crucial role in protein degradation. The primary structure of PSMD1 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that contribute to its function within the proteasome complex. The secondary structure of PSMD1 may include alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common in proteins involved in complex assemblies (Mao2020Structure).

In terms of tertiary structure, PSMD1 is involved in the three-dimensional folding necessary for its interaction with other proteasome subunits. The quaternary structure of PSMD1 involves its assembly within the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome, where it plays a role in substrate recognition and processing (Mao2020Structure).

PSMD1 is part of the base subcomplex of the regulatory particle, which includes other subunits such as RPN1 and RPN2. This base subcomplex is essential for the initial recognition of ubiquitylated substrates, with PSMD1 contributing to the processing of these substrates by the proteasome (Mao2020Structure).

Post-translational modifications of PSMD1, such as phosphorylation and SUMOylation, can affect its interactions with other proteins and may be relevant for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Rubio202126S). These modifications highlight the dynamic nature of PSMD1's role in cellular processes.

## Function
PSMD1 is a non-ATPase subunit of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome complex, which is crucial for intracellular protein degradation. This complex plays a significant role in maintaining protein homeostasis by degrading ubiquitinated proteins, thereby preventing the accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins in cells (Xuan2021Prognostic; Kim2024Depletion). In healthy human cells, PSMD1 is involved in the regulation of protein turnover, which is essential for various cellular processes such as antigen processing, cell-cycle regulation, and signal transduction (Xuan2021Prognostic).

PSMD1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to cellular regulation by facilitating the recognition and unfolding of substrate proteins, allowing their entry into the proteolytic core of the proteasome (Kim2024Depletion). The gene is also linked to broader cellular functions, including ubiquinone metabolism and immune system pathways, indicating its role beyond mere protein degradation (Xuan2021Prognostic). Through these activities, PSMD1 helps maintain cellular homeostasis and supports organismal health by ensuring efficient protein turnover and preventing cellular stress.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PSMD1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In breast cancer, PSMD1 is overexpressed, particularly in tamoxifen-resistant cells, and is associated with poor prognosis and shorter relapse-free survival. Knockdown of PSMD1 in breast cancer cells leads to cell cycle arrest and increased levels of the tumor suppressor protein p53, suggesting its role in promoting cancer cell proliferation and drug resistance (Okumura2017Proteasome). 

In CML, PSMD1 is upregulated in tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant cells and is involved in the stabilization of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), a key factor in cell survival and proliferation. Knockdown of PSMD1 reduces NF-κB activity, leading to decreased cell survival and increased apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in CML (BencomoAlvarez2021Proteasome). 

The PSMD1 gene is also part of a broader family of proteasome subunits that are generally upregulated in cancerous tissues, contributing to tumor growth and poor survival outcomes (Xuan2021Prognostic).

## Interactions
PSMD1, a subunit of the 26S proteasome, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the autophagy protein ATG16, which mediates the autophagic degradation of PSMD1. The interaction is direct, with the N-terminal half of ATG16 binding to PSMD1, while the C-terminal half interacts with both PSMD1 and PSMD2. This suggests a role for ATG16 in linking autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Xiong2018ATG16).

In breast cancer, PSMD1 is involved in the degradation of the p53 protein, a crucial tumor suppressor. Knockdown of PSMD1 in breast cancer cells leads to increased p53 levels, indicating that PSMD1 facilitates p53 degradation, thereby influencing cell growth and survival (Okumura2017Proteasome).

PSMD1 also plays a role in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) by stabilizing NF-κB, a transcription factor essential for cell survival and proliferation. Knockdown of PSMD1 reduces NF-κB protein expression and transcriptional activity, highlighting its role in CML progression (BencomoAlvarez2021Proteasome). These interactions underscore PSMD1's involvement in critical cellular pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
