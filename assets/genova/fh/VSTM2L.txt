# VSTM2L

## Overview
VSTM2L is a gene that encodes the protein V-set and transmembrane domain containing 2 like, which is categorized as a secreted protein with significant roles in neuroprotection and cancer biology. The protein is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domain, which is essential for its function as an antagonist to the neuroprotective peptide humanin (HN) (Rossini2011VSTM2L). VSTM2L is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the cerebral cortex and pituitary gland, where it modulates neuroprotective pathways by inhibiting HN activity (Rossini2011VSTM2L). Additionally, VSTM2L interacts with proteins such as VDAC1 in prostate cancer cells, suggesting a role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and influencing oncogenic pathways (Yang2024VSTM2L). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions have been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Rossini2011VSTM2L; Yang2024VSTM2L).

## Structure
VSTM2L is a protein characterized by its structure comprising three distinct regions: the N-terminal region (amino acids 1-42), the immunoglobulin-like region (amino acids 42-144), and the C-terminal region (amino acids 145-204) (Rossini2011VSTM2L). The immunoglobulin-like region is crucial for the protein's activity, as it is responsible for binding to the neuroprotective peptide humanin (HN) and inhibiting its activity (Rossini2011VSTM2L). This region is identified as the core functional domain, capable of completely inhibiting HNG-induced rescue activity, a variant of HN (Rossini2011VSTM2L).

The N-terminal region is essential for the secretion of VSTM2L, as demonstrated by experiments showing that deletion of this region prevents secretion and subsequent inhibition of HNG activity (Rossini2011VSTM2L). VSTM2L is a secreted protein, as indicated by its presence in the culture medium of overexpressing cells and in rodent serum (Rossini2011VSTM2L). The protein's secretion is facilitated by a signal sequence, which is typical for proteins destined for extracellular locations (Rossini2011VSTM2L).

VSTM2L's interaction with other proteins, such as VDAC1 in prostate cancer cells, suggests a role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, although specific structural details related to this interaction are not provided (Yang2024VSTM2L). The protein's structure and interactions highlight its functional significance in both neuroprotection and cancer biology.

## Function
The VSTM2L gene encodes a protein that functions as a secreted antagonist of the neuroprotective peptide humanin (HN). In healthy human cells, VSTM2L is involved in modulating neuroprotective pathways by inhibiting the activity of HN, which is known for its role in protecting neurons from neurotoxic insults (Rossini2011VSTM2L). VSTM2L is highly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the cerebral cortex and pituitary gland, suggesting its involvement in neuronal physiology (Rossini2011VSTM2L).

The protein is secreted and has been detected in human serum, indicating its role as an extracellular antagonist. It interacts with HN by binding to its immunoglobulin-like region, which is crucial for its inhibitory activity (Rossini2011VSTM2L). This interaction is selective for certain residues in HN, such as Cys 8, which is necessary for HN's neuroprotective activity (Rossini2011VSTM2L).

VSTM2L's antagonistic effect on HN suggests it may regulate neuronal survival and viability by modulating HN-mediated neurotrophic activity. However, its inhibitory effects are context-dependent and do not directly cause cell death when overexpressed alone (Rossini2011VSTM2L).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VSTM2L gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders. In prostate cancer, VSTM2L acts as an oncogene by inhibiting ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, through its interaction with VDAC1. This interaction helps maintain mitochondrial homeostasis, promoting cancer cell survival and growth. Suppressing VSTM2L expression sensitizes prostate cancer cells to ferroptosis inducers, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yang2024VSTM2L).

In the context of neurological disorders, VSTM2L is identified as a secreted antagonist of the neuroprotective peptide Humanin. It negatively impacts neuronal survival by inhibiting Humanin's neuroprotective activity, which could have implications for conditions where neuroprotection is compromised, such as Alzheimer's disease (Rossini2011VSTM2L).

Additionally, VSTM2L has been associated with restless legs syndrome (RLS) in patients with migraines. Inhibition of VSTM2L expression in zebrafish models led to symptoms consistent with RLS, suggesting a role in the development and distribution of dopaminergic neurons, which are implicated in RLS pathogenesis (Jiang2022Genomewide). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of VSTM2L across different diseases.

## Interactions
VSTM2L is a protein that participates in several interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It is known to interact with the neuroprotective peptide humanin (HN), acting as a secreted antagonist. VSTM2L can inhibit HN-induced protective activity by forming a complex with HN or its variant HNG, interfering with the prosurvival signal pathway mediated by JAK2 and STAT3. This interaction has been demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization experiments in mammalian cells (Rossini2011VSTM2L).

In prostate cancer cells, VSTM2L interacts with VDAC1 and HK2 proteins. It suppresses the oligomerization of VDAC1, a protein located in the outer membrane of mitochondria, by facilitating the interaction between VDAC1 and Hexokinase 2 (HK2). This interaction is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and cell viability, forming a tripartite complex that includes VSTM2L, VDAC1, and HK2. The presence of VSTM2L enhances the binding affinity between VDAC1 and HK2, thereby inhibiting VDAC1 oligomerization and protecting prostate cancer cells against ferroptosis (Yang2024VSTM2L). These interactions highlight VSTM2L's role in modulating both neuroprotective and oncogenic pathways.
