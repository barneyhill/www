# CDC26

## Overview
CDC26 is a gene that encodes the cell division cycle 26 protein, a critical component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is an essential E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. The CDC26 protein is categorized as part of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) subcomplex within the APC/C, where it plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the complex's structure by interacting with other subunits such as Cdc16 and Cdc27. This stabilization is crucial for the APC/C's function in ubiquitinating and targeting key cell cycle regulators for degradation, thereby ensuring proper cell cycle progression and genomic stability (Curtis2019The; Barford2011Structural). The gene's expression and integrity are significant in clinical contexts, as alterations in CDC26 have been linked to cancer prognosis, highlighting its potential role in tumorigenesis and as a biomarker for patient outcomes (Melloy2019The).

## Structure
The CDC26 protein is a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation. Structurally, CDC26 is involved in stabilizing the Cdc16 subunit within the APC/C through a unique tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-protein interaction. The N-terminal 12 residues of CDC26, which are unstructured in isolation, adopt an extended conformation that interacts with the inner concave groove of the Cdc16 superhelix. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of the complex (Barford2011Structural).

The N-terminal acetylated methionine residue of CDC26 is located within an enclosed chamber formed by the Cdc16 TPR superhelix, rendering the acetyl group inaccessible to bulk solvent. This acetylation is suggested to control the relative stoichiometry of subunits in the multi-subunit complex, preventing recognition and degradation via the Doa10-proteasome pathway (Barford2011Structural).

CDC26 does not have specific domains or prominent folds detailed in the available literature, nor are there mentions of splice variant isoforms or other post-translational modifications beyond acetylation. The protein's role is primarily associated with its interaction and stabilization functions within the APC/C complex (Barford2010Structure).

## Function
CDC26 is a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. The APC/C is responsible for the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of key cell cycle regulators, ensuring proper progression through mitosis and maintaining genomic stability (Curtis2019The; Zhou2016Insights). CDC26 is part of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) subcomplex within the APC/C, which includes other subunits such as Cdc16 and Cdc27. This subcomplex plays a significant role in stabilizing the overall structure of the APC/C, which is essential for its function (Barford2011Structural).

CDC26 interacts with Cdc16 through a unique TPR-protein interaction, which is crucial for the stability of the Cdc16-Cdc26 heterotetramer. This interaction prevents the degradation of CDC26 by the Doa10 E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby controlling the stoichiometry of subunits within the APC/C (Barford2011Structural). CDC26 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, contributing to chromosomal segregation and cell division fidelity (Curtis2019The). Its role in the APC/C is vital for the metaphase to anaphase transition and the progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Curtis2019The).

## Clinical Significance
CDC26 is a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation. Alterations in the CDC26 gene, such as copy number alterations (CNAs), have been associated with cancer prognosis. Specifically, a low copy number of the CDC26 gene is linked to poor patient survival or recurrence-free survival in a pan-kidney cohort (KIPAN) (Melloy2019The). These findings suggest that CDC26 may have cancer subtype-specific impacts, with its altered expression potentially acting as an oncogene in certain contexts (Melloy2019The).

Mutations in APC/C subunits, including CDC26, have been observed across various cancer types. In a study analyzing mutation frequencies, 14% of patients and samples from 11 representative cancers exhibited at least one APC/C mutation, with some cancer subtypes showing mutation frequencies greater than 20% (Melloy2019The). Although specific diseases directly associated with CDC26 mutations are not detailed, the gene's involvement in the APC/C complex suggests its potential role in tumorigenesis due to its impact on cell division and genomic stability (Zhou2016Insights). Future research may explore the use of CDC26 as a biomarker for patient survival or treatment responsiveness (Melloy2019The).

## Interactions
CDC26 is a component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. It physically interacts with several other subunits of the APC/C, including Cdc16, Cdc23, and Cdc27, forming a complex that acts as a ubiquitin ligase for B-type cyclins (Hwang1997A; Zachariae1996Identification). CDC26 stabilizes the association of Cdc16 and Cdc27 within the APC/C, which is essential for the complex's structural integrity and function (Mendenhall1998Regulation; Schwickart2004Swm1Apc13).

The interaction between CDC26 and Cdc16 is particularly notable, as CDC26 stabilizes Cdc16 through a unique tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein interaction. The N-terminal residues of CDC26 interact with the inner concave groove of the Cdc16 superhelix, forming an alpha-helix that mimics a TPR motif, which prevents CDC26 from being recognized and degraded by the Doa10-proteasome pathway (Barford2011Structural).

CDC26 is also part of a stable subcomplex with Swm1/Apc13, Cdc16, and Cdc27, and its association with the APC/C is dependent on Swm1/Apc13 (Schwickart2004Swm1Apc13). These interactions highlight the role of CDC26 in maintaining the stability and function of the APC/C complex.
