# OR2T4

## Overview
The OR2T4 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily T member 4, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. It is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to specific odorants and initiates a signal transduction pathway that leads to the perception of smell. The receptor's ability to interact with a variety of ligands, such as α-pinene, lilial, and undecanal, has been demonstrated through experimental systems, suggesting its involvement in diverse chemical detection processes (Yasi2019Rapid). While the receptor's role in olfactory signaling is established, its broader physiological functions in humans remain an area of active research.

## Function
OR2T4 is an olfactory receptor that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, primarily involved in detecting odor molecules. This receptor is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. The activation of OR2T4 by certain chemicals, such as α-pinene, lilial, and undecanal, has been demonstrated using a yeast-based system, which indicates successful signal transduction through increased GFP expression (Yasi2019Rapid). This suggests that OR2T4 plays a role in detecting specific chemical compounds, although its precise function in human physiology requires further research (Yasi2019Rapid).

The receptor's ability to bind a variety of ligands highlights its potential involvement in diverse chemical detection processes. The yeast-based system used for deorphanization of OR2T4 has shown that it can be activated by a range of structurally diverse chemicals, which may imply a broader role in chemical sensing beyond traditional olfactory functions (Yasi2019Rapid). However, the specific physiological roles of OR2T4 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.
