# SECISBP2

## Overview
SECISBP2 is a gene that encodes the SECIS binding protein 2, a crucial RNA-binding protein involved in the synthesis of selenoproteins. This protein plays a pivotal role in the recoding of the UGA stop codon as selenocysteine (Sec) by binding to the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element in the 3' untranslated region of selenoprotein mRNAs. SECIS binding protein 2 is essential for the incorporation of Sec into selenoproteins, which are vital for various biological functions, including antioxidant defense and thyroid hormone metabolism (Schoenmakers2020Human; FradejasVillar2018Consequences). The protein is characterized by several functional domains, such as the RNA binding domain (RBD) and the Sec incorporation domain (SID), which facilitate its interaction with SECIS elements and ribosomal RNA (FradejasVillar2018Consequences). Mutations in the SECISBP2 gene can lead to a multisystem selenoprotein deficiency disorder, underscoring its importance in human health (Schoenmakers2020Human).

## Function
SECISBP2 (SECIS binding protein 2) is essential for the synthesis of selenoproteins in human cells. It binds to the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of selenoprotein mRNAs, facilitating the recoding of the UGA stop codon as selenocysteine (Sec) (FradejasVillar2018Consequences). This process is crucial for the proper incorporation of Sec into selenoproteins, which are involved in various biological functions, including antioxidant defense and thyroid hormone metabolism (Schoenmakers2020Human).

SECISBP2 interacts with the SECIS element and recruits translation and assembly factors, such as the specialized elongation factor eEFSec, to the ribosome, ensuring efficient Sec incorporation during translation (Gribling-Burrer2017SECIS-binding). The protein contains several functional domains, including the RNA binding domain (RBD) and the Sec incorporation domain (SID), which are critical for its interaction with SECIS elements and ribosomal RNA (FradejasVillar2018Consequences).

In healthy cells, SECISBP2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, playing a role in maintaining cellular redox balance and overall organismal health (Schoenmakers2020Human). Its proper function is vital for the synthesis of at least 25 human selenoproteins, which contribute to processes like antioxidant defense and thyroid hormone metabolism (Schoenmakers2020Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SECISBP2 gene lead to a multisystem selenoprotein deficiency disorder characterized by a range of clinical manifestations. This condition results from impaired synthesis of selenoproteins, which are essential for various biological processes. Individuals with SECISBP2 mutations often present with symptoms such as growth retardation, muscle weakness, and neurocognitive issues, including developmental delays and sensorineural hearing loss (Schoenmakers2020Human). Male infertility due to azoospermia is also observed, linked to deficiencies in testis-enriched selenoproteins crucial for spermatogenesis (Schoenmakers2010Mutations).

The disorder is associated with increased oxidative stress due to reduced antioxidant selenoenzyme levels, leading to conditions like photosensitivity and potentially increased adipose tissue mass (Schoenmakers2010Mutations). Abnormal thyroid hormone levels are common, with elevated free T4 and normal or reduced T3 levels, indicating impaired conversion due to defective selenoprotein synthesis (Schoenmakers2010Mutations). Immune dysfunction is also noted, with impaired T cell proliferation and abnormal cytokine production (Schoenmakers2010Mutations).

Despite attempts at treatment with oral selenium supplementation, clinical outcomes and selenoprotein synthesis generally do not improve significantly. However, some improvement in growth and development has been observed with thyroid hormone and growth hormone treatments in certain cases (Schoenmakers2020Human).

## Interactions
SECISBP2 interacts with both proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate the incorporation of selenocysteine into proteins. It binds to the SECIS element in the 3' untranslated region of selenoprotein mRNAs, which is crucial for the recoding of the UGA stop codon as a selenocysteine codon (Copeland2000A). This interaction is essential for the recruitment of the specialized elongation factor eEFSec and the accommodation of Sec-tRNA into the ribosomal A-site (Caban2012Selenocysteine).

The L7Ae RNA binding motif within SECISBP2 is multifunctional, contributing to both SECIS element binding and ribosome binding. Mutations in this motif can affect ribosome binding and Sec incorporation, indicating distinct but overlapping domains for these functions (Caban2007The). SECISBP2 also interacts with the 28S rRNA, forming a complex that suggests its role in selecting ribosomes for Sec insertion (Copeland2001Insight).

SECISBP2 is involved in the assembly and translation of selenoprotein mRNPs by interacting with the SMN complex and the methylosome. These interactions are necessary for the efficient translation of selenoproteins, such as GPx1, in vivo (Gribling-Burrer2017SECIS-binding). The SMN complex and methylosome are involved in the biogenesis of snRNPs and collaborate for RNP assembly, highlighting the role of SECISBP2 in selenoprotein mRNP assembly and expression (Gribling-Burrer2017SECIS-binding).
