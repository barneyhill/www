# NXPH3

## Overview
NXPH3 is a gene that encodes the protein neurexophilin 3, a member of the neurexophilin family of secreted glycoproteins. These proteins are known for their role in synaptic function through interactions with neurexins, which are essential for synaptic transmission and neural communication. Neurexophilin 3 is characterized by its specific binding to α-neurexins, facilitated by its molecular structure that includes a signal peptide, propeptide region, and mature peptide. This protein is predominantly expressed in cortical excitatory neurons and specific brain regions such as the cortex and cerebellum, where it is implicated in sensorimotor gating and motor coordination. Although NXPH3 is not critical for normal brain architecture, as evidenced by knockout studies, it plays a modulatory role in neuronal circuits, impacting synaptic and cellular functions related to sensorimotor processes (Beglopoulos2005Neurexophilin; Wilson2019Structures).

## Structure
Neurexophilin 3 (NXPH3) is a member of the neurexophilin family, which are secreted glycoproteins that interact with neurexins, playing roles in synaptic function. The molecular structure of NXPH3 includes a signal peptide, a propeptide region, and a mature peptide. The mature form of neurexophilins, including NXPH3, does not consist of two independently folded domains as previously thought. Instead, they are composed of a signal peptide, pro-domain, polybasic cleavage site, and mature fragment (Wilson2019Structures).

NXPH3 binds to the LNS2 SS2À domains of neurexins (Nrxn1-3) with nanomolar affinities, similar to Nxph1, although the I401Q mutation in Nrxn1-3 LNS2 SS2À reduces the binding affinity of Nxph3 (Wilson2019Structures). The binding interactions are characterized by anti-parallel β-strand interactions and additional hydrophobic and polar interactions, contributing to their strong binding affinity (Wilson2019Structures).

NXPH3 is expressed in cortical excitatory neurons, suggesting a cell type-specific role, although the physiological roles of NXPH3 are not as well understood as those of Nxph1 (Wilson2019Structures). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is common in neurexophilins (Wilson2019Structures).

## Function
Neurexophilin 3 (NXPH3) is a protein that functions as a ligand for α-neurexins, which are crucial for synaptic transmission and neural communication. NXPH3 is primarily expressed in specific regions of the brain, including the cortex and cerebellum, and is involved in sensorimotor gating and motor coordination. It is highly localized in neurons within deep cortical layers, the vestibulocerebellum, and Cajal-Retzius cells during development, suggesting its role in primordial neuronal circuits and cortical maturation (Beglopoulos2005Neurexophilin).

NXPH3 binds tightly to α-neurexins, indicating its potential role at synapses, although no changes in synaptic marker protein distribution were observed in knockout mice lacking NXPH3 (Beglopoulos2005Neurexophilin). The protein's interaction with neurexins is regulated by alternative splicing, which may fine-tune synaptic signaling pathways (Wilson2019Structures). Despite its restricted expression, NXPH3 is not essential for normal brain architecture, as knockout mice show no significant structural abnormalities, although they do exhibit impairments in sensorimotor gating and motor coordination (Beglopoulos2005Neurexophilin). These findings suggest that NXPH3 plays a modulatory role in specific neuronal circuits, impacting synaptic and cellular functions related to sensorimotor processes (Beglopoulos2005Neurexophilin).

## Interactions
Neurexophilin 3 (NXPH3) is known to interact specifically with α-neurexins, forming a tight complex that is crucial for synaptic function. These interactions occur with high affinity, in the nanomolar range, and are regulated by alternative splicing at the SS2 site of neurexins, which may allow for isoform-specific signaling pathways (Wilson2019Structures). NXPH3 binds to the LNS2 domain of neurexins, a region distinct from the binding sites of most other neurexin ligands, suggesting a unique role in modulating synaptic interactions (Meng2019Neurexophilin4).

The interaction between NXPH3 and α-neurexins is not ubiquitous but occurs at specific synapses, particularly in neurons located in deep cortical layers and the vestibulocerebellum (Beglopoulos2005Neurexophilin). Despite its restricted expression, NXPH3 does not appear to be essential for maintaining normal brain architecture, as knockout studies have shown no significant structural changes in the brain (Beglopoulos2005Neurexophilin). However, the absence of NXPH3 leads to specific impairments in sensorimotor gating and motor coordination, indicating its functional importance in these processes (Beglopoulos2005Neurexophilin).
