# KLHL14

## Overview
KLHL14 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 14, which is part of the Kelch-like family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a BTB domain, a BACK domain, and multiple Kelch repeats, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and substrate recognition. KLHL14 is primarily involved in ubiquitination pathways, functioning as a substrate-binding subunit of the Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex. It plays a crucial role in regulating B cell receptor signaling and is implicated in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation machinery. The protein is highly expressed in immune tissues, particularly in B cells, and is involved in B cell differentiation and function. Additionally, KLHL14 has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene with significant implications in cancer biology, particularly in thyroid cancer and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where its expression levels are associated with tumor aggressiveness and patient prognosis (Choi2020Regulation; Li2018Kelchlike; Esposito2024KLHL14).

## Structure
KLHL14 is a member of the Kelch-like family of proteins, characterized by several distinct structural domains. The protein contains a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, a BACK domain, and multiple Kelch repeats. The BTB domain is known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, often through dimerization, and is crucial for binding to the Cullin3 subunit of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes (Choi2020Regulation; Esposito2024KLHL14). The Kelch repeats form a β-propeller structure, which is involved in substrate recognition and binding (Esposito2024KLHL14; Li2018Kelchlike). The BACK domain acts as a linker between the BTB and Kelch domains, contributing to the overall structural integrity of the protein (Esposito2024KLHL14).

KLHL14 is highly conserved across species, with a 99.4% identity between mouse and human proteins, indicating its evolutionary importance (Li2018Kelchlike). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of B cell receptor signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Di2020Transcriptomic; Choi2020Regulation). The structural features of KLHL14 suggest its role in protein targeting for ubiquitination and cytoskeletal organization (Di2020Transcriptomic).

## Function
KLHL14 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, primarily functioning as part of the Kelch-like family of proteins. These proteins are known for their roles in protein-protein interactions, often acting as adaptors in ubiquitination pathways. In healthy human cells, KLHL14 is implicated in the regulation of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. It functions as a subunit of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes, promoting the ubiquitylation and turnover of immature glycoforms of BCR subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This activity is crucial for maintaining controlled BCR signaling, which is essential for the development and activation of normal B cell subpopulations (Choi2020Regulation).

KLHL14 is also involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) machinery, where it helps regulate the stability and degradation of BCR subunits, thereby influencing the balance of survival signaling pathways such as NF-κB and PI3 kinase signaling in response to BCR engagement (Choi2020Regulation). The gene is highly expressed in immune tissues, particularly in B cells, and plays a role in controlling B cell differentiation and function (Choi2020Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
KLHL14 has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene with significant implications in various cancers. In thyroid cancer, particularly anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), KLHL14 expression is notably reduced, which is associated with a loss of differentiation and increased tumor aggressiveness. Restoration of KLHL14 expression in transformed thyroid cells has been shown to reduce proliferation and increase apoptosis, highlighting its potential role in tumor suppression (Esposito2024KLHL14).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), KLHL14 is one of the genes associated with patient prognosis. Its expression is positively correlated with immune cell infiltration and negatively correlated with tumor mutational burden, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for predicting response to PD1 antibody therapy. KLHL14 mutations are more frequent in patients achieving complete remission, indicating a potentially favorable impact on treatment outcomes (Jiang2022Identifying; Li2022Clinical).

KLHL14 is also involved in the development of B-1a lymphocytes, with its absence leading to impaired development of these cells in mice, which may have implications for immune function (Li2018Kelchlike). These findings underscore the clinical significance of KLHL14 in cancer and immune-related conditions.

## Interactions
KLHL14, a member of the Kelch-like protein family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions. It functions as a substrate-binding subunit of the Cullin-RING ligase 3 ubiquitin ligase complex, indicating its role in ubiquitination processes (Esposito2024KLHL14). KLHL14 interacts with TorsinA, a protein implicated in dystonia pathogenesis, suggesting a role in neurological functions (Giles2009Printor). This interaction is significant as it may influence the stability and function of TorsinA, although the exact biological implications require further investigation.

In the context of B-cell development, KLHL14 is highly expressed in B cells and is crucial for promoting B-1a cell development while suppressing B-1b cell development. This suggests that KLHL14 may interact with other proteins involved in B-cell differentiation and function (Li2018Kelchlike). Additionally, KLHL14's interaction with TorsinA in neurons highlights its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental processes (Li2018Kelchlike).

KLHL14's role in cancer biology is also notable. It is downregulated in undifferentiated thyroid cancer, where its re-expression reduces cell proliferation and increases apoptosis, indicating potential interactions with proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Esposito2024KLHL14). These interactions underscore KLHL14's potential as a tumor suppressor and its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis.
