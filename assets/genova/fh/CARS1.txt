# CARS1

## Overview
CARS1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase 1, which is a member of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of cysteine to its corresponding tRNA, a critical step in translating genetic information into functional proteins (Cho2020Endogenous). Beyond its primary function in translation, cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase 1 also exhibits cysteine persulfide synthase activity, contributing to cellular redox regulation and immune responses (Fujii2018Persulfide). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in various cellular processes, including immune cell activation through interactions with toll-like receptors (Cho2020Endogenous; Akaike2017CysteinyltRNA). Mutations in the CARS1 gene are linked to several clinical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and immune-related diseases, highlighting its significance in human health (Liu2024A; Kuo2019Cysteinyl-tRNA).

## Structure


## Function
Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (CARS1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the ligation of cysteine to its corresponding tRNA, a process essential for translating genetic information into proteins (Cho2020Endogenous). In healthy human cells, CARS1 is primarily involved in the production of aminoacyl-tRNAs from amino acids and ATP, which is crucial for maintaining the rate and fidelity of protein synthesis (Sung2022Functional).

Beyond its canonical role in translation, CARS1 has been identified to possess cysteine persulfide synthase (CPERS) activity, which involves the production of cysteine persulfide (CysSSH) using cysteine as a substrate. This activity is independent of the aminoacyltransferase reaction and is important for cellular redox regulation and sulfur respiration (Fujii2018Persulfide). CARS1 also plays a significant role in immune responses, where it can activate immune cells by interacting with Toll-like receptors (TLR2/6) on antigen-presenting cells, leading to the activation of dendritic cells and stimulation of immune responses (Cho2020Endogenous).

CARS1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it ensures accurate and efficient protein assembly, vital for cellular function and organismal development (Akaike2017CysteinyltRNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CARS1 gene, which encodes cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, are associated with a range of clinical conditions. Bi-allelic mutations in CARS1 can lead to a multi-system, recessive disorder characterized by microcephaly, developmental delay, brittle hair and nails, and liver dysfunction. These mutations result in a loss-of-function effect, impairing the enzyme's ability to charge tRNA Cys with cysteine, which is crucial for protein synthesis (Jiang2020Human; Kuo2019Cysteinyl-tRNA). Specific variants such as p.Arg341His and p.Ser359Leu have been identified as hypomorphic alleles that reduce enzyme activity, contributing to the disease phenotype (Kuo2019Cysteinyl-tRNA).

In addition to recessive disorders, a novel autosomal-dominant mutation in CARS1, specifically c.2384A>T (p.Glu795Val), has been linked to a parkinsonism/spinocerebellar-ataxia complex. This mutation decreases the aminoacylation activity of the enzyme, affecting protein synthesis and leading to neurodegenerative symptoms (Liu2024A).

Alterations in CARS1 expression are also implicated in neuroinflammation related to Alzheimer's disease. Overexpression of CARS1 activates microglia and the TLR2/MyD88 signaling pathway, contributing to increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cognitive impairment (Qi2024Increased).

## Interactions
Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (CARS1) is involved in several interactions that play significant roles in immune responses and cancer. CARS1 is secreted from cancer cells upon stimulation by TNF-α and the ER stress inducer tunicamycin. Once secreted, CARS1 interacts directly with toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) on antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells. This interaction is facilitated by the UNE-C1 domain within the catalytic domain of CARS1, which serves as the binding domain for TLR2. This interaction activates immune responses and shows a synergistic effect with cancer antigens and immune checkpoint inhibitors in in vivo cancer models (Cho2020Endogenous; Sung2022Functional).

The UNE-C1 domain of CARS1 is thermostable and retains its activity even after boiling, but its activity is eradicated by protease treatment. It interacts with TLR2 and TLR4 receptors, stimulating immune responses. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate the binding of His-tagged CARS1 or UNE-C1 with TLR2-Flag or TLR4-Flag proteins, indicating physical interactions. UNE-C1 enhances antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and Th1-skewed adaptive immune responses in vivo when combined with an antigen (Cho2020Endogenous).
