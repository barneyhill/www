# CHD2

## Overview
CHD2 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2) is a gene that encodes a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family of proteins, which are integral to chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. The CHD2 protein is characterized by the presence of chromodomains, helicase domains, and DNA-binding domains, which enable it to interact with methylated histones and facilitate chromatin dynamics. As a chromatin remodeler, CHD2 plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression by promoting nucleosome turnover and maintaining chromatin accessibility, which is essential for transcriptional regulation and cellular differentiation processes (Eissenberg2012Structural; Siggens2015Transcription-coupled). The protein is involved in various biological functions, including muscle cell differentiation and neurodevelopment, and is implicated in DNA repair mechanisms. Mutations in the CHD2 gene are linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, such as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, and have been associated with certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Lamar2018Chromatin; Wang2022Novel).

## Structure
CHD2 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2) is a member of the CHD family of proteins, characterized by the presence of chromodomains, helicase domains, and DNA-binding domains. The protein contains double chromodomains, which are involved in recognizing methylated histones, specifically interacting with methylated lysines on histone tails (Eissenberg2012Structural). These chromodomains are located at positions 318-414 and 439-501 in the protein sequence (Eissenberg2012Structural).

The chromodomains of CHD2 belong to the OB-fold class, which is common in nucleic acid binding proteins, and are characterized by a three-stranded anti-parallel beta sheet flanked by a C-terminal alpha helix (Eissenberg2012Structural). CHD2 has a distinct insert 3 region in chromodomain 2, which is 15 residues longer than in CHD1, potentially affecting its interaction with methylated histone peptides (Flanagan2007Molecular).

CHD2's interaction with the H3K4me peptide is significantly weaker compared to CHD1, and this binding is not enhanced by other histone modifications (Flanagan2007Molecular). The protein's function and interactions may be influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could regulate its binding to histones (Flanagan2007Molecular). The biochemical function of CHD2 is not fully understood, but it is implicated in transcriptional processes and chromatin remodeling (Flanagan2007Molecular).

## Function
The CHD2 gene encodes a chromatin remodeling protein that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure. This protein is involved in transcription-coupled recruitment to active chromatin regions, such as transcription start sites, enhancer-like regions, and active tRNA genes, where it interacts with RNA polymerase II machinery. CHD2 influences chromatin architecture by promoting nucleosome turnover, which is essential for maintaining chromatin accessibility and facilitating transcriptional regulation (Siggens2015Transcription-coupled).

In muscle cell differentiation, CHD2 acts as a cofactor for the transcription factor MyoD, aiding in the deposition of the histone variant H3.3 at muscle-specific gene promoters. This function is critical for nucleosome disassembly and reassembly, which are necessary for proper gene expression during differentiation (Siggens2015Transcription-coupled).

CHD2 also plays a significant role in neurodevelopment, particularly in the differentiation of cortical interneurons. It binds to promoter-proximal genomic regions enriched with histone modifications like H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, which are associated with active gene expression. CHD2 is involved in maintaining an open chromatin state, facilitating the expression of genes related to neuron differentiation and axonogenesis (Lewis2022Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHD2 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). These conditions are characterized by early-onset, refractory seizures, cognitive decline, and intellectual disabilities. CHD2 mutations often result in protein truncation or disrupt the helicase/ATPase domain, leading to various seizure types, including myoclonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and are frequently accompanied by photosensitivity (De2021Expanding; Lamar2018Chromatin; Wang2022Novel).

CHD2-related disorders also include autism spectrum disorder (ASD), developmental delay, and intellectual disability, with some patients exhibiting behavioral problems and psychomotor regression. The phenotypic variability among individuals with CHD2 mutations suggests the influence of additional genetic or epigenetic factors (De2021Expanding; Chénier2014CHD2; Wilson2021CHD2Related).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, CHD2 mutations have been implicated in certain cancers, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where they may contribute to cancer development by disrupting the regulation of active gene transcription (Rodríguez2015Mutations). The gene's role in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling further links it to various pathologies (Lamar2018Chromatin).

## Interactions
CHD2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. It specifically interacts with the histone variant H3.3, facilitating its incorporation into chromatin at myogenic gene loci, which is crucial for myogenic differentiation (Harada2012Chd2). This interaction is dependent on the presence of the chromodomain in CHD2, as mutants lacking this domain fail to co-immunoprecipitate with H3.3 (Harada2012Chd2).

CHD2 also interacts with the myogenic transcription factor MyoD, which is essential for its recruitment to myogenic gene promoters. This interaction is observed in both undifferentiated and differentiated muscle cells, indicating its role in facilitating differentiation-dependent gene expression (Harada2012Chd2).

In the context of DNA repair, CHD2 is recruited to sites of DNA damage through its interaction with PARP1. This recruitment is crucial for the assembly of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair complexes, as CHD2 interacts with the KU70-KU80 dimer and facilitates the recruitment of other NHEJ factors like XRCC4 (Luijsterburg2016PARP1). These interactions highlight CHD2's multifaceted role in chromatin dynamics and gene regulation.
