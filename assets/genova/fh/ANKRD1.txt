# ANKRD1

## Overview
ANKRD1, or ankyrin repeat domain 1, is a gene that encodes the cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP), a multifunctional protein primarily involved in muscle cell function and integrity. CARP is characterized by its ankyrin repeat motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and is categorized as a transcriptional regulator due to its role in modulating gene expression. The protein is predominantly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, where it contributes to the structural and functional maintenance of the sarcomere, the fundamental unit of muscle contraction. ANKRD1 is part of the muscle ankyrin repeat protein (MARP) family and is known for its mechanosensitive properties, responding to mechanical stress by altering its expression levels. This gene is implicated in various cardiovascular conditions, including dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiac health and disease (DuboscqBidot2010078; Moulik2009ANKRD1; Xu2024Pancancer).

## Structure
ANKRD1, also known as cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP), is characterized by its ankyrin repeat motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and are conserved across species (Kojic2011Muscle). The protein contains a coiled-coil domain at the N-terminus, which facilitates dimerization, forming antiparallel homo-dimers through this domain (Lun2014Probing). The C-terminal region of ANKRD1 includes four ankyrin repeat motifs, with the second repeat containing a conserved titin-binding motif (Miller2003The). These ankyrin repeats interact with the N2A region of titin, a giant sarcomeric protein, and are crucial for the protein's role in muscle structure and signaling (Lun2014Probing).

ANKRD1 is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by protein kinases such as PKCa, which may influence its function and interactions (Lun2014Probing). The protein also contains nuclear localization signals, allowing it to function in both the nucleus and myofibrils (Lun2014Probing). ANKRD1 has splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and localization, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Miller2003The).

## Function
ANKRD1, also known as cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP), is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in muscle cells. It plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression, muscle development, and response to mechanical stress. ANKRD1 is typically localized in the nucleus and sarcomere of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, where it interacts with other proteins to modulate muscle function and integrity (Moulik2009ANKRD1).

In healthy human cells, ANKRD1 is expressed in tissues such as the heart, liver, and lung, suggesting its involvement in normal cellular functions (Jiménez2017The). It is part of the muscle ankyrin repeat protein (MARP) family, which is associated with myofibrillar assembly, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and maintenance of myocardial structure (Xu2024Pancancer). ANKRD1 is also known to be a mechanosensitive gene, with its expression being upregulated in response to mechanical stretch, particularly in the absence of desmin, through the Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway (Mohamed2011Loss).

The protein's role in muscle stress responses and hypertrophy regulation is further supported by its regulation by NF-κB and its upregulation during muscle cell differentiation (Chagula2020Ankyrins). These functions highlight ANKRD1's importance in maintaining muscle cell integrity and responding to physiological changes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ANKRD1 gene are linked to several cardiovascular diseases. ANKRD1 is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a condition characterized by left ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction. Mutations in ANKRD1, such as p.Thr116Met, p.Ala276Val, and others, have been identified in both familial and sporadic cases of DCM, accounting for approximately 2% of cases (DuboscqBidot2010078). These mutations often result in altered protein interactions and function, contributing to the pathophysiology of DCM (Moulik2009ANKRD1).

ANKRD1 is also implicated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), where mutations like Pro52Ala and Thr123Met increase the binding of the encoded protein to titin and myopalladin, potentially leading to abnormal protein localization and cardiac muscle dysfunction (Arimura2009Cardiac). Overexpression of ANKRD1 can cause structural malformations in embryonic hearts and progressive diastolic dysfunction in adults, indicating its role in the pathogenesis of multiple cardiac disease phenotypes (Murphy2020Advancing; Piroddi2019Myocardial).

ANKRD1 is also associated with total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR), a congenital heart defect. A specific missense mutation, c.347C>T, has been linked to increased protein stability and transcriptional repression, suggesting a role in TAPVR pathogenesis (Cinquetti2008Transcriptional).

## Interactions
ANKRD1, also known as cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP), is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for cardiac function. In the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes, ANKRD1 interacts with titin, contributing to sarcomere stability and mechanotransduction (AlmodóvarGarcía2014ANKRD1). It also binds to myopalladin and cardiac calsequestrin-2 (CASQ2), which is important for calcium release and excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle cells (TORRADO2005ANKRD1). The interaction with CASQ2 is specific and involves hydrophobic forces, with binding sites identified on both proteins (TORRADO2005ANKRD1).

In the nucleus, ANKRD1 acts as a transcriptional regulator. It interacts with nucleolin to regulate MMP13 expression, potentially forming a complex with YB-1 to repress transcription (AlmodóvarGarcía2014ANKRD1). ANKRD1 also interacts with the p53 tumor suppressor protein, enhancing p53-mediated transcriptional activation (Kojic2010A). This interaction suggests a role for ANKRD1 as a co-activator of p53, influencing pathways related to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Kojic2010A).

ANKRD1's interactions with these proteins highlight its multifaceted role in maintaining cardiac muscle integrity and regulating gene expression in response to physiological stress.
