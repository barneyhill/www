# NGRN

## Overview
The NGRN gene encodes the protein neugrin, which is associated with neurite outgrowth. Neugrin is involved in the development and maintenance of neural structures, playing a crucial role in the growth and differentiation of neurites, which are essential for proper neuronal connectivity and function. As a cytoplasmic protein, neugrin is implicated in various cellular processes that influence neural plasticity and synaptic function. Research has highlighted its involvement in neurological conditions such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, where alterations in NGRN expression and function may contribute to disease pathophysiology (Walton2013The; Sun2021Association).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NGRN gene have been implicated in several neurological conditions. In schizophrenia, risk variants in the NGRN gene, specifically the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs12541 and rs12807809, have been associated with changes in brain structure and function. Individuals with the rs12541 TT genotype exhibit increased neural activity in brain regions associated with working memory, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Walton2013The). Additionally, carriers of the rs12807809 C allele show reduced cortical thickness in specific brain regions, suggesting a potential risk for structural brain changes linked to schizophrenia (Walton2013The).

In Alzheimer's disease, NGRN gene expression is correlated with synaptic damage, a key feature of the disease. The expression of NGRN is associated with amyloid and tau pathology, and it correlates with the Clinical Dementia Rating, indicating its potential role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. The transcriptional regulation of NGRN may be involved in selective synaptic damage pathways, highlighting its significance in Alzheimer's pathology (Sun2021Association).
