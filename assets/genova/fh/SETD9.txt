# SETD9

## Overview
SETD9 is a gene that encodes the protein SET domain containing 9, which is a member of the SET domain family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their involvement in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation through histone methylation. SET domain containing 9 is specifically known for its role as a histone methyltransferase, which catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups to lysine residues on histone proteins, thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene transcription. The activity of SETD9 is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and differentiation, and it has been implicated in several signaling pathways, such as the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and regulation of SETD9 is important for elucidating its potential roles in health and disease.
