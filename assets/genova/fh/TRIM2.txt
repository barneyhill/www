# TRIM2

## Overview
TRIM2 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 2, which is a member of the TRIM-NHL protein family and functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by a tripartite motif that includes a RING finger domain, B-box zinc finger domains, a coiled-coil region, and a beta-propeller (NHL) domain, which collectively facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes (Ylikallio2013Deficiency; Esposito2022Divergent). TRIM2 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a critical role in neuronal health by regulating the degradation of neurofilament light-chain and other proteins involved in neuronal polarization and axon formation (Cao2019TRIM2). Mutations in the TRIM2 gene have been linked to neurological disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2R, highlighting its importance in maintaining neuronal integrity and function (Ylikallio2013Deficiency; Li2020A).

## Structure
TRIM2 is a protein characterized by a tripartite motif that includes a RING finger domain, B-box zinc finger domains, and a coiled-coil (CC) region, as well as a beta-propeller (NHL) domain (Ylikallio2013Deficiency). The RING domain of TRIM2 forms a homodimeric structure stabilized by a four-helix bundle, which is crucial for its E3 ligase activity (Esposito2022Divergent). This domain interacts with ubiquitin and E2 enzymes, forming a complex with UBE2D1 and ubiquitin, where specific interactions such as salt bridges and hydrogen bonds are essential for stability (Esposito2022Divergent).

The NHL domain of TRIM2 adopts a canonical six-bladed β-propeller topology, which is involved in interactions with macromolecules and is implicated in RNA-binding, although TRIM2 may not bind RNA in the same way as its homologues due to structural differences (Chaikuad2022Comparative). The coiled-coil domain is involved in homo interactions and complex formation, with mutations in this region affecting protein stability (Ylikallio2013Deficiency).

TRIM2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, which is integral to its function as an E3 ligase (Esposito2022Divergent). The protein may exist in different splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity.

## Function
TRIM2 is a member of the TRIM-NHL protein family, which is a subfamily of the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase family. It is highly expressed in the central nervous system and plays a crucial role in neuronal polarization by targeting neurofilament light-chain (NF-L) for ubiquitination, a process essential for axon formation (Cao2019TRIM2). In healthy cells, TRIM2 is primarily associated with maintaining neuronal health and preventing neurodegeneration. It achieves this by mediating the degradation of the pro-apoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma-2 interacting mediator (Bim) during ischemic events, thereby regulating cell death. The phosphorylation of TRIM2 by the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway influences its interaction with Bim (Cao2019TRIM2).

TRIM2 is involved in the regulation of neuronal cytoskeletal architecture, which is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of neurons (Napolitano2011TRIM). The protein's function is facilitated by its ability to self-interact, heterointeract, and act as a scaffold, allowing it to participate in diverse biological processes (Napolitano2011TRIM). These interactions and modifications are vital for the protein's role in cellular homeostasis and neuronal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRIM2 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, most notably Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2R (CMT2R), a rare form of inherited peripheral neuropathy. These mutations can lead to early-onset axonal neuropathy, characterized by neurofilament accumulation and axonal degeneration, as observed in both human patients and mouse models (Ylikallio2013Deficiency; Li2020A). In particular, compound heterozygous mutations, such as a missense mutation (E227V) and a frameshift mutation, have been identified in patients, resulting in significant TRIM2 deficiency and increased susceptibility to viral infections (Sarute2019TRIM2; Ylikallio2013Deficiency).

TRIM2 mutations can also lead to neurodegenerative symptoms due to the buildup of neurofilament light chain (NF-L) in axons, causing axonal swelling and progressive neurodegeneration (Goyani2021TRIMNHL). The absence of TRIM2 in motor and sensory neurons makes distal axons particularly vulnerable to degeneration, contributing to the clinical manifestations of neuropathy (Li2020A). Additionally, TRIM2 has been implicated in increased expression levels in Alzheimer's disease and certain cancers, such as osteosarcoma and epithelial ovarian cancer, suggesting a broader role in disease pathogenesis (Goyani2021TRIMNHL).

## Interactions
TRIM2 interacts with several proteins, playing significant roles in various cellular processes. It forms a complex with the E2 conjugating enzyme UBE2D1 and ubiquitin, where specific residues in the TRIM2 RING domain are involved in forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with ubiquitin. This interaction is crucial for its catalytic activity, facilitating ubiquitin transfer (Esposito2022Divergent). TRIM2 also interacts with TRIM3, enhancing TRIM3's catalytic activity when they form heterodimers. This interaction is mediated by the filamin domain of TRIM2 and the coiled-coil domain of TRIM3, and it has been shown that TRIM3 becomes polyubiquitinated when coexpressed with TRIM2 (Esposito2022Divergent).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma, TRIM2 interacts with the Snail1 protein, directly deubiquitinating and stabilizing it. This interaction is crucial for the proliferation and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma cells, as Snail1 plays a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Lin2020TRIM2).

TRIM2 also interacts with the signal regulatory protein α (SIRPA), which is involved in phagocytosis. This interaction is important for TRIM2's antiviral activity against New World arenaviruses, as it helps block virus entry into cells (Sarute2019TRIM2).
