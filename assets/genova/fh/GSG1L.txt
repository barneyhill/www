# GSG1L

## Overview
The GSG1L gene encodes a protein known as GSG1-like, which functions as an auxiliary subunit of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), integral to fast excitatory neurotransmission in the brain. As a member of the claudin family, GSG1-like is a tetraspanning membrane protein characterized by four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops, distinguishing it from other AMPAR auxiliary subunits such as TARPs and cornichons (CNIHs) (Gu2016GSG1L; Perozzo2023GSG1Lcontaining). The protein plays a critical role in modulating AMPAR kinetics by influencing receptor desensitization and recovery, thereby impacting synaptic transmission and plasticity (Kamalova2020AMPA). GSG1L's interactions with AMPAR subunits, particularly GluA1 and GluA2, and its regulatory effects on AMPAR trafficking and synaptic delivery underscore its importance in maintaining normal synaptic function (Gu2016GSG1L). Alterations in GSG1L expression have been linked to neurological conditions such as epilepsy, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Pfisterer2020Identification).

## Structure
The GSG1L protein is a member of the claudin family and functions as an auxiliary subunit of AMPA receptors. It is a tetraspanning membrane protein with four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops, sharing a similar claudin membrane topology with TARPs (Gu2016GSG1L; Perozzo2023GSG1Lcontaining). The primary structural distinction between GSG1L and TARPs is the length of the first extracellular loop (ExL1), which is longer in GSG1L and consists of variable-sized flexible loops between four β-strands (Perozzo2023GSG1Lcontaining).

GSG1L lacks the extracellular helix found in TARPs and instead has a longer second transmembrane domain extending to the extracellular space (Kamalova2020AMPA). The β1-β2 loop in GSG1L is longer than in TARPs, and its densities reach towards the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of AMPA receptors (Kamalova2020AMPA). This structural configuration contributes to its unique functional properties, such as slowing AMPAR desensitization and recovery from desensitization (Kamalova2020AMPA; Perozzo2023GSG1Lcontaining).

GSG1L can form complexes with AMPARs at a stoichiometry of two GSG1L proteins per AMPAR tetramer, often co-assembling with other auxiliary subunits like TARPs or cornichons (CNIHs) (Kamalova2020AMPA; Perozzo2023GSG1Lcontaining). The protein's interactions with AMPARs are mediated through allosteric sites on the lower lobe of the AMPAR LBD (Perozzo2023GSG1Lcontaining).

## Function
The GSG1L gene encodes a protein that functions as an auxiliary subunit of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which are crucial for fast excitatory neurotransmission in the brain. GSG1L is unique among AMPAR auxiliary subunits due to its strong negative modulatory function. It regulates AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission by speeding up deactivation and desensitization kinetics in hippocampal CA1 neurons, contrasting with other auxiliary subunits like TARPs and CNIHs (Gu2016GSG1L). GSG1L also inhibits the CNIH2-induced slowing of AMPARs, affecting the kinetics of AMPARs by stabilizing the desensitized state and delaying recovery from desensitization (Kamalova2020AMPA).

GSG1L is involved in the regulation of AMPAR trafficking, reducing their surface expression and synaptic delivery, which results in decreased amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) (Gu2016GSG1L). This protein is expressed in specific brain regions, such as the anterior thalamus, and plays a role in synaptic plasticity and memory, as evidenced by deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) and behavioral abnormalities in knockout models (Kamalova2020AMPA; Gu2016GSG1L). GSG1L's regulatory effects on AMPARs are crucial for maintaining normal synaptic function and plasticity (Gu2016GSG1L).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GSG1L gene have been implicated in several neurological conditions, particularly epilepsy. GSG1L is one of the most dysregulated gene families in epilepsy samples, with its upregulation noted in specific neuronal subtypes. This upregulation is thought to decrease the conductance of AMPA receptors, potentially serving a protective role by reducing the strength of excitatory synapses in hyperactive network states, such as those seen in epilepsy (Pfisterer2020Identification). The dysregulation of GSG1L, along with other AMPA receptor auxiliary subunits, is associated with the hyperexcitability characteristic of epileptic seizures, suggesting its involvement in the pathophysiology of epilepsy (Pfisterer2020Identification).

In addition to epilepsy, alterations in GSG1L expression or function may impact neuropsychiatric conditions through its effects on the central autonomic network (CAN). GSG1L is expressed in the CAN, and its ablation in mice leads to increased heart rate and hyperactivity, indicating a potential link between GSG1L dysregulation and CAN-related disorders (Garrett2022A). These findings suggest that GSG1L plays a significant role in maintaining normal synaptic transmission and that its dysregulation could contribute to various neurological and psychiatric disorders.

## Interactions
GSG1L interacts specifically with AMPA receptor subunits, particularly GluA1 and GluA2, forming complexes that influence receptor kinetics and synaptic transmission. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated robust interactions between GSG1L and the GluA1 subunit in HEK cells, while similar interactions were observed with GluA2, indicating that GSG1L forms a complex with these AMPA receptor subunits (Gu2016GSG1L; Shanks2012Differences). GSG1L does not interact with kainate receptor subunits such as GluK1 and GluK2, highlighting its specificity for AMPA receptors (Gu2016GSG1L; Shanks2012Differences).

GSG1L also interacts with other proteins within the AMPA receptor complex, including TARPs and CNIH2. It can reverse the effects of CNIH2 on AMPA receptor deactivation kinetics without preventing CNIH2 from binding to AMPARs (Gu2016GSG1L). GSG1L's interaction with TARPs, such as γ2, is competitive, as both proteins bind with comparable affinities to the GluA1 core (Yu2023γ2). These interactions suggest that GSG1L plays a unique role in modulating AMPA receptor kinetics and synaptic transmission by influencing receptor trafficking and localization (Gu2016GSG1L; Perozzo2023GSG1Lcontaining).
