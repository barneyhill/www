# SPHK1

## Overview
SPHK1, or sphingosine kinase 1, is a gene that encodes the enzyme sphingosine kinase 1, a key player in the sphingolipid metabolic pathway. This enzyme is classified as a kinase, specifically involved in the phosphorylation of sphingosine to produce sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a potent signaling lipid. S1P is crucial for regulating diverse cellular processes, including proliferation, survival, and migration, by acting through specific G protein-coupled receptors (Hait2006Sphingosine; Alemany2007Regulation). The SPHK1 gene is expressed in various tissues and is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, such as cardiovascular and nervous system development, immune responses, and cancer progression (Alemany2007Regulation; BRYAN2008Regulation). Due to its significant role in cell signaling and disease, SPHK1 is a potential target for therapeutic interventions in conditions like cancer and inflammatory diseases (Zheng2019The).

## Structure
The SPHK1 protein, also known as sphingosine kinase 1, has a two-domain architecture consisting of an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD). The NTD contains a nucleotide binding site and is composed of six β-strands and six α-helices organized in an α/β/α sandwich. The CTD hosts the sphingosine binding site and contains 11 β-strands organized as a two-layer β-sandwich. The catalytic center is located in a cleft formed at the inter-domain junction (Adams2016Sphingosine).

The SPHK1 protein has three splice variants: SPHK1a, SPHK1b, and SPHK1c, which share the same catalytic region but differ in the N-terminal sequence length (Zhang2020Investigating). The structure of SPHK1 reveals plasticity in the β-phosphate binding T-loop, which may play a role in the catalytic process by allowing conformational changes. The lipid substrate access involves a potential opening and closing mechanism of helices-α7/8, which form a flap over the sphingosine binding site (Adams2016Sphingosine).

SPHK1 is suggested to have a dimeric quaternary structure through NTD-NTD engagement, with the β2-α2 loop involved in cross-subunit interactions (Adams2016Sphingosine). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its regulatory mechanisms (Adams2016Sphingosine).

## Function
Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) is a critical enzyme in the regulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels, a lipid signaling molecule that influences various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, SPHK1 is primarily located in the cytosol but can translocate to the plasma membrane upon activation by external stimuli such as growth factors and cytokines. This translocation is often mediated by phosphorylation events, notably at the Ser225 site, which enhances its enzymatic activity and facilitates its role in cellular signaling (Hait2006Sphingosine; Pitson2003Activation).

SPHK1-generated S1P acts in both autocrine and paracrine manners, binding to specific G protein-coupled receptors to regulate cell proliferation, survival, and migration. It plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating the 'sphingolipid rheostat', which balances levels of pro-apoptotic ceramide and pro-survival S1P, thus promoting cell survival and growth (Hait2006Sphingosine; Alemany2007Regulation).

SPHK1 is involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of calcium signaling, cell cycle progression, and responses to environmental stressors. Its activity is crucial for the development and function of the cardiovascular and nervous systems, as well as in immune responses and inflammation (Alemany2007Regulation; BRYAN2008Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SPHK1 gene are implicated in various cancers, where it often correlates with poor prognosis and increased malignancy. In breast cancer, SPHK1 expression is higher in estrogen receptor-negative tumors, which is associated with a worse prognosis and lower survival rates (Ruckhäberle2007Microarray). Similarly, in bladder cancer, elevated SPHK1 expression is linked to aggressive tumor subtypes and poorer overall survival, with SPHK1 playing a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis (Kao2024SPHK1). In pancreatic cancer, SPHK1 upregulation is associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance, influenced by interactions with miR-506 (Li2016Downregulated).

SPHK1 is also overexpressed in colorectal cancer, where it contributes to metastasis and poor survival through the activation of pathways like NF-κB and Stat3 (Bao2017Sphingosine). In melanoma, SPHK1 is involved in tumor immune evasion by regulating the MTA3-PD-L1 axis, impacting patient outcomes in response to immunotherapy (Lau2022Sphingosine). Across various cancers, SPHK1's role in promoting cell proliferation, migration, and survival makes it a potential target for anticancer therapy, although no SPHK1 inhibitors have been clinically approved (Zheng2019The).

## Interactions
SPHK1 (sphingosine kinase 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with PKR (Protein Kinase R), where phosphorylated SPHK1 suppresses PKR activation by binding to its catalytic domain, preventing PKR homodimerization and further activation. This interaction acts as a negative regulatory mechanism, balancing PKR's pro-apoptotic signaling and promoting cell survival pathways (Qiao2020Cell).

SPHK1 also interacts with TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6) in colorectal cancer, where it promotes autophagy-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This interaction involves TRAF6-induced ubiquitination of ULK1 and Beclin1, crucial for cancer cell migration and metastasis (Chen2023SPHK1).

In the context of sepsis-associated liver injury, SPHK1 interacts with calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II-δ (CaMKII-δ), regulating the phosphorylation of HDAC4, which is essential for its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This interaction is significant in modulating HMGB1 translocation and acetylation (Tian2020Sphingosine).

SPHK1's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in regulating stress responses, cell survival, and disease progression through various signaling pathways.
