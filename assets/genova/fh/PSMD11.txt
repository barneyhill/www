# PSMD11

## Overview
PSMD11 is a gene that encodes the protein proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 11, also known as Rpn6, which is a crucial component of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome complex. This protein plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis within eukaryotic cells. As a non-ATPase subunit, PSMD11 is involved in the assembly and stability of the proteasome, influencing its activity and efficiency in degrading misfolded or damaged proteins. The protein is characterized by a PCI (Proteasome, COP9, eIF3) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions necessary for the proteasome's function. PSMD11 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and stress responses, and its dysregulation is associated with several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Lokireddy2015cAMPinduced; Moreno2009Twohybrid; Zhao2021Generation).

## Structure
PSMD11 is a protein consisting of 422 amino acids and features a PCI (Proteasome, COP9, eIF3) domain at its C-terminus, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions and the assembly of the proteasome lid (Moreno2009Twohybrid). The PCI domain is a common structural motif found in several proteasome subunits, facilitating the organization and stability of the proteasome complex. This domain is involved in the interaction with other proteins, such as the AMPK complex, specifically with the AMPKα2 and AMPKβ2 subunits, although the interaction with AMPKβ2 is unique to PSMD11, indicating that regions outside the PCI domain may also play a role (Moreno2009Twohybrid).

Post-translational modifications of PSMD11 include phosphorylation, which can be mediated by AMPK and PKA (protein kinase A). AMPK can phosphorylate PSMD11 both in vitro and in vivo, although the exact phosphorylation site remains unidentified (Moreno2009Twohybrid). PKA phosphorylates PSMD11 at serine 14, enhancing the proteasome's ability to degrade ubiquitinated proteins and increasing its peptidase activity (Lokireddy2015cAMPinduced). These modifications are significant for regulating the protein's function within the proteasome complex.

## Function
PSMD11, also known as Rpn6, is a subunit of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome, a complex crucial for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. It plays a significant role in maintaining protein homeostasis by regulating the turnover of ubiquitinated proteins, which is essential for various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and stress responses (Lokireddy2015cAMPinduced; Zhao2021Generation). 

In healthy human cells, PSMD11 is involved in the assembly and stability of the proteasome, influencing its activity and efficiency. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to the degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins, thus preventing cellular dysfunction and promoting organismal health (Lokireddy2015cAMPinduced). The phosphorylation of PSMD11 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) enhances the proteasome's ability to degrade ubiquitinated proteins, ATP, and small peptides, particularly under conditions that activate PKA (Lokireddy2015cAMPinduced). This phosphorylation occurs at the Ser14 site of PSMD11 and is shown to increase the degradation of aggregation-prone proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Lokireddy2015cAMPinduced). This regulatory mechanism highlights the importance of PSMD11 in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and its potential role in therapeutic approaches for proteotoxic diseases.

## Clinical Significance
PSMD11 has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In cancer, PSMD11 is frequently overexpressed, which is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancer types, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) (Li2021Integrated; Larsson2022Pancancer; Zhou2021Prognostic). High expression levels of PSMD11 correlate with decreased overall survival and recurrence-free survival in PDAC patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Zhou2021Prognostic).

In neurodegenerative diseases, PSMD11 plays a role in the degradation of misfolded proteins. Phosphorylation of the PSMD11 subunit enhances proteasome activity, promoting the degradation of proteins associated with conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases (Lokireddy2015cAMPinduced). This suggests that modulating PSMD11 activity could be a therapeutic strategy for these diseases.

PSMD11 is also involved in neurological conditions such as epilepsy. Its expression is down-regulated in the hippocampus of epileptic mice, and its regulation through specific pathways may alleviate epilepsy progression (Li2023PSMD8). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PSMD11 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
PSMD11, a non-ATPase subunit of the 26S proteasome, participates in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It is a component of the lid of the 19S regulatory particle, where it interacts with Rpt-6 of the ATPase ring and the a-2 subunit of the 20S core particle, acting as a molecular clamp to maintain the integrity of the proteasome complex (Zhao2021Generation).

PSMD11 also interacts with the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex. It has been identified as a strong interaction partner of the AMPKβ2 subunit and shows interaction with AMPKα2. These interactions were confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells, suggesting a potential regulatory role in AMPK signaling pathways (Moreno2009Twohybrid).

In the context of circadian clock regulation, PSMD11 is part of the NRON complex and interacts specifically with KPNB1 and CRY1, but not with PER2 or CRY2. This interaction is significant for the nuclear translocation of circadian clock proteins, affecting the CRY1:CRY2 ratio and thereby influencing circadian rhythms (CalKayitmazbatir2023PSMD11).

Additionally, PSMD11 undergoes phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), which enhances proteasome activity and the degradation of misfolded proteins. This phosphorylation occurs at serine 14 and is crucial for the proteasome's function in protein degradation (Lokireddy2015cAMPinduced).
