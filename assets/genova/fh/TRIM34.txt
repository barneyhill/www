# TRIM34

## Overview
TRIM34 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 34, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. This family is characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes a RING finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, collectively known as the RBCC motif. The TRIM34 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including immune response regulation, apoptosis, and antiviral defense. It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a role facilitated by its RING domain, and is known to localize primarily in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. TRIM34 plays a significant role in restricting certain HIV-1 capsid mutants and maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier, thereby contributing to colon health. Its expression and activity are implicated in several diseases, including colon inflammation and tumorigenesis, and it is inducible by type I interferons and viral infections (An2020TRIM34; Ohainle2020TRIM34; Lian2020TRIM34).

## Structure
TRIM34 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes an N-terminal RBCC motif, which consists of a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region (An2020TRIM34; Ohainle2019TRIM34). The RING domain is associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is a common feature among TRIM proteins (An2020TRIM34). TRIM34 also contains a C-terminal B30.2 PRY/SPRY domain, which is important for its role in viral restriction (Twentyman2023Primate).

TRIM34 has at least three isoforms: a medium isoform with the RBCC-B30.2 domain, a long isoform with RBCC-RBCC-B30.2 domains, and a short isoform containing only the RBCC domain (An2020TRIM34). The medium isoform is the predominant form in various human organs (An2020TRIM34).

TRIM34 is not rapidly evolving in primates and has a deletion in the v1 region of the B30.2 PRY/SPRY domain, which affects its specificity for capsid recognition (Twentyman2023Primate; Ohainle2019TRIM34). This deletion distinguishes it from its paralog TRIM5α, which has undergone positive selection in this region (Twentyman2023Primate). TRIM34 localizes to the mitochondria and is involved in apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway (An2020TRIM34).

## Function
TRIM34 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, characterized by a RING domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, which are involved in various cellular processes, including immune response regulation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, TRIM34 is known to localize primarily in the cytoplasm and partially in the mitochondria, where it plays a role in mediating apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. This is evidenced by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c, which are early events in apoptosis (An2020TRIM34).

TRIM34 is also implicated in antiviral defense, particularly in restricting certain HIV-1 capsid mutants. It acts as a restriction factor for the N74D capsid mutant, inhibiting replication at a step before reverse transcription. This activity is independent of interferon stimulation and involves interaction with TRIM5α, another TRIM family member, to enhance its restriction capabilities (Ohainle2020TRIM34).

In the context of colon health, TRIM34 plays a protective role by maintaining the integrity of the inner mucus layer, which is crucial for preventing colon inflammation and tumorigenesis (Lian2020TRIM34).

## Clinical Significance
TRIM34 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier and its involvement in immune responses. Alterations in TRIM34 expression are associated with increased susceptibility to colon inflammation and tumorigenesis. TRIM34-deficient mice exhibit impaired exocytosis of Muc2, a critical component of the mucus barrier in the colon, leading to a compromised barrier and increased vulnerability to colitis and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (Lian2020TRIM34). In humans, lower TRIM34 expression is observed in patients with ulcerative colitis compared to healthy controls, and high TRIM34 levels correlate with better survival outcomes in rectal adenocarcinoma patients (Lian2020TRIM34).

TRIM34 is also involved in the immune response, particularly in antiviral actions. It is inducible by type I interferons and certain viral infections, such as influenza, and has been associated with the regulation of apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway (An2020TRIM34). Although TRIM34 has been linked to Parkinson's disease through differential methylation patterns, its genetic role in the disease remains unclear, with no significant associations found in early-onset Parkinson's disease studies (Li2021Genetic).

## Interactions
TRIM34 interacts with TRIM5α to form a functional complex that restricts lentiviral capsids, including those of HIV and SIV. This interaction is crucial for TRIM34's antiviral activity, as it requires TRIM5α to effectively restrict the N74D capsid mutant of HIV-1. The dependency of TRIM34 on TRIM5α is demonstrated by the loss of restriction activity when TRIM5α is knocked out or knocked down (Ohainle2020TRIM34; Ohainle2019TRIM34). 

TRIM34 and TRIM5α colocalize in cytoplasmic bodies and are more frequently associated with the N74D capsids than with wild-type HIV-1 capsids, suggesting a cooperative interaction in targeting these viral structures (Ohainle2020TRIM34). The interaction between TRIM34 and TRIM5α may involve heteromultimeric complexes that enhance their restriction capabilities (Ohainle2020TRIM34). 

TRIM34 does not directly interact with the N74D capsid but may stabilize TRIM5α, allowing it to restrict the capsid without altering its binding specificity. This stabilization could affect the kinetics of capsid entry into the nucleus, highlighting a potential role for TRIM34 in modulating TRIM5α's function (Ohainle2020TRIM34).
