# PJA2

## Overview
PJA2, or praja ring finger ubiquitin ligase 2, is a gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein involved in the regulation of various cellular processes through protein ubiquitination. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the praja ring finger ubiquitin ligase 2 protein plays a critical role in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination, thereby influencing their stability, localization, and activity within the cell. This protein is implicated in several signaling pathways, including the Hippo and ERK1/2 pathways, where it modulates key components such as MOB1 and KSR1, respectively (Lignitto2013Proteolysis; Rinaldi2016praja2). Additionally, PJA2 is involved in the regulation of type I interferon signaling by interacting with Janus kinases, further highlighting its role in immune response modulation (Schiefer2023Proximal). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, colorectal cancer, and kidney cancer, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Rinaldi2024Downregulation; Gong2020Regulatory; Chen2023PJA2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PJA2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), colorectal cancer (CRC), and kidney cancer. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, PJA2 is involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory processes. Overexpression of PJA2 inhibits the expression of AD marker genes such as App, Mapt, and Gsap, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for AD treatment (Gong2020Regulatory).

In colorectal cancer, PJA2 acts as a tumor suppressor. It is significantly downregulated in CRC, and this downregulation is associated with advanced clinicopathological features and poorer prognosis. PJA2 suppresses CRC cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis by controlling the degradation and stability of HDAC2, a histone deacetylase involved in epigenetic regulation (Chen2023PJA2).

In kidney cancer, particularly clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), PJA2 is involved in receptor endocytosis and signaling. Its downregulation leads to increased levels of receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR, promoting cancer cell growth and invasion. This suggests that PJA2 downregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of ccRCC by impairing receptor endocytosis and enhancing receptor signaling (Rinaldi2024Downregulation).

## Interactions
PJA2, also known as praja ring finger ubiquitin ligase 2, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various protein interactions, influencing multiple signaling pathways. PJA2 interacts with MOB1, a core component of the NDR1/LATS kinase complex in the Hippo signaling pathway. This interaction leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of MOB1, attenuating Hippo signaling and promoting glioblastoma growth (Lignitto2013Proteolysis). The interaction domain on PJA2 for MOB1 is identified as residues 531-630 (Lignitto2013Proteolysis).

PJA2 also interacts with KSR1, a scaffold protein involved in the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. PJA2 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of KSR1, thereby modulating ERK1/2 phosphorylation and affecting mitogenic signaling (Rinaldi2016praja2). The core domain of PJA2 necessary for binding to KSR1 is located at residues 401-530 (Rinaldi2016praja2).

In the context of type I interferon (IFN) signaling, PJA2 interacts with Janus kinases JAK1 and TYK2, promoting their ubiquitination. This interaction negatively regulates IFN signaling by interfering with downstream STAT phosphorylation, without leading to protein degradation (Schiefer2024Proximal; Schiefer2023Proximal). The interaction with TYK2 does not require the RING domain but involves a region spanning amino acids 531 to 630 (Schiefer2024Proximal).
