# CCDC97

## Overview
CCDC97 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 97, which is a component of the SF3B spliceosomal complex. This protein plays a critical role in pre-mRNA splicing by participating in branch site recognition, a key step in the maturation of mRNA molecules before translation into proteins. The proper functioning of CCDC97 is essential for normal cell proliferation, as its disruption can lead to increased sensitivity to spliceosomal inhibitors and altered cell growth. Beyond its role in splicing, CCDC97 has been identified as a stable reference gene in various experimental settings, indicating its consistent expression across different cell types. Although its precise molecular activities and cellular localization in healthy human cells are not fully understood, CCDC97 has been implicated in regulatory mechanisms related to coronary artery disease and potential cancer pathogenesis (Riveroll2023Selection; Byun2022Crossancestry; Wan2015Panorama; Miller2016Integrative).

## Function
CCDC97 is a protein that functions as a component of the SF3B spliceosomal complex, which is crucial for branch site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in human cells. This complex plays a significant role in the splicing process, which is essential for the proper maturation of mRNA molecules before they are translated into proteins. The presence of CCDC97 in the SF3B complex is vital for maintaining normal cell proliferation, as demonstrated by the slower growth observed in human cells where CCDC97 has been knocked out using CRISPR technology. These knockout cells also exhibit increased sensitivity to pladienolide B, a macrolide inhibitor of SF3B, indicating that CCDC97 is important for the proper functioning of the spliceosomal complex (Wan2015Panorama).

In addition to its role in splicing, CCDC97 has been identified as a stable reference gene in equine adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell differentiation studies, suggesting its consistent expression across different cell types and conditions. This stability makes it a reliable candidate for normalizing gene expression data in various experimental settings (Riveroll2023Selection). However, specific details about its molecular activities and cellular localization in healthy human cells remain limited.

## Clinical Significance
CCDC97 has been implicated in the promotion of DNA damage, which is a known cancer-promoting phenotype. A study identified that over-expression of CCDC97 in human lung fibroblasts significantly increased DNA damage, suggesting its potential role in lung cancer pathogenesis (Byun2022Crossancestry). This highlights the importance of understanding genetic variants associated with lung cancer across different ancestries to improve risk prediction models and potentially identify new therapeutic targets (Byun2022Crossancestry).

In the context of otosclerosis, a genome-wide association study identified a significant association signal on chromosome 19 overlapping with several genes, including CCDC97. However, the study did not specifically highlight any direct association between CCDC97 and otosclerosis, focusing instead on the TGFB1 gene in this region (Rämö2020Genomewide; Rämö2023Genomewide).

While CCDC97 is mentioned in the vicinity of genetic loci associated with otosclerosis and osteoarthritis, there is no direct evidence linking mutations or alterations in CCDC97 itself to these conditions. The focus in these studies is primarily on other genes such as TGFB1 (Rämö2023Genomewide; Tachmazidou2019Identification).

## Interactions
CCDC97 is a component of the SF3B spliceosomal complex, which plays a crucial role in branch site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing. It is identified as a sub-stoichiometric component in both human and worm SF3B complexes. The involvement of CCDC97 in the spliceosomal machinery suggests its participation in multiprotein complexes essential for RNA processing. The functional interaction of CCDC97 within the spliceosomal complex is indicated by the increased sensitivity to pladienolide B, a macrolide inhibitor of SF3B, observed in CRISPR-based knockout studies of CCDC97 in human cells. This sensitivity implies that CCDC97 may influence the efficacy of the spliceosomal complex, potentially affecting pre-mRNA splicing processes (Wan2015Panorama).

In the context of coronary artery disease (CAD), CCDC97 is associated with regulatory mechanisms at CAD loci. The study of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs) and tissues has identified CCDC97/TGFB1 as a candidate locus, suggesting a role in gene expression regulation through chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding. This indicates that CCDC97 may participate in regulatory interactions affecting gene expression, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed (Miller2016Integrative).
