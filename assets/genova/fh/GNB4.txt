# GNB4

## Overview
GNB4 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit beta 4, a critical component of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in signal transduction. The protein encoded by GNB4 is characterized by a β-propeller structure, which is formed by seven WD motifs, allowing it to participate in various protein-protein interactions. This structural feature categorizes it as a signaling protein, playing a pivotal role in transmitting signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to intracellular effectors. GNB4 is involved in numerous cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and sensory perception, and is particularly significant in the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, which are essential for myelination in the central nervous system. Mutations in GNB4 have been linked to several diseases, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and various cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease pathology (Chen2021High; Miura2017A; Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

## Structure
The GNB4 gene encodes the G protein subunit beta 4, which is part of the heterotrimeric G protein complex involved in signal transduction. The protein is characterized by a β-propeller structure with seven blades, each consisting of four-stranded β-sheets. This structure is formed by the presence of seven WD motifs, which are structural motifs often containing a tryptophan-aspartic acid (W-D) dipeptide, allowing the protein to fold into a circular or closed solenoid structure (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

The N-terminal region of GNB4 is involved in forming α-helical coiled-coil structures with Gγ subunits, and this region is predicted to be mostly disordered, indicating a disorder-to-order transition upon forming the Gβγ complex (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The intrinsic disorder in GNB4 contributes to its multifunctionality and ability to interact with multiple partners, facilitating various signaling pathways (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

A novel missense variant (Gln220Arg) in the GNB4 gene has been identified, which causes an amino acid substitution in the highly conserved WD40 domain. This domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions and is implicated in the pathology of certain neuropathies (Miura2017A). The GNB4 protein's structure, particularly the WD40 domain, plays a significant role in its function and interaction with other proteins.

## Function
The GNB4 gene encodes the G protein subunit beta 4, which is a component of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in signal transduction. These proteins play a crucial role in transmitting signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to intracellular effectors, influencing various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and sensory perception (Riemann2008Characterization; Miura2017A). GNB4 is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, where it contributes to the regulation of ion channels, enzymes, and other signaling pathways (Chen2021High).

In the context of oligodendrocyte differentiation, GNB4 is upregulated and plays a significant role in promoting the maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (hOPCs) into oligodendrocytes, which are essential for myelination in the central nervous system. Overexpression of GNB4 enhances oligodendrocyte formation, maturation, and axonal ensheathment, suggesting its involvement in specific signaling pathways that facilitate these processes (Pol2017NetworkBased). GNB4 also activates ERK and JNK signaling pathways, which are associated with promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin synthesis (Pol2017NetworkBased). These functions highlight the importance of GNB4 in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions through its role in signal transduction.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GNB4 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In urothelial carcinoma, high levels of GNB4 protein are associated with poor prognosis, advanced tumor stages, and increased mortality. This correlation is observed in both upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) and urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma (UBUC), where high GNB4 expression is linked to aggressive clinicopathological features such as nodal metastasis and vascular invasion (Chen2021High).

GNB4 is also associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a hereditary neuropathy. Specific missense variants in GNB4, such as c.158G>A (p.Gly53Asp) and c.265A>G (p.Lys89Glu), have been identified in individuals with CMT, affecting nerve conduction and synaptic activity (Miura2017A; Malerba2019The).

In gastric cancer, particularly in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection, high GNB4 expression is an independent unfavorable prognostic factor, correlating with poor long-term survival (Gao2020High).

In breast cancer, GNB4 is epigenetically silenced in antiestrogen-resistant cells due to DNA methylation, affecting cell proliferation and resistance to therapy (Wang2018A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GNB4 in various cancers and genetic disorders.

## Interactions
GNB4, a component of heterotrimeric G proteins, is involved in various signaling pathways through its interactions with other proteins. It forms a stable dimer with G protein gamma subunits, which then associates with G protein alpha subunits to participate in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. This complex is crucial for transducing signals from extracellular stimuli to intracellular responses (Chen2021High).

In neutrophils, GNB4 is part of a signaling pathway that includes Rac1, Plcb2, and Plcb3, which is essential for LFA-1 activation and neutrophil arrest. The interaction between Rac1 and Plcb isoforms is mediated through their pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, although direct physical interactions of GNB4 with these proteins are not explicitly detailed (Block2016Gnb). The GNB4-containing complex is involved in producing inositol triphosphate and subsequent calcium flux, leading to LFA-1 activation (Block2016Gnb).

In the context of cancer, GNB4 influences signaling pathways that affect cell proliferation and survival. In antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer cells, GNB4 expression alters the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2, which are key proteins in cell proliferation pathways (Wang2018A). However, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in these pathways are not detailed in the provided context.
