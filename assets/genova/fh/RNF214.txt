# RNF214

## Overview
RNF214 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 214, which is characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain and a coiled-coil (CC) domain. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a pivotal role in the ubiquitylation of proteins, particularly within the Hippo signaling pathway. The RING finger domain is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity, while the CC domain facilitates protein-protein interactions and oligomerization, which are crucial for its oncogenic functions, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Lin2023The; He2024Phase). RNF214's activity is primarily nuclear, where it modulates transcriptional regulation, enhancing the interaction between TEAD transcription factors and the coactivator YAP, thereby promoting cell proliferation and survival (Lin2023The). The gene's overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in HCC, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Lin2023The; He2024Phase).

## Structure
RNF214 is a protein encoded by the human gene RNF214, characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain and a coiled-coil (CC) domain. The protein consists of 703 amino acids and is located on chromosome 11q13.1 (He2024Phase). The RING finger domain, spanning amino acids 658-703, suggests that RNF214 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a role in protein ubiquitylation (Lin2023The). The CC domain, located between amino acids 220-379, is crucial for the protein's phase separation and oligomerization, which are important for its oncogenic function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (He2024Phase).

The CC domain facilitates dimerization and potentially activates the E3 ligase activity of RNF214, which is essential for its role in promoting cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis in HCC (He2024Phase). The protein's ability to undergo phase separation is mediated by the CC domain, forming speckle-like puncta in cells under certain conditions (He2024Phase). RNF214's ubiquitylation activity involves conjugating nondegradable polyubiquitin chains on TEAD transcription factors, enhancing their interaction with YAP, a transcriptional coactivator (Lin2023The). The protein's structure and post-translational modifications are integral to its function in cellular processes and cancer progression.

## Function
RNF214 is a ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in the Hippo signaling pathway, primarily through the ubiquitylation of TEAD transcription factors. This ubiquitylation is non-proteolytic, meaning it does not lead to protein degradation but instead enhances the interaction between TEADs and the transcription coactivator YAP. This interaction promotes the transactivation of downstream genes involved in regulating organ size, cell proliferation, and survival (Lin2023The).

The protein's function is facilitated by its RING finger domain, which is crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity, and its coiled-coil domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and self-oligomerization. These domains are essential for RNF214's ability to enhance the transcriptional activities of TEAD transcription factors (Lin2023The).

RNF214's activity is primarily located in the nucleus, where it modulates the transcriptional regulation of genes associated with the Hippo pathway. This regulation is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cell cycle progression. The protein's role in ubiquitylation and transcriptional regulation underscores its importance in cellular processes such as signal transduction and cell proliferation (Lin2023The).

## Clinical Significance
RNF214 is implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it acts as an oncogene. Overexpression of RNF214 is associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients, correlating with lower survival rates and higher tumor recurrence (Lin2023The; He2024Phase). RNF214 promotes HCC progression through its role in the Hippo signaling pathway, where it ubiquitylates TEAD transcription factors, enhancing their interaction with YAP, a coactivator involved in tumorigenesis (Lin2023The). This interaction leads to increased transcription of genes that drive tumor growth and metastasis (Lin2023The).

The gene's elevated expression is also linked to higher alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, a marker for HCC, suggesting a regulatory relationship that may contribute to the disease's progression (He2024Phase). Functional studies have shown that knockout of RNF214 in HCC cell lines results in reduced cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis, indicating its critical role in cancer development (Lin2023The; He2024Phase). These findings suggest that RNF214 could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in HCC (Lin2023The; He2024Phase).

## Interactions
RNF214, a RING finger ubiquitin ligase, is known for its interactions with TEAD transcription factors, which are integral to the Hippo signaling pathway. RNF214 interacts with all four human TEAD proteins (TEAD1, TEAD2, TEAD3, and TEAD4), as confirmed through reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation methods in HEK293T cells (Lin2023The). These interactions are crucial for RNF214's role in promoting nonproteolytic polyubiquitylation of TEAD2 and TEAD3, enhancing their transcriptional activities without affecting their protein stability (Lin2023The). The interaction between RNF214 and TEADs is further supported by GST pulldown assays, which confirmed direct interactions with TEAD1 (Lin2023The).

RNF214 also enhances the interaction between TEADs and the coactivator YAP, a key component of the Hippo pathway. This is achieved through the conjugation of nondegradable polyubiquitin chains on TEADs, which facilitates their interaction with YAP, thereby promoting transcriptional activities (Lin2023The). The ubiquitylation of TEADs by RNF214 involves K27 polyubiquitin chains, with specific lysine residues such as K345 on TEAD2 being major sites for this modification (Lin2023The). These interactions are significant in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma, where RNF214 is implicated in tumor progression through its effects on the YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcriptional complex (Lin2023The).
