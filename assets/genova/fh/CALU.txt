# CALU

## Overview
The CALU gene encodes calumenin, a calcium-binding protein that is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of mammalian cells. Calumenin is characterized by its multiple EF-hand motifs, which facilitate calcium ion binding, and it plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis and protein folding. As a member of the CREC (Cab45, reticulocalbin, ERC-55, and calumenin) family, calumenin is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of membrane proteins and calcium signaling pathways. It interacts with several proteins, such as the ryanodine receptor and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-transporting ATPase, influencing muscle contraction and other cellular functions. Calumenin's expression varies across tissues, with significant roles in the heart, placenta, and skeletal muscle. Its involvement in processes like vascular calcification and the vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation system highlights its importance in both intracellular and extracellular functions (Honoré2009The; Li2024CALU; Wajih2004The).

## Structure
Calumenin (CALU) is a protein encoded by the CALU gene, characterized by its multiple EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures that facilitate calcium ion binding (Honoré2009The). The primary structure of calumenin includes a signal peptide and six canonical EF-hand domains, with an additional 'orphan' loop resembling an EF-hand motif but lacking certain structural features (Mazzorana2016CaDependent). The protein undergoes significant conformational changes upon calcium binding, transitioning from a disordered state to a more compact, alpha-helical structure (Mazzorana2016CaDependent).

Calumenin's tertiary structure in the calcium-bound state is described as an elongated trilobal fold, with three lobes formed by the EF-hand domains (Mazzorana2016CaDependent). The protein's quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but it is noted that calcium binding does not affect its aggregation properties (Mazzorana2019CalciumInduced).

Calumenin exists in two alternatively spliced variants, calumenin-1 and calumenin-2, which differ in EF-hands no. 2 and 3 (Honoré2009The). Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation at Ser-44 and Thr-65, and it is a target for tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting a role in signal transduction pathways (Honoré2009The).

## Function
Calumenin (CALU) is a calcium-binding protein primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of mammalian cells. It is involved in calcium homeostasis and protein folding, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. CALU contains multiple EF-hand motifs, which are characteristic of calcium-binding proteins, and it undergoes glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its function and localization (Li2024CALU).

In healthy human cells, CALU is expressed at varying levels across different tissues, with the highest expression observed in the heart, placenta, and skeletal muscle. It plays a regulatory role in membrane proteins and is involved in processes such as vascular calcification by reducing gamma-carboxylation and inhibiting the activation of matrix Gla protein. CALU also interacts with and inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor and the cardiac Ca2+ transporting ATPase, indicating its involvement in calcium signaling and homeostasis, which are critical for muscle contraction and other cellular functions (Li2024CALU).

CALU's distribution in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and secretory pathway suggests it may have dual functions both intracellularly and extracellularly, impacting cellular and organismal functions (Li2024CALU).

## Clinical Significance
Calumenin (CALU) has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In bladder cancer (BLCA), high CALU expression is associated with poor prognosis, correlating with lower overall survival and progression-free survival. It is linked to tumor microenvironment remodeling, gene mutations, and ferroptosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic factor and therapeutic target in BLCA (Du2021The). CALU expression is also associated with increased levels of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and immune checkpoint-related genes, indicating a role in influencing patient responsiveness to immunotherapy (Du2021The).

In heart failure, particularly ischemic cardiomyopathy, CALU has been identified as a potential biomarker. Its expression is significantly lower in heart failure samples compared to non-failing samples, and it is associated with immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in the disease's etiology (Liu2021Identification).

Regarding warfarin dosing, the CALU SNP rs1043550 was investigated for its potential impact on therapeutic requirements. However, studies found that this SNP does not significantly affect warfarin dosing, indicating limited clinical significance in this context (Glurich2013Does).

## Interactions
Calumenin (CALU) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It interacts with the ryanodine receptor-1, a crucial component in the excitation-contraction mechanism of cardiac muscle cells, influencing calcium ion dynamics within the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (Honoré2009The). Calumenin also interacts with the cardiac muscle SR Ca2+-transporting ATPase, inhibiting calcium uptake into the SR, which is vital for muscle contraction-relaxation mechanisms (Honoré2009The).

Calumenin is involved in the vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation system, where it interacts with γ-carboxylase and vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR), inhibiting their activities. This interaction suggests a regulatory role in the γ-carboxylation system, which is essential for the post-translational modification of vitamin K-dependent proteins (Wajih2004The).

Additionally, calumenin interacts with fibulin-1C, C1 esterase inhibitor, and glucose-regulated protein 75 (grp75). The interaction with fibulin-1C is not dependent on calcium ions, while the interaction with C1 esterase inhibitor is calcium-dependent. These interactions suggest calumenin's involvement in various cellular processes, including chaperone activity and modulation of the complement system (Aune2015Fibulin1C).
