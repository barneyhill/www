# ANO10

## Overview
The ANO10 gene encodes the protein anoctamin 10, a member of the anoctamin family, which is characterized by its role as a transmembrane protein with dual functionality. Anoctamin 10 is primarily expressed in the human brain and is involved in calcium-dependent chloride channel activity and phospholipid scrambling. The protein's structure includes ten transmembrane α helices and calcium-binding sites, which are essential for its function in ion transport and cellular processes such as endosomal sorting and apoptosis. Mutations in the ANO10 gene are linked to neurological disorders, including autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCAR10), highlighting its clinical significance (Balreira2014ANO10; Chrysanthou2022ANO10).

## Structure
The ANO10 protein, encoded by the ANO10 gene, is a member of the anoctamin family and is characterized by its complex molecular structure. It consists of 660 amino acids and forms a symmetrical homodimer, with each monomer containing ten transmembrane α helices (TM1-TM10) (Chrysanthou2022ANO10). The TM3-TM7 helices create a groove that functions as a lipid transfer pathway, facilitated by charged and hydrogen bonding amino acids. ANO10 has three calcium-binding sites, two of which are formed by the TM6-TM8 α helices, and one by TM10 and the cytoplasmic domain α10. Specific residues such as Glu448, Glu529, Asp533, and Ser363 are crucial for calcium binding and scrambling activity (Chrysanthou2022ANO10).

The protein's function is influenced by calcium availability, which affects its role as an ion channel or phospholipid scramblase. ANO10 is involved in calcium-mediated ion transport and other cellular processes (Chrysanthou2022ANO10). While the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not fully detailed, the presence of transmembrane domains and calcium-binding sites suggests a complex and functional architecture. The protein's structure and function are crucial for its role in physiological processes and its association with diseases such as spinocerebellar ataxia (Chrysanthou2022ANO10).

## Function
ANO10, also known as anoctamin 10, is a transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in the human brain, particularly in the frontal and occipital cortex and cerebellum, and is also found in the primary cilia of retinal pigment epithelium cells (Chrysanthou2022ANO10). It is part of the anoctamin family, which is characterized by functional duality, exhibiting both calcium-dependent chloride channel activity and phospholipid scrambling activities (Chrysanthou2022ANO10). ANO10 is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and is involved in maintaining lipid distribution within this membrane (Chrysanthou2022ANO10).

The protein's activity is dependent on calcium availability, which is necessary for its activation. ANO10 plays a role in several physiological processes, including endosomal sorting, spindle assembly, calcium signaling, apoptotic cell death, and changes in cell volume (Chrysanthou2022ANO10). It is also involved in phospholipid scrambling in intracellular membranes, with its activity dependent on calcium and membrane thickness (Chrysanthou2022ANO10). ANO10's functions in healthy cells include ion transport, phospholipid scrambling, and involvement in cellular processes like apoptosis and endosomal sorting (Chrysanthou2022ANO10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANO10 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, most notably autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCAR10). This condition is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, which includes symptoms such as gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus, and cerebellar atrophy. The disease typically manifests in teenage or young adult years (Nieto2019Cognitive). ANO10 mutations can lead to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency, which has been observed in patients with SCAR10, and CoQ10 supplementation has shown to provide some symptomatic relief (Balreira2014ANO10).

Specific mutations, such as the c.1150_1151del (p.Leu384fs) mutation, have been identified as founder mutations in certain populations, like the Roma/Gypsy population, causing a distinct form of cerebellar ataxia with severe cerebellar atrophy and intellectual deficits (Chamova2011ANO10). Other mutations, such as the c.132dupA, are common in SCAR10 and are associated with cognitive impairments (Nieto2019Cognitive).

The ANO10 gene is also implicated in cellular volume regulation, and specific variants like ANO10-R263H are linked to compromised cellular functions, including volume regulation in macrophages, which may predispose individuals to conditions like spinocerebellar ataxia (Hammer2015A).

## Interactions
ANO10, also known as anoctamin 10, is involved in several interactions with other proteins that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. ANO10 interacts with Rab7, a protein associated with endosomes, and phosphatidylinositols of endolysosomes, which is important for endosomal sorting and cargo distribution within the cell (Chrysanthou2022ANO10). It also forms a symmetrical homodimer with a transmembrane domain consisting of ten α helices, where specific helices create a groove for lipid transfer (Chrysanthou2022ANO10).

ANO10 has been shown to physically interact with LRRC8A, a component of volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC), which is essential for regulatory and apoptotic cell shrinkage (Wanitchakool2017Cellular). This interaction is suggested by coimmunoprecipitation studies, indicating a potential role in the activation of VRAC (Wanitchakool2017Cellular). The R263H variant of ANO10, which affects volume regulation, is located near the dimer interface and may interfere with dimerization, impacting its function (Hammer2015A).

These interactions highlight ANO10's role in calcium-mediated ion transport and its involvement in cellular volume regulation, which are critical for various physiological processes.
