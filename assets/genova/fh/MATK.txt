# MATK

## Overview
MATK, or megakaryocyte-associated tyrosine kinase, is a gene that encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase protein involved in cellular signaling pathways. The MATK protein is characterized by its cytosolic localization and its role in modulating the activity of Src family kinases (SFKs), which are critical for various cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation. Unlike other kinases, MATK lacks certain regulatory phosphorylation sites, which suggests a unique mechanism of action in cellular signaling (Thiriet2012Cytoplasmic). It is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, particularly megakaryocytes, and is implicated in the regulation of platelet production and function (Advani2015Csk-homologous). MATK's expression and activity are tightly regulated, and its dysregulation has been associated with various cancers, where it may act as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the over-activation of SFKs (Advani2015Csk-homologous).

## Structure
MATK, also known as megakaryocyte-associated tyrosine kinase, is a cytosolic protein tyrosine kinase with a molecular weight of approximately 60 kDa. It is composed of several key domains: an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, and a kinase domain (Thiriet2012Cytoplasmic; Avraham1995Tyrosine). The SH2 domain facilitates interactions with phosphorylated tyrosine residues, while the SH3 domain is involved in subcellular localization and protein-protein interactions (Thiriet2012Cytoplasmic). MATK lacks myristylation signals, a negative regulatory phosphorylation site, and an autophosphorylation motif, indicating it is not regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (Thiriet2012Cytoplasmic).

MATK exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the P52 isoform being abundant in neurons and the P56 isoform specific to hematopoietic cells (Thiriet2012Cytoplasmic; Advani2015Csk-homologous). The N-terminal region of the P56 isoform is crucial for nuclear targeting and inhibiting cell proliferation (Advani2015Csk-homologous). MATK's structure allows it to phosphorylate Src family kinases at the conserved C-terminal tail tyrosine, leading to their inactivation (Advani2015Csk-homologous). The protein's unique structural features, including its lack of a membrane-anchoring domain, suggest a specialized role in cellular signaling pathways (Thiriet2012Cytoplasmic).

## Function
MATK, also known as megakaryocyte-associated tyrosine kinase, is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in regulating cellular signaling pathways. It plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of Src family kinases (SFKs), which are important for cell signaling and cancer progression. MATK can phosphorylate SFKs at the conserved C-terminal tail tyrosine, leading to their inactivation. It also suppresses SFK activity through a non-catalytic mechanism by directly binding to the kinase domain of active SFKs, a capability that distinguishes it from its homolog Csk (Advani2015Csk-homologous).

MATK is primarily active in hematopoietic cells, particularly in megakaryocytes, where it influences platelet production and function. It is expressed in brain and hematopoietic cells, with moderate to low expression in tissues such as the small intestine, colon, lung, and stomach (Advani2015Csk-homologous). The regulation of MATK is cell/lineage-specific, and its expression can be induced by stem cell factor (SCF) in certain cell lines, such as the megakaryoblastic cell line M07e (Grgurevich1997The). This regulation suggests a role for MATK in cellular responses mediated by SCF, impacting immune responses and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MATK gene, also known as Csk-homologous kinase (Chk/Matk), have been implicated in various cancers. Chk/Matk acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting Src-family tyrosine kinases (SFKs), which are often over-activated in cancer due to dysregulation of upstream inhibitors like Chk/Matk. Aberrant activation of SFKs is associated with cancer metastasis and drug resistance (Advani2015Csk-homologous).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), Chk/Matk expression is significantly reduced, contributing to the constitutive activation of Src and promoting cancer cell growth and migration. This downregulation is often due to hypermethylation of its promoter or missense mutations, with over 50 cancer-associated mutations identified. These mutations can impair Chk/Matk's kinase activity and its ability to bind and inhibit SFKs, facilitating cancer progression (Advani2015Csk-homologous).

Chk/Matk expression is also suppressed in other cancers, such as lung carcinoma, glioma, and stomach carcinoma, often due to epigenetic silencing mechanisms like CpG island hypermethylation. This suppression suggests a broader role for Chk/Matk as a tumor suppressor across different cancer types (Advani2015Csk-homologous). Understanding the regulation and interactions of Chk/Matk could be crucial for developing targeted cancer therapies (Advani2015Csk-homologous).

## Interactions
MATK (megakaryocyte-associated tyrosine kinase) is known to interact with several proteins, particularly within the context of cellular signaling pathways. One of its primary interactions is with the SRC-family kinases, where it plays a role in modulating their activity. MATK can inhibit the activity of c-Src, a member of the SRC-family kinases, through its interactions, which suggests a regulatory function in cellular signaling pathways related to cell growth and differentiation (Chüeh2021CSK-homologous).

The study of MATK in colorectal cancer cell lines has shown that it may act as a tumor suppressor gene, with its expression being epigenetically silenced by promoter methylation. This silencing can affect its interactions with SRC-family kinases, potentially altering the signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis (Chüeh2021CSK-homologous). The use of phospho-specific antibodies in research has indicated potential phosphorylation interactions between MATK and SRC-family kinases, further supporting its role in modulating kinase activity (Chüeh2021CSK-homologous).

These interactions highlight MATK's involvement in critical cellular processes and its potential impact on cancer development, particularly through its regulatory effects on SRC-family kinases.
