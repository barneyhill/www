# GABRQ

## Overview
The GABRQ gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor subunit theta, a component of the GABA-A receptor, which is a member of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels. This receptor plays a crucial role in inhibitory neurotransmission within the central nervous system by modulating neuronal excitability through chloride ion influx, leading to hyperpolarization and decreased neuronal firing. The theta subunit contributes to the structural diversity of the GABA-A receptor, which is typically a pentameric assembly of various subunits, including alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, theta, and pi. The expression of the GABRQ gene is region-specific within the brain, with notable presence in areas such as the hippocampus and locus coeruleus, implicating its involvement in functions related to anxiety, memory, and psychiatric disorders (Sequeira2019Human; Fatemi2013mRNA).

## Structure
The GABRQ gene encodes the theta subunit of the GABA-A receptor, which is a part of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels. These channels are characterized by a pentameric arrangement of subunits that form a central pore. Each subunit, including the theta subunit, has a conserved extracellular NH2-terminal domain, three well-conserved transmembrane (TM) domains, a variable cytoplasmic loop, and a fourth TM domain followed by a short COOH-terminal sequence. The TM domains are arranged in a 3+1 configuration, with TM2 lining the pore and TM4 interacting with the lipid bilayer (Mullins2010Fine).

The GABA-A receptor, including the theta subunit, is a pentameric structure composed of various subunits, which can include combinations of alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, theta, and pi subunits. The most common configuration in the brain is a pentamer comprising two alpha, two beta, and one gamma subunit (Mullins2010Fine). The theta subunit, encoded by GABRQ, is co-expressed with other subunits in specific brain regions, contributing to the receptor's structural diversity (Fernandez2008Investigation). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of the GABRQ protein are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The GABRQ gene encodes the theta subunit of the GABA A receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. This receptor modulates neuronal excitability by allowing chloride ions to enter the neuron, leading to hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal firing. The GABRQ subunit is expressed in various brain regions, including the amygdala, dorsal raphe, hippocampus, hypothalamus, locus coeruleus, and substantia nigra, indicating its involvement in diverse brain functions such as anxiety regulation, vigilance, attention, and memory (Fatemi2013mRNA).

In the hippocampus, GABRQ shows significant enrichment, particularly in the dentate gyrus, suggesting a role in the specific functions of the hippocampal formation (Sequeira2019Human). The expression of GABRQ in the locus coeruleus is notable due to this region's importance in psychiatric disorders, highlighting the potential involvement of GABRQ in these conditions (Fatemi2013mRNA). Although the functional properties of GABA A receptors containing the theta subunit are not fully characterized, they are implicated in midbrain development and possibly in psychiatric conditions (Fatemi2013mRNA).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GABRQ gene, which encodes the theta subunit of the GABA-A receptor, have been implicated in several psychiatric disorders. In schizophrenia, GABRQ expression is altered with reduced protein levels observed in both the BA9 region and the lateral cerebellum. Interestingly, mRNA levels are downregulated in the lateral cerebellum but upregulated in BA9, suggesting different compensatory mechanisms in these brain regions (Fatemi2013mRNA). In bipolar disorder, GABRQ protein levels are reduced in the lateral cerebellum with mRNA upregulated, while in BA9, protein levels are downregulated with unchanged mRNA levels, indicating potential defects in protein processing (Fatemi2013mRNA). In major depression, GABRQ protein is reduced in the lateral cerebellum with normal mRNA levels, suggesting issues in protein processing (Fatemi2013mRNA).

Although single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GABRQ were not linked to migraine, bipolar disorder, or essential tremor, the GABRQ-478F allele was associated with ethanol-responsive tremor improvement in men (Fatemi2013mRNA). The gene's location at Xq28 and its involvement in GABAergic signaling highlight its potential role in the pathophysiology of these conditions (Fatemi2013mRNA).
