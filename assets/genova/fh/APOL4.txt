# APOL4

## Overview
APOL4 is a gene that encodes the protein apolipoprotein L4, a member of the apolipoprotein L family, which is involved in lipid transport and metabolism. The protein is characterized by a non-classical four-helix bundle motif, similar to other members of its family, and is implicated in forming voltage-dependent ion conductance in lipid bilayers, suggesting a role in ion channel regulation (Ultsch2021Structures; Pant2021Apolipoproteins). Apolipoprotein L4 is part of the innate immune system, with its expression upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating a potential role in immune defense (Zhu2022APOL4). Clinically, APOL4 has been associated with various conditions, including gliomas and psoriasis, where its expression levels and interactions with other proteins may influence disease progression and immune responses (Ransohoff2017408; Zhu2022APOL4). Despite these associations, the precise physiological functions of APOL4 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Pant2021Apolipoproteins).

## Structure
APOL4, a member of the apolipoprotein L family, shares structural characteristics with other APOL proteins. It is predicted to have a non-classical four-helix bundle motif, similar to APOL1 and APOL3, stabilized by conserved hydrophobic residues (Ultsch2021Structures). This motif is indicative of related functions within the family. APOL4, like APOL3 and APOL5, forms voltage-dependent ion conductance in planar lipid bilayers at neutral pH, requiring a positive voltage for insertion and ion conductance formation (Pant2021Apolipoproteins). 

APOL4 has two isoforms, with isoform 2 having a weak predicted signal peptide and isoform 1 lacking any signal peptide (Pant2021Apolipoproteins). The protein's ion conductance properties are influenced by conserved amino acid residues, particularly aspartic acid 348 (D348), which is crucial for pH gating and cation selectivity (Pant2021Apolipoproteins). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of APOL4, such as prominent folds or post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available context. The structural insights suggest a role in immune defense, as APOL proteins are upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines (Ultsch2021Structures).

## Function
APOL4, a member of the apolipoprotein L family, is involved in lipid transport and metabolism. It is thought to play a role in reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral cells to the liver and in lipid exchange throughout the body (Zhu2022APOL4). APOL4 is part of the innate immune system, with its expression upregulated by pro-inflammatory signals such as interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha (Zhu2022APOL4). 

In terms of cellular processes, APOL4 is involved in ion channel regulation. It forms voltage-dependent ion conductance in lipid bilayers at neutral pH, suggesting a role in ion channel activity (Pant2021Apolipoproteins). APOL4, along with other APOL proteins, may regulate immune cell function through its cation channel activity (Pant2021Apolipoproteins). 

APOL4 has been identified as a prognostic marker in breast cancer and is associated with immune-related processes in gliomas, where its expression correlates with immune checkpoints and potential sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (Zhu2022APOL4). Despite these findings, the specific function of APOL4 in healthy human cells remains unclear, as detailed studies on its role in normal physiology are limited (Pant2021Apolipoproteins).

## Clinical Significance
APOL4 (apolipoprotein L4) has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In gliomas, a type of aggressive brain tumor, APOL4 expression is significantly higher compared to normal tissues and is associated with the World Health Organization (WHO) grade of the tumor. Higher expression levels of APOL4 correlate with shorter overall survival in glioma patients, suggesting its potential as an independent prognostic factor. This gene is also linked to immune infiltration in gliomas, showing positive correlations with various immune cells, which may influence the tumor microenvironment and immune response (Zhu2022APOL4).

APOL4 is also involved in the regulation of the corneodesmosin (CDSN) gene, which is associated with psoriasis. A synonymous SNP in CDSN affects the binding of APOL4 to CDSN mRNA, potentially contributing to psoriasis pathogenesis. APOL4 expression increases during epidermal differentiation, and its dysregulation may impact the stability of CDSN transcripts, highlighting its role in skin conditions (Ransohoff2017408).

In the context of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), research indicates that while APOL1 variants are significant risk factors, additional variants in the APOL1-APOL4-MYH9 region, including APOL4, do not significantly contribute to ESKD risk (Hawkins2015ReSequencing).

## Interactions
APOL4, a member of the apolipoprotein L family, has been identified to interact with CDSN mRNA, particularly binding strongly to the normal variant of CDSN mRNA but not to a disease-associated variant. This interaction suggests a regulatory role of APOL4 in stabilizing CDSN transcripts, which is significant in the context of psoriasis pathogenesis (Ransohoff2017408).

In the context of gliomas, APOL4 is suggested to interact with a variety of proteins through protein-protein interaction networks. According to STRING and GeneMANIA analyses, potential interacting partners include APOO, CHRM4, C15orf26, COMT, PRODH, POX2, LALRAD1, OR10H1, NPIPB9, OR10H5, APOL3, APOL2, APOL5, APOL6, APOL1, APOLD1, TRPM8, BTN2A2, SLC45A3, PSEN2, and NLRC5. These interactions imply that APOL4 is involved in immune-related processes, such as IFN-γ production, response to type I interferon, adaptive immune response, and T cell activation (Zhu2022APOL4).

Despite these findings, specific physical interactions of APOL4 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the available literature, and its precise role in these interactions remains to be fully elucidated (Pays2020The; Ultsch2021Structures).
