# VSTM4

## Overview
VSTM4 is a gene that encodes the protein V-set and transmembrane domain containing 4, which is categorized as a B7-like protein involved in immune regulation. The protein plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses by downregulating T cell activation, specifically by reducing the production of cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-2, and inhibiting the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th1 cells. This function suggests a potential role in promoting Th2 inflammation, which is particularly relevant in conditions like asthma (Lee2022Peripheral). VSTM4 has also been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels and interactions are associated with disease progression and prognosis. It is part of gene co-expression networks in cancer studies, indicating its involvement in complex biological processes (Chen2019A). The gene's expression is regulated by microRNAs in certain cancers, and its dysregulation is linked to poor outcomes, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Miao2023Prognostic; Hu2023Crucial).

## Clinical Significance
VSTM4 has been implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression levels and interactions playing a role in disease progression. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), VSTM4 is part of an 8-gene risk signature associated with poor prognosis. High expression of VSTM4 correlates with increased immune cell infiltration and higher levels of immune checkpoint genes, suggesting a potential role in immunotherapy response (Miao2023Prognostic). 

In prostate cancer, VSTM4 expression is regulated by microRNAs, specifically hsa-mir-1247. The expression levels of VSTM4 are significantly lower in prostate cancer samples compared to para-cancer samples. This downregulation is linked to the progression of prostate cancer, indicating that VSTM4 could serve as a prognostic marker (Hu2023Crucial).

In gastric cancer, VSTM4 is upregulated in cases with CDH1 mutations, which are associated with worse overall survival. Although the specific role of VSTM4 in gastric cancer remains unresolved, it is considered a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target (Malpeli2022Landscape).

These findings suggest that VSTM4 may have significant clinical implications across different cancer types, potentially serving as a biomarker for prognosis and a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
VSTM4, a B7-like protein, is known to downregulate T cell activation by reducing the production of IFN-γ and IL-2 from T cells and inhibiting the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th1 cells. This suggests that VSTM4 may play a role in promoting Th2 inflammation over Th1 inflammation, particularly in the context of asthma (Lee2022Peripheral). 

In the study of bladder cancer, VSTM4 was identified as part of a gene co-expression network using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Although the specific interactions of VSTM4 with other proteins were not detailed, it was included in a module of highly co-expressed genes, indicating potential involvement in complex functional networks (Chen2019A). 

While VSTM4 was listed among genes analyzed in a study on pericyte markers, specific interactions with proteins or nucleic acids were not mentioned (Hsu2019Comparison). Overall, the interactions of VSTM4 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain an area that requires further investigation to fully elucidate its role in immune regulation and other biological processes.
