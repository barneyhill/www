complex, which is the regulatory component of the 26S proteasome. The 26S proteosome complex is required for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. This protein is a non-ATPase subunit that may be involved in protein-protein interactions. Aberrant expression of this gene may paly a role in tumorigenesis. Two transcripts encoding different isoforms have been described. Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 3 and 20.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2011].", "symbol": "PSMD10", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1419028"}, "unigene": "Hs.522752", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "O75832", "TrEMBL": ["B1AJY7", "B1AJY6", "B1AJY5"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "PSMD10"}}
