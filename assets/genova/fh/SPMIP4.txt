# SPMIP4

## Overview
SPMIP4 is a gene that encodes the protein sperm microtubule inner protein 4, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of sperm cells. This protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, involved in the stabilization and organization of microtubules within the sperm flagellum, which is essential for sperm motility and fertility. The proper functioning of SPMIP4 is critical for the maintenance of sperm structure and the successful completion of fertilization processes. Mutations or dysregulation of this gene may lead to impaired sperm motility and are associated with certain forms of male infertility (Qiu2020aarFDC).
