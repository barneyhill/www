# ARRDC3

## Overview
ARRDC3, or arrestin domain-containing protein 3, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in receptor regulation and metabolic pathways. The ARRDC3 protein is categorized as an adaptor protein, characterized by its arrestin domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins through its PPXY motifs. These motifs are crucial for recruiting E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as those from the NEDD4 family, to target proteins like the β2-adrenergic receptor for ubiquitination and degradation, thereby modulating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling (Nabhan2010Arrestin; Qi2014Structural). Beyond its role in receptor regulation, ARRDC3 is implicated in metabolic regulation, influencing insulin action and glucose metabolism, and is involved in energy expenditure processes in adipose tissue (Patwari2011The; Batista2020Arrestin). Clinically, alterations in ARRDC3 expression are linked to various cancers and metabolic disorders, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Draheim2010ARRDC3; Batista2020Arrestin).

## Structure
The ARRDC3 protein is characterized by a two-lobed arrestin fold, with each lobe forming a β-sandwich structure. The N-terminal lobe, spanning residues 1-165, includes a core arrestin β-sandwich with one three-stranded and one four-stranded β-sheet. This lobe is noted for its flatness, attributed to a less curved conformation of the β3-β4 pair, which is linked to crystal packing interactions (Qi2014Insights). A second crystal form of the N-terminal lobe, extending to residue 180, exhibits a highly curved shape typical of the arrestin family, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit forming an electropositive surface due to basic residues lining a central channel (Qi2014Insights).

ARRDC3 contains two PPXY motifs in its C-terminal tail, which are crucial for recruiting ubiquitin ligases of the NEDD4 family. These motifs interact with the WW domains of Nedd4, particularly the WW3 domain, which binds with high affinity (Qi2014Structural). The interaction involves a type II polyproline conformation of the PPXY motif, stabilized by packing interactions and hydrogen bonds (Qi2014Structural). The protein's electropositive surface is important for binding phosphate ions and interacting with the β2-adrenergic receptor (Qi2014Insights).

## Function
ARRDC3 (arrestin domain-containing protein 3) is involved in the regulation of several cellular and physiological processes. It plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination and degradation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. ARRDC3 acts as an adaptor protein that recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 to the activated β2AR, facilitating its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This process is essential for maintaining normal physiological homeostasis and is mediated through conserved PPXY motifs in ARRDC3, which bind to the WW domains of NEDD4 (Nabhan2010Arrestin).

ARRDC3 is also implicated in metabolic regulation. It modulates insulin action and glucose metabolism in the liver by interacting with the insulin receptor (IR), influencing its expression and autophosphorylation activity. This interaction affects downstream signaling pathways, impacting glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure (Batista2020Arrestin). In adipose tissue, ARRDC3 regulates β-adrenergic signaling, which is crucial for energy expenditure and thermogenesis, by interacting with β2- and β3-adrenoceptors (Patwari2011The). These functions highlight ARRDC3's role in receptor regulation, cellular signaling, and metabolic processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ARRDC3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In breast cancer, ARRDC3 acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating integrin β4 (ITGb4). Its expression is often reduced in aggressive breast cancer subtypes, such as basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers, correlating with increased metastasis, tumor recurrence, and poor prognosis (Draheim2010ARRDC3; Wedegaertner2022The). ARRDC3 downregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to cancer progression (Draheim2010ARRDC3).

In colorectal cancer, ARRDC3 is downregulated, leading to increased expression of the oncoprotein YAP, which promotes tumorigenesis. This downregulation is linked to decreased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, suggesting a role in chemotherapy resistance (Shen2018ARRDC3).

ARRDC3 is also involved in metabolic disorders. Its deletion in mice enhances insulin sensitivity and protects against obesity and insulin resistance, indicating its potential role in metabolic regulation (Batista2020Arrestin). Additionally, a missense variant in ARRDC3 is associated with bovine congestive heart failure, highlighting its significance in cardiac function (Heaton2024Association).

## Interactions
ARRDC3 interacts with various proteins through its PPxY motifs, which are crucial for recruiting WW-domain containing proteins such as the NEDD4-family E3 ubiquitin ligases. These interactions facilitate the ubiquitination of proteins like YAP, ALIX, and ARRDC3 itself, playing a role in regulating GPCR signaling to the Hippo pathway and its tumor suppressor function (Wedegaertner2022The). ARRDC3 specifically interacts with NEDD4, a ubiquitin ligase, through its PPXY motifs, which bind to the WW domains of NEDD4. This interaction is essential for the ubiquitination and degradation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) (Nabhan2010Arrestin; Qi2014Structural).

ARRDC3 also interacts with proteins like WWP1, Itch, and β-arrestin-2, as identified in a mass spectrometry study of the ARRDC3 interactome in HEK293T cells (Wedegaertner2022The). It acts as a scaffold to facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes, interacting with metabolite interconversion enzymes and protein-modifying enzymes such as kinases, phosphatases, ubiquitin E3 ligases, and proteases (Wedegaertner2022The). ARRDC3's interaction with the insulin receptor (IR) is regulated by phosphorylation at tyrosine 382, which is important for its function in HEK293 cells (Wedegaertner2022The).
