# HIVEP2

## Overview
HIVEP2 is a gene that encodes the HIVEP zinc finger 2 protein, a transcription factor characterized by its zinc-finger motifs. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression involved in various cellular processes, including brain development, immune response, and neurotransmission. HIVEP zinc finger 2 is particularly significant in modulating the NF-κB pathway, which is essential for immune responses and neuronal development (Iwashita2012Genomewide; Murphy2020Nuclear). The protein is expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of dopaminergic neurons, where it influences dopamine signaling by regulating the dopamine transporter gene SLC6A3 (Zhao2019Identification). Mutations in the HIVEP2 gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and developmental delays, underscoring its critical role in normal brain function and development (Park2019Novel; Abreu2023Parental).

## Structure


## Function
The HIVEP2 gene encodes a zinc-finger-containing transcription factor involved in various molecular processes crucial for normal cellular and organismal functions. In healthy human cells, HIVEP2 plays a significant role in brain development by regulating the expression of genes such as the somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR-2) and c-Myc, which are involved in neurotransmission, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Srivastava2015Lossoffunction; Abreu2023Parental). HIVEP2 also modulates the NF-κB pathway, which is important for immune responses, inflammation, and neuronal development (Iwashita2012Genomewide; Murphy2020Nuclear).

In dopaminergic neurons, HIVEP2 acts as a transcription factor that regulates the dopamine transporter gene SLC6A3, influencing dopamine signaling pathways critical for brain function (Zhao2019Identification). The protein is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of these neurons, with higher levels in the cytoplasm (Zhao2019Identification).

HIVEP2 is also involved in the regulation of T-cell development and function, particularly in the context of regulatory T (T reg) cells, where it helps maintain immune homeostasis and self-tolerance (Schumann2020Functional). Its activity in these cells is crucial for the suppression of immune responses, as demonstrated in models of graft-versus-host disease (Schumann2020Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HIVEP2 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily characterized by intellectual disability (ID) and developmental delays. These conditions are often referred to as autosomal dominant mental retardation type 43 (MRD43) (Park2019Novel; Abreu2023Parental). Patients with HIVEP2 mutations frequently exhibit mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, delayed motor and language development, and behavioral issues such as hyperactivity, anxiety, and autism spectrum disorders (Srivastava2015Lossoffunction; Steinfeld2016Mutations). Dysmorphic features, hypotonia, and microcephaly are also common clinical manifestations (Quental2022Expanding; Goldsmith2019Expanding).

The gene's role in brain development is underscored by its involvement in regulating pathways such as the NF-κB pathway and the somatostatin receptor (SSTR-2), which are crucial for neuronal development (Srivastava2015Lossoffunction; Abreu2023Parental). Variants in HIVEP2, particularly de novo nonsense and frameshift mutations, lead to haploinsufficiency, contributing to the observed phenotypes (Srivastava2015Lossoffunction; Park2019Novel). These mutations often result in a truncated protein, which may cause a milder phenotype compared to other genetic disorders (Park2019Novel). The gene's intolerance to variation is highlighted by its negative RVIS score, indicating a high likelihood of pathogenicity when mutated (Steinfeld2016Mutations).
