# SECTM1

## Overview
SECTM1, or Secreted and Transmembrane 1, is a gene located on chromosome 17q25 that encodes a protein involved in immune system regulation. The SECTM1 protein, also referred to as K12, is a type 1a transmembrane protein associated with the Golgi apparatus and is expressed in various tissues, including peripheral blood leukocytes and breast cancer cell lines (Lyman2000Identification; SlentzKesler1998Identification). It exists in both membrane-bound and secreted forms, with the latter potentially acting as a cytokine or growth factor. The protein interacts with CD7, a receptor on T and NK cells, playing a crucial role in modulating immune responses and cell activation (Lyman2000Identification). The SECTM1 protein's structural features, which resemble those of cytokines and growth factors, suggest its involvement in signaling processes related to immune responses and hematopoiesis (SlentzKesler1998Identification).

## Structure
The SECTM1 protein, also known as K12, is characterized by a 248-amino-acid sequence and is associated with the Golgi apparatus. It is a type 1a membrane protein with a cleaved signal peptide at the N-terminus, followed by an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a smaller intracellular domain (SlentzKesler1998Identification). The extracellular domain is often glycosylated and may contain structural motifs resembling immunoglobulin loops, although it does not belong to the immunoglobulin gene superfamily due to insufficient sequence homology (SlentzKesler1998Identification). The intracellular domain features proline-rich or serine/threonine-rich patches, suggesting potential interactions with signaling molecules (SlentzKesler1998Identification).

The protein exists in both membrane-bound and secreted forms, with the soluble form derived from the membrane-bound form through alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage (SlentzKesler1998Identification). The SECTM1 protein is expressed in various tissues, including peripheral blood leukocytes and breast cancer cell lines, with high expression in granulocytes (SlentzKesler1998Identification). The gene is located on chromosome 17q25, near the CD7 locus, and is implicated in immune system processes (Lyman2000Identification).

## Function
The SECTM1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in immune system regulation, particularly in the activation and proliferation of T cells and other immune cells. The SECTM1 protein is associated with the Golgi apparatus and exists in both membrane-bound and secreted forms. It is primarily expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes, breast cancer cell lines, and various tissues such as the spleen, prostate, and small intestine (Lyman2000Identification; SlentzKesler1998Identification).

SECTM1 interacts with CD7, a receptor on T and NK cells, suggesting a role in modulating immune responses. This interaction can stimulate the up-regulation of activation markers such as CD25, CD54, and CD69 on NK cells, indicating its involvement in immune cell activation (Lyman2000Identification). The protein's structural characteristics resemble those of cytokines and growth factors, suggesting a potential role in signaling processes related to immune responses and hematopoiesis (SlentzKesler1998Identification).

The secreted form of SECTM1 may act as a cytokine or growth factor, interacting with hematopoietic and epithelial cells, although its precise function in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (SlentzKesler1998Identification).

## Interactions
SECTM1, also known as K12, is a transmembrane protein that interacts with CD7, a receptor found on T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. This interaction is significant in immune responses, as CD7 is involved in T cell activation and early T cell development. The binding of SECTM1 to CD7 has been demonstrated using a K12-Fc fusion protein, which binds to primary human T cells and NK cells, indicating that these cells express CD7 as a binding partner for SECTM1 (Lyman2000Identification). The interaction between SECTM1 and CD7 can lead to the upregulation of surface molecules such as CD25, CD54, and CD69 on NK cells, suggesting a role in immune cell activation (Lyman2000Identification).

SECTM1 is also involved in species-specific interactions, as shown by the binding of mouse K12 to mouse CD7, but not to human CD7, highlighting a conserved yet distinct interaction across species (Lyman2000Identification). The interaction between SECTM1 and CD7 is competitive, as evidenced by the ability of SECTM1 to affect the binding of anti-CD7 monoclonal antibodies to cells, suggesting a direct and specific binding mechanism (Lyman2000Identification).
