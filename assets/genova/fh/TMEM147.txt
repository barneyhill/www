# TMEM147

## Overview
TMEM147 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 147, a crucial component of cellular membranes, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and inner nuclear membrane (INM). This protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, which facilitate its role in various cellular processes, including cholesterol homeostasis and nuclear organization. TMEM147 is a part of the Nicalin-NOMO protein complex, which is involved in the proteolytic cleavage of transmembrane proteins and the biogenesis of multi-pass membrane proteins. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the Lamin B Receptor (LBR) and 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7), underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways. TMEM147's expression and function have been linked to several clinical conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma and rheumatoid arthritis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Dettmer2010Transmembrane; Huang2023TMEM147; Christodoulou2020TMEM147).

## Structure
TMEM147 is a transmembrane protein characterized by seven transmembrane domains (TMDs) that contribute to its structural configuration. These domains form a funnel-like structure that extends from the lumen partway across the membrane, creating a lipid-filled cavity at the center of the translocon complex (McGilvray2021An). The protein's N-terminus is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, while the C-terminus faces the cytosolic side of the membrane (Christodoulou2020TMEM147).

TMEM147 is a component of the Nicalin-NOMO protein complex, which is similar to the γ-secretase complex. This complex is involved in the proteolytic cleavage of transmembrane proteins, indicating a role in membrane protein biogenesis (Dettmer2010Transmembrane). The protein is highly conserved across mammalian species, with a 99% identical amino acid sequence among humans, rats, bovines, and mice (Christodoulou2020TMEM147).

TMEM147 interacts with other proteins, such as the Sec61 complex, to facilitate the insertion of hydrophobic segments into the membrane, suggesting its involvement in the biogenesis of multi-pass membrane proteins (McGilvray2021An). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its function in cellular processes, including cholesterol homeostasis and the regulation of the Lamin B Receptor (Christodoulou2020TMEM147).

## Function
TMEM147 is a transmembrane protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the inner nuclear membrane (INM) of human cells. It plays a crucial role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and nuclear organization by interacting with the Lamin B Receptor (LBR) and 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) (Christodoulou2020TMEM147). TMEM147 regulates the levels and localization of LBR, which is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and nuclear lamina organization. Silencing TMEM147 leads to a reduction in LBR and DHCR7 levels, affecting cholesterol metabolism and increasing cholesterol uptake to compensate for decreased endogenous production (Christodoulou2020TMEM147).

TMEM147 is also a component of the Nicalin-NOMO protein complex, which is involved in processes beyond early developmental signaling. This complex is essential for the stability and function of its components, with TMEM147 playing a role in the assembly and stabilization of the complex (Dettmer2010Transmembrane). The interaction of TMEM147 with other proteins in the complex suggests its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways (Dettmer2010Transmembrane).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of TMEM147 have been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies have shown that TMEM147 mRNA and protein levels are significantly upregulated in HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues. This upregulation is associated with poor survival outcomes in HCC patients, as high TMEM147 expression correlates with reduced overall survival and disease-free survival (Huang2023TMEM147). TMEM147 promotes HCC progression by modulating cholesterol homeostasis, suppressing ferroptosis, and promoting the M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages, which facilitates tumor invasion and metastasis (Huang2023TMEM147).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), TMEM147 is involved in the activation of the NF-κB pathway in chondrocytes, contributing to inflammation and cartilage degradation. Increased TMEM147 expression in chondrocytes from RA patients enhances NF-κB activation, leading to elevated IL-6 production and exacerbating RA symptoms. Targeting TMEM147 with specific antibodies or shRNA has been shown to suppress NF-κB activation and reduce arthritis severity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in RA (Ota2020Role).

## Interactions
TMEM147 is known to participate in several protein interactions, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It is a component of the Nicalin-NOMO protein complex, which is conserved across multicellular organisms. This complex is involved in processes beyond Nodal signaling, potentially in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor assembly in invertebrates (Dettmer2010Transmembrane). TMEM147, Nicalin, and NOMO exhibit mutual dependence, as knockdown of any of these proteins results in a reduction of the others, indicating a stabilization mechanism that is posttranscriptional (Dettmer2010Transmembrane).

TMEM147 also interacts with the Lamin B Receptor (LBR), a protein at the inner nuclear membrane involved in heterochromatin organization and cholesterol biosynthesis. Silencing TMEM147 results in the mislocalization of LBR from the inner nuclear membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum, affecting nuclear shape and chromatin structure (Christodoulou2020TMEM147). TMEM147 interacts with 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7), a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, and its downregulation leads to decreased levels of DHCR7 and LBR, impacting cholesterol homeostasis (Christodoulou2020TMEM147).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, TMEM147 interacts with the transcription factor STAT2, influencing the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of STAT2, which in turn regulates DHCR7 expression (Huang2023TMEM147). These interactions highlight TMEM147's role in regulating cholesterol biosynthesis and cellular cholesterol levels.
