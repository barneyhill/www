# HYAL3

## Overview
HYAL3 is a gene that encodes the protein hyaluronidase 3, a member of the hyaluronidase family of enzymes. These enzymes are primarily involved in the metabolism of hyaluronan (HA), a key component of the extracellular matrix. Unlike other hyaluronidases, hyaluronidase 3 does not exhibit intrinsic enzymatic activity under typical experimental conditions, suggesting its role may be non-enzymatic or context-dependent (Hemming2008Mouse; Atmuri2008Hyaluronidase). The protein is characterized by a catalytic domain with a (β/α)8 TIM barrel fold, although its exact function in HA catabolism remains unclear (Jedrzejas2005Structures). HYAL3 is expressed in various tissues and may modulate the activity of hyaluronidase 1 (HYAL1), potentially acting as a chaperone or partner to facilitate proper folding and targeting (Hemming2008Mouse). The gene has been implicated in clinical conditions such as male infertility and bladder cancer, where it may serve as a prognostic biomarker (Liu2022HYAL3; Aslam2022Identification).

## Structure
The HYAL3 protein is characterized by a major catalytic domain that resembles the (β/α)8 TIM barrel fold, which is crucial for substrate binding and hydrolytic degradation (Stern2006Hyaluronidases:; Jedrzejas2005Structures). This domain includes a large cleft responsible for binding the hyaluronic acid (HA) substrate, with the active site located within this cleft. Key catalytic residues include Glu131, Asp129, Tyr202, Tyr247, and Trp321, which are essential for the enzyme's function (Jedrzejas2005Structures).

The C-terminal domain of HYAL3 is distinct from the catalytic domain and is composed of two helices and a coiled region, though its specific function remains unknown (Stern2006Hyaluronidases:). The N-terminal segment of the catalytic domain features two helices connected by a short loop (Jedrzejas2005Structures).

HYAL3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, with three predicted N-linked glycosylation sites at amino acid positions 69, 216, and 349 (Reese2010Acidic). These modifications contribute to the protein's molecular weight and may result in different isoforms, as observed in human sperm (Reese2010Acidic). The presence of multiple forms of HYAL3, ranging from 45 to 56 kDa, is attributed to differences in N-glycan content (Hemming2008Mouse).

## Function
The HYAL3 gene encodes the hyaluronidase 3 protein, which is part of the hyaluronidase family of enzymes involved in the metabolism of hyaluronan (HA), a significant component of the extracellular matrix. Although HYAL3 is broadly expressed in multiple tissues, its exact function in HA catabolism is not fully understood. Studies suggest that HYAL3 may not function as a classic hyaluronidase enzyme involved in HA degradation, as HYAL3 knockout mice do not show evidence of HA accumulation (Atmuri2008Hyaluronidase).

In cellular processes, HYAL3 is thought to play a role in modulating the activity of hyaluronidase 1 (HYAL1). Overexpression of HYAL3 in cultured cells has been shown to increase HYAL1 activity, suggesting a potential indirect role in HA metabolism by stabilizing or inducing HYAL1 expression (Hemming2008Mouse). This interaction may involve HYAL3 acting as a chaperone or partner to ensure proper folding and targeting of HYAL1 (Hemming2008Mouse).

Despite its involvement in HA metabolism, HYAL3 does not exhibit intrinsic hyaluronidase activity under experimental conditions, indicating that its function may be non-enzymatic or dependent on specific cellular contexts (Hemming2008Mouse; Atmuri2008Hyaluronidase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HYAL3 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In male infertility, particularly oligospermia, novel mutations in the HYAL3 gene have been identified. These include a mismatch mutation at amino acid position 286 in exon 2, resulting in the substitution of arginine with another amino acid, and a frameshift deletion mutation in the same exon. These mutations were found in primary infertile oligospermia patients but not in secondary infertile patients or normal individuals, suggesting a specific link to this condition (Aslam2022Identification).

In bladder cancer (BLCA), HYAL3 is suggested to function as an oncogene. Elevated expression levels of HYAL3 have been observed in tumor samples compared to normal tissues, correlating with shorter overall survival in BLCA patients. This suggests that HYAL3 could serve as an independent prognostic factor and a potential biomarker for predicting the pathological stage of BLCA. The gene's expression is also associated with immune cell infiltration, indicating a role in tumorigenesis through immune regulation (Liu2022HYAL3).

In contrast, studies using Hyal3 knockout mice indicate that HYAL3 may not play a major role in hyaluronan degradation under normal conditions, as these mice did not show significant phenotypic changes or HA accumulation (Atmuri2008Hyaluronidase).
