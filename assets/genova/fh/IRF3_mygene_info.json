The encoded protein is found in an inactive cytoplasmic form that upon serine/threonine phosphorylation forms a complex with CREBBP.

The protein plays an important role in the innate immune response against DNA and RNA viruses. Mutations in this gene are associated with Encephalopathy, acute, infection-induced, herpes-specific, 7.
