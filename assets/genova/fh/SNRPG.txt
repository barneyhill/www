# SNRPG

## Overview
The SNRPG gene encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide G, a critical component of the spliceosome complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing. This protein is categorized as a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) and plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis and function of spliceosomal snRNPs, including U1, U2, U4, and U5, which are essential for the accurate removal of introns and joining of exons in pre-mRNA (Zhao2023The; Qin2023SNRPG). Beyond its fundamental role in mRNA processing, SNRPG is implicated in the regulation of histone transcript processing and alternative splicing, influencing gene expression and cellular function (Zhao2023The). The protein's interactions with other snRNP components and its involvement in various signaling pathways underscore its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states, including cancer (Pánek2023The; Qin2023SNRPG).

## Structure


## Function
The SNRPG gene encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide G, a core component of the spliceosome, which is crucial for the splicing of pre-mRNA into mature mRNA. This process is essential for the proper expression of genes, as it ensures the accurate removal of introns and the joining of exons (Zhao2023The; Qin2023SNRPG). SNRPG is involved in the biogenesis of major and minor spliceosome precursors, specifically uridyl-rich small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (U snRNPs) such as U1, U2, U4, and U5 (Zhao2023The). These snRNPs are vital for maintaining normal cellular processes and gene expression regulation.

In addition to its role in splicing, SNRPG is involved in the processing of the 3' ends of histone transcripts, which may influence histone modifications and alternative splicing (Zhao2023The). The protein's functions are predominantly mediated by protein-protein interactions, suggesting its involvement in various cellular processes through these interactions (Qin2023SNRPG). SNRPG is primarily active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the assembly and stability of snRNPs, playing a crucial role in mRNA processing and gene expression regulation.

## Clinical Significance
The SNRPG gene, encoding small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide G, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SNRPG is notably upregulated in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and lower survival rates in HCC patients. Knockdown of SNRPG in HCC cells results in decreased proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and reduced expression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway components, indicating its role in tumor progression (Qin2023SNRPG).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SNRPG is also overexpressed and linked to TP53 mutations, higher tumor grades, and advanced cancer stages. High SNRPG expression correlates with poor overall survival, suggesting its potential as an independent prognostic factor (Liu2022SNRPD1EFG).

SNRPG's role extends to brain tumors, where it is often overexpressed and may influence tumorigenesis through posttranscriptional modulation of TP53. Its expression is associated with immune cell infiltration, potentially affecting the immune response in cancer (Zhao2023The). These findings highlight SNRPG as a potential therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
SNRPG is a component of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential for pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with other Sm proteins, including SmB, SmD1, and SmD2, to form the core snRNP complex, facilitating spliceosome assembly and function (Pánek2023The). SNRPG is involved in the maturation of spliceosomal snRNPs, where it binds to a conserved U-rich sequence in snRNAs, known as the Sm site, as part of the SMN complex (Pánek2023The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SNRPG interacts with SNRPB, another snRNP family member, and this interaction is crucial for activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is important for tumor development and progression (Qin2023SNRPG). The interaction between SNRPG and SNRPB has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays (Qin2023SNRPG).

SNRPG also interacts with the enhancer of rudimentary homolog (ERH) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), where its upregulation is associated with shorter survival times in patients (Tsai2023Upregulated). This interaction suggests a potential role for SNRPG in the progression and prognosis of LUAD through its interaction with ERH (Tsai2023Upregulated).
