# ZNF528

## Overview
ZNF528 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 528, a member of the KRAB C2H2 zinc finger protein family, which functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding, and a krüppel associated box (KRAB) domain, typically involved in transcriptional repression. ZNF528 is expressed in various human tissues, including the cerebellum, thyroid, prostate, and ovary, and plays a significant role in regulating genes associated with bone morphology and musculoskeletal phenotypes. Variants in ZNF528, such as the c.1282C>T/p.Arg428* nonsense mutation, have been linked to severe early onset primary osteoporosis, highlighting its clinical significance in bone development and maintenance (Skarp2020Exome).

## Structure
ZNF528 is a zinc finger protein involved in transcriptional regulation, characterized by its zinc finger domains. The gene consists of 3994 base pairs organized into seven exons and encodes two isoforms. Isoform 1 is composed of 628 amino acids and includes a krüppel associated box (KRAB) domain and 15 C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains are crucial for protein-protein interactions and DNA binding, respectively (Skarp2020Exome). Isoform 2 lacks the first 233 amino acids, including the KRAB domain, and its function remains unknown (Skarp2020Exome).

The KRAB domain is typically involved in transcriptional repression, while the C2H2-type zinc finger domains facilitate DNA binding. The c.1282C > T/p.Arg428* variant in ZNF528 results in a truncated protein that disrupts the 8th C2H2-type zinc finger, likely affecting its DNA-binding capability and altering its genomic binding profile (Skarp2020Exome). This variant still localizes to the cell nucleus but changes the expression of several target genes, particularly those related to bone morphology (Skarp2020Exome). The zinc finger domains are under strong selective pressure, indicating their importance in maintaining the protein's function (Dogan2019A).

## Function
ZNF528 is a zinc finger transcription factor involved in transcriptional regulation in human cells. It is expressed in various tissues, including the cerebellum, thyroid, prostate, and ovary, and is also present in bone and connective tissue cell lines (Skarp2020Exome). ZNF528 contains a KRAB domain and multiple C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which facilitate its role as a DNA-binding transcription factor (Skarp2020Exome). The KRAB domain is typically involved in protein-protein interactions, while the zinc finger domains bind specific DNA motifs, allowing ZNF528 to regulate gene expression (Skarp2020Exome).

In healthy cells, ZNF528 localizes to the nucleus, where it influences the expression of genes involved in various biological processes, including cell cycle regulation and cancer pathways (Skarp2020Exome). It plays a significant role in bone morphology and musculoskeletal phenotypes by regulating genes associated with bone morphogenic protein signaling and endochondral ossification pathways (Skarp2020Exome). The protein's activity in these pathways suggests its involvement in bone development and maintenance, contributing to the regulation of bone-related target genes (Skarp2020Exome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF528 gene have been implicated in severe early onset primary osteoporosis, particularly in individuals with a concurrent deletion in the COL1A2 gene. A specific nonsense variant, c.1282C>T/p.Arg428*, results in a truncated ZNF528 protein that alters its DNA binding capabilities and affects the expression of several bone-related genes (Skarp2020Exome). This variant leads to a reprogramming of the global genomic binding profile, suggesting a potential acquisition of novel functions that may contribute to the osteoporosis phenotype through pathways such as WNT signaling and Notch signaling, which are crucial for bone development and homeostasis (Skarp2020Exome).

The variant ZNF528-c.1282C>T has been shown to differentially regulate a larger number of genes compared to the wild-type, with significant enrichment in bone-related pathways, including bone morphogenic protein signaling and endochondral ossification (Skarp2020Exome). This suggests that the ZNF528 variant may have a significant impact on bone development and morphology, potentially modifying the phenotype in conditions like primary osteoporosis (Skarp2020Exome). The study highlights ZNF528 as a novel candidate gene for bone disorders, with its variant potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of primary osteoporosis in conjunction with the COL1A2 deletion (Skarp2020Exome).

## Interactions
ZNF528 is a zinc finger protein that participates in various interactions, primarily through its zinc finger domains. These domains facilitate the binding of ZNF528 to DNA, allowing it to function as a transcriptional regulator. The protein is part of the KRAB C2H2 zinc finger protein family, which are known to act as transcriptional repressors. ZNF528 interacts with DNA by forming complexes with KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1), which helps recruit co-regulators necessary for its function (Skarp2020Exome).

The ZNF528-c.1282C > T variant, a nonsense mutation, results in a truncated protein that alters its DNA binding and genomic binding profile. This variant affects the expression of several target genes related to bone processes, indicating a change in its interaction dynamics compared to the wild-type protein. The variant shows a significant increase in binding peaks and distinct DNA-binding motifs, suggesting a functional gain due to the mutation (Skarp2020Exome). The altered interactions of the variant with DNA and potentially other proteins may contribute to the phenotypic effects observed in primary osteoporosis (Skarp2020Exome).
