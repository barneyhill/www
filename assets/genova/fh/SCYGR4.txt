# SCYGR4

## Overview
SCYGR4 is a gene that encodes the protein small cysteine and glycine repeat containing 4, which is characterized by its unique sequence of cysteine and glycine repeats. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. The protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its repeat motifs, which suggest a role in maintaining cellular architecture or facilitating protein-protein interactions. Research into SCYGR4 and its encoded protein is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its potential involvement in specific signaling pathways and its implications in health and disease.
