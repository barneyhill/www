# TAS2R60

## Overview
TAS2R60 is a gene that encodes the protein taste 2 receptor member 60, which is part of the taste receptor 2 (TAS2R) family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and is primarily involved in the detection of bitter compounds, playing a crucial role in the perception of bitterness. The TAS2R60 protein contributes to dietary choices and toxin avoidance by helping organisms identify potentially harmful substances. Beyond its role in taste perception, TAS2R60 is expressed in various extraoral tissues, suggesting additional physiological functions, such as contributing to innate immunity in human skin through the release of antimicrobial peptides. Despite its involvement in these processes, the specific molecular activities and broader physiological implications of TAS2R60 remain to be fully elucidated (Soares2013Different; Shaw2018Personalized).

## Function
TAS2R60, a member of the taste receptor 2 (TAS2R) family, is primarily involved in the perception of bitter taste. These receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that detect bitter compounds, initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of bitterness. This function is crucial for dietary choices and toxin avoidance, as it helps organisms identify potentially harmful substances (Shaw2018Personalized).

In addition to their role in taste perception, TAS2R receptors, including TAS2R60, are expressed in various extraoral tissues, suggesting roles beyond taste. In human skin, TAS2R60 and other TAS2Rs may contribute to innate immunity by participating in the release of antimicrobial peptides, providing a protective mechanism against pathogens (Shaw2018Personalized). However, TAS2R60 did not respond to specific phenolic compounds in studies, indicating that its role in detecting these substances might be limited or context-dependent (Soares2013Different).

The expression of TAS2R60 in non-gustatory tissues highlights its potential involvement in physiological processes beyond taste, although the specific molecular activities and organismal outcomes in these contexts remain to be fully elucidated (Shaw2018Personalized).

## Clinical Significance
The TAS2R60 gene, part of the TAS2R family encoding bitter taste receptors, has been studied for its role in various cancers. In solid tumors, TAS2R60 often shows decreased expression compared to normal tissues, with a mutation rate of approximately 7% in skin melanoma and about 4% in lung squamous cell carcinomas. These alterations in expression and mutation rates suggest a potential role for TAS2R60 as a prognostic marker in these cancers (Carey2022Impact).

In colon cancer, TAS2R60 is notably downregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, contrasting with other TAS2R genes that are typically overexpressed. This downregulation may be linked to the gene's involvement in cancer progression and patient prognosis, although specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from TAS2R60 mutations or expression changes are not detailed (Bi2024Comprehensive).

Despite its potential significance in cancer, the TAS2R60 gene does not appear to be associated with alcohol consumption behavior, as studies have found no link between the TAS2R60 rs4595035 polymorphism and the frequency of alcohol consumption (Kurshed2022The). Overall, the clinical implications of TAS2R60 require further investigation to fully understand its role in disease.
