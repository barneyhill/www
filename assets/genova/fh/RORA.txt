# RORA

## Overview
The RORA gene encodes the RAR-related orphan receptor A (RORα), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that functions as a transcription factor. RORα is characterized by its ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression, playing a crucial role in various physiological processes, including inflammation, lipid metabolism, and circadian rhythm regulation (Raspé2001Transcriptional; Nejati2018RORα). The protein is composed of several domains, including a DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain, which facilitate its interaction with specific DNA sequences and natural ligands such as cholesterol (Rani2024RARrelated). RORα can act as both an activator and repressor of transcription, interacting with coactivators and corepressors to modulate gene expression (Jetten2009RetinoidRelated). The gene's expression and function have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including neurological disorders, psychiatric conditions, and cancer, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Nguyen2010Global; Cook2015Retinoic).

## Structure
The RORA protein, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function as a transcription factor. It includes an N-terminal transactivation domain (NTTD), a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a hinge domain, and a carboxy-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) (Rani2024RARrelated). The DBD contains zinc finger motifs that facilitate specific binding to DNA sequences, while the LBD is responsible for binding natural ligands such as cholesterol, which induces conformational changes necessary for its activity (Rani2024RARrelated).

The protein undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at serine and threonine residues, ubiquitination, acetylation, and SUMOylation, which modulate its activity and interactions with other proteins (Rani2024RARrelated). RORA exists in four isoforms—RORa1, RORa2, RORa3, and RORa4—produced through alternative promoter use and exon splicing, with RORa1 and RORa4 being the predominant forms (CHAUVET2002Retinoic; Rani2024RARrelated). These isoforms share common DNA and ligand-binding domains but differ in their amino-terminal sequences, affecting their DNA binding preferences (CHAUVET2002Retinoic). The protein can form homodimers or heterodimers, influencing its regulatory functions.

## Function
The RORA gene encodes the RORα protein, a member of the nuclear receptor transcription factor family, which plays a significant role in regulating various molecular processes in human cells. RORα is involved in both the activation and repression of a wide range of genes, influencing metabolic and inflammatory signaling pathways (Nejati2018RORα). In human macrophages, RORα acts as a negative regulator of inflammation. Its deletion leads to increased expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6, indicating its role in maintaining an anti-inflammatory state (Nejati2018RORα). RORα also modulates the expression of TREM1, a gene associated with inflammation, further supporting its role in controlling inflammatory responses (Nejati2018RORα).

Beyond its role in inflammation, RORα is involved in lipid metabolism. It regulates the expression of genes like APOA-I, ABCA1, and CYP19A1, which are crucial for lipid homeostasis (Nejati2018RORα). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to modulate gene expression, impacting processes such as circadian rhythm, metabolism, and immune function, thereby contributing to overall organismal homeostasis (Raspé2001Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RORA gene have been implicated in several neurological, psychiatric, and metabolic disorders. In autism spectrum disorders (ASD), reduced expression of RORA has been observed in the cerebellum and cortex of affected individuals, correlating with decreased Purkinje cell number and size, similar to findings in RORA-deficient mice (Nguyen2010Global; Cook2015Retinoic). The gene's expression is also influenced by DNA methylation, which may contribute to its reduced levels in ASD (Nguyen2010Global).

In psychiatric conditions, RORA polymorphisms have been linked to depression and posttraumatic stress disorder, with its expression showing correlations with stress response regulation (Hennings2015RNA). RORA is also associated with asthma, where specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene interact with other genetic factors to influence susceptibility (Acevedo2013Interaction; Lima2019Genetic).

In cancer, RORA expression is down-regulated during tumor development, with its restoration inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer (Cook2015Retinoic). Alterations in RORA expression are also linked to metabolic conditions, impacting processes like insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism (Cook2015Retinoic).

## Interactions
RORA (RAR-related orphan receptor A) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its regulatory functions. It interacts with coactivators such as NCOA1, NCOA2, and PGC-1α, which are part of ROR complexes that modulate gene transcription (Jetten2009RetinoidRelated). RORA also forms complexes with corepressors like NCOR1, NCOR2, and RIP140, highlighting its dual role as both an activator and repressor of transcription (Jetten2009RetinoidRelated).

In the context of hepatic lipid homeostasis, RORA interacts with HDAC3 to repress PPARγ-mediated transcriptional activity. This interaction is crucial for regulating lipid metabolism and involves the recruitment of RORA and HDAC3 to PPARγ target promoters, such as Cd36, Scd1, and Plin2, in the liver (Kim2017RORα).

RORA also interacts with the protein ataxin 1 (ATXN1) in a complex mediated by the coactivator TIP60, which is essential for the expression of RORA-target genes necessary for Purkinje cell development and function (Jetten2009RetinoidRelated). Additionally, RORA is involved in a regulatory loop with the tumor suppressor p53, where it positively regulates p53 expression and phosphorylation, contributing to its tumor suppressor functions (Zheng2018MicroRNAtranscription).
