# PTPRD

## Overview
PTPRD, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein belonging to the LAR-RPTP subfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including synaptic differentiation, neurogenesis, and cancer progression. The PTPRD protein is characterized by its extracellular region, which contains immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III-like domains, and its intracellular region, which includes two phosphatase domains. The membrane-proximal domain (D1) is catalytically active, while the membrane-distal domain (D2) modulates D1's activity (Qian2023Manipulating; Tomita2020The). PTPRD is involved in dephosphorylating receptor tyrosine kinases, thereby influencing signaling pathways critical for neural development and tumor suppression (Huang2020Protein; Tomita2020The). Mutations in the PTPRD gene have been associated with various cancers and neurological disorders, underscoring its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Hendriks2013Protein; Sun2021Identification).

## Structure
PTPRD (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D) is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the LAR-RPTP subfamily. Its molecular structure includes an extracellular region, a single transmembrane segment, and two intracellular phosphatase domains. The extracellular segment is composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains and either four or eight fibronectin type III-like domains, depending on the isoform (Qian2023Manipulating; Tomita2020The). The intracellular portion contains two phosphatase domains: the membrane-proximal domain (D1), which has catalytic activity, and the membrane-distal domain (D2), which regulates the activity of D1 (Qian2023Manipulating).

PTPRD can undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and glycosylation, which contribute to its functional diversity. The protein is subject to proteolytic processing at specific sites, releasing the phosphatase intracellular domain into the cytosol (Qian2023Manipulating). Dimerization of PTPRD, which can be induced by antibodies targeting its ectodomain, inhibits its phosphatase activity and has therapeutic potential in cancer treatment (El2024Analysis; Qian2023Manipulating). Multiple splice variants of PTPRD exist, which may alter the number of fibronectin type III-like domains and affect its function (Tomita2020The).

## Function
PTPRD (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D) is a member of the LAR receptor tyrosine phosphatase family, playing a crucial role in synaptic differentiation and neurogenesis. It is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, where it interacts with various synaptic partners such as NGL-3, SALM3/5, IL1RAPL1, IL1RAcP, and Slitrk proteins. These interactions are essential for maintaining the excitatory/inhibitory balance in synaptic differentiation, which is vital for healthy brain function (Cornejo2021LAR).

PTPRD is involved in the regulation of cortical neurogenesis by modulating the activity of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) like TrkB and PDGFRb. It dephosphorylates these RTKs, thereby controlling the MEK-ERK signaling pathway, which is crucial for the proliferation and differentiation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) (Tomita2020The). Knockdown or knockout of PTPRD leads to increased neurogenesis, indicating its role in preventing the hyperactivation of RTKs and maintaining the balance between NPC proliferation and differentiation (Tomita2020The).

PTPRD also influences synaptic function by regulating AMPA receptor synaptic transmission and NMDAR-mediated responses, contributing to cognitive processes such as learning and memory (Cornejo2021LAR).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PTPRD gene have been implicated in various cancers and disorders. In non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (ns-NSCLC), PTPRD mutations are associated with longer progression-free survival and higher objective response rates when treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), suggesting their role as prognostic biomarkers (Sun2021Identification). In melanoma, PTPRD mutations correlate with longer median overall survival, indicating potential predictive value for ICI response (Sun2021Identification).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), PTPRD mutations lead to increased phosphorylation of STAT3, resulting in its hyperactivation. This hyperactivation is linked to decreased survival and resistance to certain therapies, but also increased sensitivity to STAT3 inhibitors, highlighting PTPRD mutations as potential therapeutic targets (Peyser2015LossofFunction).

PTPRD mutations are also associated with higher tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, which are favorable indicators for ICI treatment across multiple cancer types (Shang2022PTPRDPTPRT). Beyond cancer, PTPRD has been linked to restless legs syndrome and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, with specific SNPs affecting its expression and function (Hendriks2013Protein).

## Interactions
PTPRD, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as TrkB and PDGFRb, playing a crucial role in regulating their activity during cortical neurogenesis. PTPRD dephosphorylates these RTKs, thereby modulating the downstream MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which is essential for cortical neural progenitor cell biology (Tomita2020The).

PTPRD also interacts with adhesion molecules like β-catenin and E-cadherin, but not N-cadherin, suggesting a specific regulatory role in the β-catenin/E-cadherin complex. This interaction is significant for cell-cell adhesion and migration, particularly in the context of cancer cell behavior (FUNATO2011Tyrosine).

In cancer, PTPRD is involved in the regulation of several signaling pathways, including the STAT3, Wnt/β-catenin/TCF, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. It dephosphorylates STAT3, preventing its dimerization and nuclear translocation, which is crucial for its role as a tumor suppressor (Huang2020Protein). PTPRD's interactions with these pathways highlight its significance in both neurodevelopmental processes and cancer progression.
