# SPTBN2

## Overview
The SPTBN2 gene encodes the protein spectrin beta, non-erythrocytic 2, also known as β-III spectrin, which is a critical component of the cytoskeletal framework in neurons. This protein is categorized as a structural protein and plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity and function of neuronal cells, particularly in the cerebellum. β-III spectrin is involved in forming a supportive scaffold for cell membranes and is essential for the proper functioning of cerebellar Purkinje cells, among other neuronal types. It interacts with various proteins, including actin and ankyrin, to facilitate cellular processes such as maintaining cell shape and supporting synaptic function. Mutations in the SPTBN2 gene are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, including spinocerebellar ataxia, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining neurological health (Accogli2019Heterozygous; Lise2012Recessive; Romaniello2021Novel).

## Structure
The SPTBN2 gene encodes the β-III-spectrin protein, a crucial component of the cellular membrane skeleton. This protein is involved in maintaining cell shape, strength, and elasticity, and plays a significant role in protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions (AlMuhaizea2017A). The primary structure of β-III-spectrin includes 2390 amino acids and features 110 domains, with 2183 variations identified (AlMuhaizea2017A). The protein contains spectrin repeat domains, which are essential for its function, and these repeats contribute to its flexible rod-like tertiary structure (AlMuhaizea2017A).

The secondary structure of β-III-spectrin is characterized by alpha-helical coiled-coils, typical of spectrin proteins. The quaternary structure involves interactions with other spectrin or ankyrin proteins, facilitating its role in the cytoskeleton (AlMuhaizea2017A). β-III-spectrin is highly expressed in Purkinje cells, where it stabilizes the glutamate transporter EAAT4, and its loss of function can lead to reduced sodium current and progressive loss of inhibitory cerebellar output (AlMuhaizea2017A).

The SPTBN2 protein also contains several domains, including low complexity segments, PANTHER, SMART, superfamily, Pfam, and PROSITE domains (AlMuhaizea2017A). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may affect its function and interactions. Splice variants of SPTBN2 result in different isoforms, potentially leading to distinct functional roles within the cell (AlMuhaizea2017A).

## Function
The SPTBN2 gene encodes β-III spectrin, a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of neurons in the human brain. β-III spectrin is involved in forming a structural framework that supports cell membranes by forming antiparallel tetrameric heterodimers with α-II spectrin, encoded by SPTAN1. This structure is essential for maintaining the integrity and function of neurons (Lise2012Recessive). β-III spectrin contains domains that bind to actin, the glutamate transporter EAAT4, and ankyrin, which are vital for its role in cellular processes (Lise2012Recessive).

In healthy human cells, β-III spectrin is particularly important for the function of cerebellar Purkinje cells and possibly other brain regions involved in cognition. Studies in knockout mice have shown that the absence of β-III spectrin leads to cerebellar ataxia, Purkinje cell degeneration, and cognitive deficits, indicating its importance in cortical brain development and cognitive functions (Lise2012Recessive). The protein is also involved in dendritic development in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, with irregular dendritic morphology observed in knockout mice, suggesting its role in cognitive functions (Lise2012Recessive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPTBN2 gene are associated with various forms of spinocerebellar ataxia, a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive cerebellar atrophy and coordination issues. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 5 (SCA5) is linked to heterozygous missense variants and in-frame deletions in SPTBN2, typically presenting as an adult-onset, slowly progressive condition (Accogli2019Heterozygous; Wang2014A). However, certain heterozygous missense variants, such as c.1438C>T (p.R480W) and c.1309C>G (p.R437G), can lead to infantile-onset cerebellar ataxia, resembling spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCAR14), which is usually caused by biallelic loss-of-function variants (Accogli2019Heterozygous).

In addition to SCA5, SPTBN2 mutations have been implicated in autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCAs), characterized by congenital ataxia, mental retardation, and pyramidal signs (Elsayed2013Autosomal). These mutations can result in altered dendritic morphology and deficits in glutamatergic neurotransmission, affecting neuronal function (Romaniello2021Novel). The gene's role in maintaining dendritic architecture in cerebellar Purkinje cells is crucial, and disruptions can lead to severe neurological impairments (Romaniello2021Novel). DNA methylation changes in SPTBN2 have also been associated with attention deficits in children, suggesting a broader impact on neurodevelopment (Li2021DNA).

## Interactions
SPTBN2, or spectrin beta, non-erythrocytic 2, is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cancer progression. In endometrial cancer, SPTBN2 interacts with CLDN4, a tight junction protein, influencing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This interaction promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes (Wang2021SPTBN2). Immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the physical interaction between SPTBN2 and CLDN4, suggesting that SPTBN2 may form a complex with CLDN4 to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway (Wang2021SPTBN2).

In endometrioid ovarian cancer, SPTBN2 is associated with the ITGB4-mediated focal adhesion and ECM receptor signaling pathways. Knockdown of SPTBN2 leads to decreased expression of ITGB4 and related proteins, affecting cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion. ITGB4 overexpression can reverse the effects of SPTBN2 knockdown, indicating a regulatory interaction between SPTBN2 and ITGB4 (Yang2023SPTBN2).

In colorectal cancer, SPTBN2 is involved in interactions with METTL3, facilitated by LINC01605. This interaction enhances the m6A modification of SPTBN2 mRNA, which is crucial for its expression and function in cancer cell proliferation and survival (Yue2021LINC01605).
