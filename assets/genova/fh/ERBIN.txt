# ERBIN

## Overview
ERBIN is a gene that encodes the erbb2 interacting protein, a member of the LAP (leucine-rich repeat and PDZ domain) family, which plays a crucial role in cellular signaling and structural organization. The protein is characterized by its 16 leucine-rich repeats and a PDZ domain, which facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as the ERBB2/HER2 receptor, influencing processes like morphogenesis and oncogenesis (Huang2001Erbin; Birrane2003Novel). ERBIN is predominantly localized at the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells, where it contributes to maintaining cell polarity and integrity. It also modulates signaling pathways, including the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway, and is involved in cell-cell adhesion through interactions with proteins like p0071 (Dai2007Erbin; Izawa2002ERBIN). Clinically, alterations in ERBIN expression are linked to various diseases, including cancers and inflammatory conditions, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Stevens2018Erbin; Jang2020The).

## Structure
ERBIN, a member of the LAP (leucine-rich repeat and PDZ domain) family, is characterized by its molecular structure, which includes 16 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) in the N-terminus and a PDZ domain in the C-terminus. The PDZ domain is crucial for ERBIN's interactions with other proteins, such as ErbB2, and is characterized by a conserved histidine residue (Huang2001Erbin). The PDZ domain of ERBIN is a class I domain that can bind both class I and II ligands, demonstrating flexibility in accommodating different side chains (Birrane2003Novel). The crystal structure of the ERBIN PDZ domain bound to an ErbB2 peptide reveals deviations from the canonical PDZ fold, including a single α-helix and a longer β2-β3 loop, which allows unique interactions (Birrane2003Novel).

ERBIN is tightly associated with membranes and is expressed as a 180-kDa protein in various tissues, including the lung, heart, and kidney (Huang2001Erbin). It undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its interactions and functions (Birrane2003Novel). ERBIN also has several splice variant isoforms, which may influence its functional roles and interactions (Zhang2008Overexpression).

## Function
ERBIN, a member of the LAP (leucine-rich repeat and PDZ domain) family, plays a significant role in maintaining epithelial cell polarity and integrity. It is primarily localized at the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells, where it interacts with the ERBB2/HER2 receptor, ensuring its proper localization and function. This interaction is crucial for the receptor's signaling capabilities, which are important for cellular processes such as morphogenesis and oncogenesis (Borg2000ERBIN:).

ERBIN also modulates the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling pathway by inhibiting the interaction between Smad2/Smad3 and Smad4, thereby preventing their nuclear translocation and subsequent transcriptional activity. This regulatory function is essential for controlling cell growth and differentiation, highlighting ERBIN's role as a negative regulator of TGFβ signaling (Dai2007Erbin).

In addition to its role in signaling pathways, ERBIN is involved in cell-cell adhesion processes. It interacts with p0071, an armadillo repeat protein, at adherens junctions and desmosomes, contributing to the structural organization and integrity of epithelial tissues (JaulinBastard2002Interaction; Izawa2002ERBIN). These interactions underscore ERBIN's importance in maintaining cellular architecture and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ERBIN gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ERBIN is identified as a tumor suppressor, with its expression significantly downregulated in tumor tissues. This downregulation disrupts epithelial cell polarity and enhances signaling through the Akt and RAS/RAF pathways, promoting tumor progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Stevens2018Erbin). ERBIN's interaction with kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1) is crucial in preventing oncogenic signaling, and its loss accelerates tumor progression in Apc mutant mouse models (Stevens2018Erbin).

In breast cancer, ERBIN downregulation is associated with trastuzumab resistance in Her2-overexpressing cells, as it leads to enhanced AKT activation and increased cell migration (Liu2013Downregulation). In cervical cancer, ERBIN deficiency induces resistance to anoikis, a form of programmed cell death, by activating the STAT3 pathway, contributing to increased tumor growth and metastasis (Hu2013Deficiency).

ERBIN also plays a role in inflammatory diseases. Its interaction with Nod2 affects inflammatory responses, and its loss leads to increased activation of NFκB and proinflammatory cytokine secretion, which are linked to Crohn's disease (Jang2020The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ERBIN in various diseases, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ERBIN, a protein encoded by the ERBIN gene, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for cellular signaling and structural organization. It interacts with ERBB2 (also known as HER2), a receptor tyrosine kinase, through its PDZ domain. This interaction is specific and does not occur with other proteins that interact with similar PDZ domain proteins like PICK1 (JaulinBastard2001The). ERBIN also binds to p0071, an armadillo repeat protein related to catenins, in a PDZ domain-dependent manner. This interaction is significant for maintaining the integrity of epithelial cells, as both proteins colocalize in desmosomes and along the lateral membrane of epithelial cells (JaulinBastard2002Interaction).

In the context of TGFβ signaling, ERBIN interacts with Smad proteins, particularly Smad2 and Smad3, through a novel Smad-interacting domain adjacent to its PDZ domain. This interaction sequesters Smad2/Smad3 from associating with Smad4, thereby modulating TGFβ-dependent transcriptional responses (Dai2007Erbin). ERBIN also interacts with δ-catenin and ARVCF, forming part of a cadherin-catenin complex in the brain, which suggests its role in recruiting ERBIN to these complexes (Laura2002The).
