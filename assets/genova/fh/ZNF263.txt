# ZNF263

## Overview
ZNF263 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 263, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. The protein is characterized by its nine C2H2 zinc finger domains, a SCAN domain, and a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which collectively facilitate its role as a transcriptional repressor (Weiss2020ZNF263; Frietze2010Genomic). ZNF263 is primarily involved in the biosynthesis of heparin and heparan sulfate, where it negatively regulates key enzymes, impacting biological processes such as anticoagulation and cell signaling (Weiss2020ZNF263). The protein's activity is predominantly nuclear, where it binds to GA-rich sequences near transcription start sites, influencing promoter activity and maintaining genomic stability (Frietze2010Genomic). ZNF263 has been implicated in various cancers, including glioblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it contributes to tumor progression and chemoresistance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yu2020The; Cui2020A).

## Structure
ZNF263 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of nine C2H2-type zinc finger domains located at the C-terminus, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability (Frietze2010Genomic). These zinc finger domains contribute to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures, facilitating its role as a transcription factor. The protein also contains a SCAN domain at the N-terminus and a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain situated between the SCAN domain and the zinc finger domains (Frietze2010Genomic). The SCAN domain is highly conserved across species, indicating its importance in the protein's function (delahaye2018characterisation).

The KRAB domain is typically associated with transcriptional repression, although in ZNF263, it does not effectively interact with the KAP1/SETDB1 complex due to substitutions in critical residues of the KRAB domain consensus sequence (Frietze2010ZNF274). This lack of interaction suggests that ZNF263 may have unique functions compared to other KRAB domain-containing proteins. ZNF263 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could regulate its activity. The protein may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
ZNF263 is a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor that functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor in the biosynthesis of heparin and heparan sulfate (HS). It contains nine zinc finger domains, a KRAB repression domain, and a SCAN domain, which facilitate its binding to specific DNA sequences and its role in gene regulation (Weiss2020ZNF263; Frietze2010Genomic). ZNF263 negatively regulates the expression of key enzymes such as HS3ST1 and HS3ST3A1, which are involved in the 3-O-sulfation process crucial for the anticoagulant activity of heparin and HS (Weiss2020ZNF263). 

In healthy human cells, ZNF263 binds to GA-rich sequences near transcription start sites and within intragenic regions, suggesting its involvement in regulating gene expression by modulating promoter activity (Frietze2010Genomic). The protein's activity is primarily nuclear, where it influences transcriptional activity and maintains genomic stability by potentially defending against retrotransposons (Nätt2015High). ZNF263's regulatory functions are significant in maintaining the balance of sulfation in heparin and HS biosynthesis, impacting biological activities such as anticoagulation and cell signaling (Weiss2020ZNF263).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF263 has been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZNF263 is significantly upregulated and is associated with poor prognosis. Its elevated expression correlates with larger tumor size, advanced clinical stage, and resistance to apoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-dependent autophagy. This suggests that ZNF263 contributes to tumor progression and chemoresistance in HCC, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Cui2020A).

In glioblastoma, ZNF263 interacts with the EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway, which stabilizes the protein and prevents its degradation. This interaction leads to the epigenetic silencing of the tumor suppressor gene SIX3, promoting glioblastoma development. High levels of ZNF263 in glioblastoma tissues are associated with poor patient prognosis, indicating its role in tumor progression (Yu2020The).

ZNF263 also plays a role in the biosynthesis of heparin and heparan sulfate, acting as a transcriptional repressor of key biosynthetic enzymes. Alterations in ZNF263 expression can impact anticoagulant activity, suggesting potential clinical implications in conditions related to coagulation and thrombosis (Weiss2020ZNF263).

## Interactions
ZNF263, a zinc finger protein, engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. In glioblastoma, ZNF263 binds to the SIX3 promoter, recruiting a corepressor complex that includes KAP1, HATS, and DNMTs, leading to transcriptional silencing of the SIX3 gene. It interacts with DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT1, which are crucial for de novo and maintenance methylation, respectively (Yu2020The). ZNF263 also interacts with chromatin modifiers such as HDAC2, TRIM28 (KAP1), UHRF1, PHF8, CBX3 (HP1α), CBX5 (HP1β), and MTA2, directing them to the SIX3 promoter (Yu2020The).

In colorectal cancer, ZNF263 binds directly to the STAT3 promoter, enhancing STAT3 expression and mRNA stability, which promotes cancer cell proliferation and resistance to chemoradiotherapy (Du2024Zinc). The interaction between ZNF263 and ERK2, facilitated by an ERK Docking domain, is crucial for ZNF263 stability in glioblastoma cells, as it prevents ubiquitination and degradation (Yu2020The). These interactions highlight ZNF263's role in modulating gene expression and contributing to cancer progression.
