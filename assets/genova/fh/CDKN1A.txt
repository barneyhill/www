# CDKN1A

## Overview
The CDKN1A gene encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21), a pivotal protein in the regulation of the cell cycle. As a member of the kinase inhibitor family, p21 plays a crucial role in controlling cell cycle progression by inhibiting cyclin-CDK complexes, thereby preventing the transition from the G1 to the S phase (Dutto2014Biology). This regulatory function is essential for maintaining genomic stability and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation, which is a hallmark of cancer (Kreis2019The). Beyond its role in cell cycle regulation, p21 is involved in DNA repair, transcription regulation, apoptosis, and cell motility, acting as a molecular switch that balances cellular proliferation with other critical processes (Ticli2022Revisiting). The activity of p21 is finely regulated through transcriptional control and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which influence its stability and interactions with other proteins (Dutto2014Biology). The dual role of p21 as a tumor suppressor and potential oncogene is context-dependent, influenced by its cellular localization and the specific cellular environment (Dutto2014Biology).

## Structure
The CDKN1A gene encodes the p21 protein, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor involved in various cellular processes. The primary structure of p21 consists of 164 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 18 kDa (Dutto2014Biology). The protein is characterized by its lack of a defined tertiary structure, allowing it to adopt multiple conformations depending on its interacting partners (Kreis2019The). 

The N-terminal region of p21 contains specific motifs for cyclin/CDK interactions, including the cyclin-binding motif (Cy1 site, aa. 17-24) centered on the RXL motif, and the CDK-binding motif (K site, aa. 53-58), which inhibits CDK activity by blocking its ATP-binding site (Dutto2014Biology). The C-terminal region of p21 interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) through the PCNA-interacting protein (PIP)-box, an eight-residue sequence that confers strong affinity for PCNA binding (Dutto2014Biology).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, play a crucial role in regulating p21's stability and function. Phosphorylation affects its subcellular localization and stability, while ubiquitination mediates its proteolysis (Ticli2022Revisiting; Dutto2014Biology). These structural features and modifications enable p21 to participate in DNA replication, repair, and other DNA metabolic processes (Dutto2014Biology).

## Function
The CDKN1A gene encodes the p21 protein, a crucial regulator of the cell cycle in healthy human cells. p21 functions primarily as a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, controlling cell cycle progression by inhibiting the activity of cyclin-CDK complexes, particularly those involving CDK2 and CDK4, thus preventing the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase (Wade1993The; Dutto2014Biology). This inhibition is essential for maintaining genomic stability and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Kreis2019The).

p21 is involved in DNA repair processes by interacting with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), influencing the choice of DNA polymerases during replication, and maintaining replication fork speed during the S phase (Ticli2022Revisiting; Dutto2014Biology). It also plays a role in transcription regulation, apoptosis, and cell motility, acting as a molecular switch that balances proliferation with other cellular processes (Kreis2019The).

The protein's activity is regulated at multiple levels, including transcriptional control by p53-dependent and independent pathways, and posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which affect its stability and interaction with other proteins (Dutto2014Biology). p21's dual role as a tumor suppressor and potential oncogene is context-dependent, influenced by its cellular localization and the specific cellular environment (Dutto2014Biology).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CDKN1A gene, also known as p21, have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In bladder cancer, CDKN1A mutations are identified as tumor suppressor gene alterations, with their inactivation promoting tumor growth. These mutations are often accompanied by loss of heterozygosity, suggesting a critical role in bladder-specific carcinogenesis (Cazier2014Wholegenome). In breast cancer, CDKN1A/p21 expression is generally reduced compared to normal tissues, but increased in metastatic cases. Its expression levels are notably higher in Luminal A and hormone receptor-positive subtypes, with high expression in hormone receptor-negative patients correlating with poorer prognosis and increased risk of recurrence and metastasis (Manousakis2023CDKN1Ap21).

CDKN1A/p21 also plays a role in the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation, where its overexpression can lead to cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis, while its degradation during the S phase prevents genomic instability (Manousakis2023CDKN1Ap21). Alterations in its interactions, such as with PCNA and PARP1, can impact DNA repair processes and contribute to cancer progression (Manousakis2023CDKN1Ap21). In sporadic parathyroid adenomas, rare germline mutations in CDKN1A have been identified, suggesting a role in tumor development (CostaGuda2013Germline).

## Interactions
The CDKN1A gene encodes the p21 protein, which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for DNA repair processes. p21 interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a key player in DNA replication and repair, to regulate DNA synthesis and repair pathways. This interaction is essential for p21's recruitment to DNA damage sites and is crucial for nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) (Ticli2022Revisiting; Perucca2006Spatiotemporal).

p21 also interacts with the histone acetyltransferase p300, modulating its activity. This interaction is significant in the context of NER, where p21 regulates the histone acetyltransferase activity of p300 by disrupting its interaction with PCNA, thereby influencing chromatin remodeling and DNA repair processes (Cazzalini2008Interaction).

In addition to PCNA and p300, p21 interacts with other DNA repair proteins such as DNA polymerase δ, XPG, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). These interactions suggest that p21 plays a role in coordinating the activity of various repair factors, ensuring efficient DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability (Ticli2022Revisiting; Perucca2006Spatiotemporal).
