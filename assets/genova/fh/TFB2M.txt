# TFB2M

## Overview
The TFB2M gene encodes the mitochondrial transcription factor B2, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the transcription of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). As a transcription factor, TFB2M is integral to the initiation of mitochondrial transcription, working in concert with mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) and transcription factor A (TFAM) to facilitate promoter recognition and DNA unwinding. Structurally, TFB2M is homologous to rRNA adenine methyltransferases but has evolved to function primarily as a transcription initiation factor, with distinct structural features that include a positively charged cleft for nucleic acid binding and a C-terminal tail that regulates DNA interaction (Moustafa2015Structural; Hillen2018Structural). The protein's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which influences its binding to mtDNA and its role in transcription initiation (Bostwick2020Phosphorylation). TFB2M is essential for mitochondrial biogenesis and function, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its significance in cellular metabolism and disease pathogenesis (Gleyzer2005Control; Geng2020Over‐expression; Park2018Identification).

## Structure
The human mitochondrial transcription factor B2 (TFB2M) is a protein involved in mitochondrial transcription initiation. Structurally, TFB2M is homologous to rRNA adenine methyltransferases but has evolved distinct functions, primarily as a transcription initiation factor (Hillen2018Structural). The protein's N-terminal region resembles rRNA methyltransferases, while the C-terminal part forms a helical domain with an extended flexible tail (Hillen2018Structural). The C-terminal tail plays an autoinhibitory role in DNA binding, existing in two conformations: an autoinhibited state and a free state, which regulates its interaction with DNA (Basu2020Autoinhibitory).

TFB2M's structure includes a positively charged cleft between the N- and C-terminal domains, which may serve as a nucleic acid binding site (Moustafa2015Structural). The protein's electrostatic surface analysis reveals variations in charge distribution, particularly at the N-terminus, influencing interactions with partner proteins like POLRMT (Moustafa2015Structural). Phosphorylation at specific sites, such as T184 and T313, affects TFB2M's ability to bind mitochondrial DNA and form transcription initiation complexes (Bostwick2020Phosphorylation). These structural features and modifications are crucial for TFB2M's role in mitochondrial gene expression.

## Function
TFB2M (transcription factor B2, mitochondrial) is a crucial component of the mitochondrial transcription machinery in healthy human cells. It functions as a transcription factor that facilitates the transcription of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by interacting with mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT). TFB2M is essential for the initiation of transcription, as it helps in promoter recognition and the recruitment of POLRMT to mitochondrial promoters, allowing the transcription process to begin effectively (AsinCayuela2007Mitochondrial; Mulder2017Transcribing).

TFB2M is significantly more active than its paralogue, TFB1M, in supporting basal transcription, indicating its specialized role in higher eukaryotes (AsinCayuela2007Mitochondrial). It is involved in melting mtDNA at the promoter, which allows POLRMT to access the DNA template and initiate transcription (Bostwick2020Phosphorylation). TFB2M's activity is regulated by nuclear respiratory factors (NRF-1 and NRF-2) and PGC-1 family coactivators, which are key players in mitochondrial biogenesis (Gleyzer2005Control).

In addition to its role in transcription, TFB2M is implicated in maintaining mitochondrial function and biogenesis, which are essential for cellular energy production and overall cellular metabolism (Gleyzer2005Control). Its function is conserved across species, highlighting its fundamental role in mitochondrial biology (AsinCayuela2007Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TFB2M gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TFB2M is overexpressed, which is associated with poor survival outcomes. This overexpression promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis. The oncogenic effects of TFB2M in HCC are mediated through the activation of the ROS-Akt-NF-κB signaling pathway, suggesting that targeting TFB2M could be a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC (Geng2020Over‐expression).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), TFB2M is also upregulated and associated with poor clinical outcomes. High expression levels of TFB2M correlate with specific clinical features such as a high white blood cell count and a higher percentage of peripheral blood blasts, indicating its potential role in disease progression (Wu2019The).

A rare homozygous variation in TFB2M has been identified in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), suggesting a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and ASD. This variation leads to increased mitochondrial gene transcription and function, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of ASD (Park2018Identification).

## Interactions
TFB2M is a mitochondrial transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the transcription initiation process by interacting with other proteins and nucleic acids. It forms part of the mitochondrial transcription initiation complex along with mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) and transcription factor A (TFAM). TFB2M is essential for promoter melting, a necessary step for transcription initiation, as it facilitates the unwinding of DNA at the transcription start site (Posse2017Human). 

TFB2M interacts with POLRMT, functioning as a transient component of the catalytic site during transcription initiation. It is recruited to the promoter only when both TFAM and POLRMT are present, highlighting its role in the sequential model of transcription initiation in human mitochondria (Posse2017Human). Structural studies suggest that TFB2M has specific interactions with DNA and POLRMT, with its N-terminal region playing a role in stabilizing the open-promoter complex (Moustafa2015Structural).

Phosphorylation of TFB2M at specific sites can modulate its interaction with mtDNA, affecting its binding capabilities and transcription initiation activity. Phosphomimetic variants of TFB2M show reduced binding to mtDNA, indicating that phosphorylation may regulate its function (Bostwick2020Phosphorylation).
