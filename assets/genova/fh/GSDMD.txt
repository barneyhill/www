# GSDMD

## Overview
Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a gene that encodes the protein gasdermin D, which is a critical component in the process of pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death associated with inflammation. The protein belongs to the gasdermin family and is characterized by its ability to form membrane pores, a function primarily executed by its N-terminal domain following proteolytic cleavage by inflammatory caspases. This pore-forming activity facilitates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, playing a vital role in immune responses and host defense mechanisms (Balasubramanian2024The; Devant2023Molecular). Gasdermin D is also involved in various cellular processes beyond cell death, such as cytokine release in a state of hyperactivation, and is implicated in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (Sollberger2018Gasdermin). The gene's expression and regulation are significant in the context of several diseases, including cancers and inflammatory conditions, highlighting its clinical importance (Wan2023Gasdermin).

## Structure
Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a protein involved in pyroptosis, characterized by its N-terminal (GSDMD-N) and C-terminal (GSDMD-C) domains. The N-terminal domain is responsible for forming membrane pores, while the C-terminal domain inhibits this activity through intramolecular interactions (Liu2019Crystal). The GSDMD-C domain has a compact globular fold consisting of nine helices capped by an antiparallel beta-sheet, which plays a role in autoinhibition by engaging the b1-b2 loop of the N-terminal domain (Liu2019Crystal; Liu2018Structures).

Upon cleavage by inflammatory caspases, the N-terminal domain oligomerizes to form pores in cell membranes, a process facilitated by the exposure of a positively charged surface that enhances lipid binding (Liu2019Crystal; Kuang2017Structure). The N-terminal domain contains three alpha helices and ten beta strands, with specific regions such as the a1 helix and b1-b2 loop being crucial for lipid binding and pore formation (Liu2019Crystal).

Post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation at Cys192, are essential for the membrane translocation and activation of the N-terminal domain, influencing its oligomerization and function in pyroptosis (Balasubramanian2024The). The structural integrity and function of GSDMD are critical for its role in cell death and inflammation.

## Function
Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a protein that plays a pivotal role in the process of pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death associated with inflammation. In healthy human cells, GSDMD is initially inactive and is activated through proteolytic cleavage by inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1, caspase-4, and caspase-5. This cleavage releases the N-terminal domain of GSDMD, which translocates to the plasma membrane to form pores (Balasubramanian2024The; Devant2023Molecular). These pores facilitate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18, which are crucial for immune responses (Balasubramanian2024The; He2015Gasdermin).

GSDMD pore formation is not solely linked to cell death; it can also occur independently, allowing cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages to release cytokines while remaining viable, a state referred to as 'hyperactivation' (Devant2023Molecular). This activity is essential for robust immune responses. GSDMD is also involved in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are structures that trap and kill pathogens, highlighting its role in host defense mechanisms (Sollberger2018Gasdermin).

## Clinical Significance
Gasdermin D (GSDMD) plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death associated with inflammation. Alterations in GSDMD expression have been linked to several cancers. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, high GSDMD expression is associated with poor outcomes, while in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), downregulation of GSDMD inhibits tumor proliferation by activating caspase-3-mediated apoptosis and inhibiting the EGFR/AKT signaling pathway (Wan2023Gasdermin; Gao2018Downregulation). Conversely, in gastric cancer, downregulation of GSDMD promotes tumor proliferation (Wan2023Gasdermin).

GSDMD is also implicated in inflammatory and infectious diseases. Its expression is upregulated in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and COVID-19, contributing to disease severity through inflammatory responses (Wan2023Gasdermin). In systemic infectious diseases, GSDMD is involved in pyroptosis, which can lead to cytokine storms and organ damage, as seen in sepsis and SARS-CoV-2 infections (Wan2023Gasdermin).

The gene's expression and activity are regulated by factors such as NF-κB, Nrf2, and IRF, which can influence its transcription and impact disease progression (Wan2023Gasdermin).

## Interactions
Gasdermin D (GSDMD) interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in the process of pyroptosis. GSDMD contains a BH3-like domain in its N-terminal portion, which allows it to interact with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. This interaction is constitutive under basal conditions and increases upon activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The BH3-like domain is critical for this interaction, as mutations in this domain disrupt binding to Bcl-2. Bcl-2 inhibits the cleavage of GSDMD by caspases 1, 4, and 5, a key step in pyroptosis, and this inhibition is dependent on the BH3-like domain of GSDMD (Shi2019Bcl2).

GSDMD is also a substrate for inflammatory caspases, including caspase-1, caspase-4, and caspase-11. These caspases cleave GSDMD to release its N-terminal domain, which forms pores in the cell membrane, leading to cell lysis. The interaction between GSDMD and caspases involves a hydrophobic interface, crucial for the recognition and cleavage of GSDMD (Wang2020Structural). GSDMD can also be cleaved by other proteases such as cathepsin G and elastase, and its interaction with caspase-8 is context-dependent, particularly in macrophages infected with Yersinia (Devant2023Molecular).
