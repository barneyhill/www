# PPT1

## Overview
The PPT1 gene encodes the enzyme palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1, which is a lysosomal hydrolase involved in the depalmitoylation of S-acylated proteins. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the degradation and recycling of lipid-modified proteins, particularly within the lysosomal compartment, and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein turnover (Koster2019Depalmitoylation). The protein is characterized by an α/β-hydrolase fold and a catalytic triad, which are vital for its enzymatic activity (Bellizzi2000The). PPT1 is particularly significant in neuronal cells, where it is implicated in synaptic vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter release, processes critical for effective synaptic transmission (Kim2008Palmitoyl). Mutations in the PPT1 gene are linked to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, a group of neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its clinical importance (Gupta2001Disruption). Additionally, alterations in PPT1 expression have been associated with cancer, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Rebecca2019PPT1).

## Structure
Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) is a lysosomal enzyme with a primary structure consisting of 306 amino acids, including a signal sequence of 26 amino acids (Lyly2007Glycosylation). The secondary structure of PPT1 features an α/β-hydrolase fold, characterized by a central six-stranded parallel β-sheet, similar to the haloperoxidase and dienlactone hydrolase subfamilies (Bellizzi2000The). The enzyme's tertiary structure includes a catalytic triad composed of Ser115, His289, and Asp233, with Ser115 acting as the nucleophile (Bellizzi2000The). A hydrophobic groove accommodates the fatty acid chain, crucial for its enzymatic function (Bellizzi2000The).

PPT1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation at three sites: Asn197, Asn212, and Asn232. Glycosylation at Asn197 and Asn232 is essential for its activity and intracellular transport (Lyly2007Glycosylation). The enzyme can exist in both monomeric and complex forms, with evidence suggesting self-oligomerization (Lyly2007Glycosylation). These structural features and modifications are critical for PPT1's function in the degradation of lipid-modified proteins and its role in neurodegenerative disorders.

## Function
Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the depalmitoylation of S-acylated proteins, a process essential for protein recycling and degradation in healthy human cells. PPT1 is primarily active in the lysosome, where it depalmitoylates proteins before their degradation, contributing to protein turnover and cellular homeostasis (Koster2019Depalmitoylation). This enzyme is involved in the dynamic regulation of protein palmitoylation, which is crucial for various biological functions such as membrane anchorage, vesicular transport, and signal transduction (Kim2008Palmitoyl).

In neurons, PPT1 is hypothesized to be present in the presynaptic compartment, where it facilitates the depalmitoylation of synaptic vesicle proteins, including VAMP2 and SNAP25, which are involved in neurotransmitter release and synaptic vesicle recycling (Kim2008Palmitoyl). The proper functioning of PPT1 ensures the normal recycling and regeneration of synaptic vesicles, maintaining synaptic strength and effective neurotransmission (Kim2008Palmitoyl). PPT1 also interacts with proteins involved in endocytosis, exocytosis, and endo-lysosomal trafficking, highlighting its role in regulating signaling proteins and transmembrane receptors (Koster2019Depalmitoylation). Deficiency in PPT1 leads to impaired synaptic vesicle recycling, contributing to neuropathological conditions such as infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Kim2008Palmitoyl).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPT1 gene are primarily associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), a group of neurodegenerative disorders. The most severe form, Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (INCL), is caused by loss-of-function mutations in PPT1, leading to the accumulation of fatty acid esters of cysteine and resulting in symptoms such as psychomotor retardation, seizures, and vision loss, with death typically occurring by age 10 (Jalanko2005Mice; Gupta2001Disruption). The disease is characterized by the dramatic death of cortical neurons and the accumulation of granular osmiophilic deposits in neurons (Jalanko2005Mice).

PPT1 mutations also contribute to other forms of NCL, including Late Infantile and Juvenile forms, with varying onset and severity (Kousi2011Update). The p.Arg122Trp mutation is notably common in Finnish patients, while the p.Arg151X mutation is prevalent worldwide (Kousi2011Update).

Alterations in PPT1 expression have been linked to cancer, where its elevated expression is associated with tumor growth and poorer patient survival. PPT1 is targeted by chloroquine derivatives, which inhibit its activity, affecting lysosomal function and mTOR signaling pathways (Rebecca2019PPT1). This suggests potential therapeutic applications in targeting PPT1 for cancer treatment.

## Interactions
Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) is known to interact with a variety of proteins, many of which are involved in neuronal morphology and function. The interactome of PPT1 includes 64 proteins, with a significant portion being palmitoylated, suggesting these proteins may serve as substrates for PPT1. Notable interacting partners include SPTAN1, ATP6V0D1, and BASP1, which were identified through affinity purification and mass spectrometry analyses (Sapir2019The). 

PPT1 is also involved in the regulation of synaptic function and plasticity. It interacts with proteins related to cytoskeletal regulation and synaptic compartments, influencing dendritic tree complexity and spine density in neurons (Sapir2019The). The absence of PPT1 leads to structural deficits in hippocampal neurons, affecting synaptic activity and plasticity (Sapir2019The).

In addition, PPT1 has been shown to interact with proteins involved in mitochondrial ATP synthesis, protein transport, and thioester biosynthesis, indicating its role in broader cellular processes (Scifo2015Quantitative). These interactions highlight the critical role of PPT1 in maintaining neuronal structure and function, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases.
