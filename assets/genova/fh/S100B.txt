# S100B

## Overview
S100B is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein B, a member of the S100 protein family characterized by its EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. This protein is predominantly expressed in astrocytes and Schwann cells and plays a crucial role in regulating calcium homeostasis, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. S100B functions both intracellularly and extracellularly, interacting with various proteins and receptors, such as p53 and the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), to influence cellular processes and signaling pathways. The protein's interactions are often modulated by calcium, which enhances its binding affinity and functional versatility. Clinically, alterations in S100B expression are associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, as well as certain cancers like melanoma and ovarian cancer, where it serves as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target (Donato2012Functions; Michetti2023The; Donato2003Intracellular).

## Structure
The S100B protein is a member of the S100 protein family, characterized by its EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. Each S100B monomer contains two EF-hand domains: the N-terminal pseudo EF-hand and the C-terminal canonical EF-hand. The pseudo EF-hand consists of helices I and II with a 14-residue calcium-binding loop, while the canonical EF-hand includes helices III and IV with a 12-residue loop (Malik2008Analysis; Baudier2020The). 

The primary structure of S100B includes specific calcium-binding residues such as Ser18, Glu21, Asp23, Lys26, Asp61, Asp63, Asp65, Glu67, and Glu72 (Baudier2020The). The secondary structure is composed of alpha helices that form a dimer through an antiparallel alignment of helices I-I' and IV-IV', creating an X-type bundle (Malik2008Analysis). 

In its quaternary structure, S100B forms a symmetric homodimer, with the dimerization occurring mainly via the terminal helices (Thulin2011Molecular). The protein can also oligomerize into tetramers, hexamers, and higher-order structures under specific conditions (Thulin2011Molecular). S100B is known to undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions.

## Function
S100B is a calcium-binding protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in astrocytes and Schwann cells, where it is involved in both intracellular and extracellular regulatory activities. Intracellularly, S100B regulates calcium homeostasis, which is crucial for maintaining cellular functions and signaling pathways (Donato2003Intracellular). It interacts with several target proteins, including p53, tubulin, and caldesmon, influencing activities such as cell shape maintenance, transcription, and protein degradation (Donato2012Functions).

S100B is also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It acts as a stimulator of cell proliferation and migration while inhibiting apoptosis and differentiation, contributing to brain, cartilage, and skeletal muscle development and regeneration (Donato2012Functions). In the nervous system, S100B promotes neuronal survival and stimulates neurite outgrowth at nanomolar concentrations, while higher concentrations can lead to apoptosis (Donato2003Intracellular).

Extracellularly, S100B interacts with the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), modulating immune responses and cell signaling pathways. This interaction is implicated in both neurotrophic and neurotoxic effects, depending on the concentration of S100B (Donato2012Functions). Overall, S100B plays a crucial role in cellular growth, differentiation, and repair processes, particularly in the nervous system.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the S100B gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In schizophrenia, increased serum levels of S100B have been observed in patients, correlating with negative symptoms. A specific haplotype, V3–V4 (G–C), in the S100B gene is associated with schizophrenia, suggesting that increased S100B expression may contribute to the disorder's susceptibility (Liu2005SNPs). 

In Alzheimer's disease, S100B is upregulated and linked to increased amyloid β deposits and inflammation. Overexpression of S100B exacerbates symptoms, while its inhibition can ameliorate conditions in experimental models, indicating its role in disease progression (Michetti2023The).

S100B is also involved in cancer, particularly melanoma and ovarian cancer. High levels of S100B are associated with worse overall survival in ovarian cancer and are linked to drug resistance by inhibiting p53 activity. In melanoma, S100B acts as a prognostic marker for advanced stages, inhibiting p53-dependent apoptosis and promoting tumor survival (Allgöwer2020Friend).

In Parkinson's disease, S100B overexpression correlates with disease severity, and its inhibition has shown protective effects in experimental models (Michetti2023The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of S100B in various diseases.

## Interactions
S100B is a calcium-binding protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing numerous cellular processes. One of its key interactions is with the tumor suppressor protein p53. S100B binds to the C-terminal domain of p53, inhibiting its phosphorylation and transcriptional activity, which can lead to increased tumor activity (Zimmer2003Molecular; Wu2020Interfering). This interaction is calcium-dependent, with S100B undergoing conformational changes upon calcium binding that expose hydrophobic residues crucial for binding (Zimmer2010The; Zimmer2003Molecular).

S100B also interacts with the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), playing a role in paracrine signaling and affecting inflammation and neurodegeneration (Donato2012Functions). Additionally, S100B can bind to nucleic acids, impacting transcriptional regulation (Donato2012Functions).

The protein's interactions are not limited to stable complexes; they include more transient interactions that can activate or inhibit target proteins. These interactions are often modulated by calcium, which enhances S100B's binding affinity for its targets, a feature that is significant for its role in cellular signaling pathways (Zimmer2010The; Liriano2012Target).
