# B3GNT6

## Overview
B3GNT6 is a human gene that encodes the enzyme UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 6, commonly referred to as core 3 synthase. This enzyme is a member of the beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase family and plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of O-glycans, specifically the core 3 structure, which is essential for the formation of mucin-type glycoproteins. These glycoproteins are vital for various cellular functions, including cell signaling and adhesion, and are predominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it ensures proper glycosylation of proteins, contributing to their stability and function. Dysregulation of B3GNT6 expression has been linked to several diseases, including cancers and selective IgA deficiency, highlighting its potential role in tumor suppression and mucosal immunity (Lim2021STXBP6; Yang2020Downregulation; Xiao2022Downregulation).

## Function
The B3GNT6 gene encodes an enzyme known as core 3 synthase, which is a member of the beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase family. This enzyme is crucial for the biosynthesis of O-glycans, specifically the core 3 structure, by adding an N-acetylglucosamine to N-acetylgalactosamine-modified serine or threonine residues. This process is essential for the formation of mucin-type glycoproteins, which play significant roles in various cellular functions, including cell signaling and adhesion (Yang2020Downregulation; Xiao2022Downregulation).

In healthy human cells, B3GNT6 is predominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and is involved in maintaining the normal structure and function of glycoproteins. These glycoproteins are integral to the normal biological activities of cells, influencing processes such as cell-cell interactions and signaling pathways (Yang2020Downregulation; Xiao2022Downregulation). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the proper glycosylation of proteins, ensuring their stability and function (Xiao2022Downregulation).

The proper function of B3GNT6 is essential for maintaining normal glycan structures, which are often dysregulated in cancerous cells, indicating its potential role in tumor suppression (Yang2020Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the B3GNT6 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers. In colorectal cancer, B3GNT6 expression is significantly downregulated at both mRNA and protein levels. This downregulation is associated with poor overall survival and correlates with chromosome instability (CIN) and KRAS mutations. The reduced expression of B3GNT6 is linked to increased proteasome activity, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic biomarker for poor outcomes in colorectal cancer patients (Xiao2022Downregulation).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), B3GNT6 expression is observed in about 20% of cases and is associated with more differentiated adenocarcinoma and longer disease-free survival. This suggests that B3GNT6 expression may serve as a favorable prognostic factor in PDAC, potentially reducing malignant characteristics through its role in glycosylation patterns (Doi2020Clinicopathological).

B3GNT6 has also been associated with selective IgA deficiency (IgAD), a condition characterized by a lack of immunoglobulin A. Variants in B3GNT6 may contribute to IgAD, particularly in patients without major HLA susceptibility haplotypes, indicating a potential role in mucosal immunity (Lim2021STXBP6).
