# SINHCAF

## Overview
SINHCAF, also known as FAM60A, is a gene that encodes the SIN3-HDAC complex associated factor, a protein integral to the SIN3A-HDAC transcriptional corepressor complex. This protein is primarily involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, functioning as a transcriptional regulator by modulating histone acetylation states. The SIN3-HDAC complex, with SINHCAF as a component, plays a crucial role in repressing gene expression, particularly under hypoxic conditions by targeting the HIF 2α (EPAS1) promoter. This repression is achieved through the recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), leading to histone deacetylation and subsequent transcriptional silencing. Beyond its role in hypoxia response, SINHCAF is implicated in the regulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway and Cyclin D1 transcription, indicating its involvement in broader cellular processes such as angiogenesis and proliferation (Biddlestone2017SINHCAFFAM60A).

## Function
SINHCAF, also known as FAM60A, is a component of the SIN3A-HDAC complex, a master transcriptional repressor involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, SINHCAF is primarily involved in the regulation of the hypoxia response by repressing the expression of HIF 2α (EPAS1), a gene crucial for cellular adaptation to low oxygen conditions. This repression occurs at both the mRNA and protein levels, highlighting SINHCAF's role in transcriptional regulation (Biddlestone2017SINHCAFFAM60A).

SINHCAF functions as a transcriptional regulator by being part of a repressor complex with SIN3A and HDAC1, which targets the HIF 2α promoter. This complex leads to histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression, thereby modulating the hypoxia response. SINHCAF is crucial for the recruitment of HDAC1 to the HIF 2α promoter, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis under varying oxygen levels (Biddlestone2017SINHCAFFAM60A).

Additionally, SINHCAF is involved in the regulation of genes within the TGF-β signaling pathway and contributes to the transcriptional control of Cyclin D1, indicating its broader role in cellular regulation and its involvement in processes such as angiogenesis and proliferation (Biddlestone2017SINHCAFFAM60A).

## Clinical Significance
The SINHCAF gene, also known as FAM60A, plays a significant role in cancer progression and patient prognosis. Alterations in SINHCAF expression levels are linked to various cancers, including colorectal and lung cancer. Elevated SINHCAF mRNA levels are associated with poor patient survival, while high levels of HIF 2α, which SINHCAF represses, correlate with better survival outcomes. This inverse relationship suggests that SINHCAF could serve as a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis (Biddlestone2017SINHCAFFAM60A).

SINHCAF's role in cancer is primarily through its interaction with the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) system. It epigenetically silences HIF 2α expression, impacting angiogenesis and proliferation in cancer cells. This regulation is crucial for tumor progression, making SINHCAF a potential therapeutic target. The gene's overexpression is observed in a significant percentage of colorectal cancer cases, highlighting its predictive value for patient survival (Biddlestone2017SINHCAFFAM60A).

In addition to cancer, SINHCAF has been associated with other conditions such as Type II diabetes and esophageal cancer through genetic studies, indicating its broader clinical significance (Biddlestone2017SINHCAFFAM60A).

## Interactions
SINHCAF, also known as FAM60A, is a component of the SIN3A-HDAC transcriptional corepressor complex, which plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. SINHCAF interacts with the SIN3A/HDAC complex, which is crucial for histone deacetylation and gene silencing. This interaction is essential for the repression of specific target genes, such as HIF 2α (EPAS1), where SINHCAF acts as a repressor by recruiting HDAC1 to the HIF 2α promoter, leading to decreased histone acetylation and reduced gene expression (Biddlestone2017SINHCAFFAM60A).

SINHCAF is also involved in the regulation of DNA methylation patterns during embryogenesis. It interacts with the Sin3a-Hdac complex, which includes proteins like MeCP2, Dnmt1, and Tet1, suggesting a role in DNA methylation and demethylation processes (Nabeshima2018Loss). In embryonic stem cells, SINHCAF is part of a variant Sin3a complex that includes Tet1 and Ogt, indicating its involvement in both transcriptional repression and activation depending on the cellular context (Nabeshima2018Loss).

These interactions highlight SINHCAF's role in modulating chromatin structure and gene expression, linking it to critical cellular processes such as hypoxia response and cancer progression (Biddlestone2017SINHCAFFAM60A).
