# LANCL1

## Overview
LANCL1 is a gene that encodes the protein LanC like glutathione S-transferase 1, a peripheral membrane protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in redox regulation and oxidative stress response. The protein is characterized by a double seven-helix barrel fold, which is essential for its function as a glutathione-binding Zn2+ metalloprotein (Zhang2009Structure). LANCL1 is highly expressed in the brain, where it plays a neuroprotective role by regulating protein glutathionylation and interacting with deubiquitinating enzymes to maintain cellular redox balance (Downey2020Stable). Additionally, LANCL1 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, autism, and cancer, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Tan2019LanCL1; Downey2020Stable).

## Structure
The LANCL1 protein, encoded by the human LANCL1 gene, exhibits a complex molecular structure characterized by a double seven-helix barrel fold. Each barrel consists of seven helices, with the outer barrel formed by odd-numbered helices and the inner barrel by even-numbered helices, both exhibiting a left-handed twist (Zhang2009Structure). This structural motif is similar to that found in farnesyl transferases and is crucial for its function as a glutathione (GSH)-binding Zn2+ metalloprotein (Downey2020Stable).

LANCL1 contains conserved GxxG motifs essential for Zn2+-dependent GSH binding, with the zinc ion coordinated in a tetrahedral arrangement involving specific cysteine and histidine residues (Zhang2009Structure). The protein's interaction with the SH3 domain of Eps8, a signaling protein, is significant for nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth, highlighting its role in cellular signaling (Zhang2009Structure).

The protein is a peripheral membrane protein, not an integral one, and is associated with the red cell membrane under certain conditions (Blisnick2005LANCL1). LANCL1 is also involved in redox regulation, potentially through the modulation of deubiquitinating enzymes (Downey2020Stable).

## Function
LANCL1 (LanC like glutathione S-transferase 1) is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily related to redox regulation and oxidative stress response. It is a glutathione-binding Zn2+ metalloprotein that plays a significant role in maintaining cellular redox balance by facilitating the conjugation of glutathione to various substrates, aiding in detoxification and excretion processes (Downey2020Stable; Zhong2012Lanthionine). 

In healthy human cells, LANCL1 is highly expressed in the brain and is involved in neuroprotection. It regulates protein glutathionylation and has been implicated in the redox regulation of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which are crucial for protein degradation and cellular stress responses (Downey2020Stable). LANCL1 supports the recovery of cysteinyl DUBs from oxidative inactivation, potentially enhancing cell resistance to oxidative stress (Downey2020Stable).

LANCL1 also interacts with cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), acting as a negative regulator, which is important for the synthesis of reduced glutathione, a key antioxidant in the brain (Zhong2012Lanthionine). This interaction highlights its role in the GSH-dependent antioxidant system, contributing to neuronal redox homeostasis and protection against oxidative damage.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LANCL1 gene have been implicated in several neurological and systemic conditions. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, LANCL1 is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Overexpression of LANCL1 in ALS mouse models has been shown to delay disease onset, extend lifespan, and improve motor function, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tan2019LanCL1). Conversely, deletion of LANCL1 leads to neurodegenerative phenotypes, including motor neuron loss and oxidative damage (Tan2019LanCL1).

LANCL1 is also linked to autism and Rett syndrome-like features in humans, where deletions of the gene are observed (Downey2020Stable). In prostate cancer, LANCL1 overexpression correlates with resistance to oxidative stress and is associated with poor prognosis, indicating its role in tumor progression and potential drug resistance (p&gt; Downey2020Stable; Tang2020&lt; Identification).

In the context of obesity, LANCL1 expression in the hypothalamus is altered during high-fat-diet-induced obesity, affecting antioxidant defense and redox balance, which may contribute to obesity progression (Shi2024PGC1αCoordinated). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LANCL1 in various diseases, emphasizing its role in oxidative stress regulation and cellular protection.

## Interactions
LANCL1 interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In HeLa cells, LANCL1 is involved in the redox regulation of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). It interacts with glutathione (GSH) to support the recovery of DUB activity from oxidative inactivation, suggesting a protective role against oxidative stress (Downey2020Stable). LANCL1 also influences the stability and activity of specific DUBs, such as ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH), USP9X, and USP10, by potentially preventing their oxidative inactivation and degradation (Downey2020Stable).

In the context of Plasmodium falciparum infection, LANCL1 interacts with the trans-membrane protein PfSBP1, which is associated with Maurer's clefts in infected erythrocytes. This interaction is crucial during the late stages of parasite development, potentially contributing to the stability of Maurer's clefts and the altered mechanical properties of parasitized erythrocytes (Blisnick2005LANCL1). LANCL1 binds specifically to phosphorylated forms of PfSBP1, indicating a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria (Blisnick2005LANCL1). These interactions highlight LANCL1's involvement in both cellular stress responses and parasitic infection processes.
