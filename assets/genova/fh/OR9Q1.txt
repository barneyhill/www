# OR9Q1

## Overview
The OR9Q1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 9 subfamily Q member 1, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules. The olfactory receptors, including the protein encoded by OR9Q1, play a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a common feature among many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors (Qiu2020aarFDC).
