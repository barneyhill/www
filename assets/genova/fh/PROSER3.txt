# PROSER3

## Overview
Proline and serine rich 3 (PROSER3) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, characterized by its abundance of proline and serine residues. The PROSER3 protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. It is not currently categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but its role in cellular pathways suggests it may have regulatory functions. Research into the PROSER3 gene and its encoded protein is ongoing, with studies exploring its potential involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which may have implications for understanding certain cellular behaviors and disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
