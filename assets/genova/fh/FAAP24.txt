# FAAP24

## Overview
FAAP24 is a gene that encodes the FA core complex associated protein 24, a crucial component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway. This protein is integral to maintaining genomic stability by participating in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and responding to DNA damage. FAAP24 forms a heterodimeric complex with FANCM, which is essential for the remodeling of stalled replication forks and the activation of ATR-mediated checkpoint signaling during replication stress (Hořejší2009FANCMFAAP24; Collis2008FANCM). Structurally, FAAP24 is characterized by an N-terminal ERCC4-like nuclease domain and a C-terminal (HhH)2 domain, which facilitates its DNA-binding activity, particularly to single-stranded DNA (Wienk2013The; Wang2013Structure). Clinically, alterations in the FAAP24 gene have been linked to hematological malignancies and immune disorders, highlighting its significance in both genomic maintenance and disease pathology (Bao2023High; Daschkey2016Fatal).

## Structure
The FAAP24 protein is a component of the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway and is characterized by distinct structural domains that facilitate its function. The protein comprises an N-terminal ERCC4-like nuclease domain and a C-terminal (HhH)2 domain. The ERCC4-like domain, spanning residues 1-139, features a central six-stranded β-sheet flanked by five α-helices. This domain shares structural similarities with other ERCC4 domains but lacks nucleolytic activity due to substitutions in the catalytic motif (Wang2013Structure; Yang2013Structural).

The C-terminal (HhH)2 domain, consisting of residues 155-215, includes two helix-hairpin-helix motifs connected by a helix, forming a five-helical structure with pseudo-two-fold symmetry. This domain is crucial for DNA binding and interaction with FANCM, with specific residues like G168, V169, and G170 playing key roles in DNA interaction (Wienk2013The; Wang2013Structure).

FAAP24's structure also includes a flexible 22-residue linker between the two domains, and the N-terminal tail is unstructured in solution. The protein can bind both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, with a preference for single-stranded DNA, facilitated by its (HhH)2 domain (Wienk2013The; Wang2013Structure).

## Function
FAAP24 (FA core complex associated protein 24) is a crucial component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, playing a significant role in maintaining genomic stability. It is involved in the DNA damage response, particularly in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). FAAP24 functions by forming a heterodimeric complex with FANCM, which is essential for the remodeling of stalled replication forks and the activation of ATR-mediated checkpoint signaling in response to replication stress (Hořejší2009FANCMFAAP24; Collis2008FANCM).

FAAP24 exhibits DNA-binding activity, preferring single-stranded DNA, and is necessary for the recruitment of replication protein A (RPA) to ICL-stalled replication forks. This recruitment is critical for efficient ATR-mediated checkpoint activation (Huang2010The). FAAP24 also plays a role in promoting ATR-mediated checkpoint activation independently of FANCM, as evidenced by its ability to mediate checkpoint signal activation without forming a complex with FANCM (Wang2013FANCM).

In healthy human cells, FAAP24 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the suppression of sister chromatid exchanges and supports the activation of the FA pathway, facilitating the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI, which are essential for DNA damage response (Wang2013FANCM).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FAAP24 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of hematological malignancies and immune disorders. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high expression of FAAP24 is associated with poor prognosis and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This overexpression correlates with inferior overall survival and is linked to increased recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, which may promote leukemia progression (Bao2023High). FAAP24 expression is also associated with resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as chelerythrine, highlighting its potential role in drug resistance (Bao2023High).

In a separate study, a homozygous missense mutation in FAAP24 (cC635T, pT212M) was identified in two siblings with a fatal lymphoproliferative disease associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. This mutation impaired the DNA damage response, particularly affecting FANCD2 monoubiquitination and checkpoint kinase activation, leading to severe immunological dysfunctions and increased susceptibility to EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (Daschkey2016Fatal). These findings underscore the critical role of FAAP24 in maintaining genomic stability and its potential involvement in various diseases when its function is compromised.

## Interactions
FAAP24 is a protein that plays a significant role in the DNA damage response, particularly through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a heterodimer with FANCM, which is crucial for the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. This complex is essential for protecting cells from complex DNA lesions such as interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and is involved in the recruitment of the FA core complex to sites of DNA damage (Wienk2013The; Wang2013Structure).

FAAP24 has a high affinity for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and does not bind to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Its DNA-binding activity is mediated by the (HhH)2 domain, which is crucial for its association with FANCM and its ability to bind DNA. Specific residues, such as those in the GVGKVK motif, are important for this activity (Wang2013Structure).

FAAP24 also interacts with the checkpoint protein HCLK2, which is important for ATR-mediated checkpoint signaling. This interaction is independent of the FA core complex and is crucial for the replication stress checkpoint and activation of the FA network (Collis2008FANCM). The FANCM/FAAP24 complex is involved in recruiting replication protein A (RPA) to ICL-stalled replication forks, facilitating further recruitment of ATR and ATRIP, which are involved in the checkpoint response (Huang2010The).
