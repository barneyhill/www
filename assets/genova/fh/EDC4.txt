# EDC4

## Overview
EDC4, or enhancer of mRNA decapping 4, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes, including mRNA decay and DNA repair. The EDC4 protein is a key component of the mRNA decapping complex, which is essential for the regulation of mRNA turnover and stability. It facilitates the removal of the 5' cap from mRNA, a crucial step in mRNA degradation, and is localized to cytoplasmic structures known as processing bodies (P-bodies) (Brothers2022Pbodies; Bloch2023Assembly). Additionally, EDC4 plays a significant role in the homologous recombination pathway of DNA repair, contributing to genome stability by participating in the BRCA1-BRIP1-TOPBP1 complex (Hernández2018Decapping). The protein's structure includes a WD40 domain, which is vital for protein-protein interactions, and it is subject to regulation through phosphorylation (Rahman2014Crosstalk; Bloch2023Assembly). EDC4's involvement in both mRNA processing and DNA repair highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic integrity.

## Structure
The EDC4 protein has a complex structure characterized by distinct domains and features. The N-terminus of EDC4 contains a WD40 motif, spanning amino acids 131-538, which is predicted to form a seven-blade 'propeller' structure. This motif is crucial for protein-protein interactions and serves as a scaffold for building protein complexes (Rahman2014Crosstalk; Bloch2023Assembly). The N-terminal region also includes a serine-rich area, which may act as a 'flexible hinge' between the N and C terminal portions of the protein (Bloch2023Assembly).

The central portion of EDC4 includes a bipartite nuclear localization sequence, suggesting that a fraction of EDC4 may localize to the nucleus (Bloch2023Assembly). The C-terminus is rich in alpha helices and mediates interactions with DCP2 and EDC4 itself, playing a role in mRNA decapping and localization to P-bodies (Davey2024A; Bloch2023Assembly).

EDC4 is a phospho-protein with numerous predicted phosphorylation sites, including serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, which may influence its function and interactions (Rahman2014Crosstalk). There are two splice variants of EDC4, with the longer isoform including an in-frame insertion of 36 amino acids (Bloch2023Assembly).

## Function
EDC4 (enhancer of mRNA decapping 4) is a multifunctional protein involved in both mRNA processing and DNA repair in healthy human cells. It plays a critical role in mRNA decay by participating in the decapping complex, which facilitates the removal of the 5' cap from mRNA, a key step in mRNA degradation. This process occurs in processing bodies (P-bodies), cytoplasmic structures where EDC4 interacts with various mRNA decay factors, including the decapping enzyme DCP2 and the exonuclease XRN1, to regulate mRNA turnover and stability (Brothers2022Pbodies; Bloch2023Assembly).

In addition to its role in mRNA processing, EDC4 is involved in DNA repair, particularly in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. It is a component of the BRCA1-BRIP1-TOPBP1 complex, which is essential for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. EDC4 stimulates end resection at these breaks, a critical step in HR, thereby maintaining genome stability. Its deficiency leads to genome instability and increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, similar to BRCA1 deficiency (Hernández2018Decapping). EDC4's dual role in mRNA processing and DNA repair underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EDC4 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer. EDC4 is involved in DNA repair, specifically in the FA/BRCA signaling pathway, and mutations in its WD40 domain are associated with increased breast cancer susceptibility. These mutations are more frequent in breast cancer patients compared to controls, suggesting EDC4 as a potential risk factor for the disease (Hernández2018Decapping). EDC4 mutations have also been identified in metastatic breast cancer and high-grade serous ovarian cancer, supporting its role in cancer development (Hernández2018Decapping).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), EDC4 has been identified as a novel fusion partner of the MLL gene. The resulting MLL-EDC4 fusion protein lacks a significant portion of the WD40 domain, potentially leading to EDC4 haploinsufficiency and contributing to oncogenesis (Becker2019Identification).

EDC4 has also been linked to non-medullary thyroid cancer (NMTC) through the identification of a missense variant in a family with a Mendelian-like inheritance pattern, suggesting a potential role in genetic predisposition to NMTC (Wang2019Identification).

## Interactions
EDC4, a key component of the mRNA decapping complex, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in both mRNA decay and DNA repair processes. EDC4 serves as a scaffold for the assembly of the mRNA decapping complex, interacting with proteins such as DCP1A and DCP2. DCP1A binds to the N-terminal WD40 domain of EDC4, while DCP2 binds to the proximal domain at the C-terminal end (Davey2024A). EDC4 also interacts with MARF1, a human endonuclease, impairing MARF1-mediated repression of target mRNAs by localizing MARF1 to P-bodies, which are involved in mRNA decay (Brothers2020A).

In the context of DNA repair, EDC4 is part of the BRCA1-BRIP1-TOPBP1 complex, where it interacts with TOPBP1, BRCA1, and BRIP1, playing a role in homologous recombination by stimulating end resection at double-strand breaks (Hernández2018Decapping). EDC4's interaction with replication protein A (RPA) is significant in the context of cisplatin resistance in cervical cancer, where it promotes RPA phosphorylation, contributing to DNA damage response (Wu2020Enhancer). EDC4's interactions extend to viral processes, where it interacts with the Ebola virus protein VP35, facilitating viral replication by recruiting the mRNA decapping complex (Davey2024A).
