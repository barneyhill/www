# KLHL32

## Overview
KLHL32 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 32, which is part of the kelch-like family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their involvement in protein-protein interactions, often serving as adaptors or scaffolds in various cellular processes. KLHL32 is particularly noted for its role in the ubiquitination pathway, where it may facilitate the targeting of specific proteins for degradation through its interaction with the Cullin-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The protein is predominantly expressed in brain tissues, with its expression regulated by epigenetic factors such as enhancer chromatin and DNA hypomethylation, suggesting a specialized function in the central nervous system (Shilovsky2023Regulation; Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). Although the precise biological roles of KLHL32 remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in cellular organization, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal regulation highlights its potential significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to oxidative stress (Peng2023Genomic; Monda2013A).

## Structure
KLHL32 is a member of the Kelch-like family of proteins, characterized by the presence of specific structural domains that contribute to its function. The protein contains a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and five to six Kelch motifs. The BTB/POZ domain is involved in dimerization and interaction with the Cullin-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the formation of Cullin-RING multisubunit ubiquitin ligases (Shilovsky2023Regulation; Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). The Kelch motifs typically form a β-propeller structure, which is crucial for substrate recruitment and protein-protein interactions (Shilovsky2023Regulation; Peng2023Genomic).

The BACK domain, although its function is less clearly defined, serves as a linker between the BTB/POZ and Kelch domains (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). KLHL32 is expressed preferentially in brain tissues, with its expression regulated by epigenetic factors such as enhancer chromatin and DNA hypomethylation (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). Specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of KLHL32, as well as any post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
KLHL32 is a member of the kelch-like family of proteins, which are known to participate in protein-protein interactions, often functioning as adaptors or scaffolds. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including cellular organization, signal transduction, and regulation of the cytoskeleton. KLHL32, like other kelch proteins, is implicated in the ubiquitination process, where it may bind substrate proteins to target them for proteasomal degradation or modulate their activity, interaction, and localization (Peng2023Genomic; Monda2013A).

The specific function of KLHL32 in healthy human cells is not fully understood, but it is known to exhibit brain-specific expression and epigenetic regulation. KLHL32 shows a range of steady-state RNA levels in different brain tissues and the spinal cord, with negligible expression in other tissues. This brain-specific expression is associated with enhancer chromatin segments and DNA hypomethylation at its promoter region, suggesting a role in brain function (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics).

KLHL32's involvement in the Cullin-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex suggests it may play a role in targeting tissue-specific proteins for degradation, affecting differentiation, homeostasis, metabolism, cell signaling, and the oxidative stress response (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics).

## Interactions
KLHL32, a member of the kelch-like family of proteins, is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly through its BTB domain. The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening method identified an interaction between KLHL32 and CDK4, where the binding site overlaps with a predicted BTB domain. This domain is known for facilitating protein interactions, suggesting that KLHL32 may interact with CDK4 through this domain, consistent with established protein interaction mechanisms (Waaijers2013Identification).

In the context of neuroendocrine (NE) cancer, KLHL32 is one of the BTB proteins that show a positive correlation with the NE signature. It is highly expressed in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) compared to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancer types. Although specific interactions of KLHL32 in NE cancer are not detailed, its expression is correlated with NE markers such as CHGA and DPYSL5, indicating a potential role in NE cancer biology (Park2022The).

KLHL32 is also part of the kelch-like (klhl) gene family, which encodes substrate adapter proteins for Cullin-E3 ubiquitination. These proteins, including KLHL32, interact with Cullin3 to form a ubiquitin ligase complex, acting as adapters to recruit substrates for ubiquitination (Peng2023Genomic).
