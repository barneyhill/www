# KRTAP19-6

## Overview
KRTAP19-6 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 19-6, which is part of the keratin-associated protein family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in the structural composition of hair and wool fibers, where they play a crucial role in maintaining the mechanical properties and integrity of these fibers. The protein encoded by KRTAP19-6 interacts with keratin intermediate filaments, forming disulfide bonds that contribute to the texture and strength of hair. While the gene's specific interactions and functions are not fully elucidated, it has been identified as an interactor with the protein IIIG9, suggesting a role in complex protein networks within hair fibers (Oviedo2022Is; Soto2020Identification).

## Function


## Interactions
KRTAP19-6, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, is involved in interactions with keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the structural integrity and mechanical properties of hair fibers. These interactions typically involve the formation of disulfide bonds with keratins, which influence hair texture and strength. In a study exploring protein interactions, KRTAP19-6 was identified as an interactor with the protein IIIG9. This interaction was discovered using the human reference interactome (HuRi) map, employing experimental approaches such as two-hybrid assays and affinity capture-MS (Oviedo2022Is). However, specific details on the nature of KRTAP19-6's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the available literature. Additionally, KRTAP19-6 was mentioned in a study on structural variations in chimpanzees, where it was affected by a deletion, but this context did not provide further insights into its protein interactions (Soto2020Identification). Overall, while KRTAP19-6 is recognized for its role in hair fiber structure, detailed information on its specific protein interactions remains limited.
