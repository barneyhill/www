# BHLHE41

## Overview
BHLHE41, also known as DEC2, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein family. The protein encoded by BHLHE41, basic helix-loop-helix family member e41, functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor. It plays a crucial role in regulating circadian rhythms, cellular differentiation, and various physiological processes by binding to E-box motifs in target gene promoters. BHLHE41 is involved in the differentiation of lung alveolar macrophages and B lymphocytes, as well as the regulation of liver metabolism and circadian control of P450 cytochromes. The protein's ability to form homo- or heterodimers and interact with other transcription factors and epigenetic enzymes underscores its significance in cell cycle control, cell growth, and DNA damage response. BHLHE41's expression and interactions have been implicated in various cancers, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or oncogene, depending on the context (Bret2024BHLHE41).

## Structure
BHLHE41, also known as DEC2, is a transcription factor that belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein family. The primary structure of BHLHE41 includes a bHLH domain located at the N terminus, which is essential for DNA binding and dimerization. This domain binds to the E-box motif CANNTG in target promoters and includes an LxxLL motif for interaction with nuclear retinoid receptors, facilitating the formation of homo- or heterodimers (Bret2024BHLHE41). The protein is 482 amino acids long and has a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa (Bret2024BHLHE41).

The secondary structure of the bHLH domain typically involves alpha helices, which are crucial for its function. The tertiary structure is characterized by the folding of these helices, allowing interactions with DNA and other proteins. BHLHE41 can form homodimers, which are transcriptionally inactive or act as repressors, as well as heterodimers with other bHLH proteins (Torres-Machorro2021Homodimeric).

Post-translational modifications of BHLHE41 include SUMOylation, which enhances its repression activity, particularly in the context of PPARG expression (Bret2024BHLHE41). The protein also contains an orange motif in the central region and an alanine/glycine-rich sequence in the C-terminal region (Bret2024BHLHE41).

## Function
BHLHE41, also known as DEC2, is a transcriptional repressor involved in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in regulating circadian rhythms by repressing CLOCK-BMAL1-induced transactivation, which is crucial for maintaining the body's internal clock (Zhang2020BHLHE41; Bret2024BHLHE41). BHLHE41 is expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in a circadian manner and influences sleep duration in humans (Bret2024BHLHE41).

At the cellular level, BHLHE41 is involved in the differentiation and maturation of lung alveolar macrophages and B lymphocytes, particularly during the transition to plasma cells (Bret2024BHLHE41). It also plays a role in the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells by suppressing their differentiation into muscle cells and adipocytes (Bret2024BHLHE41).

BHLHE41 interacts with various transcription factors and epigenetic enzymes, influencing cell cycle control, cell growth, and DNA damage response (Bret2024BHLHE41). It acts as a transcriptional repressor by binding to E-box sequences in target promoters and recruiting co-repressors like HDAC1 and SIRT1 (Bret2024BHLHE41). This gene is also involved in the regulation of liver metabolism and the circadian control of P450 cytochromes (Bret2024BHLHE41).

## Clinical Significance
The BHLHE41 gene, also known as DEC2, plays a significant role in various cancers and conditions through its expression levels and interactions. In bladder cancer, BHLHE41 is downregulated, and its lower expression is linked to worse overall survival. It acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase (Xiao2024BHLHE41). In breast cancer, BHLHE41 has anti-apoptotic effects, and its knockdown enhances apoptosis, affecting genes like FAS and MYC (Bret2024BHLHE41). In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), BHLHE41 is overexpressed and may promote tumor formation and progression, independent of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway (Bigot2016Functional).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), BHLHE41 is associated with better prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma and is considered an early inactivated molecule in NSCLC development (Furukawa2023Approach). In colon cancer, lower expression of BHLHE41 is associated with increased migration and proliferation of cancer cells under hypoxic conditions (Furukawa2023Approach). These findings suggest that BHLHE41's role in cancer varies by tumor type, acting as either an oncogene or tumor suppressor depending on the context.

## Interactions
BHLHE41, a transcriptional repressor, interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in different biological processes. It forms homo- or heterodimers with its paralogue BHLHE40 and other proteins, including transcription factors such as SP1, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) and beta (CEBPB), HIF-1 alpha, MYOD1, and the RNA binding protein NONO (Bret2024BHLHE41). BHLHE41 competes with SP1 for binding to the SP1 binding site on the TWIST1 promoter, effectively displacing SP1 and suppressing TWIST1 transcription, which is crucial for cancer cell behavior (Asanoma2015Regulation).

BHLHE41 also interacts with proteins involved in cell cycle control, cell growth, and division, such as CSNK2A1, CSNK2A2, and PPP2CB (Bret2024BHLHE41). It binds to HIF-1 alpha, promoting its proteasomal degradation, which affects hypoxia response and cell invasion in cancer cells (Bret2024BHLHE41). In bladder cancer, BHLHE41 interacts with PYCR1, promoting its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, thereby inactivating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and suppressing cancer progression (Xiao2024BHLHE41).

BHLHE41's interactions extend to epigenetic regulation, where it recruits co-repressors like HDAC1 and SIRT1 to target promoters, influencing gene expression through histone deacetylation (Bret2024BHLHE41).
