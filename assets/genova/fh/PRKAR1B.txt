# PRKAR1B

## Overview
The PRKAR1B gene encodes the protein kinase cAMP-dependent type I regulatory subunit beta, a critical component of the protein kinase A (PKA) holoenzyme. This regulatory subunit plays a pivotal role in the cAMP signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including metabolism, gene expression, and cell growth. The PRKAR1B protein is categorized as a regulatory subunit and is primarily expressed in the brain, where it is involved in neuronal signaling and mitochondrial function. It interacts with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) to localize PKA to specific cellular sites, thereby influencing cellular signaling pathways. Mutations in PRKAR1B have been associated with neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining normal PKA activity and cellular function (Ilouz2012Localization; Wong2014PRKAR1B; Marbach2021Variants).

## Structure
The PRKAR1B gene encodes the regulatory subunit type I beta of protein kinase A (PKA), which is a crucial component in cAMP signaling. The protein structure includes an N-terminal dimerization/docking (D/D) domain, a linker region, and two cyclic AMP (cAMP) binding domains. The D/D domain is essential for dimerization and interaction with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which localize PKA to specific cellular sites (Wong2014PRKAR1B; Marbach2021Variants).

The primary structure of PRKAR1B involves specific amino acid sequences that form these domains. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, allowing for proper interaction with other proteins and molecules. The quaternary structure of PRKAR1B is characterized by its assembly into a tetrameric holoenzyme, consisting of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits (Wong2014PRKAR1B; Ilouz2012Localization).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in the regulation of PRKAR1B's activity. Alternative splice variants of PRKAR1B have been identified, which may have distinct N-terminal sequences and functional roles (Banday2012Two). These structural features are crucial for the protein's role in cellular signaling and its involvement in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Function
The PRKAR1B gene encodes the R1β regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), a crucial component in the cAMP signaling pathway. In its inactive form, PKA is a tetramer composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. The binding of cyclic AMP (cAMP) to the regulatory subunits, including R1β, releases the catalytic subunits, allowing them to phosphorylate target proteins. This process is essential for regulating various cellular functions, including metabolism, gene expression, and cell growth (Wong2014PRKAR1B; Marbach2021Variants).

The R1β subunit is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus, where it plays a significant role in neuronal signaling. It acts as a cAMP receptor and helps localize PKA within the cell by binding to A-Kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which is crucial for the specific cellular functions of PKA (Ilouz2012Localization; Marbach2021Variants). The R1β subunit is also enriched in mitochondria, suggesting a unique role in regulating mitochondrial structure and function (Ilouz2012Localization).

In healthy human cells, PRKAR1B is involved in brain functions, influencing processes such as long-term memory formation and pain perception (Marbach2021Variants). Its proper function is essential for maintaining normal PKA activity, which is critical for cellular signaling and function (Marbach2021Variants).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRKAR1B gene have been linked to several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. A novel neurodegenerative disorder associated with a heterozygous c.149T>G (p.Leu50Arg) missense mutation in PRKAR1B is characterized by symptoms of dementia and parkinsonism, along with unique neuropathological features such as neuronal inclusions positive for intermediate filaments (Wong2014PRKAR1B). This mutation disrupts protein kinase A (PKA) activity, leading to neurofilament accumulation, a common feature in disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (Wong2014PRKAR1B).

Variants in PRKAR1B are also associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by autism spectrum disorder (ASD), apraxia, and insensitivity to pain. Specific variants such as c.1003C>T (p.Arg335Trp) have been identified in individuals with ASD and global developmental delay, showing decreased PKA activity and impaired integration into the PKA complex (Marbach2021Variants).

Additionally, PRKAR1B variants have been implicated in adrenocortical diseases, including bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia and cortisol-producing adrenal adenomas. These variants are associated with decreased PKA activity, suggesting a distinct mechanism from other PKA subunit mutations (Drougat2021Genomic).

## Interactions
The PRKAR1B protein, a regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), plays a crucial role in forming the PKA holoenzyme by interacting with its catalytic subunits. It contains an N-terminal dimerization/docking (D/D) domain, which is essential for dimerization and binding to A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). These interactions localize PKA to specific subcellular locations, influencing cellular signaling pathways (Ilouz2012Localization; Wong2014PRKAR1B).

Mutations in PRKAR1B, such as the leucine to arginine substitution at position 50, can disrupt the dimerization interface, affecting the protein's ability to bind AKAPs and potentially altering PKA signaling. This mutation may also lead to protein aggregation due to exposed hydrophobic areas (Wong2014PRKAR1B).

PRKAR1B also interacts with the catalytic subunit of PKA, as demonstrated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies. Variants of PRKAR1B, such as p.A67V and p.A300T, have been shown to bind more strongly to the catalytic subunit compared to the wild-type, which may influence PKA activity and contribute to disease pathogenesis (Drougat2021Genomic). These interactions highlight the importance of PRKAR1B in regulating PKA activity and its potential role in various diseases.
