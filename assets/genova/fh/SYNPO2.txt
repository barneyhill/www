# SYNPO2

## Overview
The SYNPO2 gene encodes the synaptopodin 2 protein, which is a member of the synaptopodin family and plays a pivotal role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Synaptopodin 2 is characterized by its structural domains, including a PDZ domain, PXXP motifs, and a PPXY motif, which facilitate various protein-protein interactions essential for cellular functions such as actin polymerization and autophagy (Zheng2023Synaptopodin2:). The protein is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, each contributing differently to actin bundle formation and cellular architecture (Zheng2023Synaptopodin2:). Synaptopodin 2 is involved in critical cellular processes, including mitophagy and chaperone-assisted selective autophagy, and is implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle cell function and differentiation (Zheng2023Synaptopodin2:; Turczyńska2015Regulation). The gene's expression is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and vascular diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Hossain2021MicroRNAs; Ye2023SYNPO2).

## Structure
The SYNPO2 protein, part of the synaptopodin family, has a complex molecular structure with several distinct features. It contains a PSD95-DLG-ZO1 (PDZ) domain, which may facilitate binding to proteins and lipids, and hydrophobic PXXP motifs that allow for SH3 domain protein binding. Additionally, it has a single PPXY motif for protein-protein interactions (Zheng2023Synaptopodin2:). The protein is known to undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at sites such as S902 and S906, which influence its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling and are crucial for its role in cancer suppression (Zheng2023Synaptopodin2:).

SYNPO2 is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with seven identified isoforms (a-g). Isoform a is the longest, approximately 110 kDa, and plays a role in promoting long, ordered actin bundles, while isoform g creates irregular networks (Zheng2023Synaptopodin2:). The protein's structure is integral to its function in actin polymerization and bundle formation, which is essential for maintaining cellular architecture and dynamics (Zheng2023Synaptopodin2:). The gene's expression and structural features are highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental biological importance (Zheng2023Synaptopodin2:).

## Function
SYNPO2 (synaptopodin 2) is a protein that plays a significant role in actin cytoskeleton organization, which is crucial for maintaining cellular structure and function. In healthy human cells, SYNPO2 is involved in the formation of actin bundles, with different isoforms influencing the organization of these structures. Isoforms a and d promote the formation of long, well-ordered actin bundles, while isoform g results in a disordered actin network (Zheng2023Synaptopodin2:). This organization is essential for processes such as cell shape, motility, and adhesion.

SYNPO2 is also implicated in autophagy, particularly in mitophagy and chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA), which are vital for cellular homeostasis. It interacts with proteins like 14-3-3β and Bag3 to facilitate the degradation of damaged proteins and dysfunctional mitochondria (Zheng2023Synaptopodin2:). The protein's involvement in these processes suggests a role in stress responses and maintaining cellular integrity.

In smooth muscle cells, SYNPO2 is highly expressed and contributes to actin polymerization, which is essential for smooth muscle differentiation and contractile function. It interacts with α-actin, playing a key role in regulating actin dynamics and maintaining the structural integrity of smooth muscle cells (Turczyńska2015Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SYNPO2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), colorectal cancer (CRC), and cervical cancer (CC). In BLCA, overexpression of SYNPO2 is associated with poor prognosis, increased tumor invasion, and resistance to immunotherapy. It promotes tumor progression by upregulating vimentin expression and enhancing the infiltration of resting mast cells, which contributes to immune resistance (Ye2023SYNPO2). High SYNPO2 expression in BLCA is linked to worse clinical outcomes, including shorter overall survival and increased mortality (Ye2023SYNPO2).

In contrast, SYNPO2 expression is significantly lower in CRC and CC, where its down-regulation is associated with poor prognosis and lower survival rates. This reduced expression is partly due to hypermethylation of its promoter region. SYNPO2 is involved in critical signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which are crucial for cancer progression and metastasis (Hossain2021MicroRNAs).

In vascular diseases, SYNPO2 expression is regulated by actin polymerization and is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and contractile function of vascular smooth muscle cells. Alterations in SYNPO2 expression can impact vascular contractility and mechanosensing, potentially contributing to vascular pathologies (Turczyńska2015Regulation).

## Interactions
Synaptopodin 2 (SYNPO2) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular functions. SYNPO2 interacts with actin filaments, participating in actin polymerization by forming actin bundles, which is essential for maintaining smooth muscle function and differentiation (Turczyńska2015Regulation). It also binds to α-actin, as demonstrated by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiments, highlighting its role in maintaining the structural integrity and contractile function of vascular smooth muscle cells (Turczyńska2015Regulation).

SYNPO2 contains a PDZ domain that facilitates protein and lipid binding, and it has hydrophobic PXXP motifs for SH3 domain interactions. It also features a PPXY motif for protein-protein interactions, such as binding with BAG3, which is important for chaperone-assisted autophagy (Zheng2023Synaptopodin2:). The interaction between SYNPO2 and BAG3 is crucial for autophagosome membrane elongation, and its inhibition can suppress chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA) (Zheng2023Synaptopodin2:).

SYNPO2 also interacts with 14-3-3β, which mediates its nuclear import, and this interaction is significant for its role in cancer progression and autophagy regulation (Zheng2023Synaptopodin2:). These interactions underscore SYNPO2's involvement in various cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton organization and autophagy.
