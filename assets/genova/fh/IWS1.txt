# IWS1

## Overview
IWS1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in mRNA processing and export. The protein encoded by IWS1 interacts with several key factors, including the transcription elongation factor Spt6 and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), playing a significant role in transcription regulation and histone modification. It is essential for the recruitment of mRNA export adaptors and histone methyltransferases, facilitating efficient mRNA processing and chromatin structure regulation. The IWS1 protein's interactions extend to various other proteins, highlighting its multifaceted role in coordinating transcription elongation and mRNA export. Alterations in IWS1 expression or phosphorylation have been linked to cancer progression and antiviral responses, underscoring its clinical significance (Laliotis2021RETRACTED; Yoh2008The).

## Function
The IWS1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in mRNA processing and export in human cells. It is part of a complex with Spt6 and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), which is essential for transcription elongation. IWS1 facilitates the recruitment of the REF1/Aly mRNA export adaptor and the Rrp6 subunit of the nuclear exosome to the RNAPII elongation complex, ensuring efficient mRNA processing and export (Yoh2008The). 

IWS1 is also involved in histone modification processes, particularly in the regulation of histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) through its interaction with HYPB/Setd2. This modification is important for chromatin structure and gene expression regulation. IWS1 recruits HYPB/Setd2 to the RNAPIIo complex, facilitating H3K36me3 across transcribed regions of certain genes, such as c-Myc and HIV-1 (Yoh2008The). 

In the nucleus, IWS1 interacts with Spt6 and REF1/Aly, stabilizing their binding to actively transcribed genes and aiding in mRNA export. Knockdown of IWS1 results in mRNA processing and export defects, leading to the accumulation of poly(A)+ mRNAs in the nucleus (Yoh2007The; Yoh2008The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or phosphorylation of the IWS1 gene have been implicated in the progression of lung adenocarcinomas, particularly those with EGFR mutations. The phosphorylation of IWS1 by AKT3 is crucial for the regulation of RNA splicing, affecting the splicing of U2AF2 mRNA and promoting cell proliferation through a feedback loop involving Sororin and ERK phosphorylation. This pathway is associated with more aggressive tumor characteristics and poorer patient survival, suggesting that IWS1 plays a significant role in tumor growth and progression (Laliotis2021RETRACTED).

The IWS1 phosphorylation pathway is more active in tumors than in normal tissues and correlates with tumor grade, stage, and metastatic potential. Knockdown of IWS1 has been shown to reduce tumor growth, particularly in EGFR mutant tumors, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Laliotis2021RETRACTED).

In addition to its role in cancer, IWS1 phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of type I interferon expression, which is crucial for antiviral responses. Alterations in IWS1 expression or phosphorylation can affect the cellular antiviral response, making cells more susceptible to viral infections (Laliotis2021RETRACTEDa).

## Interactions
The IWS1 protein is involved in several critical interactions that influence transcription regulation and mRNA processing. It forms a complex with the transcription elongation factor Spt6 and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), which is crucial for mRNA export and histone modification (Yoh2007The; Yoh2008The). IWS1 interacts with the REF1/Aly mRNA export factor, stabilizing its binding to actively transcribed genes and facilitating mRNA export (Yoh2007The; Yoh2008The). 

IWS1 also recruits the HYPB/Setd2 histone methyltransferase to the RNAPII elongation complex, necessary for H3K36 trimethylation, a modification important for transcription elongation and mRNA processing (Oqani2019Iws1; Yoh2008The). The protein interacts with LEDGF/p75, although this interaction does not significantly affect IWS1's nuclear localization, suggesting other factors are more influential in this regard (Tesina2015Multiple). 

IWS1's interactions extend to the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5, which regulates the methylation of the SUPT5h elongation factor, essential for cell viability and early embryonic development (Oqani2019Iws1). These interactions highlight IWS1's role in coordinating transcription elongation, mRNA processing, and export.
