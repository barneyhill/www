# RPP14

## Overview
RPP14 is a gene that encodes the ribonuclease P/MRP subunit p14, a protein component of the ribonuclease P (RNase P) and ribonuclease MRP (RNase MRP) complexes. These complexes are essential for RNA processing, particularly in the maturation of precursor tRNA molecules, which is crucial for protein synthesis (Klemm2016The). The protein encoded by RPP14 is categorized as a ribonucleoprotein subunit, playing a significant role in enhancing the catalytic efficiency and substrate affinity of RNase P by interacting with other protein subunits (Klemm2016The; Welting2004Mutual). Although RPP14 does not directly bind to RNA components of these complexes, its function is mediated through protein-protein interactions, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient protein synthesis (Reiner2011RNA; JIANG2001Protein–RNA).

## Function
RPP14 encodes a protein subunit of the ribonuclease P (RNase P) complex, which is crucial for the maturation of precursor tRNA molecules by cleaving their 5' leader sequences. This process is essential for proper tRNA processing and function, impacting protein synthesis (Klemm2016The). In humans, RNase P is composed of a single RNA subunit and at least ten protein subunits, including RPP14. The RNA subunit alone has minimal catalytic activity without its associated protein subunits, indicating that proteins like RPP14 are crucial for enhancing the catalytic efficiency and substrate affinity of RNase P (Klemm2016The).

RPP14 is active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to RNA processing and ribonucleoprotein complex assembly. The human nuclear RNase P shares homology with yeast RNase P proteins, suggesting a conserved function across eukaryotes (Klemm2016The). Although specific details on the function of RPP14 in healthy human cells are not provided, its role as part of the RNase P complex highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient protein synthesis through its involvement in tRNA maturation (Klemm2016The).

## Interactions
RPP14 is a protein subunit of the human ribonuclease P (RNase P) and ribonuclease MRP (RNase MRP) complexes, which are involved in RNA processing. Within these complexes, RPP14 interacts with several other protein subunits. It has been shown to interact with hPop5, as part of the RNase MRP complex, through GST pull-down assays (Welting2004Mutual). RPP14 also interacts with other RNase MRP proteins, although specific interactions are not detailed in the available excerpts (Welting2004Mutual).

Despite its role in these complexes, RPP14 does not directly bind to the RNA components of RNase P or RNase MRP under the conditions tested. Studies using gel shift assays and UV-crosslinking have shown that RPP14 does not interact with H1 RNA, the RNA component of RNase P, or with the P3 domain of H1 RNA (Reiner2011RNA; JIANG2001Protein–RNA). Similarly, RPP14 does not bind to RNase MRP RNA in the tested conditions (Welting2004Mutual). These findings suggest that RPP14's role in the RNase P and MRP complexes is likely mediated through protein-protein interactions rather than direct RNA binding.
