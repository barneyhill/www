# F8

## Overview
The F8 gene is responsible for encoding coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), a vital protein in the blood coagulation process. FVIII is a glycoprotein that functions as a cofactor in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, specifically aiding in the activation of factor X to factor Xa, which is crucial for the formation of a stable blood clot. Structurally, FVIII is composed of multiple domains, including A1, A2, B, A3, C1, and C2, which are essential for its interaction with other proteins and its function in coagulation. The protein is primarily synthesized in endothelial cells and circulates in the bloodstream bound to von Willebrand factor (vWF), which stabilizes it and protects it from degradation. Mutations in the F8 gene can lead to hemophilia A, a genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency in FVIII, resulting in impaired blood clotting and increased bleeding risk (Turner2015Factor; De2022The; Lannoy2016Principles).

## Structure
The F8 gene encodes coagulation factor VIII (fVIII), a crucial protein in the blood coagulation process. The primary structure of fVIII consists of 2,332 amino acids arranged in a domain sequence of A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 (wuerth2015structural; AlAllaf2019Identification). The A domains share approximately 30% sequence homology with each other and with ceruloplasmin, a copper-binding protein, while the C domains also exhibit extensive homology to each other. The B domain does not show homology to other proteins (wuerth2015structural).

The secondary structure of fVIII includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the stability and function of the protein. The tertiary structure involves interactions between these domains, crucial for the protein's stability and function (Lopes2021Protein). The quaternary structure of fVIII involves its association with von Willebrand factor (vWF) in the bloodstream, forming a noncovalently associated heterodimer of a heavy chain (A1-A2-B) and a light chain (A3-C1-C2) (wuerth2015structural).

Post-translational modifications of fVIII include glycosylation and sulfation, which are important for its stability and activity (wuerth2015structural). Structural studies have also explored modifications such as B-domain deletion to enhance stability and reduce dissociation (wuerth2015structural).

## Function
The F8 gene encodes coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), a critical protein in the blood coagulation process. FVIII functions as a cofactor for activated factor IX (FIXa) in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, facilitating the conversion of factor X (FX) to its active form, FXa. This conversion is essential for the formation of the tenase complex, which plays a pivotal role in the amplification phase of the coagulation cascade, ultimately leading to the formation of a stable blood clot (De2022The).

In its inactive form, FVIII consists of six domains: A1, A2, B, A3, C1, and C2. Upon activation by thrombin or FXa, FVIII is converted to its active form, FVIIIa, which binds to FIXa to form the tenase complex. This complex is crucial for the activation of FX to FXa, a key step in the coagulation cascade (De2022The). FVIIIa's interaction with von Willebrand factor (VWF) is mediated by the A3 domain, while the C1 and C2 domains are involved in binding to platelet membrane phospholipids (De2022The).

FVIII is primarily synthesized in endothelial cells, where it is stored in Weibel-Palade bodies and secreted bound to ultra-large VWF strings. This binding protects FVIII from proteolysis and pinocytosis in the plasma, ensuring its stability and availability for coagulation (Turner2015Factor).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the F8 gene, which encodes coagulation factor VIII, are primarily associated with hemophilia A, a hereditary X-linked recessive bleeding disorder. This condition is characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of factor VIII, leading to impaired blood clotting and excessive bleeding. Hemophilia A is classified into severe, moderate, and mild forms based on residual factor VIII activity levels in plasma (Andersson2020Novel; Lannoy2016Principles).

The most common genetic defect causing severe hemophilia A is the intron 22 inversion, which occurs in approximately 40-50% of severe cases. This inversion results from intrachromosomal recombination between homologous sequences, disrupting the production of functional factor VIII protein (Garagiola2015A; Lannoy2016Principles). Another significant mutation is the intron 1 inversion, affecting 1-6% of severe cases (Garagiola2015A).

In some patients, deep intronic mutations in the F8 gene can lead to abnormal mRNA splicing, resulting in the inclusion of intronic sequences in mRNA and premature stop codons. These mutations are not detected by routine screening methods and can contribute to mild hemophilia A by reducing factor VIII activity (Pezeshkpoor2013Deep).

## Interactions
Coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its function in the coagulation cascade. One of its primary interactions is with von Willebrand factor (vWF), which stabilizes FVIII in circulation and protects it from proteolytic degradation. This interaction occurs at the D' domain of vWF and is essential for regulating FVIII's half-life and activity (Kiouptsi2020Physiological; LacroixDesmazes2008Dynamics).

FVIII is activated by proteolytic cleavage through thrombin and factor Xa, which enhances its coagulant activity. Thrombin cleaves FVIII at specific sites, resulting in smaller subunits that are more active in the coagulation process. Factor Xa initially activates FVIII but can also inactivate it through further cleavage (Eaton1986Proteolytic).

In the endoplasmic reticulum, FVIII interacts with chaperone proteins such as calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT). These interactions are important for its proper folding and secretion. FVIII forms complexes with CNX and CRT, which are mediated by its heavily glycosylated B-domain. This interaction is crucial for FVIII's degradation and secretion pathways (Pipe1998Differential).

The sulfation of tyrosine residues, particularly Tyr1680, is critical for FVIII's interaction with vWF. This post-translational modification is necessary for high-affinity binding to vWF, which influences FVIII's stability and function (Leyte1991Sulfation).
