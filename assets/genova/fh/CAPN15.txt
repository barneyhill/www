# CAPN15

## Overview
CAPN15 is a gene that encodes the protein calpain 15, a member of the SOL subfamily of non-classical calpains. Calpain 15 is categorized as an intracellular calcium-dependent cysteine protease, which plays a crucial role in modulating substrates through limited proteolysis rather than complete degradation. This modulation is essential for various developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system and eye development (Zha2020Biallelic; Mor‐Shaked2021Biallelic). The protein is characterized by a unique domain organization, including zinc-finger repeats and a calpain catalytic domain, but lacks the penta-EF-hand domain found in classical calpains, suggesting a distinct regulatory mechanism (Spinozzi2021Calpains). CAPN15 is predominantly expressed in the nervous system during embryonic development, and its mutations are associated with developmental disorders affecting the eyes and brain (Zha2020Biallelic).

## Structure
The human gene CAPN15 encodes a protein that is part of the SOL subfamily of non-classical calpains, characterized by a unique domain organization. The molecular structure of CAPN15 includes several distinct domains. At the N-terminus, it features up to six zinc-finger repeats, which are known to bind polyubiquitin, playing a role in protein regulation (Hastings2018The; Spinozzi2021Calpains). The protein also contains a calpain catalytic domain, which is crucial for its protease activity, and a SOL homology domain (SOH) at the C-terminal, although the function of the SOH domain remains unknown (Zha2020Biallelic; Spinozzi2021Calpains).

CAPN15 lacks the penta-EF-hand (PEF) domain found in classical calpains, indicating a different regulatory mechanism (Spinozzi2021Calpains). The protein is highly conserved, sharing significant sequence identity with its mouse orthologue, and is expressed predominantly in the nervous system, particularly during embryonic development (Zha2020Biallelic). Variants in CAPN15 can affect protein stability, influencing its function and potentially leading to developmental disorders (Zha2020Biallelic). The zinc fingers and other domains contribute to the protein's tertiary structure, which is stabilized by interactions with polyubiquitin (Hastings2018The).

## Function
CAPN15, or calpain 15, is a non-classical calpain that functions as an intracellular calcium-dependent cysteine protease. It is involved in modulating substrates through limited proteolysis, which means it modifies proteins rather than degrading them completely. This modulation is crucial for various developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system and eye development (Zha2020Biallelic; Mor‐Shaked2021Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, CAPN15 is highly expressed in the brain and is associated with the development of the nervous system. It is particularly active during embryonic stages, suggesting a significant role in early brain development (Zha2020Biallelic). The protein is also expressed in the eye, where it is involved in normal eye development, as evidenced by its association with congenital eye anomalies when mutated (Zha2020Biallelic).

Structurally, CAPN15 contains Zn-finger motifs and a SOL homology domain, although the specific function of these domains in healthy cells remains unclear (Spinozzi2021Calpains). The calpain catalytic domain of CAPN15 is conserved, indicating its potential involvement in transcriptional regulation through the cleavage of transcription factors, similar to other calpains (Zha2020Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CAPN15 gene are associated with a range of developmental disorders, particularly affecting the eyes and brain. Biallelic variants in CAPN15 have been linked to congenital eye anomalies such as microphthalmia, coloboma, and cataracts, as well as neurodevelopmental deficits including developmental delays, cognitive impairments, autism, and hearing loss (Zha2020Biallelic). These conditions are often inherited in a recessive pattern, with mutations affecting the highly conserved SOLH domain of the CAPN15 protein, impacting its stability and function (Zha2020Biallelic).

In humans, individuals with biallelic loss-of-function variants in CAPN15 may present with a syndrome resembling Johanson-Blizzard syndrome, characterized by congenital malformations, developmental delay, and eye abnormalities (Mor‐Shaked2021Biallelic). Mouse models with Capn15 knockout exhibit similar phenotypes, including developmental eye disorders and reduced brain size, particularly in the thalamus and hippocampal regions, underscoring the gene's role in brain development and plasticity (Zha2021MRI).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of CAPN15 mutations in contributing to a spectrum of developmental disorders, emphasizing the importance of including CAPN15 in genetic testing for related conditions (Zha2020Biallelic).
