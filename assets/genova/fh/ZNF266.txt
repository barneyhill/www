# ZNF266

## Overview
ZNF266 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 266, which is a member of the KRAB-ZNF (Krüppel-associated box zinc finger) protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of C2H2 zinc finger domains, which are essential for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The zinc finger protein 266 is involved in the repression of gene expression and plays a crucial role in cellular differentiation processes, particularly in the maturation of neutrophils. It has been implicated in various biological processes, including cell differentiation, immune response, and potentially in oncogenesis, as it is associated with diseases such as multiple sclerosis and certain cancers. The gene's expression and function are influenced by genetic variants, which may affect its role in transcriptional regulation and contribute to disease susceptibility (Yang2024Largescale; Mollinedo2008Differential; Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

## Function
ZNF266, a zinc finger protein, plays a significant role in transcription regulation during cell differentiation. It is notably up-regulated during the differentiation of human leukemia HL-60 cells into neutrophils, particularly after three days of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) treatment, with a 40-fold increase in expression. This suggests that ZNF266 is involved in the acquisition of the mature neutrophil phenotype, indicating its importance in the late stages of neutrophil maturation (Mollinedo2008Differential).

ZNF266 is part of the KRAB-ZNF gene family, which is characterized by the presence of C2H2 zinc finger domains. These domains are crucial for DNA binding and gene regulation. The KRAB-ZNF proteins, including ZNF266, are involved in the repression of gene expression by interacting with DNA, RNA, or cofactors such as KAP1. This interaction is essential for the repressor activity of KRAB-ZNF proteins, which may influence various cellular processes and phenotypic traits (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

In addition to its role in differentiation, ZNF266 has been identified as a gene potentially related to cervical cancer, suggesting its involvement in critical molecular processes such as replication, transcription, and translation in tumor cells (Zhang2021Leveraging).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZNF266 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. ZNF266 has been identified as a novel gene associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), with significant associations found in large-scale whole-exome sequencing studies. This suggests that genetic variations in ZNF266 may contribute to the pathogenesis of MS (Yang2024Largescale).

The gene is also involved in cell immortalization pathways, particularly in the context of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-induced cell transformation. This association indicates a potential role for ZNF266 in cancer-related processes, as EBV is known to contribute to the development of certain types of cancer (Wragg2020Using).

Additionally, genetic variants near ZNF266, such as rs2116843, have been linked to variations in its expression at both mRNA and protein levels. These variants may influence the stability and regulation of ZNF266, potentially affecting its role in transcriptional regulation and contributing to disease states (Hause2014Identification).

ZNF266 is part of a cluster of KRAB-ZNF genes that show patterns of genetic variation consistent with positive selection, suggesting its involvement in local adaptation and possibly in conditions related to immune response and other phenotypic traits (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).
