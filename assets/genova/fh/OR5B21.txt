# OR5B21

## Overview
The OR5B21 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily B member 21, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in detecting odor molecules. The OR5B21 protein plays a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating a neuronal response that leads to the perception of smell. As a member of the largest gene family in the human genome, olfactory receptors like OR5B21 are essential for the diversity of olfactory perception, contributing to the ability to detect a wide range of chemical compounds (Qiu2020aarFDC).
