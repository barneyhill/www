# EZR

## Overview
The EZR gene encodes the protein ezrin, a member of the ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) protein family, which plays a pivotal role in linking the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton. Ezrin is categorized as a cytoskeletal linker protein and is integral to maintaining cell shape, adhesion, and the organization of cell surface structures such as microvilli and cilia (Algrain1993Ezrin; Kawaguchi2022Pathophysiological). The protein is characterized by a conserved domain structure, including an N-terminal FERM domain, a central α-helical domain, and a C-terminal domain that binds to actin filaments (Lipreri2023Perspectives; Pore2015The). Ezrin's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which facilitates its role in cellular signaling and structural maintenance (Kawaguchi2022Pathophysiological). The gene's expression and the protein's function are implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell migration, and proliferation, and have significant clinical relevance in cancer progression and drug resistance (Car2023Ezrin; XIAO2022Integrative).

## Structure
Ezrin is a member of the ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) protein family, characterized by a conserved domain structure. The primary structure of ezrin includes an N-terminal FERM domain, a central α-helical domain, and a C-terminal domain that binds to actin filaments (Lipreri2023Perspectives; Pore2015The). The FERM domain, spanning approximately amino acids 1-296, is composed of three subdomains (F1, F2, and F3) and forms a compact cloverleaf structure (Ponuwei2016A; Pore2015The). This domain is responsible for binding to integral membrane proteins and is involved in various cellular processes (Lipreri2023Perspectives).

The secondary structure of ezrin includes alpha-helix and beta-pleated sheet structures (Lipreri2023Perspectives). The tertiary structure involves a compact clover-shaped FERM domain and a coiled-coil structure connecting the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Lipreri2023Perspectives). The quaternary structure can involve intermolecular interactions, forming monomers or dimers (Gary1995Ezrin; Lipreri2023Perspectives).

Ezrin undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific sites such as Y353 and T567, which are crucial for its activation (Lipreri2023Perspectives; Pore2015The). Phosphorylation at T567 is necessary for the transition from an inactive to an active state (Lipreri2023Perspectives). The protein can exist in a dormant, inactive closed conformation, with activation requiring PIP2-mediated uncoupling and phosphorylation (Xie2019Heat; Ponuwei2016A).

## Function
Ezrin (EZR) is a member of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) protein family, which functions as a crucial linker between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton in healthy human cells. This linkage is essential for maintaining cell shape, adhesion, and the organization of cell surface structures such as microvilli and cilia (Algrain1993Ezrin; Kawaguchi2022Pathophysiological). Ezrin is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell migration, and proliferation. It acts as a scaffold protein, recruiting signaling molecules and linking membrane proteins like receptors and ion channels to the cytoskeleton (Srivastava2005Srcdependent; Kawaguchi2022Pathophysiological).

Ezrin's function is regulated by phosphorylation, which allows it to switch between active and inactive conformations, facilitating its role in cellular signaling and structural maintenance (Kawaguchi2022Pathophysiological). It interacts with proteins such as the ELMO-DOCK1 complex and β2 adrenergic receptors, playing a role in ciliary function and cellular responses to external stimuli (Kawaguchi2022Pathophysiological). Ezrin is also involved in the regulation of cell adhesion, interacting with molecules like E-cadherin and β-catenin, which are critical for cell-cell junctions and epithelial integrity (Hiscox1999Ezrin; Pujuguet2003Ezrin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EZR gene, which encodes the protein ezrin, have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, high EZR expression is associated with poor prognosis and shorter overall survival. It contributes to cancer cell proliferation, motility, and metastasis through pathways such as Rac1/RhoA/cdc42, and its expression is negatively correlated with the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs like Doxorubicin and Paclitaxel (XIAO2022Integrative).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), elevated EZR expression is linked to worse clinical outcomes and acts as an independent prognostic marker. Pharmacological inhibition of EZR in AML cell lines reduces cell viability and induces apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lipreri2021Comprehensive).

In cervical and gastric cancers, high EZR expression correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis. In cervical cancer, it is associated with the severity of HPV-related lesions, while in gastric cancer, it is linked to Helicobacter pylori infection and various clinical factors (Carvalho2024Transcriptomics).

EZR is also involved in acquired resistance to the BRAFV600E inhibitor vemurafenib in colon cancer and melanoma. Inhibition of ezrin enhances the effects of vemurafenib, indicating its role in drug resistance mechanisms (Car2023Ezrin).

## Interactions
Ezrin (EZR) is a member of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) protein family and is involved in linking the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton. It interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular architecture and signaling. Ezrin binds to several membrane proteins, including CD44, ICAM-2, and syndecan 2, through its amino-terminal domain, facilitated by a positively charged amino acid cluster at a juxtamembrane position (Louvet‐Vallée2000ERM). It also interacts with EBP50, a phosphoprotein that acts as an adapter between integral membrane proteins and ERM proteins, forming multiprotein complexes beneath the plasma membrane (Morales2004Ezrin–radixin–moesin; Louvet‐Vallée2000ERM).

Ezrin's interaction with F-actin is mediated through its C-terminal domain, which is normally masked in the monomeric form and requires activation to bind F-actin (Gary1995Ezrin). This interaction is crucial for the formation and maintenance of actin-rich structures such as microvilli and lamellipodia (Gary1995Ezrin). Ezrin also forms dimers and heterodimers with other ERM family members, such as moesin, through interactions between its N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Gary1995Ezrin).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells, ezrin interacts with heat shock protein family B member 1 (HSPB1), particularly in its inactive form. This interaction is reduced when ezrin is activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Xie2019Heat). Ezrin also functions as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP), binding to PKA regulatory subunits and playing a role in T cell activation and gastric acid secretion (Neisch2011Ezrin).
