# GPR75

## Overview
GPR75 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 75, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly within the hypothalamus, and plays a significant role in the neuroendocrine regulation of energy balance and metabolic processes. GPR75 is activated by the chemokine CCL5, leading to intracellular signaling pathways that influence calcium ion mobilization and insulin secretion, thereby impacting glucose homeostasis and body weight regulation (Liu2013The; Ignatov2006RANTES). Variants of the GPR75 gene have been associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases (Akbari2021Sequencing; Hossain2023Gpr75‐deficient). Additionally, GPR75's involvement in neuroprotection suggests its relevance in neurodegenerative disease contexts (Dedoni2018The).

## Structure
The GPR75 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a common feature of Class A GPCRs. The structure of GPR75 reveals a closed, active conformation with a high-affinity state for agonists. The ligand binding pocket is shallow and spacious, formed by the extracellular ends of transmembrane helices TM2, TM3, TM5, TM6, and TM7, and is surrounded by polar and hydrophobic residues, which facilitate ligand interaction (Lv2022CryoEM). The ICL2 loop acts as a lid over the ligand binding pocket, modulating ligand recognition (Lv2022CryoEM).

The receptor's structure includes unique features such as the absence of a classical sodium binding site and a non-canonical DRY motif, similar to the HRM motif in GPR162 and GPR153 (Lv2022CryoEM). The NPxxY motif in TM7 is arranged similarly to activated β2AR, and the PIF motif below the binding pocket initiates structural changes upon activation (Lv2022CryoEM). GPR75 lacks a highly conserved proline, resulting in a more rigid TM5 conformation (Lv2022CryoEM). The receptor was expressed in Sf9 insect cells with modifications to enhance expression and stability, including the replacement of the ICL3 loop with the bril sequence (Lv2022CryoEM).

## Function
GPR75, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in several critical molecular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in the hypothalamus, where it plays a role in the neuroendocrine regulation of energy balance. This receptor is activated by the chemokine CCL5, leading to intracellular signaling events that include the mobilization of calcium ions and the formation of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) through Gq protein-coupled pathways (Ignatov2006RANTES). These signaling pathways are crucial for various cellular functions, including insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis, as GPR75 activation influences calcium levels in beta cells, which are essential for insulin release (Liu2013The).

GPR75 is also implicated in metabolic regulation, with protein-truncating variants associated with lower body mass index (BMI) and protection against obesity. These variants suggest a role for GPR75 in regulating body weight and fat mass, potentially through its influence on glucose and insulin pathways (Akbari2021Sequencing). In addition to its metabolic functions, GPR75 is involved in neuroprotection, where its activation by CCL5 can prevent neuronal cell death, indicating its potential role in protecting against neurodegenerative diseases (Dedoni2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GPR75 gene have been associated with several metabolic disorders, particularly obesity and related conditions. Rare protein-truncating variants in GPR75 are linked to a significant reduction in body mass index (BMI) and offer protection against obesity. These variants lead to a truncated GPR75 receptor, likely resulting in a complete loss of function, which is associated with lower overall body fat mass and percentage (Akbari2021Sequencing). In mouse models, Gpr75-deficient mice exhibit reduced weight gain, adiposity, and improved glucose metabolism when subjected to a high-fat diet, suggesting a protective role against obesity and insulin resistance (Hossain2023Gpr75‐deficient).

GPR75 is also implicated in metabolic syndrome and related conditions through its interaction with 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), a lipid involved in insulin resistance and obesity. Activation of GPR75 by 20-HETE triggers pro-inflammatory pathways, contributing to diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (Wang2024Effect). The receptor's role in these pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic dysfunction-related steatosis liver disease (MASLD) and other metabolic disorders (Wang2024Effect). These findings underscore the clinical significance of GPR75 in metabolic health and disease.

## Interactions
GPR75, a G protein-coupled receptor, interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in multiple signaling pathways. In the context of 20-HETE signaling, GPR75 is associated with Gαq/11, GIT1, and HIC-5. The binding of 20-HETE to GPR75 decreases its association with Gαq/11 and HIC-5 while increasing its association with GIT1. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of EGFR, mediated by c-Src and involving GIT1, leading to downstream effects such as eNOS uncoupling and ACE induction (Garcia201720HETE).

GPR75 also interacts with the chemokine RANTES (CCL5), which activates signaling pathways involving the mobilization of calcium ions and the formation of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) in GPR75-transfected cells. This process is mediated by Gq proteins and involves phospholipase-C (PLC) activation. RANTES enhances the phosphorylation of AKT and MAPK, which are important for cell proliferation and survival (Ignatov2006RANTES).

In addition, GPR75 interacts with TUB-like protein 3 (TULP3), which is essential for its localization in primary cilia. This localization is crucial for GPR75's function in regulating body weight, as demonstrated by the failure of GPR75 to localize in cilia in Tulp3-knockout cells (Jiang2024Central).
