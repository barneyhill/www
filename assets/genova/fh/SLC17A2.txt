# SLC17A2

## Overview
The SLC17A2 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 17 member 2, which functions as a type I Na+-phosphate cotransporter, also known as NPT3. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and is primarily expressed in the liver and kidneys, where it plays a significant role in the regulation of serum urate levels by facilitating the transport of organic anions across cell membranes (Dong2018Genetic; Togawa2015Wide). SLC17A2 is a membrane potential-driven transporter that exhibits polyspecificity, recognizing various organic anions such as urate, aspirin, salicylate, and ibuprofen as substrates (Togawa2015Wide). The gene's variants have been associated with conditions such as gout and subclinical atherosclerosis, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Arya2018A; Reimer2013SLC17:).

## Function
The SLC17A2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a type I Na+-phosphate cotransporter, also known as NPT3, which is involved in the transport of organic anions across cell membranes. This protein is primarily expressed in the liver and kidneys, where it plays a crucial role in regulating serum urate levels by facilitating urate transport (Dong2018Genetic; Togawa2015Wide). SLC17A2 is a membrane potential-driven transporter that exhibits polyspecificity, recognizing various organic anions such as urate, aspirin, salicylate, and ibuprofen as substrates (Togawa2015Wide).

The protein is localized in the apical regions of certain tissues, including the liver and kidneys, where it contributes to the homeostasis of organic anions and phosphate (Togawa2015Wide). SLC17A2's activity is influenced by the presence of an Na+ gradient, which is essential for its function as a cotransporter (Togawa2015Wide). Variants of the SLC17A2 gene, such as rs2071299, have been associated with altered expression levels and may influence the risk of developing gout by affecting serum urate concentrations (Dong2018Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC17A2 gene has been implicated in various health conditions through its genetic variants and expression patterns. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in SLC17A2, rs36014129, is suggestively associated with carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, in populations with rheumatoid arthritis (Arya2018A). Another SNP, rs80215559-C, located in an intron of SLC17A2, has been linked to increased cirrhosis prevalence, although this association is primarily due to its linkage with the HFE C282Y mutation, a known cause of hereditary hemochromatosis (Chen2020Genetic).

SLC17A2 is also involved in the transport of organic anions, such as urate, and its expression is noted in various tissues, including the liver and kidneys (Togawa2015Wide). While the clinical significance of SLC17A2 mutations is not fully established, its role in urate transport suggests potential implications in conditions like gout and hyperuricemia (Reimer2013SLC17:). Despite these associations, the direct impact of SLC17A2 mutations on specific diseases remains to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to clarify its clinical relevance.
