# USP18

## Overview
USP18, or ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18, is a gene that encodes a cysteine protease enzyme involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly through its role in modulating type I interferon (IFN) signaling. The protein encoded by USP18 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that specifically targets the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15, a process known as deISGylation, which is crucial for antiviral defense and cellular stress responses (Kang2020Emerging; Malakhov2002UBP43). Beyond its enzymatic activity, USP18 acts as a negative regulator of the IFN signaling pathway by interacting with the IFN receptor subunit IFNAR2, thereby preventing excessive immune activation and maintaining immune homeostasis (Kang2020Emerging; Rubino2021Human). The protein's structure is characterized by a catalytic core typical of cysteine proteases, with specific domains that facilitate its interaction with ISG15 (Basters2017Structural). USP18's regulatory functions are essential for preventing IFN hypersensitivity and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its significance in both innate immunity and potential therapeutic applications (DziamałekMacioszczyk2019Versatility).

## Structure
USP18, a ubiquitin-specific protease, exhibits a molecular structure characterized by a catalytic core typical of cysteine proteases, resembling a right hand with finger, palm, and thumb domains. The finger domain is stabilized by a Zn2+ ion coordinated by four cysteine residues, which supports an extended loop (Basters2017Structural). The catalytic triad of USP18 consists of Cys61, His314, and Asn331, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Basters2017Structural).

USP18 is highly specific for the ubiquitin-like modifier ISG15, and this specificity is attributed to two critical regions, ISG15-binding box 1 (IBB-1) and box 2 (IBB-2), which facilitate hydrophobic and hydrogen-bond interactions with ISG15 (Basters2017Structural). The C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of ISG15 is crucial for binding, embedding between the finger and thumb domains of USP18 (Basters2017Structural).

The protein can exist in open and closed conformations, with the closed state being incompatible with ISG15 binding. Upon ISG15 binding, USP18 undergoes conformational changes necessary for catalytic activity (Basters2017Structural). USP18 is a monomer with a molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa and is not phosphorylated when expressed in insect cells, indicating proper folding and solubility (Basters2014Molecular).

## Function
USP18, also known as ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18, is a critical regulator of type I interferon (IFN) signaling in human cells. It functions as a negative feedback regulator by binding to the IFN receptor subunit IFNAR2, thereby preventing the activation of the downstream JAK/STAT pathway. This regulation is essential for controlling the magnitude of IFN responses and maintaining immune homeostasis, preventing excessive inflammation that can result from sustained type I IFN responses (Kang2020Emerging; Rubino2021Human).

USP18 also acts as a deubiquitinating enzyme, specifically removing ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein, from conjugated proteins. This process, known as deISGylation, influences antiviral response mechanisms and cellular stress responses (Kang2020Emerging; Malakhov2002UBP43). The enzyme is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, thymus, and spleen, and is upregulated by type I and III IFNs, viral infections, and other stressors (Kang2020Emerging; DziamałekMacioszczyk2019Versatility).

In healthy human cells, USP18's role extends beyond its enzymatic activity, as it modulates the immune response by inhibiting type I and III IFN signaling pathways, thus preventing IFN hypersensitivity and autoimmune disease development (DziamałekMacioszczyk2019Versatility). Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and effective immune responses to pathogens (Kang2020Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the USP18 gene are linked to severe type 1 interferonopathy, leading to a condition known as pseudo-TORCH syndrome (PTS). This syndrome mimics congenital infections but is noninfectious, characterized by severe neurological and systemic symptoms such as brain calcifications, hemorrhages, and systemic inflammation (Meuwissen2016Human). USP18 deficiency results in excessive interferon-mediated inflammation, which can be lethal during the perinatal period. Clinical features include hydrocephalus, necrotizing cellulitis, systemic inflammation, and respiratory failure (Alsohime2020JAK). 

The absence of USP18 leads to persistent activation of interferon signaling pathways, resulting in increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes and abnormal immune responses (Meuwissen2016Human). In some cases, USP18 deficiency has been treated with JAK inhibitors like ruxolitinib, which can lead to significant clinical improvements (Alsohime2020JAK). 

Alterations in USP18 expression can also impact pancreatic beta cell survival, contributing to conditions like type 1 diabetes by increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and exacerbating cytokine-induced beta cell death (Santin2012USP18). These findings highlight the critical role of USP18 in regulating immune responses and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
USP18 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in modulating immune responses. It is involved in the deubiquitination of STING, a key protein in antiviral signaling, by recruiting other deubiquitinating enzymes, specifically USP20. USP18 and USP20 are mutually required for the deubiquitination of STING, as knockdown of either impairs this process. USP18 interacts with the C-terminus of USP20 and the N-terminus of STING, facilitating the recruitment of USP20 to STING, which is essential for the antiviral response (Zhang2016USP18).

USP18 also regulates NF-κB signaling by interacting with the TAK1-TAB1 complex and the IKK complex, including IKKα, IKKβ, and NEMO. The interaction with the IKK complex is NEMO-dependent, while USP18 still interacts with the TAK1 complex in the absence of NEMO, indicating distinct mechanisms of interaction (Yang2015USP18).

In the context of innate antiviral immunity, USP18 interacts with MAVS and TRIM31, promoting K63-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS, which is crucial for the RLR-mediated type-I interferon response. USP18 acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating the recruitment of TRIM31 to mitochondria, essential for MAVS ubiquitination and aggregation (Hou2021USP18).
