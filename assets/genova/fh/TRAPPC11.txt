# TRAPPC11

## Overview
TRAPPC11 is a gene that encodes the protein trafficking protein particle complex subunit 11, which is a critical component of the TRAPP (transport protein particle) complex involved in vesicle-mediated transport within cells. The TRAPPC11 protein plays a significant role in autophagy and membrane trafficking, particularly in the early secretory pathway, where it facilitates the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. It is categorized as a component of the TRAPP III complex and is essential for maintaining Golgi morphology and function, impacting processes such as protein glycosylation and lipid metabolism (Milev2019Characterization). Mutations in the TRAPPC11 gene are associated with various neuromuscular and developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and physiology (Milev2019Characterization; Stanga2019TRAPPC11). The protein's interactions with other TRAPP subunits and autophagy-related proteins underscore its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Stanga2019TRAPPC11).

## Structure
TRAPPC11 is a protein composed of 1133 amino acids and is a component of the TRAPP complex, which is involved in vesicle-mediated transport. The protein contains several important domains, including the foie gras domain, spanning amino acids 263-561, which is evolutionarily conserved and critical for its function (Milev2019Characterization; Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). Another significant region is the gryzun domain, located near the carboxy terminus, consisting of a 60-amino acid stretch, though its precise function remains unclear (Milev2019Characterization).

The ASH domain of TRAPPC11, identified in the region 748-1133, is conserved across species and is implicated in centrosome targeting and microtubule organization (Schou2014Identification). This domain is suggested to interact with microtubules or centrosome-specific Rab GTPases, such as Rab8 (Schou2014Identification).

TRAPPC11 is involved in N-linked glycosylation, and its depletion leads to hypoglycosylation of proteins (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). Variants in TRAPPC11 can lead to defects in membrane trafficking, glycosylation, and autophagic flux, highlighting the importance of its structure for normal cellular function (Milev2019Characterization). The protein's structure and function are further influenced by post-translational modifications, such as potential phosphorylation sites and an N-linked glycosylation motif (Milev2019Characterization).

## Function
TRAPPC11 is a crucial component of the TRAPP III complex, which is involved in autophagy and membrane trafficking in human cells. In the process of autophagy, TRAPPC11 plays a significant role by recruiting ATG2B and WIPI4 to preautophagosomal membranes, facilitating the expansion and sealing of isolation membranes into autophagosomes. This recruitment is essential for maintaining autophagic flux, as it ensures the proper formation and sealing of autophagosomes, which are necessary for the degradation and recycling of cellular components (Stanga2019TRAPPC11).

TRAPPC11 is also involved in membrane trafficking, particularly in the early secretory pathway, where it is essential for the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. It helps maintain Golgi morphology and function, impacting processes such as protein glycosylation and lipid metabolism (Milev2019Characterization). Mutations in TRAPPC11 can lead to defects in these processes, resulting in a range of phenotypes, including neuromuscular and developmental disorders (Milev2019Characterization; Stanga2019TRAPPC11). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum membranes, highlighting its role in cellular homeostasis and physiology (Milev2019Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRAPPC11 gene are associated with a range of disorders, primarily affecting muscle, eye, and brain function. These include limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2S (LGMD2S), congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), and intellectual disabilities. Individuals with TRAPPC11 variants often present with symptoms such as muscle weakness, movement disorders, intellectual deficits, epilepsy, and elevated creatine kinase levels, indicative of muscle pathology (Justel2023Expanding; Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). 

A specific splice-site variant, c.1287+5G>A, has been identified as a founder pathogenic variant in the Roma population, leading to a distinct phenotype that includes progressive microcephaly and infections triggering psychomotor regression and seizures (Justel2023Expanding). This variant results in an in-frame deletion affecting the conserved foie gras domain, crucial for interactions with TRAPPC2L, and leads to defects in membrane trafficking, autophagy, and N-linked glycosylation (Justel2023Expanding).

TRAPPC11 mutations are also linked to congenital disorders of glycosylation, characterized by defects in both N- and O-glycosylation, which can lead to a variety of systemic symptoms, including hypotonia, microcephaly, and liver abnormalities (Matalonga2016Mutations). These mutations can disrupt normal protein trafficking, leading to cellular dysfunction and disease (Milev2019Characterization).

## Interactions
TRAPPC11 is a component of the TRAPP III complex, which is involved in membrane trafficking and autophagy. It interacts with several proteins, including ATG2B and WIPI4, which are crucial for autophagosome formation. TRAPPC11 recruits ATG2B-WIPI4 to preautophagosomal membranes, a process essential for the expansion of the isolation membrane during autophagy (Stanga2019TRAPPC11). The interaction between TRAPPC11 and ATG2B-WIPI4 is dependent on ATG9A, as depletion of ATG9A disrupts this interaction (Stanga2019TRAPPC11).

TRAPPC11 also interacts with other TRAPP subunits, such as TRAPPC12, TRAPPC8, and TRAPPC2L. The interaction with TRAPPC2L is particularly significant, as a specific variant in TRAPPC11 can alter this interaction, leading to phenotypic similarities with TRAPPC2L-related conditions (Justel2023Expanding). The carboxy-terminus of TRAPPC11 is crucial for its interaction with ATG2B-WIPI4, facilitating their recruitment to isolation membranes during autophagy (Stanga2019TRAPPC11).

TRAPPC11's role in autophagy is further supported by its involvement in the recruitment of ATG2B-WIPI4, which is crucial for the formation and expansion of isolation membranes, and its interaction with ATG9-containing vesicles (Stanga2019TRAPPC11).
