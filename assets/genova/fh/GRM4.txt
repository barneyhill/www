# GRM4

## Overview
The GRM4 gene encodes the glutamate metabotropic receptor 4 (mGlu4), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in modulating neurotransmission within the central nervous system (CNS) (Volpi2018Opportunities). As a member of the metabotropic glutamate receptor family, mGlu4 is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure and functions primarily as an autoreceptor or heteroceptor to inhibit neurotransmitter release, thereby influencing synaptic activity and neuronal communication (Suh2018Metabotropic). The receptor is involved in various physiological processes, including motor control, learning, and emotional regulation, and has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy and major depressive disorder (Volpi2018Opportunities; Muhle2010Role). Additionally, mGlu4's expression in immune cells suggests a role in immune regulation, while its potential tumor suppressor function in certain cancers highlights its broader biological significance (Volpi2018Opportunities; Xiao2019Glutamate).

## Structure
The GRM4 gene encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGlu4), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane (7-TM) domain structure (Volpi2018Opportunities). The receptor's primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein, which includes an extracellular N-terminal domain, a 7-TM domain, and an intracellular C-terminal domain (Suh2018Metabotropic). The N-terminal domain contains a 'venus fly trap' (VFT) domain, composed of two lobes made of α-helices surrounding a large β-sheet, which undergoes conformational changes upon ligand binding (Volpi2018Opportunities).

The mGlu4 receptor forms homodimers stabilized by an inter-subunit disulfide bridge, essential for receptor activation (Volpi2018Opportunities). It can also form heterodimers with other group II receptors, such as mGlu2 (Volpi2018Opportunities). The receptor's C-terminal domain is intrinsically disordered but can adopt ordered conformations upon interaction with binding partners, which is significant for protein-protein interactions (Enz2012Metabotropic).

A single splicing variant, mGlu4b, has been identified, featuring a longer and different C-terminal domain compared to the canonical mGlu4, although its functional coupling and pharmacology are similar (Volpi2018Opportunities). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which plays a role in receptor signaling and trafficking (Suh2018Metabotropic).

## Function
The GRM4 gene encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGlu4), a G-protein-coupled receptor primarily involved in modulating neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS). mGlu4 is predominantly expressed in presynaptic terminals, where it functions as an autoreceptor or heteroceptor to inhibit the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This inhibition is achieved through the suppression of adenylyl cyclase and presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, as well as the activation of potassium channels, leading to reduced excitatory neurotransmission (Volpi2018Opportunities).

mGlu4 is involved in various physiological processes, including motor function, spatial information processing, and modulation of anxiety and addiction behaviors. In the cerebellum, it is essential for normal motor function, while in the hippocampus, it plays a role in spatial learning. In the basal ganglia, mGlu4 modulates synaptic activity, and its activation has been shown to alleviate motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease models by inhibiting GABA release (Volpi2018Opportunities).

Outside the CNS, mGlu4 is expressed in immune cells, where it promotes immunosuppressive cytokine secretion and upregulates the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 enzyme, contributing to immune regulation and tolerance (Volpi2018Opportunities).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GRM4 gene, which encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 4, have been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. In idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE), particularly in subtypes such as childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), significant associations have been found with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the GRM4 gene. These findings suggest that GRM4 polymorphisms may contribute to the genetic susceptibility to these epilepsy syndromes (Muhle2010Role). 

In the context of major depressive disorder (MDD), a variant in the 3' UTR of the GRM4 gene, rs2229901, has been associated with an increased risk of the disorder. This variant may disrupt the binding of miR-1202, potentially affecting GRM4 expression and contributing to the pathogenesis of MDD (Dadkhah2017A).

In breast cancer, GRM4 expression is associated with better prognosis. Overexpression of GRM4 inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role. The regulation of GRM4 by miR-328-3p and miR-370-3p further highlights its significance in cancer biology (Xiao2019Glutamate).

## Interactions
GRM4, or glutamate metabotropic receptor 4, is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In osteosarcoma cells, GRM4 interacts notably with CBX4, a member of the Polycomb group proteins. This interaction is crucial as it regulates the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α, a transcription factor involved in the expression of genes like VEGFA and PDK1. The interaction between GRM4 and CBX4 affects the cellular localization of CBX4, reducing its presence in the nucleus and thereby weakening HIF-1α's transcriptional activity (Zhang2020GRM4).

The study by Zhang et al. also identified other potential interaction targets of GRM4 using protein interaction databases, including PIAS1, PIAS3, UBE2I, and CAMK2A. However, the interaction with CBX4 was confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments, highlighting its significance in the GRM4/CBX4/HIF-1α signaling pathway (Zhang2020GRM4).

GRM4's interaction with CBX4 suggests a regulatory mechanism in osteosarcoma cells that inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This interaction can be modulated by allosteric effectors, such as VU0364439, which further inhibit the expression of VEGFA and PDK1, reducing the malignant behavior of osteosarcoma cells (Zhang2020GRM4).
