# XPO7

## Overview
XPO7 is a gene that encodes the protein exportin 7, which is a member of the karyopherin family involved in the nuclear export of proteins. Exportin 7 plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, erythroid cell differentiation, and tumor suppression. It facilitates the nuclear export of specific transcription factors and histones, thereby influencing gene expression and chromatin dynamics. In the context of cancer biology, XPO7 functions as a tumor suppressor by modulating oncogene-induced senescence, particularly through the p21^CIP1 pathway. Alterations in the expression or function of XPO7 have been associated with several cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Markiewicz2021Xpo7; CáceresGorriti2014RAN; Innes2021XPO7).

## Function
XPO7 (exportin 7) is a nuclear export protein involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in the regulation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway by mediating the nuclear export of Gli2, a transcription factor. This export is essential for maintaining the balance between activator and repressor forms of Gli proteins, which is crucial for the precise regulation of Hh target gene expression. The interaction between XPO7 and Gli2 is enhanced by the presence of SuFu, a negative regulator of Hh signaling, helping to maintain the pathway in an 'OFF' state when inactive (Markiewicz2021Xpo7).

In erythroid cells, XPO7 is vital for nuclear maturation during terminal differentiation. It facilitates the export of nuclear proteins, including histones H2A and H3, from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which is necessary for chromatin condensation and enucleation. Knockdown of XPO7 disrupts these processes, leading to impaired nuclear maturation, although it does not affect other erythroid functions like hemoglobin production (Hattangadi2014Histones).

XPO7 also functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating oncogene-induced senescence through the mediation of p21 CIP1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Its depletion can lead to reduced senescence and increased tumor formation, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular senescence and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Innes2021XPO7).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the XPO7 gene, including mutations and changes in expression levels, have been linked to various cancers. XPO7 is identified as a tumor suppressor that regulates oncogene-induced senescence through the p21 CIP1 pathway. Loss or reduced expression of XPO7 is associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as prostate adenocarcinomas, colon adenocarcinomas, and liver hepatocellular carcinomas. In these cancers, XPO7 deletions correlate with worse progression-free and overall survival (Innes2021XPO7). In colon adenocarcinoma, XPO7 alterations, including deep deletions, are linked to lower overall survival rates (Kalia2024Comprehensive).

In serous epithelial ovarian cancer, high cytoplasmic expression of XPO7 is associated with poor patient outcomes. This suggests that deregulation of XPO7 contributes to tumor progression and poor survival (CáceresGorriti2014RAN). The study indicates that XPO7, as part of the RAN network, may serve as a prognostic biomarker in this cancer type (CáceresGorriti2014RAN).

These findings highlight the potential of XPO7 as a therapeutic target, especially in tumors with deletions or low expression levels, due to its role in tumor suppression and senescence regulation (Innes2021XPO7).

## Interactions
Exportin 7 (XPO7) is involved in several key interactions with proteins that regulate various cellular processes. XPO7 interacts with Gli2 and Gli3, transcription factors in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, facilitating their nuclear export. This interaction is enhanced by the presence of Suppressor of Fused (SuFu), a negative regulator of Hh signaling, which competes with importin β1/β2 for binding to Gli proteins and recruits transcriptional corepressors to Gli-occupied chromatin loci (Markiewicz2021Xpo7).

XPO7 also plays a role in erythroid nuclear maturation by exporting nuclear proteins, including histones H2A and H3, from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during terminal erythroid differentiation. This process is crucial for chromatin condensation and enucleation in erythroid cells (Hattangadi2014Histones).

In the context of cellular senescence, XPO7 interacts with the p53 pathway, specifically regulating p21^CIP1-dependent senescence. It influences the nuclear levels of TCF3, a transcription factor that regulates p21^CIP1 expression, suggesting a role in modulating senescence through post-transcriptional mechanisms (Innes2021XPO7). These interactions highlight XPO7's multifaceted role in cellular transport and regulation.
