# NDUFS4

## Overview
The NDUFS4 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S4, a critical component of mitochondrial complex I, which is part of the electron transport chain. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular energy production by facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, contributing to ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation. NDUFS4 is categorized as a mitochondrial protein and is essential for the proper assembly and stability of complex I. The protein's function is regulated by phosphorylation, which influences its import into mitochondria and integration into the complex. Mutations in the NDUFS4 gene can lead to complex I deficiencies, resulting in severe neurological disorders such as Leigh syndrome, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy homeostasis (Breuer2013Cellular; Johnson2016Deletion; Scacco2003Pathological).

## Structure
The NDUFS4 protein is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. It is an 18 kDa protein encoded by the NDUFS4 gene located on chromosome 5 (Papa2002The). The protein structure includes a mitochondrial targeting sequence, which is cleaved upon import into mitochondria, resulting in a mature form of 133 amino acids (Papa2002The).

Structurally, NDUFS4 features an N-terminal coil, a folded N-terminal domain with three β-strands and four short α-helices, an extended loop, and a C-terminal coil (Padavannil2022The). The N-terminal coil interacts with subunits NDUFS3 and NDUFA6, while the folded domain bridges NDUFS1 in the N-module and NDUFS3 in the Q-module (Padavannil2022The). The extended loop interacts with multiple subunits, including NDUFS1, NDUFS3, NDUFS8, NDUFS6, NDUFA9, NDUFA6, and NDUFA12 (Padavannil2022The). The C-terminal coil interacts with NDUFV1, NDUFV2, NDUFS1, and NDUFV3 (Padavannil2022The).

NDUFS4 contains a conserved phosphorylation site at Ser131, which is a target for protein kinase A (Rasmo2010Phosphorylation). This phosphorylation is significant for the protein's function and is associated with the import and maturation of the protein in mitochondria (Rasmo2010Phosphorylation). The absence of NDUFS4 leads to structural instability in complex I, affecting its assembly and function (Yin2023Structural).

## Function
The NDUFS4 gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is a crucial component of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. In healthy human cells, the NDUFS4 subunit is essential for the proper assembly and function of complex I, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. This process is vital for the generation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, as it contributes to the creation of a proton motive force across the mitochondrial inner membrane (Breuer2013Cellular; Scacco2003Pathological).

The NDUFS4 protein is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which enhances its import and incorporation into complex I, thereby supporting mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Breuer2013Cellular; Papa2002The). The NDUFS4 subunit is involved in the stability and activity of complex I, ensuring efficient electron transport and ATP production. Its proper function is critical for maintaining normal respiratory metabolism and cellular energy homeostasis (Breuer2013Cellular; Valsecchi2012Metabolic).

Mutations in the NDUFS4 gene can lead to complex I deficiency, resulting in impaired mitochondrial function and associated neurological disorders, highlighting the gene's importance in cellular and organismal health (Valsecchi2013Primary; Scacco2003Pathological).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFS4 gene are associated with Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder that typically manifests in early childhood. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as progressive encephalopathy, motor and intellectual retardation, dystonia, ataxia, and growth retardation, often leading to death by the age of three (Johnson2016Deletion). Patients with NDUFS4 mutations often present with hypotonia, developmental arrest or regression, ocular abnormalities, and apneic episodes, with brain lesions affecting the brain stem and basal ganglia (OrtigozaEscobar2016Ndufs4).

Biochemical investigations in affected individuals reveal lactic acid accumulation and deficiencies in respiratory chain complex I activity, particularly in muscle tissue (OrtigozaEscobar2016Ndufs4). Specific mutations, such as nonsense mutations and deletions, lead to defective assembly and function of complex I, resulting in reduced NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity (Scacco2003Pathological). These mutations can cause rapid degradation of the NDUFS4 transcript via nonsense-mediated decay, preventing proper protein expression and mitochondrial localization (Scacco2003Pathological).

The clinical significance of NDUFS4 mutations is underscored by their impact on mitochondrial energy production, which is crucial for tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain and muscles (Iuso2006Dysfunctions). Genetic testing is essential for diagnosing these metabolic disorders, as early detection can guide potential therapeutic strategies (Lombardo2014Identification).

## Interactions
NDUFS4, a subunit of Complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, participates in several critical protein interactions that influence its function and stability. It is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cPKA), which enhances its import into mitochondria and prevents its retrograde diffusion back into the cytosol. This phosphorylation is crucial for the accumulation of mature NDUFS4 within mitochondria, as demonstrated by the specific role of the Ser173 phosphorylation site (De2008cAMPdependent).

NDUFS4 also interacts with the cytosolic chaperone Hsp70, which assists in its import into mitochondria. The presence of cPKA increases the binding of NDUFS4 to Hsp70, suggesting that phosphorylation enhances this interaction, facilitating mitochondrial import (De2008cAMPdependent).

In the context of diabetic kidney disease, NDUFS4 interacts with cristae regulatory proteins such as STOML2. This interaction is essential for maintaining cristae integrity and mitochondrial dynamics. The N-terminal domain of STOML2 is particularly important for binding with NDUFS4, and this interaction is crucial for the proper assembly of respiratory supercomplexes and the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology (Mise2024NDUFS4).
