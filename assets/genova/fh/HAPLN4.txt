# HAPLN4

## Overview
HAPLN4, or hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 4, is a gene that encodes a member of the hyaluronan and proteoglycan link proteins family. The protein product of HAPLN4 is primarily associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the central nervous system, where it plays a critical role in stabilizing ECM structures by binding hyaluronic acid and proteoglycans. This protein is particularly important in the formation and maintenance of perineuronal nets (PNNs), which are specialized ECM structures that support synaptic stability and protect against neurodegeneration (Sucha2019The; Oohashi2015The). HAPLN4 is predominantly expressed in the adult mammalian brain and is involved in cellular communication and tissue integrity. Its expression is also noted in the human retina, suggesting a role in ocular tissue structure (Keenan2012Mapping). The protein's interactions within the ECM contribute to its function in enhancing cell motility and adhesion, particularly in glioma cells, although its membrane association in native brain tissue suggests a unique interaction profile distinct from its behavior in cultured cells (Sim2009Reduced).

## Structure
HAPLN4, a member of the hyaluronan and proteoglycan link proteins family, is characterized by a unique molecular structure. It contains a 10-amino acid glycine-rich insertion within its first hyaluronan (HA) binding domain, which may influence its HA binding activity. Additionally, HAPLN4 has a distinct 30-amino acid C-terminal sequence that is hydrophobic and rich in glycine, tryptophan, and proline. This sequence shows about 95% identity across human, bovine, rat, and mouse HAPLN4, indicating a conserved function (Sim2009Reduced).

The protein is predominantly expressed in the adult mammalian brain and is associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the central nervous system. HAPLN4 is secreted into the culture medium when overexpressed in glioma cell lines, but in its native form, it is strongly associated with brain membranes, although this association is peripheral and resistant to mild solubilization (Sim2009Reduced). Despite predictions of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, solubilization results suggest that HAPLN4 does not possess this feature in its native state (Sim2009Reduced). The protein's structure and interactions contribute to its role in increasing glioma cell motility, particularly on HA-coated surfaces (Sim2009Reduced).

## Function
HAPLN4, also known as hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 4, plays a crucial role in the stabilization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by binding hyaluronic acid and proteoglycans. This protein is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating cellular communication. HAPLN4 is involved in the formation and stabilization of perineuronal nets (PNNs), which are specialized ECM structures that surround certain neurons and are important for synaptic stability and protection against neurodegeneration (Sucha2019The; Oohashi2015The).

In the brain, HAPLN4 is co-expressed with brevican, a type of lectican, and is essential for the proper assembly of PNN structures, particularly in regions such as the brainstem and cerebellum (Oohashi2015The). The presence of HAPLN4 in the human retina has also been observed, where it is distributed throughout the neurosensory retina and Bruch's membrane, indicating its role in maintaining the structural integrity of ocular tissues (Keenan2012Mapping). The protein's activity is crucial for neuronal function and plasticity, as it helps regulate the micro-organization of PNNs, which are involved in synaptic physiology and memory formation (Oohashi2015The).

## Interactions
HAPLN4, a member of the hyaluronan and proteoglycan link proteins family, is involved in interactions within the extracellular matrix, particularly in the brain. It is known to interact with components such as hyaluronan (HA) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), including brevican, although these interactions do not appear to be strong or direct in glioma cells. In glioma cell lines, HAPLN4 is largely secreted into the culture medium and does not exhibit strong membrane association, suggesting that its interactions with brevican and HA are not sufficient to retain it on the cell surface (Sim2009Reduced). Despite this, HAPLN4 enhances cell adhesion and motility in glioma cells, indicating a role in modifying the extracellular matrix and influencing cell behavior, potentially through indirect interactions or signaling pathways (Sim2009Reduced).

In native brain tissue, HAPLN4 shows a strong peripheral association with cell membranes, which is resistant to mild solubilization methods unless detergents are used. This suggests a unique, HA-independent, and lectican-independent association with brain membranes, indicating that HAPLN4 may interact with other components of the extracellular matrix in a manner distinct from its behavior in glioma cells (Sim2009Reduced).
