# SSU72

## Overview
SSU72 is a gene that encodes the SSU72 homolog, a dual-specificity phosphatase involved in the regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription. The SSU72 protein plays a critical role in the dephosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, which is essential for the transitions between different stages of transcription, including initiation, elongation, and termination (Hwang2021Ssu72; Kim2022Mammalian). Additionally, SSU72 is involved in the 3'-end processing of pre-mRNA, sister chromatid cohesion, and telomere homeostasis, contributing to genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression (Hwang2021Ssu72). The protein's interactions with various cellular components, such as the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) complex and cohesin subunits, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Hwang2021Ssu72; He2003Functional). Alterations in SSU72 function have been linked to liver diseases and immune system dysregulation, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target (Hwang2021Ssu72; Lee2021Ssu72).

## Structure
The SSU72 protein, encoded by the SSU72 gene, is a dual-specificity phosphatase involved in RNA polymerase II transcription. Its primary structure consists of 206 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 23,469 Da (Sun1996Synthetic). The protein is characterized by a unique active site and a cysteine-X(5)-arginine (CX5R) signature motif typical of protein tyrosine phosphatases (Hwang2021Ssu72).

The secondary structure of SSU72 includes a central 5-stranded β-sheet (β1-β5) flanked by helices, with additional two-stranded antiparallel β-sheets (β2A and β2B) near the active site. The C-terminus features an extra helix (αG) and β-strand (β5) (Hwang2021Ssu72). The αD helix influences phosphopeptide binding, and the protein's N-terminus contains a zinc-binding motif, C-X2-C, crucial for its function (Sun1996Synthetic).

In terms of tertiary structure, SSU72 has a distinct backbone fold compared to other CTD phosphatases, with a deep groove separating 'cap' and 'core' domains, connected by flexible loops (Liu2020Diverse). The quaternary structure involves interactions with other proteins, such as symplekin, forming a complex that stabilizes the protein's active site (Xiang2010Crystal). The protein's phosphatase activity is enhanced by Pin1, which facilitates the trans-cis isomerization of the CTD phosphopeptide (Xiang2010Crystal).

## Function
The SSU72 gene encodes a dual-specific protein phosphatase that plays a critical role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the regulation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription by dephosphorylating the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII, specifically targeting Ser5 and Ser7 residues. This dephosphorylation is essential for the transitions between different stages of transcription, including initiation, elongation, and termination (Hwang2021Ssu72; Kim2022Mammalian). SSU72 is also involved in the 3'-end processing of pre-mRNA, facilitating cleavage and polyadenylation, which are crucial for mRNA maturation (Hwang2021Ssu72).

In addition to its role in transcription, SSU72 is important for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion during the cell cycle. It counteracts the hyperphosphorylation of cohesin subunits, ensuring proper chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation (Hwang2021Ssu72; Kim2010The). SSU72 also contributes to telomere homeostasis by regulating lagging-strand DNA synthesis and facilitating the recruitment of telomere-associated proteins (Hwang2021Ssu72).

SSU72's activity is crucial for genomic stability, proper cell cycle progression, and liver function, as it regulates hepatic chromosome polyploidization during liver development (Hwang2021Ssu72).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the SSU72 gene, which encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase, have been implicated in various diseases. In the liver, the loss of SSU72 activity can lead to increased polyploid hepatocytes due to excessive endoreplication cycles, contributing to liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), fibrosis, and steatohepatitis (NASH) (Hwang2021Ssu72). SSU72 deficiency in hepatocytes results in symptoms like fat storage, necrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration, and is associated with the activation of hepatic stellate cells, a primary cause of liver fibrosis (Hwang2021Ssu72).

In the immune system, SSU72 plays a crucial role in T-cell receptor signaling and the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Its deficiency impairs Treg function, leading to increased inflammatory responses and susceptibility to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Lee2021Ssu72). SSU72 deficiency is linked to impaired Foxp3 induction, crucial for Treg differentiation, and results in increased production of effector cytokines IL-2 and IFNγ, contributing to immune dysregulation (Lee2021Ssu72). These findings suggest that SSU72 is a potential therapeutic target for preventing liver and autoimmune diseases.

## Interactions
The SSU72 protein is involved in various interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in transcription and mRNA processing. SSU72 is a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) complex, where it interacts with subunits such as Pta1, Cft1, Cft2, and Brr5. It has a strong interaction with the Pta1 subunit, which is essential for its function in mRNA 3' end processing (Hwang2021Ssu72; He2003Functional). SSU72 also interacts with the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) subunits, particularly Rpb2, and is involved in transcription initiation mediated by TFIIB (Hwang2021Ssu72; He2003Functional).

In addition to its role in transcription, SSU72 interacts with the nuclear exosome component Rrp6, which is involved in degrading non-coding RNAs (Hwang2021Ssu72). It also forms part of the Tat complex in HIV-1, interacting with the Tat protein and potentially influencing the Tat:P-TEFb complex (Chen2014A). SSU72's interactions extend to cohesin subunits like RAD21 and SA2, where it regulates sister chromatid cohesion by counteracting their phosphorylation (Hwang2021Ssu72; Kim2013Functional).
