# ZNF157

## Overview
ZNF157 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 157, a member of the KRAB-Zinc Finger Protein (KRAB-ZFP) family, which is known for its role in transcriptional repression and chromatin modification. The protein is characterized by the presence of a KRAB domain, which facilitates interactions with the corepressor KAP-1, leading to the recruitment of chromatin-remodeling factors and subsequent gene silencing (Lupo2013KRAB-Zinc). ZNF157 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a critical role in regulating gene expression patterns and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is particularly significant in the context of pluripotent stem cells, where it is upregulated to help maintain pluripotency and self-renewal by repressing pro-differentiation genes (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28). Additionally, ZNF157 is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function as a transcriptional regulator, with implications in processes such as cell differentiation and development (Oliver2012The; Agata1999Two).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF157 is a member of the KRAB-Zinc Finger Protein (KRAB-ZFP) family, which are transcriptional repressors involved in various cellular processes. These proteins are characterized by a KRAB domain that interacts with the corepressor KAP-1, recruiting chromatin-remodeling factors to modify chromatin and silence gene expression (Lupo2013KRAB-Zinc). ZNF157, like other KRAB-ZFPs, plays a role in transcriptional repression, chromatin modification, and epigenetic regulation, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression patterns (Lupo2013KRAB-Zinc).

In the context of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), ZNF157 is significantly upregulated in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) compared to fibroblasts, suggesting its involvement in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal capabilities. This upregulation is associated with the epigenetic repression of pro-differentiation genes, indicating that ZNF157 may help preserve the undifferentiated state of stem cells (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28).

ZNF157 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences chromatin structure and gene expression patterns. Its activity is crucial for processes such as cell differentiation and development, highlighting its importance in the regulation of cellular functions and organismal development (Lupo2013KRAB-Zinc).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF157, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions that influence its function as a transcriptional regulator. It is part of the KRAB domain-containing zinc finger protein family, which typically interacts with the corepressor KAP1 (also known as TIF1β or KRIP-1) to mediate transcriptional repression. This interaction is crucial for the repression activity of KRAB domain proteins, as KAP1 acts as a scaffold for recruiting other chromatin-modifying proteins, thereby facilitating the formation of heterochromatin and silencing gene expression (Agata1999Two).

In the context of mammary gland development, Zfp157, the mouse homolog of ZNF157, interacts with several key proteins. It is regulated by Stat6 and Gata-3, which suppress its expression to promote alveologenesis. Zfp157 also interacts with pStat5, acting as a repressor to control cell proliferation and differentiation within the mammary gland (Oliver2012The). The deletion of Zfp157 leads to increased expression of Id2, a protein essential for alveologenesis, suggesting that Zfp157 indirectly influences Id2 expression through its regulatory network (Oliver2012The). These interactions highlight the role of ZNF157 in maintaining cellular balance and its potential implications in breast cancer prognosis (Oliver2012The).
