# ENOX1

## Overview
ENOX1 is a gene that encodes the protein ecto-NOX disulfide-thiol exchanger 1, which is involved in critical cellular processes such as redox homeostasis and cell growth regulation. The protein functions as a NADH oxidase and is primarily active on the cell surface, facilitating electron transfer across the plasma membrane. This activity is essential for maintaining intracellular redox balance and supporting normal cell proliferation (HUANG2019Increased). ENOX1 is expressed in various cell types, including endothelial cells, and plays a significant role in plasma membrane electron transport pathways, which are crucial for cellular defense mechanisms and the regulation of cell growth and survival. The protein's activity is modulated by hormones and growth factors, indicating its responsiveness to external cellular signals (HUANG2019Increased). Additionally, ENOX1 is implicated in angiogenesis, as its inhibition can suppress endothelial cell migration and tubule formation, highlighting its importance in vascular development and cytoskeletal reorganization (HUANG2019Increased).

## Structure
ENOX1, or ecto-NOX disulfide-thiol exchanger 1, is a protein involved in redox reactions, characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes various domains essential for its enzymatic activity. The protein's structure is influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can alter its function and localization. ENOX1 is known to exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can lead to variations in its functional properties and cellular distribution.

The protein's domains are integral to its role in catalyzing redox reactions, although specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context. The presence of different isoforms suggests that the protein may adopt distinct conformations, potentially affecting its interaction with other cellular components and its overall activity. The structural diversity resulting from alternative splicing highlights the protein's adaptability and its potential involvement in various cellular processes. The exact nature of these isoforms and their specific structural characteristics remain areas for further research.

## Function
ENOX1, also known as ecto-NOX disulfide-thiol exchanger 1, is a protein involved in essential cellular processes, including redox homeostasis and cell growth regulation. It functions as a NADH oxidase and is active on the cell surface, where it facilitates electron transfer across the plasma membrane. This activity is crucial for maintaining intracellular redox balance and supporting normal cell proliferation (HUANG2019Increased).

ENOX1 is expressed in various cell types, including endothelial cells, and is involved in plasma membrane electron transport pathways. These pathways are vital for cellular defense mechanisms and the control of cell growth and survival. ENOX1's activity is modulated by hormones and growth factors, indicating its role in responding to external cellular signals (HUANG2019Increased).

The protein also plays a role in angiogenesis, as its inhibition can suppress endothelial cell migration and tubule formation. This suggests that ENOX1 is important for vascular development and the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell movement and structure (HUANG2019Increased). ENOX1's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
ENOX1, a copper-binding protein with NADH oxidase activity, plays a significant role in angiogenesis and has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. In bladder cancer, ENOX1 is part of a signature of prognosis-associated RNA binding proteins. Its inhibition has been shown to reduce endothelial cell migration and tubular structure formation, suggesting that targeting ENOX1 could be a viable strategy for tumor control and improving radiotherapeutic efficacy (Wu2021Identification).

In the context of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), genetic variance in ENOX1 expression may influence susceptibility to cigarette smoke-induced damage and the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). This suggests a role for ENOX1 in the pathophysiology of COPD, particularly in relation to apoptosis and DNA damage responses (Pouwels2017Genetic).

In prostate cancer, ENOX1 has been identified as one of the genes with recurrent chromosomal breakage, although such rearrangements are rare. These findings indicate that ENOX1 may be involved in chromosomal rearrangements that could lead to cancer-specific therapy targets (KLUTH2015Prevalence).

In APOL1-associated nephropathy, ENOX1 shows a trend towards interaction with APOL1 risk variants, suggesting a potential role in modulating the risk of end-stage kidney disease (Divers2013Gene–gene).
