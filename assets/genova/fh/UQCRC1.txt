# UQCRC1

## Overview
UQCRC1 is a gene that encodes the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 1, a critical component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III, also known as the cytochrome bc1 complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, which is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. As a core protein, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 1 is integral to maintaining the structural integrity and function of complex III, contributing to cellular energy metabolism and the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Shan2019Critical; Chen2020Inhibition). The gene's expression is crucial for normal cellular function and survival, with implications for brain health and protection against oxidative stress (Shan2019Critical). Mutations in UQCRC1 have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis (Lin2020Mitochondrial).

## Structure
UQCRC1, or ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 1, is a subunit of mitochondrial complex III, also known as the cytochrome bc1 complex. This protein is integral to the electron transport chain, playing a crucial role in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis. UQCRC1 is part of a bilobed structure with a hollow inner core that is exposed to the mitochondrial matrix, contributing to the complex's overall architecture (Unni2019Tryptophan).

The primary structure of UQCRC1 includes conserved amino acid residues, such as Trp395, which is susceptible to oxidative modifications. Oxidation of this residue can lead to significant structural changes, affecting the protein's function and interactions within the complex (Unni2019Tryptophan). The secondary structure of UQCRC1 includes a helix-loop-helix motif, which is important for its stability and interaction with other subunits (Unni2019Tryptophan).

In terms of quaternary structure, UQCRC1 interacts with several other subunits, including UQCRC2, CYC1, UQCRFS1, UQCRQ, and UQCR11, forming a stable assembly essential for the function of complex III (Unni2019Tryptophan). Post-translational modifications, such as tryptophan oxidation, can alter these interactions, impacting the electron transfer and enzyme activity of the complex (Unni2019Tryptophan).

## Function
UQCRC1 encodes a core protein of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex, also known as Complex III, which is a crucial component of the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein facilitates the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, a process essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Shan2019Critical; Chen2020Inhibition). UQCRC1 is involved in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and energy metabolism, which are vital for normal cellular function and survival (Shan2019Critical).

In healthy human cells, UQCRC1 plays a protective role by maintaining mitochondrial function and preventing cell death through pyroptosis, particularly under conditions of oxidative stress. It helps regulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which, if uncontrolled, can lead to cellular damage (Chen2020Inhibition). The protein is expressed in various cell types, including neurons and astrocytes, indicating its importance in brain health and function (Shan2019Critical).

Overall, UQCRC1 is essential for the proper assembly and integrity of Complex III, contributing to the maintenance of cellular energy balance and reducing oxidative stress, which are crucial for cell survival and function (Shan2019Critical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UQCRC1 gene, which encodes a core protein of mitochondrial complex III, have been linked to autosomal dominant parkinsonism with polyneuropathy. The p.Tyr314Ser mutation is particularly associated with this condition, leading to dopaminergic system dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced striatal dopamine levels and loss of nigral TH-positive neurons in knock-in mouse models. These mice also exhibit peripheral neuropathy, characterized by reduced compound muscle action potentials and nerve conduction velocities (Lin2020Mitochondrial). 

In Drosophila models, the p.Tyr314Ser mutation causes age-dependent locomotor defects and dopaminergic neuron loss, indicating a conserved function of UQCRC1 across species (Lin2020Mitochondrial). The mutation also results in abnormal mitochondrial morphology and reduced complex III activity, suggesting disrupted mitochondrial function (Lin2020Mitochondrial). 

Functional studies using CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in models have shown that UQCRC1 mutations lead to shortened neurites, impaired neurite morphogenesis, decreased maximal respiration activity, and increased reactive oxygen species production, contributing to neurodegenerative processes (Lin2020Mitochondrial). These findings underscore the clinical significance of UQCRC1 mutations in contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease.

## Interactions
UQCRC1, a core protein of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III, interacts with several other subunits within this complex to facilitate its function. It forms a stable complex with UQCRC2 through extensive hydrophilic interactions, although these interactions are reduced in the oxidized form (Unni2019Tryptophan). UQCRC1 also interacts with CYC1, where oxidation leads to a decrease in hydrogen bonds, affecting the stability of the interaction (Unni2019Tryptophan). 

The protein interacts with UQCRFS1, with increased hydrogen bonding in the oxidized form, suggesting enhanced stability (Unni2019Tryptophan). UQCRQ shows similar increased hydrogen bonding with UQCRC1 in the oxidized state (Unni2019Tryptophan). UQCR10 and UQCR11 also interact with UQCRC1, with UQCR10 showing decreased stability in the oxidized form, while UQCR11 exhibits increased hydrogen bonding post-oxidation (Unni2019Tryptophan). 

These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of complex III, impacting electron transfer and enzyme activity. The oxidation of tryptophan residue Trp395 in UQCRC1 can lead to significant structural changes, affecting its interactions with other subunits and potentially altering the overall function of the complex (Unni2019Tryptophan).
