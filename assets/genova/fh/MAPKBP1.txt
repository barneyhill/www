# MAPKBP1

## Overview
MAPKBP1 is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase binding protein 1, also known as JNKBP1. This protein functions primarily as a scaffolding protein within cellular signaling pathways, particularly those involving the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. It plays a critical role in mitosis by localizing to the mitotic spindle poles and interacting with proteins such as WDR62, which is essential for proper spindle orientation and cell division (Macia2017Mutations). Structurally, MAPKBP1 is characterized by WD repeats and a JNK-binding domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins, including members of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase family (Macia2017Mutations). Although MAPKBP1 is not involved in ciliogenesis, mutations in this gene have been linked to nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies, highlighting its clinical significance in kidney function and disease (Nigro2023Molecular; Rabie2023Ciliopathies).

## Structure
The MAPKBP1 protein, also known as JNKBP1, is characterized by its structural organization, which includes 12 WD repeats located at the N terminus. These repeats are involved in protein-protein interactions and contribute to the protein's stability and function (Macia2017Mutations). The C-terminal region of MAPKBP1 contains a JNK-binding domain, spanning amino acids 1,063 to 1,331, which acts as a scaffolding site for JNK and other signaling pathways (Macia2017Mutations). This region is crucial for the protein's role in cellular signaling.

MAPKBP1 also features conserved coiled-coil domains at the C terminus, which are necessary for dimerization and interaction with its paralog, WDR62. This interaction is important for the protein's recruitment to mitotic spindle poles during cell division (Macia2017Mutations). Mutations affecting these domains can disrupt protein-protein interactions, leading to functional impairments (Schönauer2017SP004CHARACTERIZATION).

The protein is not involved in ciliogenesis, as demonstrated by experiments showing that mutations in MAPKBP1 do not affect cilia formation (Macia2017Mutations). The subcellular distribution of MAPKBP1 is primarily cytoplasmic, with no specific association with ciliary structures (Macia2017Mutations).

## Function
MAPKBP1, also known as JNKBP1, is a scaffolding protein involved in cellular signaling pathways, particularly those related to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. In healthy human cells, MAPKBP1 plays a crucial role in mitosis by localizing to the mitotic spindle poles, where it colocalizes with WDR62, a protein essential for mitotic spindle pole function (Macia2017Mutations). This localization is important for the orientation of the mitotic spindle, a critical process for accurate cell division (Macia2017Mutations).

MAPKBP1 acts as a scaffolding protein for c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and other signaling pathways, modulating their activity and influencing various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and stress responses (Macia2017Mutations). Despite its involvement in these pathways, MAPKBP1 does not associate with cilia or basal bodies, and mutations in this gene do not impact ciliogenesis, indicating its functions are independent of ciliary processes (Macia2017Mutations).

In addition to its role in mitosis, MAPKBP1 is implicated in the DNA damage response (DDR) signaling. Mutations in MAPKBP1 have been associated with increased DDR signaling, suggesting a potential role in maintaining genomic stability, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Macia2017Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAPKBP1 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies, which are a group of genetic disorders affecting kidney function. Nephronophthisis is an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease that progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is caused by variants in numerous genes, including MAPKBP1. These variants disrupt the function of primary cilia, basal body, and centrosome, leading to renal disease and extrarenal manifestations (Rabie2023Ciliopathies).

In a study of Italian patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD), a homozygous pathogenic variant in MAPKBP1 was identified, highlighting the gene's role in the genetic complexity of PKD. The study noted that truncating mutations in MAPKBP1 are predicted to be pathogenic, significantly affecting protein structure and function, and are associated with a more severe phenotype of the disease (Nigro2023Molecular).

MAPKBP1 is also involved in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, where it acts as a scaffold protein. Alterations in its interactions, such as dimerization with WDR62, may influence cellular responses to extracellular signals, potentially contributing to other diseases (CohenKatsenelson2013Identification).

## Interactions
MAPKBP1, also known as JNKBP1, is a scaffolding protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular signaling pathways. It is known to interact with WDR62, a protein involved in mitotic spindle pole function. This interaction is facilitated by the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of MAPKBP1, which is crucial for forming homodimers and heterodimers with WDR62 (CohenKatsenelson2013Identification; Macia2017Mutations). The interaction between MAPKBP1 and WDR62 has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that the last coiled-coil domain of MAPKBP1 is essential for this interaction (Macia2017Mutations).

MAPKBP1 also interacts with JNK2, a member of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase family. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal domain of MAPKBP1, which binds to JNK family members (Macia2017Mutations). Certain mutations in MAPKBP1, such as p.Gln943*, result in the loss of the JNK binding site, while the p.Arg1465* mutation decreases the interaction with JNK2 (Macia2017Mutations). Despite these mutations, there is no significant change in JNK signaling in cells with MAPKBP1 knockdown, suggesting that MAPKBP1's role in JNK signaling may be complex and context-dependent (Macia2017Mutations).
