# STAMBP

## Overview
STAMBP, or signal transducing adaptor molecule binding protein, is a gene that encodes the STAM binding protein, a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by its metalloprotease activity, which distinguishes it from other deubiquitinases, and is crucial for regulating endosomal sorting and trafficking. It plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating signal transduction pathways and immune responses. STAMBP interacts with components of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery and is involved in the regulation of inflammasome activity, highlighting its importance in both cellular signaling and immune regulation. Mutations in the STAMBP gene are linked to microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome, a severe developmental disorder, underscoring its clinical significance (Hu2022Novel; Bednash2017Targeting; Guo2021Structural).

## Structure
STAMBP, or STAM binding protein, is characterized by its distinct domain architecture, which includes an N-terminal microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain, a central SH3-binding motif (SBM), and a C-terminal catalytic JAMM domain. The MIT domain is involved in interactions with microtubules, playing a role in endosomal sorting and trafficking processes. The SH3-binding motif facilitates protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways (Guo2021Structural).

The JAMM domain of STAMBP is a metalloprotease, distinguishing it from other deubiquitinases that are typically cysteine proteases. This domain is essential for its deubiquitinating activity, which involves the removal of ubiquitin from substrate proteins, thereby regulating their degradation and function (Guo2021Structural). The JAMM domain's structure includes specific insertions, ins-1 and ins-2, which contribute to its substrate specificity, particularly towards K63-linked polyubiquitin chains (Guo2021Structural).

The protein's tertiary structure is stabilized by interactions within these domains, and its quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. Post-translational modifications and splice variants may influence STAMBP's function and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
STAMBP, also known as the STAM-binding protein, is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating endosomal sorting and trafficking in healthy human cells. It functions by removing ubiquitin from proteins, preventing their degradation in lysosomes, and is active in the cytoplasm, particularly within endosomes (Hori2018A; Hu2022Novel). This activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating signal transduction pathways, such as the RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways, which are important for cellular processes like proliferation and apoptosis (Hu2022Novel).

STAMBP is involved in the regulation of the NALP7 inflammasome, a component of the innate immune response. It deubiquitinates NALP7, preventing its degradation and facilitating its trafficking through the endolysosomal system, which is crucial for the activation of the inflammasome and the maturation of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 (Bednash2017Targeting). By modulating the ubiquitination of the NLRP3 inflammasome, STAMBP helps maintain a balance in immune responses, preventing excessive inflammation during endotoxin stress (Bednash2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STAMBP gene are associated with microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome (MICCAP), a severe developmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay, progressive microcephaly, intractable epilepsy, and generalized capillary malformations on the skin (Hori2018A; Hu2022Novel). The condition is linked to both homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in the STAMBP gene, which can lead to protein instability and reduced expression (Hori2018A). These mutations disrupt normal cellular processes, such as endocytosis and protein degradation, contributing to the clinical manifestations of the syndrome (Guo2021Structural).

A specific novel compound heterozygous mutation, including a missense mutation (p.G307E), has been identified in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, leading to impaired neural stem cell proliferation and reduced cortical organoid size (Hu2022Novel). This mutation negatively impacts the STAMBP protein's function, particularly in its ability to bind ubiquitinated proteins, which is crucial for normal cellular signaling pathways (Hu2022Novel).

Alterations in STAMBP expression can also affect immune responses. STAMBP knockout cells exhibit a hyperinflammatory phenotype, characterized by increased cytokine and chemokine expression, suggesting its role in maintaining immune homeostasis (Bednash2021The).

## Interactions
STAMBP (STAM binding protein) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with components of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, specifically STAM1 and STAM2, which are important for endocytosis and endosomal-lysosomal sorting. This interaction facilitates the deubiquitination and rescue of ubiquitinated cargo proteins from lysosomal degradation (Guo2021Structural).

STAMBP also plays a role in the regulation of inflammasome activity. It interacts with NLRP7, stabilizing it by removing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which prevents its degradation and modulates inflammasome activity. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of cytokine release, such as IL-1β, in response to inflammatory stimuli (Gangoda2020Deubiquitinase; Bednash2017Targeting).

In melanoma cells, STAMBP interacts with the SLUG protein, stabilizing it and thereby enhancing melanoma cell migration and invasion. This interaction is significant for maintaining the metastatic potential of melanoma cells (Iwakami2018STAMbinding).

These interactions highlight STAMBP's role in various cellular pathways, including protein degradation, immune response regulation, and cancer metastasis.
