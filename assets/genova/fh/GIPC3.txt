# GIPC3

## Overview
GIPC3 is a gene that encodes the protein GIPC PDZ domain containing family member 3, which is a member of the GIPC family of adaptor proteins. This protein is characterized by the presence of a PDZ domain, which is crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions involved in intracellular signaling and trafficking. GIPC3 plays a significant role in the auditory system, particularly in the regulation of vesicle transport and the maintenance of hair cells in the inner ear. It interacts with myosin VI and is involved in the mechanical-electrical conversion process in hair cells, influencing neurotransmitter release and auditory nerve function. Mutations in the GIPC3 gene are linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, highlighting its importance in auditory function and sensory perception (Li2023A; Charizopoulou2011Gipc3).

## Structure
The GIPC3 protein from Schistosoma japonicum (SjGIPC3) is characterized by a single PDZ domain, which is a key protein-protein interaction module. This domain is located in the middle region of the protein and is conserved among trematode orthologues, forming a distinct cluster separate from other phyla (Mu2012Molecular). The PDZ domain of SjGIPC3 consists of two α-helices and five β-sheets, with a hydrophobic pocket formed between βB and αB, which is crucial for ligand binding (Mu2012Molecular). The 'GLGF' motif, common in GIPC proteins, is replaced by 'SFGL' in SjGIPC3, potentially affecting ligand binding specificity (Mu2012Molecular).

The GIPC family, which includes GIPC3, also features GH1 and GH2 domains flanking the PDZ domain. These domains are unique to the GIPC family and contribute to oligomerization and interaction with myosin VI (Shang2017Structure). The GH1 domain adopts an ubiquitin-like fold, while the GH2 domain forms a four-helix globular fold (Shang2017Structure). The structural analyses suggest that GIPC3 may form domain-swapped dimers similar to GIPC1, which stabilizes the protein structure and influences its interactions (Shang2017Structure). However, specific details on the primary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of GIPC3 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The GIPC3 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the auditory system. The GIPC3 protein contains a PDZ domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions crucial for intracellular trafficking and signal transduction. In healthy human cells, GIPC3 is involved in the regulation of vesicle transport and is part of the G protein-coupled signaling complex. It interacts with myosin VI (MYO6), which is essential for the trafficking of transmembrane proteins on endocytic vesicles, playing a critical role in hair cell formation and maintenance in the inner ear (Li2023A).

GIPC3 is active in various cellular locations, including the cytoplasm and cell membrane, and is implicated in auditory function and sensory perception. It is involved in the mechanical-electrical conversion process in hair cells, affecting the distribution and function of calcium channels at the ribbon synapses of inner hair cells. This influences neurotransmitter release and auditory nerve firing thresholds, which are essential for sound perception (Li2023A). The protein is also suggested to be part of a protein complex involved in vesicle trafficking, crucial for signal acquisition and propagation in cochlear hair cells (Charizopoulou2011Gipc3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GIPC3 gene are associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL), a condition characterized by sensorineural hearing impairment without other syndromic features. These mutations can lead to progressive sensorineural hearing loss, as observed in both humans and animal models. In humans, specific mutations in GIPC3 have been linked to hearing loss types DFNB15, DFNB72, and DFNB95, which are characterized by progressive hearing impairment (Katoh2013Functional; Li2023A). 

In animal studies, mutations in the Gipc3 gene in Black Swiss mice result in progressive sensorineural hearing loss and increased susceptibility to audiogenic seizures. These mice exhibit defects in the stereocilia bundles of sensory hair cells and degeneration of the organ of Corti, leading to impaired auditory function (Li2023A; Charizopoulou2011Gipc3). The presence of a transgene can rescue these phenotypes, indicating a potential therapeutic approach (Charizopoulou2011Gipc3).

GIPC3 mutations may also affect mitochondrial function and mitophagy, potentially contributing to hearing loss by impairing interactions with proteins involved in mitochondrial fission (Li2023A). These findings underscore the critical role of GIPC3 in maintaining normal auditory processes and its involvement in hereditary deafness.

## Interactions
GIPC3, a member of the GIPC family of adaptor proteins, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. GIPC3 interacts with the PLXND1 receptor, a relationship that is part of a conserved mechanism among GIPC family members, including GIPC1 and GIPC2. This interaction is significant in modulating PLXND1 signaling during vascular development, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (CarreteroOrtega2019GIPC). GIPC3 also plays a role in the formation of clathrin-coated pits and the clustering of ligand-bound cell surface receptors, which is essential for endocytosis and intracellular transport (Shang2017Structure).

The interaction between GIPC3 and myosin VI is another critical aspect of its function. GIPC3, like other GIPC proteins, interacts with myosin VI through distinct interfaces, contributing to the oligomerization of the GIPC/myosin VI complex. This interaction is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of stereocilia in the inner ear, and mutations in GIPC3 can lead to familial hearing loss (Katoh2013Functional; Shang2017Structure). These interactions highlight the role of GIPC3 in cellular signaling and structural maintenance.
