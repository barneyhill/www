# NDUFA5

## Overview
NDUFA5 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A5, an accessory component of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein is integral to the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, which is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. NDUFA5 is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is part of the iron-sulfur protein fraction, playing a critical role in the assembly and stability of complex I. The gene is situated on chromosome 7 and is regulated by factors such as miR-33a, which can modulate its expression and, consequently, mitochondrial function (Tensing1999Genomic; Nie2018Hepatocyte). As a member of the LYRM protein family, NDUFA5 is characterized by a three-helix bundle fold, contributing to its interactions with other complex I subunits and assembly factors (Pei2021Human). Alterations in NDUFA5 expression have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and related diseases, underscoring its clinical significance (Fassone2012Complex).

## Structure
The NDUFA5 protein is an accessory subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory complex I (CI), also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. It is composed of a short N-terminal coil, a three-helix bundle, and a long C-terminal coil. The N-terminal coil and three-helix bundle interact with core subunits NDUFS2, NDUFS3, and NDUFA7, while the three-helix bundle also interacts with NDUFA10 in a state-dependent manner. The C-terminal loop interacts with NDUFS2, NDUFS3, and NDUFS4 (Padavannil2022The). NDUFA5 is identified as a distant member of the LYRM protein family, characterized by the presence of the LYR motif and a three-helix bundle fold (Pei2021Human).

NDUFA5 plays a crucial role in stabilizing interactions between NDUFS2 and NDUFS3 in eukaryotic CI, replacing similar interactions found in bacterial structures (Padavannil2022The). The gene encoding NDUFA5 is located on chromosome 7 and spans approximately 14 kb, comprising five exons. The protein coding region is 348 bp long, and the 3'UTR is 1088 bp (Tensing1999Genomic). The protein's expression is regulated by miR-33a, which can suppress NDUFA5 by binding to its 3′-UTR, affecting mitochondrial function (Nie2018Hepatocyte).

## Function
NDUFA5 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain. This enzyme complex facilitates the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, contributing to ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation, a vital process for cellular energy metabolism (Shimada2006Identification; Nie2018Hepatocyte). NDUFA5 is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is part of the iron-sulfur protein fraction of the enzyme complex, indicating its involvement in electron transfer processes (Shimada2006Identification).

In healthy human cells, NDUFA5 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production. It is involved in the assembly and stability of complex I, particularly as part of the Q-module, which is sensitive to changes in other subunits like NDUFS3 (D’Angelo2020Biogenesis). The proper function of NDUFA5 is critical for oxidative phosphorylation, and its activity is linked to the regulation of cellular stress responses and apoptosis (Shimada2006Identification). The gene's expression is responsive to various stimuli, including oxidants and ionizing radiation, highlighting its role in cellular defense mechanisms (Shimada2006Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NDUFA5 gene, a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, have been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction and related diseases. The study by Nie et al. highlights that miR-33a, a microRNA, can suppress NDUFA5 expression by binding to its 3′-UTR, leading to decreased mitochondrial function. This suppression is associated with conditions such as hepatosteatosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in the liver, particularly under high-fat diet conditions. The inhibition of miR-33a has been shown to restore NDUFA5 levels, improve mitochondrial function, and reduce liver damage markers, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for fatty liver disease (Nie2018Hepatocyte).

While the context does not provide specific diseases directly caused by mutations in NDUFA5, it is known that mitochondrial complex I deficiencies, which can involve various subunits including NDUFA5, are linked to a range of disorders. These include Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder, and other mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. However, the specific role of NDUFA5 mutations in these conditions is not detailed in the provided context (Fassone2012Complex).

## Interactions
NDUFA5 is an accessory subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain. It is involved in the assembly and function of complex I, interacting with various other subunits and assembly factors. NDUFA5 is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane and is part of the complex I subassembly process. It interacts with subunits such as NDUFS2, NDUFS3, NDUFS7, and NDUFS8 during the assembly of intermediate 3, facilitated by assembly factors like Ndufaf3 and Ndufaf4 (Mckenzie2010Assembly).

NDUFA5 is also identified as a distant member of the LYRM protein family, characterized by the presence of the LYR motif and a three-helix bundle fold. This structural similarity suggests potential interactions with other LYRM proteins, although specific partners are not detailed (Pei2021Human).

In ischemic heart failure, NDUFA5 expression is downregulated, which correlates with reduced complex I activity and increased reactive oxygen species production. This downregulation might be a protective response to oxidative stress, although this hypothesis requires further validation (Liu2014Mitochondrial).
