# ADAM32

## Overview
ADAM32 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 32 protein, a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease) family. This family of proteins is characterized by a multi-domain structure that includes a disintegrin domain, which is involved in cell adhesion processes, although ADAM32 itself lacks the metalloprotease activity due to the absence of the conserved histidines necessary for zinc binding (Choi2003Identification; Brocker2009Evolutionary). Predominantly expressed in the testis, ADAM32 is implicated in reproductive biology, particularly in sperm development and fertilization, although its precise function remains unclear (Choi2003Identification). Despite its expression pattern, studies in mice suggest that ADAM32 may be dispensable for fertility (Lee2020Normal). Additionally, ADAM32 has been associated with various cancers, including hepatoblastoma, where it is linked to tumor progression and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Fukazawa2022Oncogenic).

## Structure
ADAM32 is a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease) family, characterized by a multi-domain structure. The protein is composed of several domains typical of the ADAM family, including a signal sequence, prodomain, metalloprotease domain, disintegrin domain, cysteine-rich domain, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domain (Choi2003Identification). However, ADAM32 lacks the metalloprotease active site sequence necessary for protease activity, having a different sequence at the metalloprotease active site position (Choi2003Identification).

The disintegrin domain of ADAM32 contains a putative integrin-binding sequence, which suggests a role in cell adhesion (Choi2003Identification). The protein is homologous to ADAM2 and ADAM3, which are involved in sperm-egg interactions, indicating a potential role in fertilization (Choi2003Identification). ADAM32 is expressed predominantly in the testis, with low-level expression in the epididymis, brain, and heart (Choi2003Identification).

While the primary structure of ADAM32 is well-documented, specific details on its secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available literature (Choi2003Identification; EDWARDS2008The).

## Function
ADAM32 is a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease) family, which is involved in various cellular processes such as cell adhesion and protease activity. In humans, ADAM32 is predominantly expressed in the testis, suggesting a role in reproductive biology, particularly in sperm development or fertilization (Choi2003Identification). The protein is expressed during the meiotic prophase in pachytene spermatocytes, indicating its potential involvement in spermatogenesis (Choi2003Identification).

Despite its expression pattern, ADAM32 lacks the conserved histidines necessary for zinc binding, which are crucial for peptidase activity, suggesting that it may not function as a peptidase (Choi2003Identification; Brocker2009Evolutionary). Instead, ADAM32 might be involved in protein folding or protein-protein interactions, possibly through its integrin-binding sequence in the disintegrin domain (Choi2003Identification; Brocker2009Evolutionary).

In mice, studies have shown that the absence of ADAM32 does not affect male fertility, indicating that it may be dispensable for fertility and functionally independent of closely related ADAM proteins such as ADAM2 and ADAM3 (Lee2020Normal). However, the specific function of ADAM32 in healthy human cells remains unclear.

## Clinical Significance
ADAM32 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly hepatoblastoma (HBL), a rare liver cancer affecting children. The gene is highly expressed in HBL tissue samples and is associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types, including breast, ovarian, lung, and gastric cancers, although it correlates with better outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Fukazawa2022Oncogenic). In HBL, ADAM32 is involved in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to chemotherapy, suggesting its role in promoting tumor growth and progression (Fukazawa2022Oncogenic). Knockdown experiments in HBL cell lines have shown that reducing ADAM32 expression decreases cell viability and increases apoptosis, indicating its anti-apoptotic function (Fukazawa2022Oncogenic).

The gene's expression is notably higher in embryonal and fetal subtypes of HBL compared to normal liver tissue, and its expression is linked to a gain of chromosome 8 in HBL cases, a feature not observed in HCC (Fukazawa2022Oncogenic). ADAM32's role in cancer is further supported by its involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as its expression influences EMT-related genes, enhancing cell migration and invasion capabilities (Fukazawa2022Oncogenic). These findings suggest that ADAM32 could be a promising target for therapeutic intervention in HBL and potentially other cancers.

## Interactions
ADAM32 is a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family, which is involved in various biological processes, including cell adhesion and proteolysis. Although specific interactions of ADAM32 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, several studies suggest potential roles in reproductive processes. ADAM32 is predominantly expressed in the testis and is thought to play a role in sperm-egg interactions. It contains disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains, which are likely involved in binding to integrins on the egg membrane, suggesting a role in sperm-egg binding and fusion (Choi2003Identification; Vicens2014Proteins).

The protein has been identified in human sperm as having potential hyaluronic acid (HA) binding properties due to the presence of BX7B motifs, which are associated with HA-binding domains. This suggests that ADAM32 may function as a hyaladherin, participating in sperm-oocyte interactions (Torabi2017Zona). Despite these findings, specific interactions of ADAM32 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely unexplored, and further research is needed to elucidate its precise role in cellular processes and reproductive biology.
