# USP3

## Overview
Ubiquitin specific peptidase 3 (USP3) is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme, which is part of the ubiquitin-specific protease family. The protein product of USP3 plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the maintenance of genomic stability, regulation of immune responses, and cell cycle progression. As a deubiquitinase, USP3 is involved in the removal of ubiquitin moieties from specific protein substrates, thereby modulating their stability and function. This enzymatic activity is essential for the DNA damage response, where USP3 deubiquitinates histones to facilitate chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. Additionally, USP3 regulates immune signaling pathways by modulating ubiquitination of key signaling proteins, thus preventing excessive immune activation. The protein's interactions with various cellular partners, such as transcription factors and signaling molecules, underscore its involvement in cancer progression and other pathological conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Cui2013USP3; Clague2012Cellular; Wang2024Ubiquitin).

## Structure
USP3 is a protein consisting of 520 amino acid residues and is located on human chromosome 15q22.31. It contains two conserved domains: the ZnF domain and the catalytic domain (UCH). The ZnF domain, spanning amino acids 1-121, has a unique structure characterized by a compact globular fold, a deep cleft, and a pocket that accommodates the C terminus of ubiquitin (Wang2024Ubiquitin). The UCH domain extends from amino acids 159-511 and includes a conserved cysteine catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic activity (Wang2024Ubiquitin).

The core catalytic structure of USP3 is composed of three subdomains, often likened to a palm, thumb, and finger configuration. The 'fingers' are responsible for grabbing ubiquitin, while the catalytic center is located between the 'palm' and 'thumb' (Wang2024Ubiquitin). The ZnF domain is crucial for mediating interactions between USP3 and ubiquitin, as mutations in this domain significantly reduce USP3's interaction with ubiquitinated histone uH2A (Wang2024Ubiquitin).

USP3 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing. These structural features and modifications are critical for its function as a deubiquitinase.

## Function
USP3 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 3) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating immune responses in healthy human cells. It is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) by deubiquitinating monoubiquitinated histones H2A and H2B, which is essential for chromatin remodeling and the recruitment of DNA repair proteins. This activity is crucial for the repair of double-strand breaks and contributes to genomic stability (Wang2024Ubiquitin; Clague2012Cellular).

USP3 also acts as a negative regulator of type I interferon signaling by deubiquitinating K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on RIG-I-like receptors, thereby modulating antiviral responses. This regulation prevents excessive activation of the immune response, which could lead to immunopathology or autoimmune disorders (Cui2013USP3).

In the context of cell cycle regulation, USP3 promotes the dephosphorylation of the variant histone H2AX, aiding in checkpoint recovery after DNA damage, and stabilizes the cell division cycle 25A (Cdc25A), which is crucial for cell cycle progression (Wang2024Ubiquitin; Clague2012Cellular). These functions highlight USP3's role in maintaining chromatin structure, facilitating DNA repair, and modulating immune responses, which are essential for healthy cell function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the USP3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In gastric cancer, USP3 acts as an oncogene by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell invasion, and migration through the stabilization of COL9A3 and COL6A5 proteins. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that the USP3-COL9A3/COL6A5 axis could serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Wu2021USP3). In neuroblastoma, USP3 stabilizes the REST protein, which blocks neuronal differentiation and promotes tumorigenesis. High USP3 expression correlates with poor patient survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Karapurkar2023CRISPRCas9based).

USP3 also plays a role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by stabilizing the Aurora A protein, enhancing cell proliferation and metastasis (Shi2021Protein). In breast cancer, USP3 promotes cell proliferation by stabilizing the KLF5 transcription factor (Wu2019USP3). In glioblastoma, USP3 stabilizes the Snail protein, facilitating EMT and tumor invasiveness (Fan2019UbiquitinSpecific). Additionally, in osteosarcoma, USP3 promotes tumor progression by deubiquitinating EPHA2 and activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Li2024USP3). These findings highlight USP3's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
USP3 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 3) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In breast cancer cells, USP3 interacts with the Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), a transcription factor involved in cell proliferation. This interaction stabilizes KLF5 by reducing its polyubiquitination, thereby promoting breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth (Wu2019USP3). The interaction between USP3 and KLF5 occurs through the C-terminus of USP3 and the N-terminus of KLF5, and it is independent of USP3's enzymatic activity (Wu2019USP3).

USP3 also interacts with histones H2A and γH2AX, where it counteracts the ubiquitination facilitated by E3 ligases such as RNF168. This interaction is crucial for modulating the DNA damage response by altering the ubiquitination status of these histones, which affects the recruitment of DNA repair factors like BRCA1 and 53BP1 to damage sites (Sharma2013USP3).

In osteoarthritis, USP3 interacts with TRAF6, a key adaptor protein in the NF-kB signaling pathway. USP3 deubiquitinates TRAF6, thereby negatively regulating NF-kB activation and reducing IL-1β-induced chondrocyte apoptosis (Zhou2019Ubiquitinspecific).
