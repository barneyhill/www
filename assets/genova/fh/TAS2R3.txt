# TAS2R3

## Overview
TAS2R3 is a gene that encodes the taste 2 receptor member 3, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the perception of bitter tastes. This receptor is part of the larger TAS2R family, which plays a critical role in detecting bitter compounds, thereby helping organisms avoid potentially harmful substances. The TAS2R3 protein is characterized by its heptahelical structure, typical of GPCRs, and is primarily expressed on the surface of taste receptor cells in the tongue. Beyond its role in taste perception, TAS2R3 has been implicated in various physiological processes, including thyroid function and potentially limb development, as evidenced by genetic studies linking variations in the TAS2R3 gene to conditions such as papillary thyroid carcinoma and polysyndactyly (Zhang2020Novel; Choi2018Genetic). These findings suggest that TAS2R3 may have broader biological significance beyond its established function in taste.

## Structure
The TAS2R3 protein is a member of the taste receptor 2 (TAS2R) family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in bitter taste perception. These receptors are characterized by a heptahelical structure, consisting of seven transmembrane helices that form the structural core of the receptor (Pallante2021On; Meyerhof2011Molecular). The transmembrane helices are connected by three extracellular loops (ECLs) and three intracellular loops (ICLs), with the ligand-binding site located in the extracellular region (Pallante2021On; Spaggiari2020Sweet).

TAS2R3, like other TAS2Rs, lacks certain conserved motifs and disulfide bridges typical of other GPCR subfamilies, but it contains specific residues that may stabilize its inactive conformation (Pallante2021On). The receptor is glycosylated, a post-translational modification necessary for its biosynthesis and expression on the cell surface (Meyerhof2011Molecular). Genetic variations, such as synonymous changes, can affect mRNA splicing and protein folding, potentially altering receptor function (Choi2018Genetic). The TAS2R3 gene is located on chromosome 7 and may have splice variant isoforms that influence its function and ligand sensing capabilities (Choi2018Genetic).

## Function
The TAS2R3 gene encodes a member of the type 2 taste receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors primarily involved in the perception of bitter tastes. These receptors are located on the surface of taste receptor cells in the tongue and play a crucial role in detecting bitter compounds, which is important for avoiding the ingestion of potentially harmful substances (Meyerhof2011Molecular). Upon activation by bitter compounds, TAS2R3 receptors initiate a signal transduction pathway that involves the activation of the G protein α-gustducin. This leads to a cascade of intracellular events resulting in the release of neurotransmitters and the excitation of gustatory nerves, ultimately leading to the perception of bitterness (Meyerhof2011Molecular).

In addition to its role in taste perception, TAS2R3 has been implicated in other physiological processes. Variations in the TAS2R3 gene have been associated with thyroid function, particularly in the regulation of thyroid hormone levels, suggesting a broader role in human metabolism and disease (Choi2018Genetic). The gene's influence on thyroid hormone production may be linked to its interactions with thyrocytes, indicating a potential regulatory function beyond taste perception (Choi2018Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Genetic variations in the TAS2R3 gene have been associated with an altered risk of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in Korean females. Specifically, individuals with the CC/TC diplotype in TAS2R3/4 are less likely to develop PTC compared to those with the TC/TC diplotype, with an odds ratio of 0.43, indicating a protective effect against PTC (Choi2018Genetic). The presence of the CC haplotype is also linked to a reduced risk of PTC, with an odds ratio of 0.59 (Choi2018Genetic). These genetic variations may influence thyroid hormone levels, particularly total triiodothyronine (TT3), which could be a mechanism affecting PTC risk (Choi2018Genetic).

A frameshift mutation in the TAS2R3 gene has been identified in a Chinese family with polysyndactyly (PSD), suggesting a potential role in limb development. This mutation alters the amino acid sequence of TAS2R3, likely impairing its function (Zhang2020Novel). Additionally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TAS2R3 has been correlated with male infertility, although the mechanisms remain unclear (Zhang2020Novel). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of TAS2R3 genetic variations.

## Interactions
TAS2R3, a member of the taste receptor family, is involved in the perception of bitter taste. It is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that interacts with G proteins to transduce taste signals. One of the key interactions of TAS2R3 is with the protein gustducin, which is a G protein specifically associated with taste signal transduction. Gustducin plays a crucial role in the signaling pathway by coupling with TAS2R3 to mediate the cellular response to bitter compounds. This interaction is essential for the activation of downstream signaling cascades that ultimately lead to the perception of bitterness.

TAS2R3 may also be part of larger multiprotein complexes, which could include other taste receptors and signaling molecules. These complexes facilitate the integration and modulation of taste signals, allowing for a more nuanced perception of bitter flavors. The formation of such complexes suggests that TAS2R3 does not function in isolation but rather as part of a coordinated network of proteins that collectively contribute to taste perception. The precise nature of these interactions and the full range of proteins involved remain areas of active research, highlighting the complexity of taste signal transduction pathways.
