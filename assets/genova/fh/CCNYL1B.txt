# CCNYL1B

## Overview
The CCNYL1B gene encodes the cyclin Y like 1B protein, which is a member of the cyclin family, known for their role in regulating the cell cycle. Cyclin Y like 1B is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and signal transduction pathways. As a regulatory protein, it interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) to control the transition between different phases of the cell cycle. The precise mechanisms and pathways involving cyclin Y like 1B are still under investigation, but its function is crucial for maintaining normal cellular proliferation and differentiation. Mutations or dysregulation of CCNYL1B may have implications in various diseases, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
