# GOLGA8R

## Overview
GOLGA8R is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A8 family member R, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their coiled-coil structure and are primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids within the cell. Golgin A8 family member R is implicated in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi and facilitating vesicular transport processes. The precise biological functions and interactions of GOLGA8R remain an active area of research, with studies suggesting its involvement in various cellular pathways and potential implications in disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
