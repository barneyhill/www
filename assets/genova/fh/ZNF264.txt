# ZNF264

## Overview
ZNF264 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 264, a transcription factor characterized by the presence of Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domains and a 13-unit zinc finger domain. This protein is involved in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as differentiation and development. ZNF264 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with particularly high levels in the testes, and is located in the PEG3/USP29 imprinted domain on chromosome 19q13.4. The gene's expression patterns are conserved across species, indicating its importance in genomic imprinting and tissue-specific transcription regulation. ZNF264 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including obesity, colorectal cancer, and glioma, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological and pathological contexts (Kim2001Imprinting; Kusic2019rs11670527).

## Structure
The ZNF264 gene encodes a protein characterized by the presence of Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) A and B domains at the amino-terminal regions, linked to a 13-unit zinc-finger domain (Kim2001Imprinting). The full-length cDNA for human ZNF264 is 6.5 kb, encoding a 627-amino-acid protein (Kim2001Imprinting). The zinc-finger domains are small protein structural motifs stabilized by zinc ions, typically facilitating binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. These domains contribute to the protein's function, potentially involving interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins.

The genomic structure of human ZNF264 consists of four exons covering a 30-kb genomic region, with the 5' end located adjacent to a CpG island, which may play a role in the regulation of its expression (Kim2001Imprinting). The intergenic region between ZIM3 and ZNF264 in humans is about 40 kb, filled with Alu and mammalian-wide interspersed repeat (MIR SINE) elements, which could influence genomic stability and gene regulation (Kim2001Imprinting). Specific information on post-translational modifications, splice variant isoforms, or detailed tertiary and quaternary structures is not provided in the available context.

## Function
ZNF264 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor, regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. It is characterized by the presence of KRAB A and B domains at the N-terminal regions and a 13-unit zinc finger domain, which facilitate its role in nucleic acid binding and transcription regulation (Kim2001Imprinting). ZNF264 is ubiquitously expressed in humans, with particularly high levels in the testes and modest levels in other adult tissues, indicating its involvement in various cellular processes (Kim2001Imprinting).

The protein is active in the cell nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape by modulating the transcription of target genes. This activity is crucial for processes such as cell differentiation and development (Kusic2019rs11670527). The gene is located in the PEG3/USP29 imprinted domain on chromosome 19q13.4, and its expression patterns are conserved between humans and mice, suggesting a significant role in maintaining genomic imprinting and potentially influencing tissue-specific transcription (Kim2001Imprinting).

ZNF264's involvement in regulating transcription may also have implications for body mass index (BMI) regulation, as genetic variants near this gene have been associated with BMI, suggesting a potential role in obesity susceptibility (Kusic2019rs11670527).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF264 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ZNF264 is associated with increased risk, as indicated by its odds ratios in logistic regression models, suggesting a significant role in CRC pathogenesis (Huang2023GeneFunctionBased). The gene is also involved in complex gene interactions related to CRC, particularly in transcriptional regulation during replication stress and genomic instability (Huang2023GeneFunctionBased).

In obesity, a polymorphism upstream of ZNF264, rs11670527, is associated with higher body mass index (BMI). Individuals carrying the minor allele C at this locus have a higher likelihood of obesity, indicating a genetic susceptibility linked to ZNF264 (Kusic2019rs11670527).

ZNF264 is also upregulated in glioma, where it acts as a circular RNA (circ-ZNF264) that promotes tumor growth by sponging miR-4493, leading to increased expression of apelin, a gene involved in tumor angiogenesis and proliferation (Zhang2019CircZNF264).

In lung cancer, ZNF264 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells has been identified as a potential prognostic marker, with increased expression correlating with higher risk in non-small cell lung cancer (Wu2017CPEB4).

## Interactions
ZNF264, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions with nucleic acids and potentially other proteins. It functions primarily as a transcription factor, binding to DNA to regulate gene expression. This binding is facilitated by its zinc finger domains, which allow it to interact with specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing the transcription of target genes (Kusic2019rs11670527).

In the context of glioma cells, ZNF264 is transcribed into a circular RNA known as circ-ZNF264. This circular RNA acts as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA), interacting with microRNA miR-4493. Circ-ZNF264 serves as a miRNA sponge, binding to miR-4493 and inhibiting its activity. This interaction prevents miR-4493 from suppressing its target gene, apelin, which is involved in promoting tumor growth and progression (Zhang2019CircZNF264).

These interactions highlight the role of ZNF264 in modulating gene expression through both direct DNA binding and indirect regulation via RNA interactions. The ability of circ-ZNF264 to sequester miR-4493 exemplifies its involvement in complex regulatory networks that influence cellular behavior and disease progression (Zhang2019CircZNF264).
