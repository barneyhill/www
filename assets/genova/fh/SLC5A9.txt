# SLC5A9

## Overview
SLC5A9 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 5 member 9 (SGLT4), which is part of the sodium/glucose cotransporter family. This protein functions as a Na+-dependent transporter, primarily facilitating the transport of mannose and, to a lesser extent, glucose across cell membranes. SGLT4 is predominantly expressed in the small intestine, kidneys, liver, lung, and brain, where it plays a crucial role in the absorption and homeostasis of monosaccharides (Wright2013Glucose; SabinoSilva2010The). The protein is characterized by its 14 transmembrane helices, a structural feature typical of the SLC5 family, which supports its function as a transmembrane transporter (Wright2013Glucose). While the physiological roles of SGLT4 are not fully elucidated, its involvement in mannose transport suggests potential implications in metabolic processes and conditions such as diabetes mellitus (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

## Structure
The SLC5A9 gene encodes the SGLT4 protein, which is a member of the sodium/glucose cotransporter family. SGLT4 is primarily expressed in the small intestine, kidneys, liver, lung, and brain (SabinoSilva2010The). The protein functions as a Na+-dependent transporter, with a particular affinity for mannose, and also transports glucose, albeit with lower affinity (Wright2013Glucose; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

The molecular structure of SGLT4 includes 14 transmembrane helices, a common feature among members of the SLC5 family (Wright2013Glucose). The protein's transport mechanism involves the binding of sodium ions, which facilitates the uptake of sugars like mannose and glucose (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). Although specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of SGLT4 are not provided, the protein's function as a transporter suggests a complex folding pattern that allows for the formation of a substrate-binding pocket.

SGLT4 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functional properties (Wright2013Glucose). However, detailed information on post-translational modifications or specific domains within SGLT4 is not available in the provided context.

## Function
SLC5A9, also known as SGLT4, is a sodium-dependent glucose transporter primarily expressed in the intestine, kidney, and liver. It plays a significant role in the transport of mannose, glucose, and other monosaccharides. In COS-7 cells, SGLT4 transports glucose with a lower affinity compared to mannose, indicating a preference for mannose transport (Wright2013Glucose). The protein is involved in Na+-coupled transport processes, facilitating the uptake of α-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (α-MG) and is inhibited by mannose and glucose, with mannose showing a higher inhibitory effect (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

SGLT4 is suggested to be involved in mannose homeostasis, and mutations in the SLC5A9 gene may influence serum mannose levels, potentially impacting conditions like diabetes mellitus (Wright2013Glucose). The transporter is also expressed in the proximal tubule of the kidney, where it contributes to the reabsorption of various monosaccharides (Lewis2021“SLComics”). Despite its known transport functions, the full physiological role of SGLT4 remains poorly understood due to limited functional data and expression profile information (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC5A9 gene, which encodes the SGLT5 transporter, have been linked to several clinical conditions. SGLT5 is primarily involved in the renal transport of 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), a sugar alcohol associated with rare forms of neutropenia. Specific mutations in SGLT5, such as Asn96Ile, Gly471Glu, and Arg401His, have been shown to reduce or abolish the transport of 1,5-AG, leading to lower levels of this compound in the blood, which is significant in the context of neutropenia (Diederich2023SGLT5).

The SLC5A9 gene has also been implicated in metabolic diseases. In diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice, the expression of SLC5A9 was elevated in the liver and further increased by metformin treatment, suggesting a potential role in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitization (Le2021Restoration). Additionally, SLC5A9 has been associated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, with genetic studies identifying rare variants of the gene in affected patients (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

In cancer research, SLC5A9 has been identified as one of the eosinophil-related genes in bladder urothelial cancer, with its expression negatively correlated with a risk score for the disease, indicating a potential role in cancer prognosis (Xu2022Clinical).
