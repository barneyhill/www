# TAF11L14

## Overview
TAF11L14 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 11 like 14, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression by interacting with other components of the transcription machinery. TAF11L14 is implicated in the modulation of transcriptional activity, influencing the expression of genes involved in cell growth and differentiation. The protein's function and interactions are essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and may have implications in various clinical contexts, although specific pathways and mechanisms remain under investigation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
