# CCDC172

## Overview
The CCDC172 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 172 protein, which is a member of the coiled-coil domain-containing protein family. These proteins are characterized by their structural motif, the coiled-coil domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions and is involved in various cellular processes. While the specific biological functions of CCDC172 are not fully elucidated, proteins with coiled-coil domains are often implicated in the regulation of cellular architecture and intracellular transport. The CCDC172 protein may play a role in these processes, although further research is needed to clarify its precise functions and interactions within the cell. Understanding the role of CCDC172 is also of clinical interest, as alterations in coiled-coil domain proteins can be associated with various diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
