# FGL2

## Overview
FGL2 is a gene that encodes the fibrinogen-like protein 2, a multifunctional protein involved in coagulation and immune regulation. The protein exists in two forms: membrane-associated FGL2 (mFGL2), which functions as a prothrombinase, and soluble FGL2 (sFGL2), which acts as an immunosuppressor. mFGL2 facilitates the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, playing a crucial role in local fibrin deposition and tissue coagulation, while sFGL2 inhibits the proliferation of T lymphocytes and the maturation of dendritic cells, contributing to immune homeostasis (Zhang2023Fibrinogenlike; Yang2013Physiological). FGL2 is expressed in various organs, including the heart, lung, spleen, and liver, and is dynamically regulated during embryogenesis, indicating its importance in physiological processes such as embryo implantation and placenta development (Yang2013Physiological). The protein's involvement in immune regulation and coagulation processes has significant implications for diseases such as cancer and inflammatory conditions (Galpin2024FGL2; Zhang2023Fibrinogenlike).

## Structure
The FGL2 protein is composed of 439 amino acids and includes a 23-amino acid signal peptide at the N-terminus, followed by a 416-amino acid functional peptide (Zhang2023Fibrinogenlike). The N-terminus features a cytoplasmic domain and a transmembrane domain, which acts as a signal peptide, and includes two α-helical chains forming a superhelical cable structure (Chen2024FGL1). The C-terminus contains a conserved sequence of 229 amino acids forming a globular domain known as the fibrinogen-related domain (FReD), essential for receptor recognition, calcium binding, substrate binding, and immune regulation (Chen2024FGL1).

FGL2 exists in two forms: transmembrane FGL2 (mFGL2) and soluble FGL2 (sFGL2). mFGL2 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, while sFGL2 is secreted by immune cells (Chen2024FGL1). The protein can form a homo-tetrameric structure linked by disulfide bonds, with membrane-anchored FGL2s existing as tetramers and secreted FGL2s as tetramers, dimers, or monomers (Zhang2023Fibrinogenlike). Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification that affects the solubility and stability of sFGL2 (Chen2024FGL1; Zhang2023Fibrinogenlike).

## Function
Fibrinogen-like 2 (FGL2) is a multifunctional protein that plays significant roles in coagulation and immune regulation in healthy human cells. It exists in two forms: membrane-associated FGL2 (mFGL2) and soluble FGL2 (sFGL2). mFGL2 functions as a prothrombinase, facilitating the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, which is crucial for local fibrin deposition and tissue coagulation. This activity is intrinsic to mFGL2 and requires association with membrane phospholipids, factor Va, and calcium (Zhang2023Fibrinogenlike; Yang2013Physiological).

sFGL2, on the other hand, acts as an immunosuppressor. It inhibits the proliferation of alloreactive T lymphocytes and the maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. This immunosuppressive activity is attributed to its fibrinogen-related domain, which binds specifically to the Fc gamma receptor II B/CD32, expressed on various immune cells (Sulimai2022Fibrinogen; Yang2013Physiological).

FGL2 is constitutively expressed in several organs, including the heart, lung, spleen, and liver, indicating its physiological importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and vascular integrity (Sulimai2022Fibrinogen; Yang2013Physiological). Its expression is dynamically regulated during embryogenesis, suggesting roles in embryo implantation and placenta development (Yang2013Physiological).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FGL2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and gliomas. In ccRCC, increased FGL2 expression is associated with poor prognosis, as it correlates with enhanced cell viability and reduced apoptosis through the activation of the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways (Tang2017Increased). In gliomas, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), high FGL2 expression is linked to immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment, promoting tumor growth by expanding immunosuppressive cells like M2 macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Song2020Identification; Yan2015FGL2). FGL2 also correlates with immune checkpoint-related genes, suggesting its role in creating an immunosuppressive environment that facilitates tumor progression (Song2020Identification).

FGL2's role extends beyond cancer, as it is involved in immune regulation and coagulation. Its expression in immune and stromal cells contributes to immunosuppressive activities, impacting diseases like melanoma and ovarian cancer by attenuating immune cell infiltration (Galpin2024FGL2). The gene's prothrombinase activity, which converts fibrinogen into fibrin, can lead to vascular thrombosis and tissue inflammation, further implicating it in inflammatory conditions (Zhang2023Fibrinogenlike).

## Interactions
Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in immune regulation and coagulation processes. FGL2 exhibits prothrombinase activity, converting fibrinogen into fibrin, which requires phospholipids, free calcium, and coagulation factor Va (Zhang2023Fibrinogenlike). It forms a tetramer and binds to low-affinity Fcγ receptors, specifically FcγRIIB (CD32b) and FcγRIII (CD16), on antigen-presenting cells, inhibiting dendritic cell maturation and prolonging skin allograft survival (Zhang2023Fibrinogenlike). FGL2 also interacts with FcγRIIB on B cells, inducing apoptosis and impairing proliferation through the BTK and p38 MAPK pathways (Zhang2023Fibrinogenlike). In macrophages, FGL2 acts as a chemokine, attracting them via the CD16a receptor and activating the FGL2-CD16-Syk-HIF1α signaling pathway, leading to CXCL7 secretion (Zhang2023Fibrinogenlike).

FGL2 does not bind to fibrinogen-binding receptors such as Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) or TLR4 (Zhang2023Fibrinogenlike). Soluble FGL2, secreted by T lymphocytes, can impair T cell proliferation by binding to T cells (Zhang2023Fibrinogenlike). FGL2 is also expressed in regulatory T cells, where it acts as an effector of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells, suppressing effector T cell activities (Zhang2023Fibrinogenlike).
