encodes a member of a family of cysteine- and proline-rich proteins. The encoded protein is an inhibitor of the receptor-transduced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Activity of this protein impairs the formation of active GTP-RAS. Nucleotide variation in this gene has been associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 17 with or without anosmia. Alternative splicing results in a multiple transcript variants.
