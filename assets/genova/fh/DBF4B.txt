# DBF4B

## Overview
DBF4B is a gene that encodes the DBF4 zinc finger B protein, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cell cycle. The DBF4 zinc finger B protein is a regulatory subunit that partners with the CDC7 kinase to form a complex essential for the initiation of DNA replication. This protein is involved in the activation of the CDC7 kinase, which is necessary for the phosphorylation of substrates that drive the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. The DBF4B gene, through its encoded protein, is implicated in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and replication, and is of particular interest in studies related to cancer biology due to its role in cell proliferation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
