# ACKR4

## Overview
ACKR4, or atypical chemokine receptor 4, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor involved in the regulation of chemokine availability and immune cell positioning. Unlike typical chemokine receptors, the protein encoded by ACKR4 does not activate classical G protein-mediated signaling pathways. Instead, it functions as a chemokine scavenger, internalizing and degrading specific homeostatic chemokines such as CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25, which are essential for immune cell trafficking (Sjöberg2020The; Nibbs2013Immune). ACKR4 is expressed in epithelial tissues of barrier organs, lymphatic endothelial cells, and thymic epithelial cells, where it plays a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity (Vacchini2016Overview; Nibbs2013Immune). Its unique mechanism of action and expression pattern underscore its importance in immune surveillance and central tolerance, as well as its potential implications in cancer prognosis and autoimmune diseases (Sjöberg2020The; Borroni2018Chemokines).

## Function
ACKR4, or atypical chemokine receptor 4, functions primarily as a chemokine scavenger, regulating the availability of chemokines in the extracellular space. It binds homeostatic chemokines such as CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25, which are crucial for the trafficking of naive T-cells, B-cells, and dendritic cells, without initiating classical G protein-mediated signaling pathways (Sjöberg2020The; Nibbs2013Immune). Instead, ACKR4 internalizes and degrades these chemokines, thereby shaping chemokine gradients and influencing leukocyte migration and positioning within lymphoid tissues (Vacchini2016Overview; Borroni2018Chemokines).

In healthy human cells, ACKR4 is expressed on epithelial tissues of barrier organs, lymphatic endothelial cells, and thymic epithelial cells, where it plays a role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity (Vacchini2016Overview; Nibbs2013Immune). Its activity is crucial for the proper functioning of the immune system, as evidenced by the development of spontaneous autoimmunity and altered thymic homeostasis in ACKR4-deficient models (Vacchini2016Overview). By modulating chemokine gradients, ACKR4 contributes to the regulation of immune surveillance and homeostasis, ensuring effective immune responses and central tolerance (Borroni2018Chemokines).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the atypical chemokine receptor 4 (ACKR4) have been associated with various cancers. In breast cancer, high levels of ACKR4 expression are linked to a lower incidence of lymph node metastasis and improved patient prognosis, suggesting a protective role against cancer progression (Sjöberg2020The). Conversely, ACKR4 expression has been associated with enhanced metastatic potential in some breast cancer models, indicating a complex role in cancer dynamics (Sjöberg2020The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, ACKR4 expression is typically downregulated compared to normal liver tissue. This downregulation is associated with advanced tumor stages and poorer survival outcomes, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Sjöberg2020The). Similarly, in colorectal cancer, decreased ACKR4 protein levels correlate with lymph node metastasis and reduced patient survival, further supporting its role as an independent prognostic marker for disease-free survival (Sjöberg2020The).

ACKR4 also plays a role in immune regulation, where its deficiency can lead to increased Th17 responses and autoimmune conditions, as observed in ACKR4-deficient mice (Meyrath2020Systematic; Borroni2018Chemokines). These findings suggest that ACKR4 is crucial in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammatory responses.

## Interactions
ACKR4, or atypical chemokine receptor 4, interacts with various proteins, primarily through its role in chemokine uptake and trafficking. Unlike typical chemokine receptors, ACKR4 does not activate canonical G-protein signaling pathways. It does not associate with or activate G-proteins such as Gα i, Gα q, Gα s, Gα o, or Gα 13, as demonstrated by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays (Matti2020ACKR4).

ACKR4 recruits G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), specifically GRK3 and to a lesser extent GRK2, upon chemokine stimulation. This recruitment occurs before the interaction with β-arrestins, which are crucial for chemokine uptake and receptor trafficking. The C-terminus of ACKR4 is essential for the recruitment of β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2, particularly upon stimulation with chemokines CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25. CCL19 is noted as the most potent in this recruitment process (Matti2020ACKR4).

β-arrestins contribute to the steady-state trafficking of ACKR4, although they are not essential for its chemokine scavenging function. ACKR4 can still scavenge chemokines in the absence of β-arrestins, indicating alternative pathways for endocytosis (Matti2020ACKR4). These interactions highlight the unique role of ACKR4 in modulating chemokine availability and immune cell positioning.
