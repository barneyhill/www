# CSPG4

## Overview
CSPG4, or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane proteoglycan involved in various cellular processes. The protein product of CSPG4, also known as NG2, is characterized by its large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail, which facilitate its role in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling (Campoli2010Functional; Tamburini2018Structural). As a transmembrane proteoglycan, CSPG4 interacts with numerous extracellular matrix components and integrins, influencing cell motility and shape through pathways such as the integrin-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (Ilieva2018Chondroitin; Tang2018Cell). CSPG4 is implicated in tissue development, angiogenesis, and neural development, and its expression is associated with the progression of various cancers and certain neurological disorders (Price2011CSPG4; Ilieva2018Chondroitin).

## Structure
The CSPG4 gene encodes a transmembrane proteoglycan with a complex molecular structure. The primary sequence of CSPG4 includes a contiguous human cDNA spanning 8071 nucleotides, encoding an open reading frame of 2322 amino acids, resulting in a polypeptide of 250,537 Da (Tamburini2018Structural). The protein features a large extracellular domain (~2221-2222 amino acids), a single transmembrane domain (~25 amino acids), and a short cytoplasmic tail (~75-76 amino acids) (Campoli2010Functional; Tamburini2018Structural).

The extracellular domain is divided into three subdomains: D1, a globular N-terminus with a laminin-G domain; D2, a flexible rod-like central region with potential glycosaminoglycan (GAG) acceptor sites and collagen-binding sites; and D3, a C-terminal portion in globular conformation (Campoli2010Functional). The ectodomain includes 15 unique CSPG repeats and two contiguous Laminin-G-type repeats (Tamburini2018Structural). The cytoplasmic domain contains a PDZ-binding motif and potential phosphorylation sites (Campoli2010Functional).

CSPG4 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and sulfation, which are crucial for its function and membrane integration (Campoli2010Functional; Tamburini2018Structural). The presence of GAG is not required for ligand binding but may be important for targeting CSPG4 to specific cell membrane microdomains (Campoli2010Functional). The protein's structure allows for extensive interactions with more than 40 putative ligands, influencing various cellular phenomena (Tamburini2018Structural).

## Function
CSPG4, also known as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4, is a transmembrane proteoglycan that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling, primarily through its interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and integrins. CSPG4 binds to ECM components such as perlecan, tenascin-C, laminin, and collagen types II, V, and VI, facilitating cell adhesion and motility (Tamburini2018Structural; Tang2018Cell). 

The protein is active in the cell membrane and influences cell shape and motility by interacting with the actin cytoskeleton and cytoskeletal regulators. It is involved in the formation of cell membrane protrusions like filopodia and invadopodia, which are crucial for cell movement and polarity (Tamburini2018Structural). CSPG4 also acts as a docking receptor for growth factors, aligning with stress fibers and participating in signal transduction pathways such as the integrin-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) axis and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (Ilieva2018Chondroitin).

CSPG4's role extends to tissue development and homeostasis, including processes like angiogenesis and neural development, where it contributes to cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation (Ilieva2018Chondroitin).

## Clinical Significance
CSPG4 is implicated in the progression of various cancers, including melanoma, gliomas, and breast carcinomas. In melanoma, CSPG4 expression is linked to tumor progression, promoting anchorage-independent growth and increased motility in melanoma cells. Its intact core protein is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis (Price2011CSPG4). CSPG4 is also expressed in nonmelanoma tumors such as glioblastomas, renal cell carcinomas, and pancreatic cell carcinomas, where its expression is often associated with poorer prognosis and tumorigenic cancer stem cell subpopulations (Price2011CSPG4).

In hematological cancers like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), CSPG4 expression is correlated with poor outcomes and specific genetic translocations (Campoli2010Functional; Ilieva2018Chondroitin). CSPG4's role in drug resistance and its potential as a target for antibody therapies in cancer are also noted (Ilieva2018Chondroitin).

CSPG4 mutations have been associated with schizophrenia. Rare variants such as CSPG4 A131T and CSPG4 V901G may affect protein conformation and interactions, potentially impacting cell adhesion and migration. These mutations are linked to oligodendrocyte progenitor cell dysfunction and altered neuronal properties, contributing to schizophrenia (de2018Candidate).

## Interactions
CSPG4, also known as NG2, is a transmembrane chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that engages in various interactions with proteins and extracellular matrix components. It binds to type VI collagen, specifically the α2 (VI) collagen chain, facilitating cell anchorage and potentially serving as a cellular receptor for this collagen type (Tamburini2018Structural; Burg1996Binding). CSPG4 also interacts with other ECM molecules such as type II and V collagen, tenascin, and laminin, with these interactions primarily mediated by the NG2 core protein (Burg1996Binding).

CSPG4 forms complexes with membrane type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs), particularly MT3-MMP, which is crucial for the degradation of type I collagen in melanoma cells (Campoli2010Functional). It also interacts with integrins, such as α4β1 and α3β1, enhancing cell adhesion and migration (Campoli2010Functional; Tang2018Cell). CSPG4's interaction with integrins is linked to the activation of signaling pathways involving focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which are important for cell motility and invasion (Campoli2010Functional).

Additionally, CSPG4 binds to growth factors like basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA), influencing cellular responsiveness and proliferation (Goretzki1999Highaffinity). These interactions highlight CSPG4's role in modulating cell behavior and its potential involvement in cancer progression and neural development.
