# ILF3

## Overview
Interleukin enhancer binding factor 3 (ILF3) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various aspects of RNA biology, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. The ILF3 protein, characterized by its double-stranded RNA-binding motifs and arginine/glycine-rich domain, plays a pivotal role in RNA binding and nuclear export processes (Gwizdek2004Minihelixcontaining; Duchange2000Alternative). As a transcriptional activator and co-activator, ILF3 is involved in the regulation of gene expression, impacting processes such as apoptosis inhibition and mRNA stabilization (Castella2014Ilf3). It also participates in the biogenesis and processing of microRNAs, highlighting its integral role in gene expression regulation (Castella2014Ilf3). Clinically, ILF3 is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in colorectal and lung cancers, where it influences tumor growth and patient survival outcomes (Zhang2023PSMD3ILF3; Li2019ILF3). These diverse functions underscore ILF3's significance in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Structure
The ILF3 protein is composed of 894 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 96 kDa. It includes several domains: a bipartite nuclear localization domain, two double-stranded RNA-binding motifs (dsRBMs), and an arginine/glycine-rich (RG) domain, which is implicated in RNA binding (Duchange2000Alternative). The N-terminal portion of ILF3 is common with other related proteins until amino acid 686, after which the sequences diverge. The C-terminal domain is rich in glycine, serine, tyrosine, and glutamine (Duchange2000Alternative).

The ILF3 protein contains two double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) and an RGG domain, which are crucial for its role in RNA binding and nuclear export processes (Gwizdek2004Minihelixcontaining). The dsRBM is a compact structure consisting of two alpha-helices lying across the surface of a three-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet (Buaas1999Cloning).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and arginine dimethylation, contribute to the heterogeneity of ILF3, affecting its functions in RNA metabolism and other cellular processes (Castella2014Ilf3). Alternative splicing of the ILF3 gene results in different isoforms, such as ilf3-a, ilf3-b, ilf3-c, ilf3-d, and ilf3-e, which may have distinct functions (Duchange2000Alternative).

## Function
The ILF3 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in RNA biology, particularly in the regulation of transcription and translation in healthy human cells. ILF3 functions as a transcriptional activator and co-activator, involved in the activation of genes such as GATA-2 and synoviolin, which are associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Castella2014Ilf3). It forms complexes with proteins like NF45, p54 nrb, and PRMT1 to regulate the expression of survivin, a protein that inhibits apoptosis (Castella2014Ilf3). ILF3 also acts as a co-activator for liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1), enhancing the expression of the SHP gene in synergy with PRMT1 and PGC-1α (Ohno2011Interleukin).

In terms of translation regulation, ILF3 is involved in mRNA stabilization, particularly through interactions with AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs, which is crucial for the expression of genes like IL2 during T-cell activation and VEGF under hypoxic conditions (Castella2014Ilf3). ILF3 is also implicated in the biogenesis of microRNAs, participating in the processing of primary miRNAs into precursor miRNAs and their export to the cytoplasm (Castella2014Ilf3). These activities highlight ILF3's integral role in gene expression regulation at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.

## Clinical Significance
The ILF3 gene is significantly implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) through its role in reprogramming serine metabolism, which is crucial for maintaining the malignant progression of CRC. Overexpression of ILF3 in CRC cells enhances the serine biosynthesis pathway, supporting tumor growth and correlating with poor survival outcomes in patients. ILF3 stabilizes the mRNA of SGOC pathway genes, such as PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH, through its dsRNA-binding motifs, thereby enhancing their expression (Li2019ILF3). The EGF-ERK signaling axis regulates ILF3 stability, with EGF treatment increasing ILF3 expression and decreasing its polyubiquitination, thus stabilizing the protein. Phosphorylation of ILF3 at serine residue S382 by ERK is critical for its stability (Li2019ILF3).

In lung cancer, ILF3 interacts with PSMD3, which regulates ILF3 protein stability and facilitates its ubiquitination, contributing to tumor growth and proliferation. High levels of both PSMD3 and ILF3 are associated with poor overall survival in lung cancer patients (Zhang2023PSMD3ILF3). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ILF3 interacts with lncRNA PTTG3P, promoting cell growth and metastasis by maintaining mRNA stability (Wang2023LncRNA). These findings suggest that ILF3 plays a significant role in cancer development and progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
ILF3, also known as interleukin enhancer binding factor 3, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA biology. ILF3 interacts with Exportin-5 in a RanGTP-dependent manner, facilitating its nuclear export. This interaction is specific and does not occur with other transport receptors like importin β and Crm1 (Brownawell2002Exportin5). ILF3 also forms a complex with Exportin-5 and RanGTP, mediated by RNA structures such as minihelices, which are crucial for its export from the nucleus (Gwizdek2004Minihelixcontaining).

ILF3 is part of the NF90/NF45 complex, which can inhibit the processing of primary miRNAs into precursor miRNAs by interacting with the Microprocessor complex. This interaction affects the levels of mature miRNAs (Castella2014Ilf3). ILF3 also binds to the ELF3-AS1 lncRNA and ELF3 mRNA, stabilizing these transcripts and influencing their expression (Li2022LncRNA).

In addition to its role in RNA processing, ILF3 interacts with proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, such as PRMT1 and Yin Yang 1, and forms complexes with nuclear receptors, influencing gene expression (Castella2014Ilf3). These interactions highlight ILF3's multifaceted role in cellular processes.
