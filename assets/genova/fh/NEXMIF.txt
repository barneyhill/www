# NEXMIF

## Overview
NEXMIF is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the neurite extension and migration factor, a protein integral to various cellular processes, particularly in the brain and pancreatic beta cells. This protein is categorized as a nuclear protein and is pivotal in maintaining genomic integrity, influencing synapse formation, and regulating chromatin and transposable elements. In the brain, it plays a crucial role in dendritic extension and neuronal migration, essential for neural network formation and cognitive functions (Stekelenburg2022Loss; Mount2023The). The protein's function extends to the pancreas, where it is involved in beta-cell proliferation and genomic stability, highlighting its significance in both neurological and metabolic processes (Stekelenburg2022Loss). Mutations in the NEXMIF gene are linked to a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and epilepsy, with varying phenotypic expressions between males and females (Panda2020Clinical; Stamberger2021NEXMIF).

## Structure


## Function
The NEXMIF gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining genomic integrity and is involved in various molecular processes essential for healthy cellular function. NEXMIF is highly expressed in the brain and pancreatic beta cells, indicating its importance in both neurological and metabolic processes (Stekelenburg2022Loss). In the brain, NEXMIF is crucial for proper dendritic extension and neuronal migration, processes vital for neural network formation and cognitive functions (Mount2023The). The protein is active in the nucleus of postmitotic neurons, where it influences synapse formation and function, contributing to learning and memory (Gilbert2019NEXMIFKIDLIA).

NEXMIF is also involved in chromatin regulation and the inhibition of LINE1 elements, which are transposable elements that can disrupt genomic stability. This function is similar to that of the ATRX protein, which regulates histone H3.3 deposition (Stekelenburg2022Loss). In pancreatic islets, NEXMIF is crucial for beta-cell proliferation and maintaining genomic stability, as evidenced by its role in silencing repetitive elements and responding to oxidative stress (Stekelenburg2022Loss). The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in both neuronal development and metabolic regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NEXMIF gene, previously known as KIAA2022, are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and epilepsy. These mutations are particularly impactful in males, often resulting in severe intellectual disability, language impairment, and behavioral abnormalities such as autistic features and hyperactivity. Affected males may also experience microcephaly, gastrointestinal issues, central hypotonia, facial dysmorphism, and squint (Panda2020Clinical; Stamberger2021NEXMIF).

In females, NEXMIF mutations are linked to more frequent and severe epilepsy, including absence and myoclonic seizures, and are considered a potential cause of Jeavon syndrome. The phenotypic expression in females varies widely, with some carriers being asymptomatic, a variability not fully explained by skewed X-inactivation (Panda2020Clinical; Stamberger2021NEXMIF). 

NEXMIF encephalopathy, an X-linked disorder, is characterized by cognitive impairments, ASD features, and behavioral problems. Epilepsy is prevalent, with drug-resistant epilepsy more common in females. The disorder affects neuronal morphogenesis and synapse formation, leading to loss of function and impacting brain development (Stamberger2021NEXMIF). 

Research using animal models has shown that NEXMIF mutations can also affect other organ systems, such as the pancreas, leading to impaired beta-cell function and glucose metabolism (Stekelenburg2022Loss).
