# ULK4

## Overview
ULK4 is a gene located on human chromosome 3p22.1 that encodes the protein unc-51 like kinase 4, a member of the Unc-51-like serine/threonine kinase family. Despite being classified as a pseudokinase due to its catalytically inactive domain, ULK4 plays a crucial role in neurodevelopmental processes by acting as a scaffold for protein interactions and potentially functioning as an ATP sensor (Khamrui2019HighResolution; Luo2022ULK4). The protein is involved in regulating neural stem cell pools, influencing neurogenesis, and maintaining microtubule stability, which are essential for proper brain development and function (Liu2016Ulk4; Lang2016Control). ULK4's interactions with various proteins and signaling pathways underscore its importance in maintaining normal brain function and its association with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (Luo2022ULK4; Hu2021Ulk4).

## Structure
ULK4 is a large protein encoded by the ULK4 gene, located on human chromosome 3p22.1. It is part of the Unc-51-like serine/threonine kinase family but is considered a pseudokinase due to its catalytically inactive pseudokinase domain at the N-terminus (Khamrui2019HighResolution; Luo2022ULK4). Despite lacking phosphotransfer activity, ULK4 can bind ATP with high affinity in a Mg2+-independent manner, suggesting a potential role as an ATP sensor (Khamrui2019HighResolution; Luo2022ULK4).

The protein structure includes five HEAT repeats at the C-terminus, which are involved in protein scaffolding and interaction, similar to ULK1 and ULK2 (Luo2022ULK4). These repeats enable ULK4 to interact with proteins such as CAMSAP1, OFD1, and PAN2 (Luo2022ULK4). The high-resolution structure of ULK4 reveals a classic kinase fold with unique features, including a tryptophan:leucine hydrophobic interaction instead of the typical lysine:glutamate salt bridge (Khamrui2019HighResolution).

ULK4 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, and may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could regulate its function (Luo2022ULK4). The structural framework of ULK4 provides insights into its roles in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders (Luo2022ULK4).

## Function
The ULK4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the unc-51-like kinase family, which plays a significant role in neurodevelopmental processes. Although ULK4 contains a pseudokinase domain and is catalytically inactive, it can bind ATP in a unique Mg2+-independent manner, suggesting it may function as an ATP sensor and scaffold for substrate recruitment (Luo2022ULK4). ULK4 is involved in the regulation of the neural stem cell pool, influencing neurogenesis and corticogenesis, which are crucial for brain development and function (Liu2016Ulk4; Lang2016Control).

ULK4 is expressed in various brain regions and is essential for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the brain. It regulates the acetylation of α-tubulin, a modification important for microtubule stability, cell polarity, and directional migration, which are vital for neuronal development and connectivity (Lang2016Control). ULK4 also interacts with the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining the balance of stem cells and progenitor cells, further influencing neural development (Liu2016Ulk4). The gene's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal brain function and preventing neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ULK4 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. ULK4 is implicated in conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and major depressive disorders. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and deletions in ULK4 are enriched in patients with these conditions, suggesting its role as a susceptibility gene (Luo2022ULK4; Hu2021Ulk4). 

ULK4 is crucial for proper brain development, and its deficiency can lead to structural abnormalities such as cortical thinning and impaired myelination. These structural changes are linked to cognitive and developmental delays, which are common in schizophrenia and ASD (Liu2016Ulk4; Liu2017Ulk4). ULK4 mutations also affect signaling pathways like Wnt, PKC, MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK, which are involved in mental disorders (Luo2022ULK4).

Behavioral studies in mice with ULK4 mutations show anxiety-like behaviors and social interaction deficits, which are indicative of its role in anxiety disorders and other neuropsychiatric conditions (Liu2018Ulk4). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ULK4 in understanding and potentially treating these disorders.

## Interactions
ULK4, a pseudokinase, participates in various protein interactions that suggest its role as a scaffold in cellular signaling. It interacts with several proteins involved in microtubule dynamics and centrosomal functions, including CAMSAP1, HAUS2, HAUS8, CCP110, CEP97, CSPP1, and OFD1 (Preuss2020Nucleotidea). ULK4 also associates with motor proteins of the kinesin family and protein kinases such as ROCK2 and ARHGAP29 (Preuss2020Nucleotidea). These interactions are crucial for its proposed role in microtubular and centrosomal functions.

ULK4's pseudokinase domain specifically interacts with STK36, indicating a regulatory role over active kinases despite its lack of catalytic activity (Luo2022ULK4). This interaction is essential for the formation of the Stk36-Gli2 complex, which is involved in Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling (Zhou2023Ulk4). ULK4 acts as a scaffold, facilitating the interaction between Stk36 and Gli2, and its ciliary localization is crucial for Gli2 phosphorylation (Zhou2023Ulk4).

The armadillo repeat region of ULK4 interacts with CAMSAP1 and other proteins, while the pseudokinase domain interacts with STK36, PTPN14, and CAMSAP3 (Preuss2020Nucleotidea). These interactions highlight ULK4's potential role in cellular processes related to the cytoskeleton and centrosome.
