# PIEZO2

## Overview
PIEZO2 is a gene that encodes the piezo type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2, a transmembrane protein integral to the mechanotransduction process in various cell types. This protein is characterized by its unique structure, comprising 38 transmembrane segments per monomer, which assemble into a trimeric, propeller-like conformation. PIEZO2 plays a pivotal role in converting mechanical stimuli into electrochemical signals, essential for sensory functions such as touch, proprioception, and mechanical pain perception (Murthy2017Piezos; Szczot2021The). It is predominantly expressed in sensory neurons and mechanosensory structures, facilitating the passage of cations, particularly calcium ions, into cells, thereby influencing numerous cellular processes (Szczot2021The). Mutations in the PIEZO2 gene are linked to various clinical conditions, including Distal Arthrogryposis and Gordon Syndrome, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Coste2013Gainoffunction; Ma2019Mutations).

## Structure
The PIEZO2 protein is a mechanosensitive ion channel characterized by a unique molecular structure. It consists of 38 transmembrane segments per monomer, forming a trimeric assembly with a three-bladed, propeller-like conformation. This structure includes a central ion-conducting pore and peripheral blades, which are crucial for its function in mechanotransduction (Liu2020Structure; Fang2021Structure; Szczot2021The). The blades curve into a nano-dome shape, contributing to the channel's mechanosensitivity by potentially deforming the local membrane (Liu2020Structure).

The protein's quaternary structure involves a trimeric assembly, with each monomer contributing to the overall architecture. The central pore is enclosed by transmembrane segments TM37 and TM38, the C-terminal domain, and the anchor domain, which are involved in gating mechanisms (Liu2020Structure). Intracellular domains, accounting for 25% of the protein, play a significant role in differentiating PIEZO2's function from its homolog PIEZO1 (Verkest2022Intrinsically).

PIEZO2 also features intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that influence its mechanosensitivity. These IDRs, particularly IDR5, are crucial for activation by cytoskeleton-transmitted forces (Verkest2022Intrinsically). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, and exists in several splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function and localization (Verkest2022Intrinsically).

## Function
PIEZO2 is a mechanosensitive ion channel protein that plays a critical role in converting mechanical stimuli into electrochemical signals in cells. It is primarily involved in touch sensation, proprioception, and mechanical pain. In healthy human cells, PIEZO2 is essential for mechanotransduction, the process by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into electrical signals. This protein is crucial for the sensation of touch and proprioception, which is the ability to sense limb position and balance (Murthy2017Piezos). PIEZO2 allows the passage of cations, particularly calcium ions (Ca2+), into cells, which is essential for various biochemical signals such as gene expression regulation, cytoskeletal remodeling, and protein trafficking (Szczot2021The).

PIEZO2 is expressed in sensory neurons and specialized mechanosensory structures, playing a significant role in sensory transduction (Murthy2017Piezos). It is highly expressed in somatosensory neurons and is critical for touch, proprioception, and interoception in vertebrates (Szczot2021The). In the urinary system, PIEZO2 is essential for the synchronization and triggering of micturition reflexes, and its deficiency leads to bladder dysfunction (Szczot2021The). PIEZO2 is also involved in respiratory function, as its activity in sensory neurons innervating the lung is crucial for sensing organ stretch and mediating the Hering-Breuer reflex, which prevents excessive lung stretching (Murthy2017Piezos).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIEZO2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions characterized by joint contractures and sensory abnormalities. Gain-of-function mutations in PIEZO2, often located in the C-terminal region, are linked to autosomal dominant conditions such as Distal Arthrogryposis Type 5 (DA5), Gordon Syndrome (GS), and Marden-Walker Syndrome (MWS). These mutations lead to increased channel activity in response to mechanical stimuli, resulting in joint contractures, skeletal abnormalities, and other features like ophthalmoplegia and pulmonary hypertension (Coste2013Gainoffunction; Ma2019Mutations).

Loss-of-function mutations, typically recessive and found in the N-terminal region, result in conditions like Distal Arthrogryposis with Impaired Proprioception and Touch (DAIPT). These mutations cause a complete loss of function, leading to symptoms such as severe hypotonia, delayed motor development, scoliosis, and proprioceptive defects. Patients with these mutations often exhibit a profound lack of proprioception and touch sensitivity, while maintaining normal temperature and pain thresholds (Szczot2021The; Klaniewska2021Case).

The clinical presentations of PIEZO2-associated diseases vary significantly, with gain-of-function mutations causing hyperexcitability of PIEZO2-expressing cells, while loss-of-function mutations lead to mechanosensory deficiencies (Behunova2018Distal; Chesler2016The).

## Interactions
PIEZO2 interacts with various proteins and cellular components, playing a crucial role in mechanotransduction. It is modulated by membrane lipids, such as margaric acid, which increases membrane stiffness and inhibits PIEZO2 currents, while cholesterol-rich lipid rafts and the cholesterol-binding protein Stoml3 enhance its function. Phosphoinositides, including PI(3,5)P2, bind directly to PIEZO2, facilitating mechanotransduction, and proteins like Mtmr2 and Tentonin3, involved in phospholipid homeostasis, modulate its activity. Mtmr2 acts as a negative regulator of the PIEZO2-potentiating lipid PI(3,5)P2 (Szczot2021The).

PIEZO2's function is also influenced by its interactions with the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, which may transmit mechanical force to the channel. Although no direct biochemical linkage between PIEZO2 and the cytoskeleton has been proven, functional evidence suggests a connection, particularly involving the PIEZO2 beam domain (Szczot2021The). The intrinsically disordered region 5 (IDR5) of PIEZO2 is crucial for its activation by cytoskeleton-transmitted forces, indicating that PIEZO2 may require cytoskeletal interactions for normal function (Verkest2022Intrinsically). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms of PIEZO2 in response to mechanical stimuli.
