# PCBP3

## Overview
PCBP3, or poly(rC) binding protein 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the poly(C)-binding protein family, which is involved in RNA binding and regulation. The protein encoded by PCBP3 is characterized by the presence of three hnRNP K homology (KH) domains, which are essential for its RNA-binding capabilities. These domains enable the protein to interact with both single-stranded and double-stranded poly(C) sequences, functioning primarily as a transcriptional repressor. PCBP3 plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation, mRNA stabilization, and translational control, influencing cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation. The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates gene expression and maintains cellular homeostasis. Additionally, PCBP3 has been identified as a potential prognostic biomarker for pancreatic cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Kang2012Novel; Qiu2022LncRNA; GER2018Proteomic).

## Structure
PCBP3, or poly(rC) binding protein 3, is characterized by the presence of three hnRNP K homology (KH) domains, which are essential for its RNA-binding capabilities. These domains are approximately 70 amino acids in length and consist of three α-helices and β-strands arranged to form an antiparallel β-sheet with α-helices packed against one side. A conserved Gly-X-X-Gly loop is present between the α1 and α2 helices, which is a common feature of KH domains (Kang2012Novel).

The primary structure of PCBP3 is composed of 339 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 36,171 Daltons and an isoelectric point (pI) of 8.22 (Kang2012Novel). The protein's secondary structure is defined by its KH domains, which contribute to its ability to bind both single- and double-stranded poly(C) sequences, functioning as a transcriptional repressor (Kang2012Novel).

PCBP3 is expressed as a fusion protein with a 6X His-tag at the carboxyl terminus when produced in E. coli, facilitating its purification via Ni-NTA His-affinity columns (Kang2012Novel). The protein's ability to interact with nucleic acids is confirmed through electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), demonstrating its dual-binding function (Kang2012Novel).

## Function
PCBP3, or poly(rC) binding protein 3, is a member of the poly(C)-binding protein family, which is involved in RNA binding and regulation. In healthy human cells, PCBP3 plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation by binding to both single-stranded and double-stranded poly(C) sequences. This dual-binding capability allows PCBP3 to function as a transcriptional repressor, as demonstrated by its ability to repress luciferase reporter expression when co-transfected with constructs containing poly(C) sequences in their promoters (Kang2012Novel).

PCBP3 contains three hnRNP K homology (KH) domains, which are RNA-binding modules that facilitate its interaction with polycytosine sequences. These interactions are crucial for its role in posttranscriptional regulation, including mRNA stabilization and translational activation or silencing (Kang2012Novel). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences gene expression and cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation.

The function of PCBP3 can be modulated by posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can alter its nucleic acid-binding activity. This suggests that PCBP3 may play a role in regulating gene expression through its interaction with poly(C) sequences, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Kang2012Novel).

## Clinical Significance
PCBP3 (poly(rC) binding protein 3) has been identified as a potential prognostic biomarker for pancreatic cancer. Its expression levels correlate with tumor stage and lymph node invasion, and higher levels are associated with better survival rates in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients (GER2018Proteomic). The interaction between PCBP3 and the long non-coding RNA A2M-AS1 is significant in promoting ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, in pancreatic cancer cells. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of iron metabolism and the modulation of signaling pathways such as p38 and AKT/mTOR, which are involved in ferroptosis (Qiu2022LncRNA). Alterations in PCBP3 expression or its interaction with A2M-AS1 could impact the progression of pancreatic cancer and patient prognosis (Qiu2022LncRNA).

While PCBP3's role in other diseases is less documented, its involvement in RNA binding and regulation suggests that mutations or expression changes could potentially affect various cellular processes, including proliferation and apoptosis. However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from PCBP3 gene mutations or expression alterations beyond pancreatic cancer are not detailed in the available literature (Zhao2022Poly(rC)binding page 0 of 7).

## Interactions
PCBP3 (poly(rC) binding protein 3) is known for its interactions with nucleic acids, specifically its ability to bind both single-stranded and double-stranded poly(C) sequences. This dual-binding capability is unique among poly(C)-binding proteins and suggests a significant role in transcriptional regulation. PCBP3 acts as a transcriptional repressor, reducing the activity of promoters containing poly(C) sequences by approximately 70% for single-stranded and 50% for double-stranded promoters in neuronal cells (Kang2012Novel).

The protein contains three hnRNP K homology (KH) domains, which are RNA-binding modules that facilitate its interaction with nucleic acids. These domains consist of three α-helices and β-strands, forming an antiparallel β-sheet structure (Kang2012Novel). PCBP3's interactions with nucleic acids were confirmed through electrophoretic mobility shift assays, which demonstrated its ability to shift labeled oligonucleotide probes, indicating a physical interaction (Kang2012Novel).

PCBP3's function as a transcriptional repressor was further demonstrated in experiments where it was shown to repress the expression of luciferase reporters when cotransfected with constructs containing poly(C) sequences in their promoters (Kang2012Novel). These findings highlight PCBP3's role in transcriptional regulation through its interactions with nucleic acids.
