# UBE2Z

## Overview
UBE2Z is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 Z, a member of the E2 enzyme family involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and regulation in eukaryotic cells. The UBE2Z protein is characterized by a ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity and interaction with other proteins in the ubiquitination pathway (Gu2006Cloning; Sheng2012A). This enzyme is uniquely activated by the E1 enzyme UBA6, distinguishing it from other E2 enzymes and suggesting a specialized role in cellular processes (van2009A; Groettrup2008Activating). UBE2Z is expressed in various human tissues, including the placenta, pancreas, spleen, and testis, and is involved in maintaining mitochondrial quality control and cellular function under stress conditions (Gu2006Cloning; RodríguezPérez2020The). Clinically, UBE2Z has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and enhanced tumor cell proliferation and invasion (Bui2021UbiquitinConjugating; Shi2020Upregulation).

## Structure
The UBE2Z gene encodes a protein that is 246 amino acids long and contains a ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain at its amino terminal, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Gu2006Cloning). This domain includes a highly conserved cysteine residue that serves as the active site for thiol ester formation with ubiquitin, a key step in the ubiquitination process (Gu2006Cloning). The UBC domain is a conserved catalytic core shared among E2 proteins, characterized by a canonical fold consisting of a four-stranded, anti-parallel curled β-sheet surrounded by α-helical segments (Sheng2012A).

The UBE2Z protein is expressed in various human tissues, with particularly high expression in the placenta, pancreas, spleen, and testis (Gu2006Cloning). It is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of AD293 cells when fused with GFP, indicating its potential involvement in multiple cellular processes (Gu2006Cloning). Although specific post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of UBE2Z are not detailed in the provided context, the presence of the UBC domain suggests it may undergo modifications typical of E2 enzymes, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions.

## Function
UBE2Z encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and regulation in eukaryotic cells. This enzyme is involved in the transfer of ubiquitin to target substrates, a process that influences protein degradation, activity, interactions, and localization (Gu2006Cloning). UBE2Z is specifically activated by the E1 enzyme UBA6, distinguishing it from other E2 enzymes and suggesting a unique role in the ubiquitylation process mediated by UBA6 (van2009A; Groettrup2008Activating).

UBE2Z is expressed in various human tissues, with high expression levels in the placenta, pancreas, spleen, and testis, and is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Gu2006Cloning). It plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial quality control and optimal cellular function during conditions such as ischemia-reperfusion and post-infarction recovery (RodríguezPérez2020The). Although UBE2Z is classified as an inactive Ub E2 variant in some assays, its specific interactions and roles in the ubiquitination network suggest it contributes to cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Sheng2012A; van2009A).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2Z is implicated in several cancers, notably hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and lung cancer, due to its altered expression levels. In HCC, UBE2Z is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and survival outcomes. This overexpression is linked to DNA amplification and decreased methylation levels, contributing to its elevated expression in cancerous tissues (Shi2020Upregulation). High UBE2Z expression is associated with advanced clinicopathological features such as advanced TNM stage, histological grade, and vascular invasion, and is a predictor of worse overall and disease-free survival in HCC patients (Shi2020Upregulation). Functional studies indicate that UBE2Z promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by modulating the ERK and STAT3 signaling pathways (Shi2020Upregulation; Lei2023Ubiquitin‑conjugating).

In lung cancer, UBE2Z is also upregulated, enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Its knockdown has been shown to reduce tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Bui2021UbiquitinConjugating). These findings underscore the clinical significance of UBE2Z in cancer progression and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
UBE2Z, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, participates in several interactions within the human ubiquitin-proteasome system. It interacts with E3 ligases, having been identified to engage with 11 different E3 ligases, which suggests its role in linking the E1 enzyme Uba6 to RING E3 ligases (van2009A). The enzyme is ubiquitin-loaded by Uba6, a process that discriminates against other E2 enzymes, indicating a specific interaction pathway (van2009A). 

The structural basis of UBE2Z's interactions is characterized by its ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is conserved among E2 enzymes. This domain includes an active-site cysteine crucial for catalysis and is surrounded by conserved residues that facilitate thioester and isopeptide bond formation. These structural features enable UBE2Z to engage in low-affinity interactions with E3 ligases, promoting its disengagement post-ubiquitination and allowing recharging by E1 enzymes (Gundogdu2019Structural).

The removal of UBE2Z from the ubiquitination network results in the disconnection of two RING domains from the second E1 for ubiquitin, Uba6, highlighting its role in maintaining specific E3 connections within the ubiquitination process (van2009A).
