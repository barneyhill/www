# SOX7

## Overview
SOX7 is a gene that encodes the SRY-box transcription factor 7, a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of transcription factors. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor and plays a pivotal role in regulating embryonic development and determining cell fate. SOX7 is particularly significant in cardiovascular development and angiogenesis, where it influences major developmental pathways such as VEGF/Flk1, Wnt, and Notch signaling (Wat2014Sox7). The protein is expressed in vascular endothelial cell precursors and is essential for the formation of arteries and veins (Wat2014Sox7). Beyond its developmental roles, SOX7 is involved in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, acting as a tumor suppressor in various cancers by modulating gene expression and cellular interactions (Fan2018SOX7; Hu2020Novel). The gene's expression and function are tightly regulated, and its dysregulation is associated with several malignancies, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2014Reduced; Guo2008Sox7).

## Function
SOX7 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in cardiovascular development and angiogenesis. It is part of the SoxF subfamily, which includes Sox17 and Sox18, and is involved in major developmental pathways such as VEGF/Flk1 signaling, Wnt signaling, and the Notch pathway, all of which are crucial for normal cardiovascular development (Wat2014Sox7). SOX7 is expressed in vascular endothelial cell precursors and is essential for the proper formation of major and branching arteries and veins (Wat2014Sox7).

In hypoxic conditions, SOX7 acts as an early regulator of angiogenesis in human endothelial cells, influencing vessel elongation and the expression of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis-related genes such as NOTCH4 and DLL4 (Klomp2020Comprehensive). It is regulated by HIF-2α during hypoxia, highlighting its role in the hypoxic response and angiogenic processes (Klomp2020Comprehensive).

SOX7 also plays a role in lineage decisions in cardiovascular progenitor cells, promoting the endothelial lineage while repressing the cardiac lineage. It interacts with WNT and BMP signaling pathways, which are crucial for cardiac differentiation (Doyle2019Sox7Regulates).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SOX7 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In ovarian cancer, SOX7 expression is significantly reduced, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This reduction correlates with tumor progression, particularly in serous cystadenocarcinoma and advanced cancer stages (Liu2014Reduced). In gastric cancer, decreased SOX7 expression is associated with the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, poor survival outcomes, and advanced disease stages (CUI2014Decreased). 

In breast cancer, SOX7 is downregulated, correlating with advanced stages and poor differentiation. It acts as a co-regulator in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, affecting cancer progression (Liu2016SOX7). In colorectal and prostate cancers, SOX7 is often inactivated through promoter methylation, which is crucial for cancer development due to its role in regulating β-catenin function (Guo2008Sox7). 

SOX7 downregulation is also observed in lung adenocarcinoma, NSCLC, and leukemia, where it is linked to metastasis, decreased survival rates, and DNA hypermethylation, respectively (Hu2020Novel). These findings highlight SOX7's potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
SOX7 is involved in several interactions that influence the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. It directly binds to β-catenin, suppressing its transcriptional activities by disrupting the β-catenin/BCL9 interaction, which impedes the formation of the β-catenin/TCF/LEF transcriptional complex. This disruption leads to the suppression of target genes such as COX2, c-Myc, FGF9, and cyclin D1 (Fan2018SOX7; Hu2020Novel). SOX7 also interacts with AXIN2, a key regulator in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, forming a negative feedback loop that controls β-catenin levels and affects breast cancer progression (Liu2016SOX7).

In addition to its role in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, SOX7 is involved in cardiovascular development. It interacts with VEGFR2, hey2, and efnb2, playing a role in arterial specification through Notch signaling. SOX7 and SOX18 induce Notch expression, which is necessary for arterial development in a Dll4-dependent manner (Hu2020Novel). These interactions highlight SOX7's multifaceted role in both tumor suppression and developmental processes.
