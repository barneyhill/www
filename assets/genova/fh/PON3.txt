# PON3

## Overview
PON3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme paraoxonase 3, a member of the paraoxonase family of enzymes. This enzyme is primarily categorized as a lactonase due to its significant lactonase activity, which surpasses its paraoxonase and arylesterase activities. Paraoxonase 3 is predominantly expressed in the liver and kidneys and circulates in the bloodstream bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, where it plays a crucial role in protecting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from oxidative modification. This antioxidative function is vital for cardiovascular protection, as it helps prevent atherosclerosis by reducing oxidative stress and lipid peroxides (Précourt2011The; Draganov2005Human). Additionally, PON3 is involved in various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism and detoxification, and has been implicated in protective roles against atherosclerosis, obesity, and certain cancers (Schweikert2012PON3; Précourt2011The). The enzyme's interactions with HDL and other cellular components underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential clinical significance in metabolic and cardiovascular diseases (Khersonsky2009Directed; Draganov2000Rabbit).

## Structure
The PON3 protein is composed of 354 amino acids and is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass ranging from 39.6 to 45 kDa, depending on the species and glycosylation status (TalerVerčič2020The; Labrecque2009Molecular). The primary structure of PON3 includes conserved histidine residues at positions 115 and 134, which are essential for its lactonase activity (Labrecque2009Molecular). The protein also contains conserved cysteine residues at positions 42, 283, and 352, with a disulfide bond between Cys 283 and Cys 352, contributing to its stability (Labrecque2009Molecular).

PON3's secondary and tertiary structures have not been fully elucidated, but it is known to have a larger active site compared to PON1, allowing it to accommodate bulkier substrates (Priyanka2019Paraoxonase). The protein is associated with high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in the bloodstream, suggesting potential quaternary interactions (Priyanka2019Paraoxonase).

Post-translational modifications include N-glycosylation at positions 50, 101, and 268, with the site at position 101 being unique to porcine PON3 (Labrecque2009Molecular). These modifications may influence the protein's activity and stability across different species (Labrecque2009Molecular). Variants of PON3, such as V1 and V2, result from the absence of certain exons, potentially leading to truncated protein forms (Labrecque2009Molecular).

## Function
PON3 (paraoxonase 3) is an enzyme primarily expressed in the liver and kidneys, circulating in the bloodstream bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. It is known for its antioxidative properties, particularly its ability to delay the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which is more effective than PON1 despite being less abundant (Précourt2011The). PON3 exhibits significant lactonase activity, which is greater than its paraoxonase or arylesterase activities, contributing to its role in reducing oxidative stress and lipid peroxides (Précourt2011The). 

In cellular conditions, PON3 is involved in metabolizing specific substrates within cells, potentially contributing to lipid metabolism or detoxification processes (Draganov2005Human). It is also associated with protective roles against atherosclerosis and obesity, and its expression is linked to smaller atherosclerotic lesions and reduced monocyte chemotaxis in transgenic mice (Précourt2011The). PON3 is active in various tissues, including the lung, liver, pancreas, and intestine, and is upregulated in late gestation, suggesting an antioxidative role in newborns (Précourt2011The). The enzyme's activity is largely cell-associated, with only a small fraction secreted, indicating its primary function within cells (Draganov2005Human).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the PON3 gene is primarily associated with its role in coronary artery disease (CAD), cancer, and metabolic disorders. Although PON3's involvement in CAD is not as well understood as PON1, some studies suggest that PON3 may influence PON1 activity, which is known to be associated with CAD risk (Priyanka2019Paraoxonase). PON3 is also implicated in oxidative stress and inflammation, which are critical factors in atherosclerosis and CAD. Its expression is upregulated in late gestation, indicating a protective role in newborns, and is downregulated in inflammatory bowel diseases (Priyanka2019Paraoxonase).

In cancer, PON3 is frequently upregulated in various tumor types, contributing to antiapoptotic mechanisms and potentially leading to chemotherapeutic resistance. This suggests that reducing PON3 expression could enhance cancer treatment effectiveness, although systemic downregulation poses risks (Witte2012Protectors). PON3's antioxidative and antiapoptotic functions may aid early tumor formation by providing a platform for malignant transformation (Witte2012Protectors).

PON3's role in obesity and adiposity has been observed in animal models, where its overexpression is linked to reduced atherosclerotic lesions and adiposity, indicating potential in obesity control and atherosclerosis prevention (Priyanka2019Paraoxonase).

## Interactions
Paraoxonase 3 (PON3) is known to interact with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, which enhances its stability and lactonase activity. This interaction is significant as it contributes to PON3's role in protecting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from oxidative modification, a key factor in cardiovascular protection (Khersonsky2009Directed; Draganov2000Rabbit). PON3 is associated with HDL in both rabbit and human serum, and its presence in HDL particles is crucial for its enzymatic function and stability (Khersonsky2009Directed).

PON3 also interacts with the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunits, acting as a chaperone that decreases the functional expression of ENaC. This interaction reduces the surface expression of ENaC subunits, thereby inhibiting ENaC activity, which has implications for sodium balance and blood pressure regulation (Shi2020Paraoxonase). Immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that PON3 specifically interacts with ENaC subunits when coexpressed in cells, highlighting its role in modulating ion channel expression (Shi2020Paraoxonase).

In cancer biology, PON3 interacts with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and likely sequesters ubisemiquinone, which enhances resistance to cell death by reducing mitochondrial superoxide formation (Schweikert2012PON3). This interaction is crucial for PON3's protective role against mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptosis.
