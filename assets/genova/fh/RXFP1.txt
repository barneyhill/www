# RXFP1

## Overview
The RXFP1 gene encodes the relaxin family peptide receptor 1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in mediating the physiological effects of the hormone relaxin. This receptor is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a low-density lipoprotein receptor type A (LDLa) module, essential for ligand binding and receptor activation, respectively (Halls2015International; Chen2020The). RXFP1 is involved in various biological processes, including vasodilation, cell differentiation, and the inhibition of profibrotic signaling, through its activation of multiple signal transduction pathways such as cAMP production and nitric oxide signaling (Halls2015International). The receptor is expressed in diverse tissues, including the reproductive organs, heart, and brain, and is implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and fibrotic diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Thanasupawat2019Emerging; Chen2020The).

## Structure
The RXFP1 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes distinct domains essential for its function. The extracellular region of RXFP1 features a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which is crucial for high-affinity ligand binding, particularly with the relaxin hormone. This domain is composed of ten LRRs, providing a relatively flat surface for interaction (Petrie2015In; Chen2020The). The LRR domain is connected to an N-terminal low-density lipoprotein receptor type A (LDLa) module, which is vital for receptor activation but not for ligand binding (Halls2015International; Sethi2016The).

The transmembrane region of RXFP1 consists of seven α-helices typical of GPCRs, facilitating signal transduction. This region includes specific transmembrane domains (TM6 and TM7) that interact with small molecule agonists at an allosteric site (Hu2016Structural). The intracellular region contains loops and a C-terminal tail that are important for G-protein coupling (Chen2020The).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation at specific residues, are important for receptor translocation to the cell surface and signaling efficacy (Halls2015International). RXFP1 can form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure component (Chen2020The).

## Function
RXFP1 (relaxin family peptide receptor 1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various physiological processes through its interaction with the hormone relaxin. In healthy human cells, RXFP1 is involved in the relaxin signaling pathway, which is crucial for processes such as vasodilation, cell differentiation, and inhibition of profibrotic signaling (Chen2020The). The receptor is expressed in multiple tissues, including the ovary, uterus, placenta, heart, and brain, where it mediates relaxin's effects by coupling to several signal transduction pathways, including cAMP production, ERK1/2 activation, and nitric oxide (NO) signaling (Halls2015International).

RXFP1 activation leads to increased cAMP accumulation, which is essential for various cellular responses, including the regulation of collagen turnover and vasodilation (Halls2015International). The receptor's structure includes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and a low-density lipoprotein class A (LDLa) module, which are important for ligand binding and receptor activation (Chen2020The). RXFP1 also forms part of a signalosome complex, allowing for high-sensitivity signaling in response to relaxin, which is crucial for its protective roles against fibrosis in tissues such as the lungs, kidneys, and heart (Halls2015International; Chen2020The).

## Clinical Significance
The RXFP1 gene, encoding the relaxin family peptide receptor 1, is implicated in various diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disrupted interactions. In cancer, RXFP1 is associated with tumor growth and metastasis. In prostate cancer, RXFP1 expression does not differ between normal and cancerous tissues, but its activation by ligands like RLN1 and RLN2 correlates with higher tumor grades and poor clinical outcomes. Silencing RXFP1 reduces tumor growth and metastasis, highlighting its role as a survival factor (Feng2010Suppression; Thanasupawat2019Emerging). In glioblastoma, RXFP1 activation enhances DNA repair and chemoresistance, contributing to therapy resistance (Glogowska2021Novel; Thanasupawat2019Emerging).

In fibrotic diseases such as systemic sclerosis (SSc) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), RXFP1 expression is significantly reduced, leading to insensitivity to relaxin and reduced efficacy of relaxin-based therapies (Corallo2018AB0185; Chen2020The). The altered expression and function of RXFP1 in these conditions may be due to alternative splice variants, which can exert a dominant negative effect on the receptor's function (Corallo2018AB0185). These findings underscore the potential of RXFP1 as a therapeutic target in both cancer and fibrotic diseases.

## Interactions
The relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that primarily interacts with the hormone relaxin. This interaction involves a complex, multi-step binding mechanism where relaxin binds to the extracellular domain (ECD) of RXFP1, specifically engaging with the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and linker domains. The LDLa module of RXFP1 plays a crucial role in receptor activation by interacting with the transmembrane domain (TMD) to promote active receptor conformations (Hoare2019MultiComponent).

Mutations in key residues of the LRR domain can abolish relaxin binding, highlighting the importance of these interactions in the initial binding step (Hoare2019MultiComponent). The LDLa module also influences relaxin binding by stabilizing a higher-affinity state of the ECD, and its removal can subtly decrease relaxin binding affinity (Hoare2019MultiComponent).

RXFP1 interactions are not limited to relaxin binding. The receptor can also interact with cytosolic signaling proteins, including G proteins, which are essential for signal transduction. The intracellular region of RXFP1, comprising intracellular loops and a C-terminal tail, is important for G-protein coupling, which modulates downstream signaling pathways such as adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP (cAMP) production (Chen2020The).
