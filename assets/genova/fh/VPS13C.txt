# VPS13C

## Overview
VPS13C is a gene that encodes the vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog C, a large, multi-domain protein involved in lipid transport and intracellular trafficking. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and membrane expansion, and is categorized as a lipid transport protein. VPS13C is localized at contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum and late endosomes/lysosomes, as well as lipid droplets, facilitating lipid transport through a hydrophobic channel. It is implicated in various cellular processes, including autophagy, cytoskeletal organization, and mitochondrial homeostasis. Mutations in the VPS13C gene have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Lewy body diseases such as Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative pathology (Smolders2020Homozygous; Schormair2018Diagnostic; Ugur2020Role).

## Structure
The VPS13C protein is a large, multi-domain structure encoded by the VPS13C gene, which spans 208 kb and consists of 86 exons (VelayosBaeza2004Analysis). The protein is characterized by an internal duplication of 494 amino acids, encoded by 11 exons, contributing to its larger size compared to other VPS13 family members (VelayosBaeza2004Analysis). This duplication results in fragments with 51% identity and 73% equivalence, and a third region (amino acids 509-804) shows significant sequence similarity to these duplicated regions (VelayosBaeza2004Analysis).

VPS13C contains several conserved domains, including the DUF1162 motif and an R domain, which are shared with VPS13A and VPS13D (VelayosBaeza2004Analysis). The protein also features a lysine-rich motif and a P-X4-P-X13-17-G sequence, which are conserved elements within the family (VelayosBaeza2004Analysis). The structure includes an extended β-sheet forming a 'basket' and α-helices forming a 'handle', with a hydrophobic groove that binds lipids, facilitating lipid transport between membrane bilayers (Ugur2020Role).

Alternative splicing results in different isoforms, with the main splicing forms being variants 1A and 2A. Variant 2A is brain-specific and includes a Lys-rich domain encoded by exon 7 (VelayosBaeza2004Analysis). These structural features are crucial for VPS13C's role in lipid transport and its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases (Ugur2020Role).

## Function
VPS13C is a gene that encodes a protein involved in lipid transport and intracellular trafficking, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and membrane expansion. In healthy human cells, VPS13C is localized at contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and late endosomes/lysosomes, as well as between the ER and lipid droplets. This localization is mediated by an FFAT motif-dependent interaction with the ER integral membrane protein VAP, facilitating lipid transport through a hydrophobic channel similar to the autophagy protein ATG2 (Ugur2020Role).

The protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including autophagy, cytoskeletal organization, and mitochondrial homeostasis. VPS13C's role in lipid transport is essential for these processes, contributing to cellular functions such as membrane growth and energy metabolism (Ugur2020Role). Additionally, VPS13C is involved in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and stress response, and it participates in adipogenesis by binding galectin-12, which is necessary for adipogenic signaling and adipocyte differentiation (Rzepnikowska2017Yeast).

VPS13C is also associated with the regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion, particularly in pancreatic β-cells, where it colocalizes with insulin-containing granules, suggesting a role in the distribution or properties of secretory granules (Mehta2016Changes).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VPS13C gene are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Lewy body diseases (LBD), which include Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Homozygous and compound heterozygous rare variants in VPS13C have been linked to early-onset parkinsonism, characterized by rapid disease progression and cognitive decline. These mutations often result in loss-of-function, such as premature termination codon mutations or deletions, contributing to early-onset PD with cognitive deterioration (Smolders2020Homozygous; Schormair2018Diagnostic).

The presence of rare missense variants in VPS13C, such as p.Trp395Cys and p.Ala444Pro, has been identified in patients with DLB and PD, suggesting a recessive inheritance pattern. These variants are associated with reduced protein expression and altered subcellular localization, which may contribute to disease pathology (Smolders2020Homozygous; Smolders2021Contribution). Neuropathological findings in affected individuals often include severe neuronal loss and the presence of Lewy bodies in various brain regions (Smolders2021Contribution).

VPS13C mutations have also been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction, as the gene is partially localized at the mitochondrial membrane. This dysfunction is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of early-onset PD (Rudakou2020Analysis).

## Interactions
VPS13C is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with Rab7a, a GTPase that marks late endosomes and lysosomes, facilitating its recruitment to these organelles. This interaction is essential for maintaining lysosomal homeostasis, as demonstrated by the diffuse cytosolic distribution of VPS13C when co-expressed with a dominant negative mutant Rab7a that cannot localize to late endosomes/lysosomes (HancockCerutti2021ERlysosome).

VPS13C also binds to galectin-12, a protein involved in adipocyte differentiation and lipolysis. This interaction is necessary for maintaining galectin-12 protein stability, as VPS13C knockdown leads to its degradation through the lysosomal pathway. The interaction between VPS13C and galectin-12 is critical for adipogenesis, as evidenced by impaired adipocyte differentiation upon VPS13C knockdown (Yang2016Identification).

In brown adipocytes, VPS13C interacts with ER proteins VAPA and VAPB, which mediate ER-organelle interactions and lipid transfer. This suggests a role for VPS13C in lipid droplet dynamics and lipolysis regulation, as its knockdown results in altered lipid droplet size and increased lipolysis (Ramseyer2018Vacuolar).
