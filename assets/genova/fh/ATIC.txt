# ATIC

## Overview
The ATIC gene encodes the bifunctional enzyme 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase, which plays a pivotal role in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the final two steps of purine biosynthesis, converting 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) to inosine monophosphate (IMP), a precursor for adenine and guanine nucleotides. These nucleotides are essential for DNA and RNA synthesis, energy metabolism, and cellular signaling (Ramond2020AICA‐ribosiduria; Mazzarino2020The). The ATIC protein functions as a homodimer and is active in the cytoplasm, where it ensures the efficient conversion of AICAR to IMP, preventing the accumulation of AICAR, which can activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and disrupt cellular metabolism (Mazzarino2020The). Mutations in the ATIC gene can lead to metabolic disorders such as AICA-ribosiduria, characterized by severe neurodevelopmental impairment and other systemic symptoms (Ramond2020AICA‐ribosiduria; Dewulf2022Disorders). Additionally, alterations in ATIC expression have been implicated in cancer progression, highlighting its clinical significance (Kelemen2012Regular).

## Structure
The ATIC protein, also known as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase/IMP cyclohydrolase, is a bifunctional enzyme involved in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway. It is a dimeric protein, with each monomer containing two distinct active sites capable of binding nucleotide substrates. The enzyme's quaternary structure involves a monomer-dimer equilibrium, with a Kdim of 0.55 µM, and dimerization is necessary for its transformylase activity, although the monomeric form is sufficient for cyclohydrolase activity (Witkowska2018Analysis).

The ATIC protein consists of two domains: the C-terminal AICAR Tfase domain (residues 200-593) and the N-terminal IMPCH domain (residues 1-199). The AICAR Tfase domain is responsible for transferring a formyl group from N10-formyltetrahydrofolate to AICAR, while the IMPCH domain catalyzes the final step of the pathway (Tavassoli2005Genetically). Structural studies have shown that ATIC forms an intertwined dimer, with the two catalytic sites separated by approximately 50 Å (Witkowska2018Analysis).

The enzyme's structure is highly homologous between avian and human forms, with an 82% sequence identity (Witkowska2018Analysis). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation can alter its tertiary structure and confer a neo-antigenic structure (Heo2020Cyclic).

## Function
The ATIC gene encodes a bifunctional enzyme that plays a crucial role in the de novo purine biosynthesis (DNPS) pathway in human cells. This enzyme, known as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase, catalyzes the final two steps of purine biosynthesis. It converts 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) to inosine monophosphate (IMP), a precursor for the synthesis of adenine and guanine nucleotides, which are essential for DNA and RNA synthesis, energy metabolism, and cellular signaling (Ramond2020AICA‐ribosiduria; Mazzarino2020The).

In healthy human cells, ATIC functions as a homodimer and is active in the cytoplasm, ensuring the efficient conversion of AICAR to IMP. This prevents the accumulation of AICAR, which can act as an AMP mimetic and activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular metabolism (Mazzarino2020The). The proper functioning of ATIC is vital for maintaining normal cellular processes, including cell proliferation and energy homeostasis (Heo2020Cyclic). Deficiencies in ATIC can lead to metabolic disruptions and are associated with severe developmental defects (Ramond2020AICA‐ribosiduria).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATIC gene can lead to AICA-ribosiduria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe neurodevelopmental impairment, visual impairment due to chorioretinal atrophy, growth impairment, and scoliosis. This condition is marked by the accumulation of AICA-riboside in urine and is associated with dysmorphic features, early-onset epilepsy, and other symptoms such as aortic coarctation and nephrocalcinosis (Ramond2020AICA‐ribosiduria; Dewulf2022Disorders). The disorder is biochemically detectable by elevated levels of AICA-riboside, SAICA-riboside, and succinyladenosine in urine and cerebrospinal fluid (Ramond2020AICA‐ribosiduria).

ATIC deficiency also results in the accumulation of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (ZMP), which can activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and affect cellular metabolism. This accumulation is studied using a CRISPR-Cas9 model in HeLa cells, which helps explore the impact of ATIC mutations on transcription, translation, and metabolism (Mazzarino2020The).

Alterations in ATIC expression have been linked to cancer, as its overexpression can promote tumor growth by enhancing nucleotide synthesis. Additionally, genetic variants in ATIC may influence the risk of ovarian carcinoma, particularly in the context of multivitamin use (Kelemen2012Regular).

## Interactions
ATIC, a bifunctional enzyme involved in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, participates in several protein-protein interactions within the purinosome, a multi-protein complex. This complex facilitates the efficient synthesis of purines by compartmentalizing six enzymes, including ATIC, in response to cellular purine levels. ATIC interacts with a core group of enzymes such as PPAT, TGART, and FGAMS, which catalyze the initial steps of the purine biosynthetic pathway. These interactions are dynamic and regulated by cellular signaling pathways, including those involving GPCRs and kinases (Zhao2013The).

The enzyme's activity is also influenced by its homodimerization, which is essential for its AICAR transformylase function. The crystal structure of ATIC reveals it as a dimer with a significant interface, highlighting the importance of this interaction for its enzymatic activity (Tavassoli2005Genetically). Inhibition of ATIC dimerization has been explored as a therapeutic strategy, with studies identifying small molecules that disrupt this interaction (Witkowska2018Analysis).

Additionally, ATIC's transcription is regulated by lncRNA ZFAS1, which binds to the upstream region of the ATIC gene, promoting its expression and contributing to hepatocellular carcinoma progression through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Luo2024LncRNA).
