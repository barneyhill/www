# RPUSD1

## Overview
RPUSD1 (RNA pseudouridine synthase domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the pseudouridylation of RNA, a critical post-transcriptional modification that enhances RNA stability and function. The protein, categorized as a pseudouridine synthase, is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing, thereby contributing to protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis (Ding2024Implications; Xie2022GenomeWide). While the specific mechanisms of RPUSD1's action remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in fundamental cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining RNA integrity. Additionally, RPUSD1 has been implicated in various cancers, including glioma and hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and prognosis, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Jin2022Integrative; Wang2022Gene).

## Function
RPUSD1 (RNA pseudouridine synthase domain containing 1) is involved in the pseudouridylation process, which is the conversion of uridine to pseudouridine in RNA molecules. This modification is crucial for RNA stability and function, impacting various RNA species such as tRNA and rRNA (Ding2024Implications). The protein encoded by RPUSD1 is active in the nucleolus, where it plays a role in ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing, contributing to protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis (Xie2022GenomeWide).

The specific mechanism of RPUSD1-mediated pseudouridylation is not fully understood, but it is known to be part of a broader family of pseudouridine synthases that are essential for maintaining RNA integrity and function (Ding2024Implications). In healthy human cells, RPUSD1's activity in the nucleolus suggests its involvement in the fundamental processes of ribosome assembly and function, which are critical for efficient protein synthesis and overall cellular function (Xie2022GenomeWide). Despite its recognized role in RNA modification, the precise biological outcomes of RPUSD1 activity in healthy cells remain an area for further research.

## Clinical Significance
RPUSD1 has been implicated in various cancers, including glioma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In gliomas, RPUSD1 is upregulated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) compared to low-grade gliomas (LGG), and its expression is associated with higher malignancy and poor prognosis. It is part of a risk-score signature that predicts clinical outcomes and overall survival in glioma patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Wang2022Gene). The expression of RPUSD1 is also linked to the tumor microenvironment and immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in tumor progression and local immunity (Wang2022Gene).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, RPUSD1 is upregulated in advanced or poorly differentiated tissues, although its role as an independent prognostic marker is less clear. It is associated with poor overall survival in univariate analysis, but not in multivariate analysis, indicating that while it may contribute to tumor progression, it is not a standalone prognostic factor (Jin2022Integrative).

RPUSD1 has also been mentioned in the context of ATR-16 syndrome, where chromatin structure changes due to deletions can lead to gene misexpression, although RPUSD1 itself remains intact (Babbs2020ATR16).
