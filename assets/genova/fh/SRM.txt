# SRM

## Overview
The SRM gene encodes the enzyme spermidine synthase, which is a key component of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway. Spermidine synthase is classified as a transferase enzyme, specifically catalyzing the transfer of an aminopropyl group from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine to putrescine, resulting in the production of spermidine. Spermidine is a polyamine that plays a critical role in cellular growth, differentiation, and homeostasis by stabilizing DNA, regulating ion channels, and modulating enzyme activities. The SRM gene's expression and the activity of its encoded enzyme are crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing abnormal cell growth, with implications in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer and genetic disorders (MurrayStewart2018Polyamine; Miao2016Macrophage).

## Structure


## Function
The SRM gene encodes spermidine synthase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in polyamine biosynthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of an aminopropyl group from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine to putrescine, resulting in the formation of spermidine. Spermidine is a polyamine that is essential for cell growth and differentiation due to its ability to stabilize DNA, regulate ion channels, and modulate enzyme activities. The activity of spermidine synthase is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting various cellular functions (Miao2016Macrophage).

In healthy human cells, the production of spermidine is vital for normal cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression and the stabilization of nucleic acid structures. Polyamines like spermidine are involved in the modulation of ion channels and the activity of several enzymes, which are critical for cellular proliferation and differentiation. The regulation of spermidine levels is important for maintaining cellular function and preventing abnormal cell growth, highlighting the significance of the SRM gene in normal physiology (Miao2016Macrophage).

## Interactions
Spermidine synthase (SRM) is involved in the biosynthesis of spermidine, a polyamine critical for cellular growth and proliferation. SRM catalyzes the transfer of an aminopropyl group from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcAdoMet) to putrescine, forming spermidine. This reaction is part of a larger polyamine biosynthesis pathway that includes interactions with other enzymes such as S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) (MurrayStewart2018Polyamine).

In the context of colorectal cancer, SRM expression is regulated by the transcription factor C/EBPe. The binding of C/EBPe to the SRM promoter is modulated by ABHD5, a lipolytic co-activator, which suppresses SRM expression in macrophages. This interaction is part of a regulatory pathway involving reactive oxygen species (ROS) and C/EBPe, which influences spermidine production and colorectal cancer growth (Miao2016Macrophage).

SRM's role in polyamine metabolism is also highlighted in the context of Snyder-Robinson Syndrome, where its expression is upregulated in certain cell lines, although protein levels remain similar to wild-type lines. This suggests a complex regulatory mechanism involving SRM and other polyamine pathway enzymes (MurrayStewart2018Polyamine).
