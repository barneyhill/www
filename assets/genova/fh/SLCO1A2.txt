# SLCO1A2

## Overview
The SLCO1A2 gene encodes the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2), a member of the solute carrier (SLC) family, which functions as a transmembrane transporter protein. OATP1A2 is involved in the transport of a diverse array of organic anions across cell membranes, playing a critical role in the uptake and distribution of endogenous substrates and drugs across various tissues, including the brain, liver, kidney, intestine, and blood-brain barrier (Hagenbuch2013The; Eloranta2012TheSLCO1A2Gene). The protein's structure, characterized by twelve transmembrane domains, is essential for its function in substrate recognition and transport (Hagenbuch2013The; Hong2014Critical). OATP1A2's activity is modulated by factors such as pH and vitamin D3 levels, which influence its interaction with substrates and regulatory proteins (Morita2020pHdependent; Eloranta2012TheSLCO1A2Gene). Variants in the SLCO1A2 gene can significantly impact drug pharmacokinetics and are associated with clinical conditions such as methotrexate toxicity and progressive supranuclear palsy, highlighting its importance in personalized medicine (Badagnani2006Interaction; SanchezContreras2018Replication).

## Structure
The SLCO1A2 gene encodes the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2), a member of the solute carrier (SLC) family. The protein is characterized by a structure comprising twelve transmembrane domains, which are essential for its function in transporting a wide range of compounds, including drugs and endogenous substances (Hagenbuch2013The; Hong2014Critical). These transmembrane domains are crucial for substrate recognition and transport function, with specific domains like TM6 being significant for protein stability and function (Hong2014Critical).

OATP1A2 contains conserved cysteine residues in extracellular loop 5, which are important for maintaining structural integrity and proper processing of the protein (Hong2014Critical). Glycosylation sites are present and play a role in protein stability and expression, affecting the transporter's function (Hong2014Critical). The protein also features a Class I PDZ binding domain at its carboxyl terminus, which may be involved in protein-protein interactions and intracellular signaling, although detailed effects on OATP1A2 are not fully understood (Hong2014Critical).

Genetic variants of OATP1A2, such as p. Ile13Thr and p. Glu172Asp, can alter transport function, highlighting the impact of sequence variations on its activity (Badagnani2006Interaction).

## Function
The SLCO1A2 gene encodes the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2), which is involved in the transport of a wide range of organic anions across cell membranes. This protein is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, liver, kidney, intestine, and blood-brain barrier, where it plays a crucial role in the uptake and distribution of endogenous substrates and drugs (Hagenbuch2013The; Eloranta2012TheSLCO1A2Gene).

OATP1A2 facilitates the transport of bile acids, steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, prostaglandin E2, and several pharmacological agents, contributing to processes such as detoxification, drug metabolism, and the transport of endogenous compounds (Hagenbuch2013The; Hagenbuch2004Organic). In the intestine, OATP1A2 is involved in drug absorption, while in the liver and kidney, it plays a role in drug uptake and reabsorption, respectively (Yamakawa2011Pharmacokinetic).

The expression of SLCO1A2 is regulated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which can be activated by vitamin D3. This regulation suggests that vitamin D3 administration could modulate the intestinal absorption of OATP1A2 transport substrates, impacting pharmacological outcomes (Eloranta2012TheSLCO1A2Gene). The protein's activity at the blood-brain barrier indicates its importance in delivering drugs and neuroactive peptides to the brain and removing organic metabolites (Hagenbuch2004Organic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLCO1A2 gene, which encodes the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2), have significant clinical implications. Variants in SLCO1A2 can affect drug pharmacokinetics, leading to altered drug efficacy and toxicity. For instance, genetic variations such as p. Ile13Thr and p. Glu172Asp have been shown to modify the transport function of OATP1A2, impacting the disposition and toxicity of methotrexate (MTX), a drug used in cancer and autoimmune disease treatments (Badagnani2006Interaction).

In rheumatoid arthritis patients, specific SLCO1A2 variants are associated with increased risk of MTX toxicity, highlighting the gene's role in drug response variability (Wang2020Association). Additionally, the SLCO1A2 gene has been identified as a susceptibility locus for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a neurodegenerative disorder, with the p.E172D variant affecting protein function and potentially contributing to disease pathology (SanchezContreras2018Replication).

Alterations in SLCO1A2 expression, influenced by factors such as vitamin D3, can also impact drug absorption and metabolism, further affecting clinical outcomes (Eloranta2012TheSLCO1A2Gene). These findings underscore the importance of SLCO1A2 in personalized medicine and its potential role in various diseases.

## Interactions
The SLCO1A2 gene encodes the human organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2), which is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. OATP1A2 is transactivated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which binds to a specific VDR-responsive element (VDRE) in the SLCO1A2 promoter region. This interaction is facilitated by VDR forming a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα), which directly interacts with the DR-3-like motif in the promoter region, leading to the transcriptional activation of SLCO1A2 in response to vitamin D3 (Eloranta2012TheSLCO1A2Gene).

The transport activity of OATP1A2 is also influenced by extracellular pH, which affects its interaction with substrates and inhibitors. The presence of a histidine residue in the third transmembrane domain of OATP1A2 is suggested to contribute to its pH sensitivity, impacting its transport kinetics (Morita2020pHdependent). These interactions highlight the role of OATP1A2 in drug absorption and disposition, as its activity can be modulated by both genetic and environmental factors, such as pH and vitamin D3 levels.
