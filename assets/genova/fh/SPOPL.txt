# SPOPL

## Overview
SPOPL (speckle type BTB/POZ protein like) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of endocytic trafficking within human cells. The protein, also referred to as SPOPL, functions as a substrate-specific adaptor for the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, specifically the CRL3 complex, which is essential for the ubiquitination and degradation of proteins involved in endocytic pathways. SPOPL is characterized by its BTB/POZ domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and it shares significant homology with its close homolog SPOP, particularly in the MATH domain responsible for substrate recognition. However, SPOPL is distinct due to an 18 amino acid insertion in its BACK domain, affecting its dimerization and potentially its subcellular localization and substrate specificity. The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it associates with endosomes and plays a critical role in the maturation of late endosomes and the regulation of endocytic adaptor proteins like EPS15. Alterations in SPOPL expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in tumorigenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (Hu2023SPOPL; Gschweitl2016A).

## Structure
SPOPL is a protein that shares significant homology with SPOP, particularly in the MATH domain, which is responsible for substrate recognition (Gschweitl2016A). The SPOPL protein contains a BTB/POZ domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and contributes to the formation of homodimers or heterodimers (Gschweitl2016A). Unlike SPOP, SPOPL has an 18 amino acid insertion in its BACK domain, which affects its dimerization capabilities and may influence its subcellular localization and substrate specificity (Hu2017Expression; Gschweitl2016A).

SPOPL is part of a CUL3 E3 ligase complex and is involved in endocytic trafficking, specifically localizing to endosomes where it ubiquitinates substrates like EPS15 (Gschweitl2016A). The protein is expressed in E. coli for research purposes, using a His-StrepII 2x-SUMO N-terminal solubility tag to aid in purification (Gschweitl2016A). The presence of splice variants may result in different isoforms, potentially affecting the protein's functional properties (Gschweitl2016A). The molecular structure of SPOPL, including specific details on its tertiary and quaternary structures, is not fully detailed in the available context.

## Function
SPOPL (speckle type BTB/POZ protein like) is a gene encoding a protein that plays a significant role in endocytic trafficking within human cells. It functions as a substrate-specific adaptor for the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, specifically the CRL3 complex, which is crucial for the ubiquitination and degradation of proteins involved in endocytic pathways (Gschweitl2016A). SPOPL is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it associates with endosomes and is involved in the maturation of late endosomes (Gschweitl2016A).

One of the key roles of SPOPL is targeting the endocytic adaptor protein EPS15 for ubiquitination, which leads to its degradation by the proteasome. This process is essential for maintaining proper levels of EPS15 and regulating endocytic trafficking and endosomal sorting (Gschweitl2016A). The ubiquitination of EPS15 by the CRL3 SPOPL complex is crucial for the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the endocytic entry of certain viruses, such as influenza A (Gschweitl2016A).

SPOPL's activity influences the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by ensuring proper sorting into the lysosomal pathway, thus preventing excessive degradation (Gschweitl2016A). This regulation is vital for cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways, highlighting SPOPL's importance in maintaining cellular function and integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SPOPL gene have been implicated in various cancers. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), high SPOPL expression is associated with increased tumorigenicity and poor prognosis. SPOPL promotes the proliferation and stemness of glioma stem cells (GSCs) by activating the Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining the tumorigenic properties of these cells (Hu2023SPOPL). In contrast, in medulloblastoma (MB), a common malignant brain tumor in children, SPOPL expression is typically decreased. Lower SPOPL levels are associated with reduced differentiation and poorer clinical outcomes, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role in this context (Hu2017Expression).

SPOPL also plays a role in osteosarcoma, where it is targeted by miR-197-3p. This interaction enhances cancer stemness and chemoresistance, indicating that the miR-197-3p-SPOPL axis is significant in the pathology of osteosarcoma (Zhang2023miR1973p). Additionally, SPOPL is involved in endocytic trafficking, and its dysfunction can affect processes such as receptor degradation and viral entry, which may have broader implications for diseases related to endocytic trafficking defects (Gschweitl2016A).

## Interactions
SPOPL (speckle type BTB/POZ protein like) is involved in several protein interactions, primarily through its role as a substrate-specific adaptor in the CUL3 ubiquitin ligase complex. SPOPL interacts with EPS15, a scaffolding adaptor protein involved in endocytic trafficking. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of EPS15, which is mediated by the CRL3 SPOPL complex (Gschweitl2016A). The ubiquitination of EPS15 by SPOPL occurs at lysine 793, a site near the ubiquitin-interacting motifs, and is essential for regulating endosome maturation and the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Gschweitl2016A).

SPOPL can form heterodimers with its close homolog SPOP, although SPOPL has an 18 amino-acid insertion that affects its subcellular localization and interaction dynamics. This insertion prevents BACK-mediated dimerization, which can cap SPOP oligomers and reduce their size, thereby decreasing ubiquitination efficiency (Cuneo2019The; Gschweitl2016A). Despite these differences, SPOPL and SPOP share identical residues at the SBC binding site, suggesting they may recognize similar substrates (Zhuang2024Insights). These interactions highlight SPOPL's role in modulating protein degradation pathways and influencing cellular processes such as endocytic trafficking.
