# TRIM4

## Overview
TRIM4 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 4, which is a member of the TRIM protein family. This family is characterized by a tripartite motif that includes a RING finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, all of which are crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Sardiello2008Genomic; Napolitano2011TRIM). The TRIM4 protein plays a significant role in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for protein degradation, regulation of signaling pathways, and modulation of immune responses. It is particularly involved in the RIG-I-mediated signaling pathway, where it enhances antiviral signaling by facilitating the synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on RIG-I, a receptor that detects viral RNA (Langevin2019Fish; Hatakeyama2017TRIM). TRIM4's involvement in immune signaling and its interactions with various proteins underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and defense mechanisms. Additionally, TRIM4 has been implicated in several diseases, including neural tube defects and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2019TRIM4; Gao2022Pancancer).

## Structure
TRIM4 is a member of the TRIM protein family, characterized by a tripartite motif that includes a RING finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil (CC) region. The RING domain is crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 enzyme to target proteins (Napolitano2011TRIM; Sardiello2008Genomic). The B-box domains, which are zinc-binding, contribute to the structural integrity and function of TRIM4, although their precise role remains unclear (Napolitano2011TRIM). The coiled-coil region is essential for homointeractions, allowing TRIM4 to form high molecular weight homocomplexes, often as homotrimers, which are important for its functional activity (Napolitano2011TRIM).

TRIM4 also contains a C-terminal PRY-SPRY domain, also known as the B30.2 domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and RNA-binding, playing a role in antiviral immune responses (Langevin2019Fish; Sardiello2008Genomic). This domain structure allows TRIM4 to positively regulate the RIG-I pathway by ligating polyubiquitin chains to RIG-I, enhancing antiviral signaling (Langevin2019Fish).

TRIM4 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms that may have distinct regulatory effects, although the impact on its E3 ligase activity is not fully understood (Napolitano2011TRIM). Additionally, TRIM4 is involved in K63-linked polyubiquitination, a post-translational modification crucial for its role in antiviral immune responses (Zhang2023SARSCoV2).

## Function
TRIM4, a member of the TRIM protein family, functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination process. This activity is essential for protein degradation, regulation of signaling pathways, and modulation of immune responses. TRIM4 is involved in the RIG-I-mediated signaling pathway, where it collaborates with TRIM25 to synthesize K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on RIG-I. This modification is a critical step for the activation of RIG-I, a receptor that detects viral RNA, thereby initiating an innate immune response (Hatakeyama2017TRIM).

TRIM proteins, including TRIM4, are characterized by a tripartite motif that includes a RING finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. These structural features enable TRIM4 to interact with various substrates and participate in diverse cellular processes. While the specific roles of TRIM4 in healthy human cells are not extensively detailed, its involvement in immune signaling suggests a significant function in maintaining cellular homeostasis and defense mechanisms (Hatakeyama2017TRIM). TRIM4 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of protein interactions and enzymatic activities essential for cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
TRIM4 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations and alterations in its expression levels. In the context of neural tube defects (NTDs), TRIM4 is found to be differentially methylated, with significant hypomethylation in exon 1 observed in NTD cases. This hypomethylation is associated with increased TRIM4 mRNA and protein levels, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of NTDs through epigenetic modifications rather than direct genetic mutations (Zhang2019TRIM4). The study indicates that TRIM4 may influence NTDs by affecting immune and mitochondrial pathways, potentially linking it to NF-kB signaling and mitochondrial stress (Zhang2019TRIM4).

In cancer, TRIM4 is identified as a potential driver gene with significant mutations, particularly in the coiled-coil domain. Mutations such as T228M and K230N have been found in multiple patients, suggesting a possible role in cancer development. These mutations are located in critical protein domains, which may lead to deleterious effects in cancer due to their impact on protein function (Gao2022Pancancer). The involvement of TRIM4 in these conditions highlights its clinical significance in both developmental and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
TRIM4 is known to interact with several proteins, playing significant roles in various cellular processes. One notable interaction is with the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) protein NSP2. TRIM4 mediates the ubiquitination of NSP2, leading to its degradation and thereby inhibiting PRRSV replication. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, and the ubiquitination process was shown to be proteasome-dependent (Zhao2022TRIM4mediated).

TRIM4 also interacts with TRPM8, a cation channel, regulating its function through ubiquitination. TRIM4 promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRPM8 at the N-terminal lysine residue 423, which reduces its expression on the plasma membrane and decreases channel activity. This interaction involves the SPRY domain of TRIM4 and the C-terminus of TRPM8, and was confirmed through GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Huang2020TRIM4).

Additionally, TRIM4 is involved in the regulation of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway, where it catalyzes the ligation of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains onto RIG-I's CARD domain, suggesting a role in the positive regulation of the RIG-I pathway (Van2017The; Shen2021The).
