# RAC2

## Overview
RAC2 is a gene that encodes the Rac family small GTPase 2, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, which are pivotal in regulating various cellular processes. The RAC2 protein functions as a molecular switch, cycling between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state, thereby modulating signal transduction pathways. It is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, where it plays a crucial role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, impacting cell migration, chemotaxis, and immune responses (Filippi2004Localization; Lougaris2020RAC2). The protein's activity is essential for the proper functioning of immune cells, such as neutrophils and mast cells, and is involved in processes like superoxide production and actin reorganization (Gu2002Rac2; Filippi2004Localization). Mutations in the RAC2 gene can lead to immunodeficiency disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining immune system integrity (Smits2020A; Lougaris2020RAC2).

## Structure
RAC2 is a member of the Rho family of GTPases, characterized by its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP, acting as a molecular switch in various signaling pathways. The primary structure of RAC2 includes a GTP-binding domain, which is crucial for its function in signal transduction (Bunney2009Structural). The secondary structure of RAC2 involves alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and function (Bunney2009Structural).

The tertiary structure of RAC2 is defined by its three-dimensional folding, which allows it to interact with specific effector proteins. This interaction is facilitated by the switch I and II regions, which undergo conformational changes upon GTP binding, transitioning from a GDP-bound inactive state to a GTP-bound active state (Bunney2009Structural). The quaternary structure involves RAC2 forming complexes with other proteins, such as phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCγ2), through specific interactions with the split pleckstrin homology (spPH) domain (Bunney2009Structural).

RAC2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including isoprenylation at a cysteine residue near the C-terminus, which is essential for its membrane localization and function (Kinsella1991Carboxylterminal). This modification typically involves the addition of a geranylgeranyl group, enhancing its interaction with cellular membranes (Kinsella1991Carboxylterminal).

## Function
RAC2 is a GTPase specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells, playing a crucial role in various cellular functions, particularly in the immune system. It is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for processes such as cell migration, chemotaxis, and the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles (Filippi2004Localization; Lougaris2020RAC2). In neutrophils, RAC2 is critical for superoxide production, actin polarity, and chemotaxis, contributing to effective immune responses (Weston2004Rac1; Filippi2004Localization). The protein's function is regulated by its subcellular distribution, influenced by specific C-terminal motifs, including the RQQKRP sequence and aspartic acid 150, which are crucial for its role in superoxide generation and actin rearrangement (Filippi2004Localization; Tao2002The).

RAC2 also plays a role in mast cell function by regulating the expression of protease genes through the JNK signaling cascade (Gu2002Rac2). In T and B cells, RAC2 is involved in actin reorganization and signaling pathways essential for cell proliferation and survival (Lougaris2020RAC2). Mutations in RAC2 can lead to primary immunodeficiencies, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal immune function (Lougaris2020RAC2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RAC2 gene are associated with various immunodeficiency disorders. Dominant activating mutations, such as c.184G > A (pE62K), lead to combined immunodeficiency (CID) and pulmonary disease. This mutation results in decreased GTP hydrolysis, causing increased active RAC2, severe lymphopenia, and neutrophil dysfunction, which manifest as recurrent respiratory infections and pulmonary damage (Smits2020A; Hsu2019Dominant). Another activating mutation, c.275A > C (p.N92T), is linked to combined immunodeficiency with recurring infections and lung disease, despite hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Sharapova2019Heterozygous).

The G12R mutation in RAC2 is associated with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and bone marrow hypoplasia. This mutation impairs GTP hydrolysis, leading to increased active RAC2, affecting cell division and survival, and resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and increased apoptosis (Chantal2020A). The P34H mutation, another gain-of-function variant, causes combined immunodeficiency, characterized by lymphopenia and increased lymphocyte apoptosis (Lougaris2019A).

These mutations highlight the critical role of RAC2 in immune cell function, with alterations leading to significant immune deficiencies and related conditions (Stern2020A; Lougaris2020RAC2).

## Interactions
RAC2, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with downstream effectors such as p67^phox and PLCγ2, which are involved in the activation of neutrophil NADPH oxidase and actin cytoskeleton changes, respectively (Hsu2023Not). RAC2 also interacts with PAK1, a serine/threonine kinase, where post-translational modifications of RAC2 enhance its binding affinity and activation of PAK1 (Rimmele2010Bead‐based).

The TRQQKRP motif near the C-terminus of RAC2 is essential for its proper subcellular localization and interaction with other proteins. This motif is crucial for the geranylgeranylation of RAC2, which affects its membrane association and biological functions (Tao2002The). RAC2 also forms complexes with RhoGDIa, a regulatory protein that inhibits RAC2 by preventing its membrane association. This interaction is modulated by the nucleotide state of RAC2, with non-hydrolyzable GTP analogues inhibiting the formation of RAC2-RhoGDIa complexes (Schmohl2010Protein–protein‐interactions).

These interactions highlight the role of RAC2 in regulating actin dynamics and immune cell functions, particularly through its involvement in the NADPH oxidase complex and actin remodeling pathways.
