# C1QL4

## Overview
C1QL4 is a gene in humans that encodes the protein complement C1q-like 4, a member of the C1q family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its globular complement 1q (gC1q) domain, which is crucial for its structural and functional properties, including the formation of higher-order multimers such as homotrimers or heterotrimers (Bolliger2011The). C1QL4 is involved in various physiological processes, including steroidogenesis in the testis and regulation of adipogenesis in adipose tissue, as well as promoting angiogenesis in endothelial cells (Liu2016C1ql1Ctrp14; Tan2019Expression). The protein interacts with the BAI3 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, which is significant for its role in cellular signaling pathways (Hamoud2018Spatiotemporal). Additionally, C1QL4 has been implicated in the progression of breast cancer, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis (Xu2023C1ql4).

## Structure
C1QL4 is a protein encoded by the C1QL4 gene in humans, belonging to the C1q family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by a globular complement 1q (gC1q) domain, which is a significant structural component of C1QL4, accounting for approximately half of its sequence (Bolliger2011The). The gC1q domain is involved in forming higher-order multimers, such as homotrimers or heterotrimers, through interactions within the gC1q domains and possibly the collagenous and cysteine loop domains (Bolliger2011The).

C1QL4 contains an N-terminal signal peptide, a short conserved sequence with two closely spaced cysteine residues, a spacer, a collagen-like sequence, and a C-terminal gC1q domain (Bolliger2011The). The collagen-like region and the gC1q domain are crucial for the trimerization of C1QL4, a common feature among C1q-domain-containing proteins (Tom2005The). The protein's structure is similar to that of cerebellins and adiponectin, which also contain C-terminal gC1q domains (Bolliger2011The).

The interaction of C1QL4 with the BAI3 receptor is mediated by its gC1q domain, which binds to the thrombospondin repeats of BAI3 with a dissociation constant of 20.5 nM, indicating a lower affinity compared to other C1ql proteins (Bolliger2011The). The CUB domain of BAI3 is essential for this interaction (Hamoud2018Spatiotemporal). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can affect its binding properties (Hamoud2018Spatiotemporal). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of C1QL4, as well as splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
C1QL4, a member of the C1q-like protein family, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the testis and adipose tissue. In the testis, C1QL4 is involved in steroidogenesis, enhancing testosterone production in Leydig cells and seminiferous tubules. This process is facilitated by the upregulation of the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein and steroidogenic enzymes, with C1QL4 activating the c-Raf/ERK1/2 and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways (Tan2019Expression). The protein's interaction with the BAI3 receptor, a cell-adhesion GPCR, is crucial for its role in steroidogenesis, although C1QL4 can still induce testosterone secretion in the absence of BAI3, suggesting the presence of another receptor (Tan2019Expression).

In adipose tissue, C1QL4 functions as a regulator of adipogenesis by suppressing adipocyte differentiation (Tan2019Expression). Additionally, C1QL4 is involved in promoting angiogenesis in endothelial cells by activating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which is essential for endothelial cell migration and capillary tube formation (Liu2016C1ql1Ctrp14). These roles highlight C1QL4's involvement in critical physiological processes, including reproductive functions and tissue development.

## Clinical Significance
C1QL4 has been implicated in the progression of breast cancer (BC). Overexpression of C1QL4 is significantly correlated with poor prognosis in BC patients, as it is associated with larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stage. Immunohistochemistry assays have shown higher expression of C1QL4 in BC tissues compared to para-carcinoma tissues. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicates a negative correlation between C1QL4 expression and overall survival in BC patients. C1QL4 is highly expressed in certain BC cell lines, such as BT 549 and MDA-MB-231, and is enriched in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). Knockdown of C1QL4 in these cells leads to decreased expression of BCSC markers and reduced spheroid formation, suggesting its role in maintaining BC cell stemness. Conversely, overexpression of C1QL4 in MCF-7 cells increases BCSC marker expression and sphere formation ability. These findings suggest that C1QL4 plays a crucial role in regulating the stemness and progression of breast cancer cells through the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway (Xu2023C1ql4).

In murine models, C1QL4 is involved in steroidogenesis within Leydig cells, influencing testosterone production through the MEK/ERK1/2 and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways. However, specific diseases or conditions directly linked to C1QL4 mutations or expression changes in humans have not been detailed (Tan2019Expression).

## Interactions
C1QL4, a member of the complement C1q-like protein family, is known to interact with the BAI3 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). This interaction plays a significant role in regulating myoblast fusion. C1QL4 acts as a ligand for BAI3, and this binding is crucial for its inhibitory function on myoblast fusion. The CUB domain of BAI3 is identified as the minimal region necessary for interaction with C1QL4. A mutant version of C1QL4 that cannot bind BAI3 fails to inhibit myoblast fusion, underscoring the importance of this interaction (Hamoud2018Spatiotemporal).

In the context of steroidogenesis, C1QL4 also interacts with BAI3 in Leydig cells, where it stimulates testosterone production through the cAMP/PKA signaling cascade. This interaction involves binding to the CUB or TSR domain on the N terminus of BAI3, which can be cleaved at a conserved GPCR proteolysis site (Tan2019Expression).

C1QL4's interaction with BAI3 is complex, as BAI3 can both stimulate and inhibit different signaling pathways. This includes the MEK/ERK1/2 cascade, which is implicated in C1QL4's role in promoting testosterone production (Tan2019Expression).
