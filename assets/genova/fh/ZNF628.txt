# ZNF628

## Overview
ZNF628 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 628, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which are small protein structural motifs that can bind to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. Zinc finger protein 628 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, by interacting with specific DNA sequences to modulate gene expression. The precise biological functions and pathways involving ZNF628 are still under investigation, but its role in gene regulation suggests it may have significant implications in cellular differentiation and development. Understanding the interactions and clinical significance of ZNF628 could provide insights into its potential involvement in human diseases.
