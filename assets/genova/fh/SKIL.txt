# SKIL

## Overview
The SKIL gene encodes the SKI-like proto-oncogene, a protein that is a member of the Ski/Sno family and functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator. This protein plays a significant role in the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional). The SKIL protein acts as a negative regulator within this pathway, interacting with Smad proteins to modulate gene expression and maintain cellular homeostasis (Gori2020Mutations). It is involved in various cellular interactions, including those with the Hippo signaling pathway, and has been implicated in oncogenic processes, particularly in cancer progression and immune escape (Ma2020SKIL). Additionally, SKIL is associated with other physiological and pathological conditions, such as fibrosis and schizophrenia, highlighting its diverse biological significance (Lu2022ATAD3B).

## Structure
The SKIL protein, encoded by the SKIL gene, is a member of the Ski/Sno protein family and plays a role in the TGF-β/Activin signaling pathway. It contains several key domains that contribute to its function. The SAND domain is crucial for its interaction with SMAD4, a component of the signaling pathway, and is involved in DNA binding (Gori2020Mutations). The SKIL protein shares structural similarities with the SKI protein, including conserved regions that facilitate binding to phosphorylated R-SMADs, which are essential for its regulatory role in the signaling pathway (Gori2020Mutations).

The SKIL protein can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are important for its stability and function. These modifications are part of the regulatory mechanisms that control its activity in the signaling pathway (TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional). The protein's structure allows it to bind to SMAD complexes without disrupting them, supporting its role as a negative regulator that requires degradation for pathway activation (Gori2020Mutations).

Splice variants of the SKIL gene can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting the protein's function and interactions within the cell (TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional).

## Function
The SKIL gene, also known as SnoN, plays a crucial role in regulating the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, SKIL interacts with Smad proteins to modulate gene expression. Under normal conditions, the SnoN/Ski/Smad4 complex binds to and represses the SKIL gene promoter. Upon TGF-β stimulation, the degradation of SnoN and Ski proteins allows the activated Smad2/Smad4 complex to replace the SnoN/Ski complex on the SKIL gene promoter, promoting its induction. This regulation is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional).

SKIL is also involved in maintaining stem cell pluripotency through a super-enhancer regulated by Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog transcriptional factors. Its expression is modulated by various signals, including TGF-β, activin, nodal, BMP7, HGF/CREB, and prolactin/STAT5, as well as by miRNAs such as miR-17 and miR-23a (TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional). In embryonic development, SKIL is crucial for regulating the TGF-β signaling pathway, which is important for embryo development and tissue maintenance (TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SKIL gene, which encodes the SnoN protein, have significant implications in various diseases, particularly cancer. In cancerous cells, the expression and localization of Ski and SnoN proteins are often altered, although no mutations in these proteins have been identified in different cancer types (TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional). Overexpression of SKIL is associated with oncogenic activity, promoting cellular proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis, which contributes to tumor progression (TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional). In colorectal cancer, SKIL gene amplification and allelic loss are observed, and these genetic alterations are often co-amplified with oncogenic genes, further contributing to cancer progression (TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional).

In the context of fibrosis, reduced levels of Ski and SnoN are linked to the activation of the TGF-β pathway, suggesting that upregulating these cofactors could counteract fibrotic processes (TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional). However, in cancer, overexpression of Ski and SnoN can act as oncoproteins, and strategies to downregulate them might help control tumor growth (TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional).

In schizophrenia, SKIL is part of a miRNA-TF-gene network, where its underexpression is observed in patients, and this expression level is reversed after treatment, indicating a potential role in schizophrenia pathophysiology (Lu2022ATAD3B). Additionally, genetic variations in the SKIL gene are associated with changes in the QTc interval, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, highlighting its relevance in cardiac health (Lu2022ATAD3B).

## Interactions
The SKIL gene encodes a protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins, influencing several cellular pathways. SKIL is known to interact with elements of the Hippo signaling pathway, such as LATS2 and Salvador (Sav), although it does not directly bind to TAZ. This interaction affects TAZ activation indirectly, as overexpression of LATS2 promotes TAZ degradation through phosphorylation, while SKIL overexpression inhibits this process (Ma2020SKIL). SKIL also plays a role in the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway by interacting with Smad proteins. It binds to R-Smad (Smad2/3) and co-Smad (Smad4), disrupting the Smad complexes' ability to activate transcription of TGF-β target genes. This interaction involves competition for binding sites on Smad4, leading to the displacement of phospho-Smad2/3 and disruption of functional Smad heteromeric complexes (Deheuninck2008Ski).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SKIL interacts with TAZ, a transcriptional co-activator, promoting malignant phenotypes and immune escape. This interaction is part of a broader network involving pathways like Hippo and Wnt, which regulate YAP/TAZ activity (Ma2020SKIL). SKIL's interaction with TAZ is crucial for its role in tumorigenesis and immune escape, as it enhances TAZ activity, which is associated with cancer proliferation and metastasis (Ma2020SKIL).
