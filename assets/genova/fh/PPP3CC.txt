# PPP3CC

## Overview
The PPP3CC gene encodes the gamma isoform of the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, particularly within the central nervous system, where it plays a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. As a serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin modulates the balance between kinase and phosphatase activities, which is essential for long-term neuronal responses (Fabbri2014PPP3CC). Beyond the CNS, PPP3CC is involved in immune system regulation, influencing B-cell receptor signaling and potentially affecting antidepressant efficacy (Fabbri2014PPP3CC). The protein's activity extends to human embryonic stem cells, where it impacts cell fate determination and differentiation (Chen2021Calcineurin). Additionally, PPP3CC has been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric conditions, as well as in non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting its diverse biological significance (Gerber2003Evidence; Zhao2024Shikonin).

## Structure


## Function
PPP3CC encodes the gamma isoform of the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS). Calcineurin is involved in regulating synaptic plasticity, a process essential for learning and memory, by modulating the balance between kinase and phosphatase activities, which is critical for long-term cellular responses in neurons (Fabbri2014PPP3CC). 

PPP3CC is also implicated in dopaminergic signal transduction and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity, linking it to affective and cognitive functions (Fabbri2014PPP3CC). In the immune system, PPP3CC influences B-cell receptor signaling, which may affect antidepressant efficacy through modulation of cytokines and B-cell proliferation (Fabbri2014PPP3CC).

In human embryonic stem cells, PPP3CC is involved in cell fate determination and differentiation, impacting the expression of lineage and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers (Chen2021Calcineurin). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it dephosphorylates target proteins, influencing gene expression and cellular responses (Chen2021Calcineurin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PPP3CC gene have been implicated in several psychiatric disorders. The PPP3CC gene, which encodes the calcineurin gamma subunit, has been associated with schizophrenia. Studies have identified polymorphisms within this gene that are linked to the disorder, suggesting that genetic variations may contribute to schizophrenia pathogenesis by affecting calcineurin signaling, which is crucial for dopaminergic and NMDA receptor-mediated signaling (Mathieu2008Association; Gerber2003Evidence). 

In addition to schizophrenia, PPP3CC has been suggested as a susceptibility factor for bipolar affective disorder (BPAD). Specific polymorphisms in the gene, such as CC33 and CCS3, have been associated with an increased risk of BPAD, and alterations in calcineurin signaling have been observed in patients with this disorder (Mathieu2008Association).

The gene also plays a role in the response to antidepressants in major depressive disorder (MDD). Variants in PPP3CC have been linked to antidepressant efficacy, potentially through its involvement in the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, which is related to immune system regulation and synaptic plasticity (Fabbri2014PPP3CC).

Furthermore, PPP3CC has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where its upregulation by shikonin is associated with inhibited cell proliferation and migration, suggesting a potential therapeutic role (Zhao2024Shikonin).

## Interactions
PPP3CC, also known as calcineurin A gamma, is a catalytic subunit of the protein phosphatase 3 complex. It interacts with calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner, forming a complex that dephosphorylates target proteins. This interaction is crucial for its role in various signaling pathways, including those involved in synaptic plasticity and immune response (Mathieu2008Association).

PPP3CC is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBE3B, which regulates synapse number by targeting PPP3CC for degradation. This interaction is significant in maintaining proper synaptic structure and function, as demonstrated by increased dendritic spine density when PPP3CC is overexpressed, mimicking the phenotype observed in UBE3B knockout models (Ambrozkiewicz2020The).

In addition to its interaction with UBE3B, PPP3CC has been implicated in interactions with other proteins. For instance, a study noted that a truncated form of PPP3CC interacts with ATOH8, although the interaction with the full-length protein remains unclear (Chen2015A). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of PPP3CC in cellular processes and its potential involvement in various neurological and psychiatric conditions.
