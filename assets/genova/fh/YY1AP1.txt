# YY1AP1

## Overview
YY1AP1 is a gene that encodes the protein YY1 associated protein 1, which plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation as part of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex. This protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and nucleolus, where it interacts with the transcription factor YY1 to modulate gene expression. YY1AP1 is involved in crucial cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and replication, particularly in vascular smooth muscle cells. The protein's interaction with YY1 enhances transcriptional activation, and it is implicated in various biological pathways, including those related to cell proliferation and differentiation. Mutations in the YY1AP1 gene are linked to Grange syndrome, a disorder characterized by vascular and skeletal abnormalities, while its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in certain cancers, such as colon adenocarcinoma (Raggio2021Whole; Guo2017LossofFunction; Ho2017Prognostic).

## Structure
The YY1AP1 protein, encoded by the YY1AP1 gene, is involved in transcriptional regulation and is a component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex. The protein is known to interact with the transcription factor YY1, playing a role in gene transcription regulation (Guo2017LossofFunction). YY1AP1 is localized in the nucleus and nucleolus of smooth muscle cells and is associated with the INO80 complex, which is crucial for maintaining cell cycle progression and proliferation (Guo2017LossofFunction).

The primary structure of YY1AP1 includes multiple isoforms, with lengths ranging from 424 to 888 amino acids (Guo2017LossofFunction). The major isoform in smooth muscle cells is a 2391 bp isoform predicting an 88 kDa protein (Guo2017LossofFunction). The protein's structure includes ordered N-terminal and C-terminal regions flanking disordered areas, which may contribute to its functional interactions and potential aggregation tendencies in mutant forms (Raggio2021Whole).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may affect the function of YY1AP1, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's interaction with other components of the INO80 complex suggests a role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Guo2017LossofFunction).

## Function
YY1AP1 (YY1 associated protein 1) is a crucial component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which is involved in transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and replication. In healthy human cells, YY1AP1 plays a significant role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). It is involved in the TGF-beta-driven differentiation of SMCs, which is essential for maintaining normal cell proliferation and differentiation (Raggio2021Whole).

YY1AP1 is primarily located in the nucleus, where it interacts with the transcription factor YY1 to influence gene expression. This interaction is vital for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation or repression. The protein's nuclear localization is confirmed by immunofluorescence studies, which show its presence in the nucleoplasm and nucleolus of SMCs and other cell types (Guo2017LossofFunction).

Loss of YY1AP1 function can lead to cell cycle arrest at the G1 and G2 phases, increased levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/WAF/CDKN1A, and disrupted differentiation processes in SMCs. These disruptions highlight YY1AP1's role in promoting cell proliferation and regulating p21 levels, which are crucial for normal cellular function (Guo2017LossofFunction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the YY1AP1 gene are associated with Grange syndrome, a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by severe vascular abnormalities, including stenosis or occlusion of multiple arteries, congenital heart defects, and fibromuscular dysplasia-like vascular disease. Patients with Grange syndrome may also exhibit skeletal abnormalities such as brachydactyly and syndactyly, bone fragility, and learning disabilities (Raggio2021Whole; Guo2017LossofFunction). The syndrome is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in YY1AP1, leading to significant protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Guo2017LossofFunction).

In addition to Grange syndrome, alterations in YY1AP1 expression have been implicated in cancer. High expression levels of YY1AP1 are associated with poor prognosis in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), where it acts as an oncogene promoting cell proliferation and tumor progression. YY1AP1 expression is significantly higher in COAD tissues compared to normal tissues, and its overexpression correlates with reduced overall survival in patients (Ho2017Prognostic). These findings suggest that YY1AP1 may serve as a prognostic marker in COAD and potentially other cancers.

## Interactions
YY1AP1 (YY1 associated protein 1) is known for its interactions with the transcription factor YY1, acting as a co-activator in transcriptional regulation. YY1AP1 enhances the transcriptional activation of YY1-responsive promoters by interacting with YY1, with two critical binding regions identified between amino acids 1-260 and 475-608 (Wang2004YY1AP). This interaction is confirmed both in vitro and in vivo, and the transactivation domain of YY1AP1 is located between amino acids 260-345 (Wang2004YY1AP).

YY1AP1 is also a component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which is essential for YY1's activation of gene transcription. It interacts with other proteins within this complex, such as actin and actin-related proteins, indicating its role in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription regulation (Guo2017LossofFunction). In hepatocellular carcinoma, YY1AP1 interacts with proteins like ASH1L, ZNF496, ZMYM4, and ACAD9, which are involved in transcriptional regulation and maintaining stem cell features (Shahrisa2021The). These interactions highlight YY1AP1's involvement in complex transcriptional and epigenetic processes.
