# MYADM

## Overview
The MYADM gene encodes the myeloid-associated differentiation marker, a transmembrane protein integral to various cellular processes, including cell migration and differentiation. This protein is characterized by its eight transmembrane segments and the presence of MARVEL domains, which are involved in membrane apposition and trafficking (Li2024Research; Aranda2011MYADM). MYADM is ubiquitously expressed and plays a significant role in organizing membrane domains, particularly in myeloid cells, where it is upregulated during differentiation (Pettersson2000Isolation). The protein's interactions with key molecules such as Rac1 and Surfactant Protein A underscore its involvement in cell signaling and immune responses (Aranda2011MYADM; Dy2021Myeloidassociated). Clinically, MYADM is implicated in various diseases, including non-small-cell lung cancer and asthma, where its expression levels and interactions influence disease progression and immune regulation (Tanyaratsrisakul2023Myeloidassociated; Zhou2022A).

## Structure
The MYADM protein is characterized by its structure as an integral membrane protein with eight transmembrane segments, as indicated by hydropathy profiles (Pettersson2000Isolation; Qiao2024MYADM). These segments suggest a complex arrangement within the plasma membrane, contributing to its role in cellular processes. The protein contains two MARVEL domains, which are involved in membrane apposition and trafficking (Li2024Research; Aranda2011MYADM).

The primary structure of MYADM consists of 298 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 32 kDa (Cui2001Cloningofhumanmyeloidassociateddifferentiationmarker(MYADM)genewhoseexpressionwasupregulatedinNB4cellsinducedbyalltransretinoicacid page 1 of 2). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including potential sites for O-glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its function and localization (Pettersson2000Isolation).

MYADM's tertiary structure is suggested to involve interactions with lipid rafts, facilitated by conserved aromatic amino acid residues, which are crucial for its role in sorting and transporting specific proteins during myeloid cell maturation (Cui2001Cloningofhumanmyeloidassociateddifferentiationmarker(MYADM)genewhoseexpressionwasupregulatedinNB4cellsinducedbyalltransretinoicacid page 1 of 2). The protein's quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed in the available sources.

## Function
The MYADM gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating cell spreading and migration by organizing membrane domains necessary for these processes. MYADM is characterized by its eight transmembrane regions and is ubiquitously expressed, localizing primarily at the plasma membrane, particularly in ordered membrane regions such as lamellipodia, where it overlaps with F-actin (Aranda2011MYADM). This localization is essential for the proper targeting of Rac1, a Rho-family GTPase involved in cell migration and spreading, to ordered membrane domains (Aranda2011MYADM). MYADM's role in maintaining high membrane order is highlighted by its ability to maintain membrane condensation, as indicated by Laurdan staining, which shows high general polarization values in MYADM-enriched regions (Aranda2011MYADM).

In addition to its role in cell migration, MYADM is involved in hematopoietic differentiation, particularly in myeloid cells. It is expressed in multipotent progenitor cells and is up-regulated during myeloid differentiation, suggesting a role in early stages of cell differentiation (Pettersson2000Isolation). The protein is also expressed in non-hematopoietic tissues such as the brain and lung, indicating a broader expression pattern (Pettersson2000Isolation).

## Clinical Significance
The MYADM gene has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MYADM is identified as a negative prognostic biomarker. High expression of MYADM is associated with poor prognosis, as it negatively impacts overall survival and disease-free survival in NSCLC patients. It is also correlated with immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in tumor immunity regulation (Zhou2022A). MYADM's interaction with ICAM-1 and Rac1 indicates its involvement in cell migration, further supporting its role as a prognostic factor in NSCLC (Zhou2022A).

In asthma, MYADM expression is upregulated in response to human rhinovirus infection, contributing to inflammatory responses in the airways. This upregulation is linked to increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, exacerbating asthma symptoms and severity (Tanyaratsrisakul2023Myeloidassociated).

MYADM is also associated with cancer progression, particularly in melanoma, where its downmodulation affects cell movement and invasion. Alterations in MYADM expression can influence the mode of cell migration, potentially favoring more invasive movement types (Labat-de-Hoz2023The; Aranda2011MYADM). These findings highlight MYADM's clinical significance in various diseases, particularly in cancer and inflammatory conditions.

## Interactions
MYADM, a member of the MAL protein family, is involved in several key interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with Rac1, a small GTPase, facilitating its targeting to ordered membrane domains crucial for cell spreading and migration. This interaction is significant for Rac1's signaling efficiency, as MYADM-enriched domains are highly ordered, and MYADM knockdown disrupts Rac1 localization to these domains (Aranda2011MYADM).

MYADM also interacts with Surfactant Protein A (SP-A) on eosinophils, playing a role in pulmonary immunity. This interaction is critical for SP-A-mediated eosinophil apoptosis, and blocking MYADM prevents SP-A from inducing apoptosis, which is significant in asthma pathology (Dy2021Myeloidassociated).

In pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, MYADM influences the nuclear export of KLF4, affecting the expression of p21/Cip1. MYADM knockdown enhances the formation of the KLF4-SMAD4 complex, upregulating p21/Cip1 expression, while MYADM overexpression reduces this complex formation (Sun2020miR1823pMyadm).

These interactions highlight MYADM's role in regulating cell migration, immune responses, and gene expression, underscoring its importance in various cellular functions and disease processes.
