# MOB4

## Overview
MOB4 is a gene that encodes the protein MOB family member 4, also known as phocein, which is a critical component of the STRIPAK complex involved in various cellular processes. The MOB4 protein is characterized by its structural composition of six helices and a long loop region, forming a four-helical bundle that is essential for its function (Chen2018The). As a member of the MOB family, MOB4 plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly the Hippo-YAP pathway, where it interacts with kinases such as MST4 to regulate cell growth, apoptosis, and other vital cellular functions (Gundogdu2019MOB). MOB4 is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, where it is crucial for neurological functions, including axonal transport and synapse formation (Gundogdu2019MOB). Its involvement in immune signaling and cellular homeostasis underscores its importance in maintaining physiological balance, with mutations in the MOB4 gene linked to various diseases, including muscle disorders and neurodegenerative conditions (Gundogdu2019MOB; Berger2022Mob4dependent).

## Structure
The MOB4 protein, also known as phocein, is a member of the MOB family of proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes. Structurally, MOB4 is composed of six helices and a long loop region, forming a four-helical bundle similar to MOB1. This structure includes two zinc ions, coordinated by specific residues, which are crucial for maintaining the protein's conformation (Chen2018The).

The interaction between MOB4 and MST4, a kinase in the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, is mediated by salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. These interactions are facilitated by the phosphorylation of threonine residues on MST4, which bind to positively charged residues on MOB4. This phosphorylation-dependent interaction highlights the importance of post-translational modifications in MOB4's function (Chen2018The).

MOB4 is also known to form complexes with other proteins, such as MST4, indicating its role in quaternary structures. The MST4-MOB4 complex is structurally similar to the MST1-MOB1 complex, although they have divergent biological functions (Chen2018The). The potential for MOB4 to pair with different MST kinases suggests a complex interplay and functional diversity within the MOB protein family (Chen2018The).

## Function
MOB4, also known as phocein, is a core component of the STRIPAK complex, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and vesicular transport. In human cells, MOB4 is suggested to play a role in connecting GCKIII upstream kinases with NDR1/2 as part of the Hippo pathway, indicating its involvement in signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and apoptosis (Gundogdu2019MOB). MOB4 is primarily expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it is essential for neurological functions such as axonal transport, neurite elongation, and synapse formation (Gundogdu2019MOB).

MOB4 is also implicated in the regulation of cytokine secretion, as evidenced by decreased IL-8 levels upon hMOB4 knockdown, suggesting a role in immune signaling (Gundogdu2019MOB). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins to influence cell morphology and motility. Its involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. The complexity of MOB4's interactions and its physiological significance underscore the need for further research to fully elucidate its functions in human cells (Gundogdu2019MOB).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MOB4 gene, also known as phocein, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In zebrafish models, mutations in MOB4 lead to significant muscle defects, including disorganized sarcomeric structures and the formation of aggregates resembling nemaline bodies, which are associated with nemaline myopathy in humans (Berger2022Mob4dependent). These findings suggest that MOB4 mutations could contribute to muscle disorders similar to nemaline myopathy.

MOB4 is also a core component of the STRIPAK complex, which is involved in multiple cellular processes. Alterations in MOB4 expression or function can disrupt the STRIPAK complex, potentially leading to diseases such as cancer, diabetes, autism, cardiac disease, and cerebral cavernous malformation (Gundogdu2019MOB). The interaction between MOB4 and the chaperonin TRiC is crucial for proper myofibril and microtubule network growth, and deficiencies in this interaction can result in compromised neuronal connectivity and increased apoptosis, suggesting a link to neurodegenerative disorders (Berger2022Mob4dependent).

These studies highlight the clinical significance of MOB4 in muscle and neuronal development, with its dysfunction potentially leading to a range of pathological conditions. Further research is needed to fully understand the molecular mechanisms by which MOB4 mutations and expression alterations contribute to these diseases.

## Interactions
MOB4, also known as phocein, is a core component of the STRIPAK (Striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase) complex. Within this complex, MOB4 interacts with striatin proteins, which serve as scaffolds, and is involved in binding to two distinct regions of striatin (Gundogdu2019MOB; Berger2022Mob4dependent). The STRIPAK complex includes serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) subunits, striatins as PP2A regulatory subunits, CCM3, and the MST3, MST4, and STK25 protein kinases, which are part of the GCKIII subfamily of Sterile 20 kinases (Gundogdu2019MOB).

MOB4 also forms a complex with MST4 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, which has been shown to promote the proliferation and migration of pancreatic cancer cells by disrupting the MST1-MOB1 complex and activating YAP, a transcriptional co-activator involved in cell growth and survival (Chen2018The). This interaction is mediated by salt bridges between phosphorylated threonines on MST4 and basic amino acids on MOB4 (Chen2018The).

In zebrafish, MOB4 interacts with the chaperonin TRiC, impacting actin biogenesis and sarcomere assembly, and is crucial for coordinating myofibril and microtubule network growth (Berger2022Mob4dependent).
