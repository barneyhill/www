# HPS1

## Overview
The HPS1 gene encodes a protein known as HPS1 biogenesis of lysosomal organelles complex 3 subunit 1, which is a critical component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-3 (BLOC-3). This protein plays a significant role in the trafficking and maturation of lysosome-related organelles (LROs), including melanosomes, platelet dense granules, and lysosomes. As a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, HPS1 is involved in the regulation of Rab32 and Rab38, which are essential for melanosome biogenesis and function. The HPS1 protein interacts with HPS4 to form the BLOC-3 complex, which is crucial for the proper localization and trafficking of melanocyte-specific proteins. Mutations in the HPS1 gene are associated with Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome type 1 (HPS-1), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, and lysosomal storage defects (Huizing2020Hermansky–Pudlak).

## Structure
The HPS1 protein, encoded by the HPS1 gene, is involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles and is a component of the BLOC-3 complex. It consists of 700 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 79.3 kDa (CarmonaRivera2013A; Chiang2003The). The primary structure of HPS1 includes specific regions necessary for interaction with HPS4, particularly the N-terminal (residues 1-249) and C-terminal (residues 506-700) regions, while the middle portion (residues 250-505) is not required for this interaction (CarmonaRivera2013A).

The secondary structure of HPS1 is predicted to include β-sheets and α-helices, forming a structured region resembling a DUF254 domain, which is a distant homolog of the mu-adaptin longin domain found in clathrin adapter protein complexes (CarmonaRivera2013A). This domain is involved in the interaction with the N-terminal CHiPS-like domain of HPS4 (CarmonaRivera2013A).

In terms of quaternary structure, HPS1 forms a complex with HPS4, which is crucial for the formation of the BLOC-3 complex. This interaction is physiologically relevant, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Martina2003BLOC3; CarmonaRivera2013A). The HPS1-HPS4 complex is primarily cytosolic, with a small fraction associated with membranes (Martina2003BLOC3).

## Function
The HPS1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-3 (BLOC-3), which is involved in the trafficking and maturation of lysosome-related organelles (LROs) such as melanosomes, platelet dense granules, and lysosomes. In healthy human cells, HPS1 plays a significant role in the proper localization and trafficking of melanocyte-specific proteins from the trans-Golgi network to premelanosomes, ensuring the correct formation and function of melanosomes (Huizing2002Disorders). The HPS1 protein is also involved in the recycling of v-SNAREs on melanosomes, which affects their maturation and exocytosis (Yu2020HPS1).

HPS1 functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab32/38 within the BLOC-3 complex, facilitating the removal of VAMP7 from large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) in Paneth cells, which is necessary for the proper secretion of lysozyme, an antimicrobial peptide (Yu2020HPS1). This activity is crucial for maintaining intestinal microbiota composition and preventing inflammatory bowel disease (Yu2020HPS1). The protein is expressed in most tissues and shows a fine granular pattern throughout the cytosol and dendrites, particularly in the perinuclear region of normal melanocytes (Huizing2002Disorders).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HPS1 gene are primarily associated with Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome type 1 (HPS-1), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis due to platelet dysfunction, and lysosomal storage defects (Huizing2020Hermansky–Pudlak). Patients with HPS-1 often exhibit severe clinical manifestations, including profound cutaneous albinism, significant ocular findings, and a high risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis by middle age (Huizing2020Hermansky–Pudlak). Pulmonary fibrosis is a common cause of mortality in HPS-1 patients, and the condition may progress rapidly (Doubková2019Novel).

HPS1 mutations can also lead to granulomatous colitis, which resembles Crohn's disease and may respond to treatment with anti-TNF-α agents and steroids (Huizing2008Disorders). In addition, female patients frequently experience menorrhagia (Huizing2020Hermansky–Pudlak). The genetic diversity of HPS1 mutations includes frameshift, missense, nonsense, and splice site variants, which can result in aberrant splicing, frameshifts, and premature stop codons, ultimately affecting protein function (Huizing2020Hermansky–Pudlak). These mutations disrupt the biogenesis of lysosomal organelles, leading to the clinical manifestations observed in HPS-1 (Huizing2008Disorders).

## Interactions
The HPS1 protein is a critical component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelle complex-3 (BLOC-3), where it interacts with the HPS4 protein. This interaction is essential for the formation and function of BLOC-3, which is involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles. The interaction between HPS1 and HPS4 is primarily mediated by their N-terminal regions, with the N-terminus of HPS1 (residues 1-249) interacting with the N-terminus of HPS4 (residues 1-230) (CarmonaRivera2013A). The C-terminus of HPS1 (residues 506-700) also interacts with a central region of HPS4 (residues 340-528) (CarmonaRivera2013A).

HPS1 and HPS4 co-immunoprecipitate, indicating they are part of a protein complex, although they do not directly interact in a yeast two-hybrid system, suggesting the involvement of additional components in stabilizing their interaction (Chiang2003The). HPS4 can self-associate to form at least a dimer, which may play a role in stabilizing HPS1 within the complex (Chiang2003The). The BLOC-3 complex, including HPS1, functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab32 and Rab38, which are crucial for melanosome biogenesis (Gerondopoulos2012BLOC3).
