# UQCR10

## Overview
UQCR10 is a gene that encodes the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, complex III subunit X, a protein integral to the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III, also known as the cytochrome bc1 complex. This protein is characterized by a single transmembrane helix and plays a crucial role in electron transfer and proton translocation within the mitochondria, processes essential for ATP synthesis. The UQCR10 protein is highly conserved across species, sharing significant sequence identity with its bovine counterpart, and is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, with particularly high levels in the heart and skeletal muscle. Its function is vital for maintaining the proton gradient necessary for cellular respiration, underscoring its importance in energy-demanding tissues (Akashi2000Isolation; Iwata1998Complete; Islam1997Primary).

## Structure
The human gene UQCR10 encodes a protein that is a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III, also known as the cytochrome bc1 complex. The primary structure of the UQCR10 protein consists of 63 amino acids, showing a high degree of sequence identity (88.5%) with its bovine counterpart (Akashi2000Isolation). The protein is characterized by a single transmembrane helix, with the NH2-terminus located on the matrix side of the mitochondria. This structural feature allows the protein to maintain contact with cytochrome c1 and the iron-sulfur protein, which is crucial for the assembly and function of the bc1 complex (Akashi2000Isolation).

In terms of quaternary structure, UQCR10 is part of the larger cytochrome bc1 complex, which is composed of multiple subunits that interact to facilitate electron transfer and proton translocation across the mitochondrial membrane (Iwata1998Complete). The protein's role within this complex is essential for the proper functioning of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as the heart and skeletal muscle (Akashi2000Isolation). The specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of UQCR10 are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
The UQCR10 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the cytochrome bc1 complex, also known as complex III, in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This complex plays a critical role in cellular respiration by facilitating the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, a process that is coupled with proton translocation across the mitochondrial inner membrane. This electron transfer is essential for maintaining the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis, the primary energy currency of the cell (Islam1997Primary).

The UQCR10 protein is homologous to the 7.2-kDa protein (subunit X) of bovine ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase and is localized in the mitochondria, indicating its involvement in the cellular respiratory system. It is expressed in all human tissues examined, with higher expression levels in the heart and skeletal muscle, which are tissues with high oxygen consumption (Akashi2000Isolation). The protein's activity in the inner mitochondrial membrane is crucial for the proper assembly and function of the respiratory chain, which is vital for efficient ATP production in cells (Akashi2000Isolation).
