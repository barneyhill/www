# HADHA

## Overview
The HADHA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, a critical enzyme complex involved in the beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. This protein complex, located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, is essential for energy production, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as the heart and skeletal muscles. The alpha subunit, encoded by HADHA, contains the enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase domains, which are vital for the enzymatic activities of the complex (Orii1999Genes). The proper function of this protein is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial architecture and function, as it plays a significant role in cardiolipin remodeling, which is necessary for mitochondrial morphology and electron transport chain activity (Miklas2019TFPaHADHA). Mutations in the HADHA gene are associated with metabolic disorders such as mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency and long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, highlighting its clinical significance (Fraser2019Evaluation; Vatkar2022Neuromyopathy).

## Structure
The HADHA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, which plays a crucial role in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. This protein is composed of four alpha and four beta subunits, with the alpha subunit containing the enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase domains (Orii1999Genes). The primary structure of HADHA consists of a sequence of amino acids, while its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its functional conformation. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, essential for its enzymatic activity. In terms of quaternary structure, the alpha subunit assembles with the beta subunit, encoded by HADHB, to form the functional mitochondrial trifunctional protein complex (Orii1999Genes).

Post-translational modifications of HADHA include acetylation, which occurs at lysine residues Lys-350, Lys-383, and Lys-406. This modification is known to reduce the enzyme's activity in fatty acid oxidation, particularly in the liver, and is regulated by the protein acetylase GCN5L1 (Thapa2018The). The acetylation status of HADHA is influenced by nutritional status and can be modulated by dietary factors (Thapa2018The).

## Function
The HADHA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, which is essential for the beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids in human cells. This protein complex is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and catalyzes three enzymatic activities: long-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase, long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (Zhao2015Prognostic; Orii1999Genes). These processes are crucial for energy production, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as the heart and skeletal muscles.

In healthy human cardiomyocytes, HADHA plays a significant role in cardiolipin remodeling, a process vital for maintaining mitochondrial architecture and function. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid that helps organize the cristae and the electron transport chain structure, which is essential for electron transport chain activity and acts as a proton trap on the inner mitochondrial membrane (Miklas2019TFPaHADHA). HADHA is involved in remodeling nascent cardiolipin during cardiomyocyte maturation, allowing for the generation of tetra[18:2]-cardiolipin, which is necessary for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function (Miklas2019TFPaHADHA). The proper functioning of HADHA ensures effective fatty acid metabolism and energy production, which are critical for the normal operation of cardiac cells (Miklas2019TFPaHADHA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HADHA gene, which encodes the α-subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP), are associated with several metabolic disorders. These include mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency (MTPD) and long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHADD). MTPD is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, leading to symptoms such as cardiomyopathy, hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, skeletal myopathy, neuropathy, and liver disease. The disorder can manifest in severe neonatal forms or milder late-onset forms, which may include peripheral neuropathy and episodic rhabdomyolysis (Fraser2019Evaluation; Vatkar2022Neuromyopathy).

LCHADD, caused by mutations in HADHA, presents with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, lethargy after fasting, cardiomyopathy, retinopathy, and polyneuropathy. It can lead to significant morbidity, affecting the heart and skeletal muscles (Karall2015Clinical). Mutations in HADHA have also been linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2, a condition characterized by neuropathy and recurrent rhabdomyolysis (Khani2020Deep; Abedidoust2024Peripheral). Early diagnosis and dietary management are crucial for improving outcomes in patients with these conditions (Fraser2019Evaluation).

## Interactions
HADHA, a subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP), is involved in fatty acid β-oxidation and interacts with the HADHB subunit to form this complex. This interaction is crucial for catalyzing three steps in the β-oxidation pathway (Miklas2019TFPaHADHA). 

HADHA also interacts with the protein acetylase GCN5L1, which acetylates HADHA at specific lysine residues, such as Lys-350, Lys-383, and Lys-406. This acetylation modulates HADHA's activity, particularly in the liver, where it is linked to changes in fatty acid oxidation and lipid deposition (Thapa2018The). The interaction between GCN5L1 and HADHA is significant in the context of nutritional status, such as a high-fat diet, which influences the acetylation process (Thapa2018The).

In addition to its role in fatty acid oxidation, HADHA is involved in hepatic metabolism, influencing glucagon response and ketogenesis. It interacts with histone deacetylases (HDACs), particularly HDAC7, through the production of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). BHB inhibits HDAC7, preserving FOXO1 acetylation and affecting gluconeogenesis (Pan2022The). This interaction highlights HADHA's role in regulating metabolic pathways beyond its enzymatic functions in β-oxidation.
