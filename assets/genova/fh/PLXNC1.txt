# PLXNC1

## Overview
PLXNC1 is a gene that encodes the protein plexin C1, a transmembrane receptor involved in semaphorin signaling pathways. Plexin C1 plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as axon guidance, cell migration, and cell adhesion by interacting with semaphorins, particularly class 7 semaphorins (Artigiani1999Plexins). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in vertebrates and is integral to the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular adhesion, exhibiting RAS-GAP activity that influences R-RAS activity and extracellular matrix-mediated migration (Odabas2018Plexin). Plexin C1's involvement in various signaling pathways and its differential expression in human malignancies suggest its potential role in tumor suppression and as a prognostic biomarker in certain cancers (Chen2020PLXNC1; Odabas2018Plexin). Additionally, its expression is regulated by transcription factors such as Lmx1a and Lmx1b, highlighting its significance in the formation of dopaminergic circuits and potential implications in neurological disorders (Chabrat2017Transcriptional).

## Structure


## Function
PLXNC1 (plexin C1) is a receptor protein involved in semaphorin signaling, which plays a crucial role in cell guidance, axon guidance, and cell migration. In healthy human cells, PLXNC1 functions as a receptor for semaphorins, particularly class 7 semaphorins, and is involved in cell-cell communication through its interactions with these ligands (Artigiani1999Plexins). The protein is expressed ubiquitously in vertebrates and is involved in various cellular processes, including axon outgrowth and cell adhesion (Artigiani1999Plexins).

PLXNC1 is located in the cell membrane and influences cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular adhesion. It has been shown to exhibit RAS-GAP activity, which can decrease R-RAS activity and ECM-mediated migration in a ligand-independent manner (Odabas2018Plexin). The cytoplasmic domain of PLXNC1 can become tyrosine phosphorylated, suggesting potential interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases or intracellular kinases, which may be crucial for signal transduction (Artigiani1999Plexins).

In the nervous system, PLXNC1 is involved in axon guidance, while in other tissues, it may play roles in cell migration and morphogenesis. Its expression is differentially regulated in various human malignancies, indicating its potential involvement in tumor suppression (Odabas2018Plexin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PLXNC1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In gastric cancer, PLXNC1 is significantly up-regulated, and its high expression levels are associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival. It serves as an independent prognostic factor, with high expression correlating with a 2.66-fold increased risk of death. PLXNC1 also shows higher diagnostic efficacy than the traditional biomarker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in predicting patient survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer (Chen2020PLXNC1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PLXNC1 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-tumoral tissues. It is associated with epithelial characteristics in HCC cell lines and is absent in cells with a mesenchymal phenotype. This suggests that PLXNC1 may serve as a marker for epithelial phenotype in liver cancer cells and could be significant in distinguishing tumor characteristics (Odabas2018Plexin).

In the context of neurological disorders, PLXNC1 is involved in the formation of dopaminergic circuits. Its expression is regulated by transcription factors Lmx1a and Lmx1b, and alterations in its expression can impact axonal guidance, which may have implications for disorders involving dopaminergic dysfunction (Chabrat2017Transcriptional).

## Interactions
PLXNC1 (plexin C1) is involved in several significant protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. One notable interaction is with glucose-regulating protein 78 (GRP78), a heat shock protein encoded by HSPA5. This interaction has been shown to play a role in osteoarthritis, where PLXNC1 depletion reduces apoptosis and extracellular matrix degradation in IL-1β-treated chondrocytes. The interaction between PLXNC1 and GRP78 was confirmed through methods such as the HDOCK server and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays, which demonstrated a high affinity between the two proteins (Meng2023PLXNC1).

In the context of gastric cancer, PLXNC1 interacts with the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway by regulating the expression of IL6ST, a key component of this pathway. This interaction is crucial for the oncogenic effects of PLXNC1, as evidenced by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) and dual-luciferase reporter assays, which show PLXNC1's role in transcriptional activation of IL6ST (Chen2020PLXNC1).

PLXNC1 also interacts with semaphorin 7A (Sema7A) in the context of olfactory synapse formation. This interaction is essential for synapse formation and dendrite maturation in mitral/tufted cells, as demonstrated by studies using knockout models and heterologous systems (Inoue2018Sema7APlxnCl).
