# AP4M1

## Overview
The AP4M1 gene encodes the adaptor-related protein complex 4 subunit mu 1, a critical component of the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4). This protein complex is involved in the intracellular trafficking of transmembrane proteins, particularly from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes and lysosomes, thereby playing a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and the endosomal-lysosomal system (Bellad2021A; Behne2020Adaptor). The AP4M1 protein, characterized by its mu homology domain, is essential for recognizing and binding to cargo proteins with specific sorting signals, facilitating their proper cellular localization (Bellad2021A). In neurons, AP4M1 is crucial for the transport of AMPA glutamate receptors, influencing synaptic transmission and plasticity (Matsuda2009Polarized). Mutations in the AP4M1 gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as Spastic Paraplegia 50 (SPG50), highlighting its importance in normal neurological function (Jameel2014A; Bettencourt2017Genotypephenotype).

## Structure
AP4M1 is a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4), which plays a crucial role in vesicular transport. The primary structure of AP4M1 consists of specific amino acid sequences that form distinct domains essential for its function. The secondary structure of AP4M1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and interaction capabilities. The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is critical for its functional conformation. In terms of quaternary structure, AP4M1 assembles with other subunits to form the complete AP-4 complex, which is necessary for its role in cellular transport mechanisms.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in AP4M1, potentially influencing its activity and interactions within the cell. These modifications can affect the protein's function and localization, thereby impacting the overall efficiency of the AP-4 complex. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of AP4M1 can exist, which may lead to variations in its function and cellular distribution. These isoforms can result in differences in the protein's ability to interact with other molecules and perform its role in vesicular transport.

## Function
The AP4M1 gene encodes a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4), which is crucial for intracellular transport processes. AP-4 is a heterotetrameric complex involved in the trafficking of transmembrane proteins from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes and lysosomes, playing a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper functioning of the endosomal-lysosomal system (Bellad2021A; Behne2020Adaptor). The AP4M1 protein contains a 'mu homology domain', also known as the 'signal binding domain', which is essential for interacting with cargo proteins that have a tyrosine-containing sorting signal (YXXØ) in their cytoplasmic tails (Bellad2021A).

In neurons, AP-4 is involved in the selective transport of AMPA glutamate receptors to the somatodendritic domain, which is crucial for excitatory synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity during brain development (Bellad2021A; Matsuda2009Polarized). The AP4M1 protein also interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), recruiting the AP-4 complex to the trans-Golgi network, and is involved in glutamate trafficking in dendritic spines through interaction with the glutamate receptor delta 2 (GluRδ2) (Bellad2021A). These interactions highlight the role of AP4M1 in protein sorting and trafficking, which is essential for normal cellular and neuronal function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AP4M1 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily characterized by spastic paraplegia and intellectual disability. One such condition is Spastic Paraplegia 50 (SPG50), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. SPG50 is marked by symptoms including spasticity, severe intellectual disability, delayed or absent speech, microcephaly, and dysmorphic features. These symptoms result from loss-of-function mutations in the AP4M1 gene, which lead to a truncated protein product lacking a crucial signal binding domain (Bellad2021A).

AP4M1 mutations have also been linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), specifically a form known as SPG50. This condition involves progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs due to corticospinal tract dysfunction. Patients may exhibit febrile seizures, developmental delays, and cerebellar hypoplasia (Bettencourt2017Genotypephenotype).

Additionally, AP4M1 mutations are implicated in autosomal recessive cerebral palsy syndrome, characterized by hypotonia, spasticity, severe intellectual disability, and limited speech. MRI findings in affected individuals often show brain abnormalities such as a thin posterior corpus callosum (Jameel2014A). These mutations disrupt the normal function of the AP-4 complex, affecting protein transport and synaptic neurotransmission, which are critical for brain development (Jameel2014A).

## Interactions
The AP4M1 protein is a component of the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4), which is involved in vesicle-mediated transport processes. AP4M1 interacts with various proteins through its signal binding domain, which is essential for its function. It specifically interacts with cargo proteins that possess a tyrosine-containing sorting signal (YXXØ) in their cytoplasmic tails. Critical amino acids in AP4M1, such as Phe255 and Arg283, are important for its interaction with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Bellad2021A).

AP4M1 also interacts with the small GTP binding protein ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), which recruits the AP4 complex to the trans-Golgi network. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization and function of the AP4 complex (Bellad2021A). Additionally, AP4M1 is involved in the trafficking of the glutamate receptor delta 2 (GluRδ2) in dendritic spines, although the exact nature of this interaction remains unclear (Bellad2021A).

In the context of oxygen-glucose-deprived hippocampal neurons, AP4M1 has been shown to co-localize with the GluR2 receptor. While initial experiments did not demonstrate a direct interaction, upregulation of AP4M1 allowed for co-immunoprecipitation with GluR2, suggesting a potential interaction under certain conditions (Zhang2024Adaptor).
