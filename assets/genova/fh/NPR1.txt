# NPR1

## Overview
NPR1 is a gene that encodes the natriuretic peptide receptor 1 (NPRA), a transmembrane receptor integral to cardiovascular and renal function regulation. This receptor is primarily involved in binding natriuretic peptides, such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), which are key hormones in blood pressure and fluid balance maintenance. Upon ligand binding, NPRA activates its guanylyl cyclase domain, catalyzing the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a second messenger that mediates physiological responses like vasodilation and natriuresis (Potter2005Natriuretic; Vandenwijngaert2019Blood). The receptor's structure includes an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular guanylyl cyclase catalytic domain, among others, facilitating its function as a homodimer (Pandey2023Guanylyl; Potter1998Phosphorylation). NPR1 is expressed in tissues such as the heart and kidneys, where it plays a critical role in cardiovascular homeostasis and fluid balance (Potter2005Natriuretic; Pandey2023Guanylyl).

## Structure
The NPR1 protein, also known as natriuretic peptide receptor 1, is a transmembrane receptor that plays a crucial role in binding natriuretic peptides such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Structurally, NPR1 consists of several distinct domains: an extracellular ligand-binding domain (LBD), a single transmembrane domain (TD), an intracellular protein kinase homology domain (KHD), a dimerization domain (DD), and a guanylyl cyclase catalytic domain (GCCD) (Pandey2023Guanylyl; Potter1998Phosphorylation).

The primary structure of NPR1 includes specific amino acid sequences that are crucial for its function. The secondary structure features include alpha helices, particularly in the dimerization domain, which forms an amphipathic alpha helix structure (Pandey2023Guanylyl). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these elements, facilitating the receptor's function as a homodimer, with each polypeptide chain containing a single GC catalytic active site (Pandey2023Guanylyl).

In terms of quaternary structure, NPR1 functions as a dimer, and its activation involves conformational changes upon ligand binding (Dunn2024Agonist). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues within the KHD, are essential for receptor activation and function (Potter1998Phosphorylation). These modifications play a critical role in the receptor's ability to mediate physiological responses.

## Function
NPR1, also known as natriuretic peptide receptor 1, is a crucial component in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal functions. It encodes a receptor for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), which are hormones involved in maintaining blood pressure and fluid balance. Upon binding with ANP or BNP, NPR1 activates its guanylyl cyclase domain, leading to the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) (Potter2005Natriuretic; Vandenwijngaert2019Blood). This cGMP acts as a second messenger, mediating physiological responses such as vasodilation, natriuresis, and diuresis, which contribute to the reduction of blood pressure and the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis (Potter2005Natriuretic; Pandey2018Molecular).

NPR1 is highly expressed in tissues such as the kidney, heart, and vascular smooth muscle cells, where it plays a role in regulating renal hemodynamics and blood pressure (Potter2005Natriuretic; Pandey2023Guanylyl). The receptor's activation leads to increased glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow, supporting its role in fluid and electrolyte balance (Pandey2018Molecular). NPR1 also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines, thus protecting against cardiac and renal disorders (Pandey2023Guanylyl).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NPR1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cardiovascular and immune-related diseases. Biallelic loss-of-function variants in NPR1 are linked to neonatal systemic hypertension and cardiogenic shock, as observed in affected children with these genetic mutations. These conditions are characterized by severe cardiovascular symptoms, including hypertension and heart failure, shortly after birth (Capri2023BiallelicNPR1loss).

NPR1 deficiency is also associated with increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis. In mice, the lack of NPR1 leads to elevated expression of integrin beta 4 (ITGB4) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), promoting monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, a key event in atherosclerosis development (Liu2022Lack).

In the context of immune response, NPR1 deficiency disrupts immune cell populations, leading to colonic inflammation and conditions resembling pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This is characterized by altered T-cell populations and increased proinflammatory cytokines, which can be partially restored with 8-Br-cGMP treatment, a downstream activator of NPR1 (Long2022Null).

Overall, NPR1 plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiovascular and immune homeostasis, and its disruption can lead to significant pathological conditions.

## Interactions
The NPR1 gene encodes the natriuretic peptide receptor 1 (NPRA), which is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that regulate cardiovascular and renal functions. NPRA binds to natriuretic peptides such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), leading to the production of cyclic GMP (cGMP), a second messenger that mediates various physiological responses, including vasodilation and natriuresis (Pandey2021Molecular).

NPRA signaling is known to inhibit the actions of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor and pro-inflammatory mediator, through a cGMP-dependent mechanism. This interaction suggests a regulatory role in counteracting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is crucial for blood pressure regulation and cardiac hypertrophy (Garg2005Regulation; Pandey2010Regulation).

The receptor also interacts with transcription factors such as SP1 and NF-Y, which are positive regulators of Npr1 expression. These interactions are essential for the basal expression of the Npr1 gene and may influence cardiovascular homeostasis and blood pressure regulation (Garg2005Regulation). Additionally, NPRA signaling can inhibit the activation of NF-κB, a key regulator of inflammation, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory effects (Pandey2023Guanylyl).
