# ATP6V1G1

## Overview
ATP6V1G1 is a gene that encodes the ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit G1, a critical component of the vacuolar-type ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. This complex is essential for the acidification of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells, a process vital for numerous cellular functions such as protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release (Smith2002Molecular). The ATP6V1G1 gene is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, underscoring its fundamental role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Smith2002Molecular). The protein encoded by ATP6V1G1 is part of the peripheral stalk of the V1 sector of the V-ATPase, which is responsible for ATP hydrolysis and energy provision for proton transport across membranes (Li2020Comprehensive). This function is crucial for maintaining the acidic environment necessary for cellular metabolism and homeostasis (De2021Role). ATP6V1G1's involvement in critical cellular processes and its interactions with other proteins highlight its significance in both normal physiology and disease states, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (CoutoVieira2020Multicancer; Wu2020ALSFTD).

## Function
The ATP6V1G1 gene encodes the G1 subunit of the vacuolar-type ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is essential for acidifying intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells. This acidification is crucial for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release (Smith2002Molecular). The V-ATPase complex is composed of two main sectors: the cytoplasmic V1 sector, which includes ATP6V1G1, and the transmembrane V0 sector. The primary function of the V1 sector is to hydrolyze ATP to provide energy for transporting hydrogen ions across membranes, maintaining the acidic environment necessary for cellular homeostasis and metabolism (Li2020Comprehensive).

ATP6V1G1 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, indicating its fundamental role in cellular function (Smith2002Molecular). The G1 subunit is part of the peripheral stalk of the V-ATPase, which is essential for efficient rotational catalysis and the acidification of endosomes, lysosomes, and secretory vesicles. These processes are necessary for vesicular trafficking, endocytosis, autophagy, receptor recycling, and protein degradation (De2021Role). The proper functioning of ATP6V1G1 ensures the correct pH balance within cellular compartments, which is critical for various cellular processes (De2021Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ATP6V1G1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. The gene encodes a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), which is crucial for acidifying intracellular compartments. This function is essential for processes such as bone resorption by osteoclasts, and dysregulation can contribute to bone-related diseases like osteoporosis and osteopetrosis (Tan2015Bivariate). The ATP6V1G1 gene has been identified as a pleiotropic locus influencing both bone mineral density (BMD) and age at menarche, suggesting its role in the pathophysiology of osteoporosis (Tan2015Bivariate).

In the context of neurodegenerative disorders, ATP6V1G1 interacts with UBQLN2, a protein associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations in UBQLN2 can impair autophagosome acidification by reducing ATP6V1G1 expression, highlighting its role in autophagy and potential involvement in these neurodegenerative conditions (Wu2020ALSFTD).

Alterations in ATP6V1G1 expression have also been observed in various cancers. The gene is upregulated in multiple cancer types, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis through its involvement in cellular acidification and ion transport (CoutoVieira2020Multicancer).

## Interactions
ATP6V1G1, a subunit of the V1 domain of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, participates in several protein interactions crucial for its function in acidifying intracellular compartments. It interacts with UBQLN2, a protein that acts as a chaperone, facilitating the biosynthesis and assembly of ATP6V1G1 into the V-ATPase complex. This interaction is essential for the proper assembly and function of the V-ATPase, which is involved in autophagosome acidification. ALS/FTD mutations in UBQLN2 impair its ability to bind ATP6V1G1, leading to reduced levels of ATP6V1G1 and disrupted autophagy (Wu2020ALSFTD).

ATP6V1G1 is also part of a complex with PAM (Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase) in peptidergic cells. This interaction involves the V1 subunits of V-ATPase, including ATP6V1G1, and is important for regulating the activity of the V-ATPase holocomplex. The interaction is supported by coimmunoprecipitation and blue native PAGE experiments, which show the presence of PAM in complexes containing V-ATPase subunits (Rao2018A). These interactions highlight the role of ATP6V1G1 in maintaining cellular processes such as autophagy and endocytosis.
