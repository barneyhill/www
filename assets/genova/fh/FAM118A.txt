# FAM118A

## Overview
FAM118A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 118 member A, which is primarily involved in RNA processing and cell cycle regulation. This protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation and RNA splicing, processes essential for maintaining normal cellular function and development. The FAM118A protein is integral to the orderly progression of the cell cycle, influencing gene expression necessary for cell growth and division, and ensuring the proper maturation of RNA transcripts. These functions underscore its importance in cellular health and organismal development (Robinson2016Exomewide; Xu2022Transcriptomewide).

## Structure


## Function
FAM118A encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in RNA processing and cell cycle regulation. The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it is involved in transcriptional regulation and RNA splicing. These activities are essential for maintaining normal cellular function and development. By participating in transcriptional regulation, FAM118A influences the expression of genes necessary for cell growth and division. Its involvement in RNA splicing ensures the proper maturation of RNA transcripts, which is critical for the synthesis of functional proteins. The precise regulation of these processes by FAM118A is vital for the orderly progression of the cell cycle, thereby contributing to the overall health and development of the organism.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FAM118A gene have been implicated in several health conditions. A missense mutation in FAM118A, which results in the substitution of arginine with histidine, is associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). This mutation is predicted to be probably damaging, with a high Polyphen-2 score of 0.999, indicating a significant impact on protein function (Robinson2016Exomewide). The gene is also linked to bone mineral density (BMD), with genetic variants in FAM118A associated with transcript isoform variations that affect BMD phenotypes. These variations have been studied in the context of osteoporosis, suggesting a role in bone biology and remodeling (Xu2022Transcriptomewide; Kwan2009Tissue).

FAM118A has also been identified as a gene associated with child body mineral density and lean body mass, indicating its broader implications in growth and development (Xu2022Transcriptomewide). Despite these associations, the exact mechanisms by which FAM118A mutations contribute to these conditions remain unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate its clinical significance fully. The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential as a target for future therapeutic interventions.
