# VSIG2

## Overview
VSIG2, or V-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). The protein is characterized by its extracellular domain, which includes IgC2 and IgV domains, and a cytoplasmic tail, suggesting its involvement in immune regulation and cell adhesion processes (Zhou2022VSet). VSIG2 is expressed in various epithelial tissues and plays a role in modulating immune responses, potentially acting as an ancestral lymphocyte receptor (Zhou2022VSet). It is implicated in the progression of certain cancers, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, through its interactions with proteins in the mTOR signaling pathway (Xu2023VSIG2). The protein's expression patterns and interactions highlight its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer and immune-related diseases (Zhou2022VSet; Xu2023VSIG2).

## Structure
VSIG2 is a type I transmembrane protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). It is composed of an extracellular domain (ECD) containing 220 amino acids, which includes both IgC2 and IgV domains, and a cytoplasmic tail of 63 amino acids (Zhou2022VSet). The ECD of VSIG2 is highly conserved between humans and mice, with the human version consisting of 227 amino acids (Zhou2022VSet). Although the exact molecular structure of VSIG2 has not been experimentally resolved through X-ray crystallization, computationally predicted structures are available (Zhou2022VSet).

VSIG2 shares structural similarities with B7 family proteins, which are known for their roles in immune regulation (Xu2023VSIG2). The protein's structure is characterized by immunoglobulin-like domains, which typically form beta-sheets and loops, contributing to its secondary and tertiary structures. These domains are crucial for the protein's function in immune response and cell adhesion processes (Zhou2022VSet). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its stability and function, although specific modifications for VSIG2 are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
VSIG2, also known as CTXL, is a protein that plays a significant role in immune regulation and cell adhesion. It is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is composed of an extracellular domain with IgC2 and IgV domains, along with a cytoplasmic tail. This structure suggests its involvement in cell-cell interactions and signaling processes (Zhou2022VSet).

In healthy human cells, VSIG2 is expressed in various epithelial tissues, including the thyroid glands, trachea, prostate, colon, and stomach. It is not expressed in the thymus, indicating a specific tissue distribution that may relate to its functional roles in maintaining epithelial integrity and facilitating immune surveillance (Zhou2022VSet).

VSIG2 is implicated in modulating immune responses, potentially acting as an ancestral lymphocyte receptor. Its expression correlates with the infiltration of B cells and M1 macrophages, which are key antigen-presenting cells, suggesting a role in modulating antitumor immunity and T-cell activation within the tumor microenvironment (Zhou2022VSet). This protein's involvement in immune cell interactions highlights its potential as a target for immune checkpoint therapies in cancer treatment (Zhou2022VSet).

## Clinical Significance
VSIG2 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and immune-related conditions. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), VSIG2 is overexpressed and promotes malignant progression by enhancing LAMTOR2-mediated mTOR activation. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, larger tumor size, and advanced clinical stages, suggesting that VSIG2 could serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in PDAC (Xu2023VSIG2). In bladder cancer, VSIG2 expression varies with cancer invasiveness; it is upregulated in nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer and downregulated in muscle invasive bladder cancer, indicating its potential as a biomarker for invasiveness (He2021Identification; Zhou2022VSet).

In lung adenocarcinoma, VSIG2 is downregulated and hypermethylated, acting as a protective gene. Its lower expression is associated with poorer survival outcomes, suggesting that targeting its methylation status could be a therapeutic strategy (Meng2021Integrated). In colorectal cancer, lower VSIG2 expression is linked to poor survival, indicating a possible tumor suppressor role (Zhou2022VSet). Additionally, VSIG2's single nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, highlighting its relevance in immune-related disorders (Zhou2022VSet).

## Interactions
VSIG2, or V-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 2, is involved in several protein interactions that play a significant role in the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). It interacts with LAMTOR2 and mTOR, two proteins integral to the mTOR signaling pathway. VSIG2 acts as a scaffold, enhancing the interaction between LAMTOR2 and mTOR, which leads to mTOR phosphorylation and activation. This interaction is crucial for the malignant progression of PDAC, as it promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Xu2023VSIG2).

The interaction between VSIG2 and these proteins was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments in PDAC cells. The study demonstrated that VSIG2 enhances the recruitment of the Ragulator complex, which includes LAMTOR2, to mTORC1, thereby promoting mTOR activation. This interaction suggests that VSIG2 indirectly activates mTOR and its downstream molecules, contributing to the malignant progression of PDAC (Xu2023VSIG2).

These findings highlight the potential of targeting the VSIG2-LAMTOR2-mTOR axis as a therapeutic strategy in PDAC, given its role in enhancing mTOR signaling and promoting cancer progression (Xu2023VSIG2).
