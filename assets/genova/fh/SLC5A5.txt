# SLC5A5

## Overview
The SLC5A5 gene encodes the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a critical role in iodide uptake, primarily within the thyroid gland. This protein is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones, as it facilitates the active transport of iodide into thyroid follicular cells, a process driven by the sodium gradient across the cell membrane (Wu2008Histidine; Martín2018Implications). NIS is characterized by its structure, which includes 13 transmembrane segments and several glycosylation sites, although these sites are not essential for its function (Zhang2021Novel; Targovnik2017Iodide). Beyond the thyroid, NIS is expressed in various tissues, indicating its broader role in iodine metabolism (Martín2018Implications). The gene's expression and the protein's function are regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone and other molecular interactions, which are crucial for maintaining normal thyroid function and have implications in thyroid-related disorders and therapies (Dohán2003The; RiescoEizaguirre2006A).

## Structure
The SLC5A5 gene encodes the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), a crucial protein for iodide uptake in thyroid epithelial cells. The NIS protein is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of approximately 80-90 kDa and is located in the basolateral membrane of thyroid cells (Targovnik2017Iodide). It consists of 643 amino acids and includes 13 transmembrane segments (TMS), an extracellular N-terminus, and an intracellular C-terminus (Zhang2021Novel). The protein has three extracellular N-linked glycosylation sites, which are located between TMS VI and VII at position 225, and between TMS XII and XIII at positions 485 and 497 (Targovnik2017Iodide). These glycosylation sites are not critical for NIS targeting to the plasma membrane or its normal function (Zhang2021Novel).

The secondary structure of NIS includes transmembrane domains, which are essential for its function in iodide transport (Targovnik2017Iodide). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding necessary for its role in transporting iodide ions, although specific details on quaternary structure are not provided. The protein's proper function depends on the integrity of its structure, including transmembrane segments and glycosylation sites (Targovnik2017Iodide).

## Function
The SLC5A5 gene encodes the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), a transmembrane glycoprotein primarily located in the thyroid gland. NIS is crucial for the active transport of iodide into thyroid follicular cells, a key step in the synthesis of thyroid hormones T3 and T4 (Wu2008Histidine; Martín2018Implications). This process is driven by the transmembrane sodium gradient, maintained by Na+/K+-ATPase, and involves the cotransport of two sodium ions along with one iodide ion (RiescoEizaguirre2006A). The iodide is then used in the synthesis of thyroid hormones, which are essential for regulating metabolism, growth, and development (Bergeron2008Inherited).

NIS is also expressed in other tissues, including the salivary glands, stomach, small intestine, lactating mammary gland, and ovary, indicating its broader role in iodine metabolism (Martín2018Implications). In the thyroid, NIS expression is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which enhances its activity through cAMP-related pathways (RiescoEizaguirre2006A). The protein's function is not only vital for thyroid hormone synthesis but also for diagnostic imaging and radioiodide therapy in thyroid cancer (Wu2008Histidine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC5A5 gene, which encodes the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), are associated with several thyroid-related disorders. These mutations can lead to iodide transport defects, resulting in conditions such as congenital hypothyroidism and thyroid dyshormonogenesis. Congenital hypothyroidism is characterized by inadequate thyroid hormone production, often due to impaired iodide uptake in the thyroid gland (Zhang2021Novel; Geysels2022Silent). Specific mutations, such as p.T354P, p.Q267E, and compound heterozygous mutations like p.Gly51AlafsTer45 and p.Gly421Arg, have been identified as causes of these conditions (Zhang2021Novel; Targovnik2017Iodide).

Alterations in the expression level of SLC5A5 can also impact thyroid function. Reduced expression or function of NIS leads to decreased iodide uptake, which is crucial for thyroid hormone synthesis. This can result in hypothyroidism, characterized by symptoms such as goiter and developmental delays (Bergeron2008Inherited; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). Additionally, synonymous variants in the SLC5A5 gene can affect splicing, leading to aberrant mRNA and dysfunctional proteins, further contributing to thyroid hormone synthesis disorders (Geysels2022Silent). These genetic alterations underscore the clinical significance of SLC5A5 in maintaining normal thyroid function.

## Interactions
The SLC5A5 gene encodes the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), which is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function and regulation. NIS contains sorting signals in its COOH terminus, including a PDZ target motif and a dileucine motif, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and sorting within the cell. These motifs potentially interact with proteins such as the PDZ binding protein LIN-7 and the clathrin-coated machinery, which are important for the subcellular distribution and retention of NIS at the plasma membrane (Dohán2003The).

NIS function is also influenced by its interaction with the KCNQ1-KCNE2 complex, which is important for efficient iodide uptake in the thyroid gland. This complex may facilitate NIS function by enhancing the electrical gradient required for sodium entry, thereby supporting iodide accumulation (Neverisky2016Ion).

In the context of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), miR-181a-5p has been shown to regulate SLC5A5 expression. This microRNA interacts with the 3' UTR of SLC5A5, leading to mRNA destabilization and downregulation of SLC5A5 mRNA and protein levels, although this interaction is non-canonical and involves a bulge in the microRNA strand (Gierlikowski2021MiR181a5p).
