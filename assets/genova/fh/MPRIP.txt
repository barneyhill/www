# MPRIP

## Overview
MPRIP, or myosin phosphatase Rho interacting protein, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and transcription processes. The protein, categorized as a regulatory protein, plays a crucial role in cellular dynamics by interacting with myosin phosphatase and influencing the phosphorylation state of myosin light chains, thereby affecting cell shape, motility, and muscle contraction (Koga2005p116Rip; Vallenius2011An). MPRIP is also implicated in nuclear processes, where it interacts with nuclear actin and RNA polymerase II, suggesting a role in transcription regulation (Balaban2021The). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, including vascular diseases and osteonecrosis, highlighting its significance in both cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Choi2023LRRC8A; Wang2022Germline).

## Structure
MPRIP, also known as myosin phosphatase Rho interacting protein, is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function. The protein contains an N-terminal region responsible for binding to F-actin, which is crucial for its localization to actin-rich structures (Mulder2003p116; Mulder2004p116Rip). This region includes a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain and a stretch of positively charged residues necessary for F-actin binding (Mulder2003p116). The C-terminal region of MPRIP contains a coiled-coil domain that interacts with the leucine-zipper domains of myosin phosphatase targeting subunits MBS85 and MBS130, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Mulder2004p116Rip).

MPRIP also features an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) at the C-terminus, which is involved in phase separation, forming fibrous and globular structures in the cytoplasm (Balaban2021The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions (Balaban2021The). MPRIP exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which could affect its functional properties and localization (Balaban2021The). These structural features enable MPRIP to play a significant role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and transcription processes.

## Function
MPRIP, also known as myosin phosphatase Rho interacting protein, plays a significant role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and transcription processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the dephosphorylation of myosin light chains by activating myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) and inactivating RhoA, a small GTPase involved in stress fiber formation. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cell shape, motility, and muscle contraction (Koga2005p116Rip; Vallenius2011An).

In the nucleus, MPRIP interacts with Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and localizes to nuclear speckles and nuclear lipid islets, which are associated with active RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription. It forms phase-separated condensates that exhibit liquid-like properties and can bind nuclear F-actin fibers, suggesting a role in organizing nuclear architecture and facilitating transcription processes (Balaban2021The).

MPRIP is also part of a nuclear complex with MYO1C and active RNAPII, potentially linking RNAPII with the transcription factor NM1, a MYO1C isoform. This indicates that MPRIP may play a role in transcription regulation by interacting with nuclear actin and RNAPII (Balaban2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MPRIP gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In the context of non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH), MPRIP mutations, particularly a non-frameshift deletion mutation, have been identified in patients, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis. These mutations may lead to abnormal cytoskeleton regulation and distorted bone cell morphology, contributing to osteopenia and femoral head collapse (Wang2022Germline). The study highlights the potential for MPRIP variants to mediate ischemic necrosis of the femoral head through interactions with other proteins like VWF and FGA (Wang2022Germline).

In vascular health, MPRIP is involved in the regulation of vasodilation through its interaction with LRRC8A anion channels. Alterations in MPRIP expression or interactions can impact vascular smooth muscle cell contractility, potentially affecting conditions related to vascular tone regulation (Choi2023LRRC8A). MPRIP's role in the RhoA/ROCK/MYPT1 signaling pathway suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to vascular dysfunction, particularly in inflammatory and oxidative stress contexts (Choi2023LRRC8A). These findings underscore the importance of MPRIP in maintaining normal vascular function and its potential involvement in vascular diseases.

## Interactions
MPRIP (myosin phosphatase Rho interacting protein) is involved in several key interactions within the cell. It binds to Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and localizes to nuclear speckles and nuclear lipid islets, which are sites of active RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription. MPRIP is part of a nuclear complex with unconventional myosin MYO1C and active RNAPII, suggesting a role in transcription regulation (Balaban2021The).

MPRIP interacts with F-actin, forming phase-separated condensates in the nucleus. These interactions are mediated by its N-terminal region, which contains Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domains that bind to the negatively charged inositol head group of phosphatidylinositol phosphates (Balaban2021The).

MPRIP also associates with the myosin-targeting subunit MYPT1, facilitating the recruitment of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) to actomyosin fibers. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of actin stress fibers and myosin light chain phosphorylation (Vallenius2011An). Additionally, MPRIP interacts with the kinase NUAK2, which is targeted to actin fibers by MPRIP, influencing stress fiber dynamics (Vallenius2011An).
