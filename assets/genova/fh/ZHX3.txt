# ZHX3

## Overview
ZHX3 is a gene that encodes the zinc fingers and homeoboxes 3 protein, a transcriptional repressor involved in the regulation of gene expression. The protein is characterized by the presence of two Cys2-His2-type zinc finger motifs and five homeodomains, which are essential for its DNA-binding and transcriptional regulatory functions (YAMADA2003Analysis). ZHX3 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it forms both homodimers and heterodimers, particularly with ZHX1, to exert its repressive effects on transcription (YAMADA2003Analysis). The protein interacts with various co-repressors and transcription factors, such as NF-YA, to modulate gene expression, playing a role in processes like cellular senescence and osteogenic differentiation (Igata2022Loss; Suehiro2011Impact). Clinically, ZHX3 exhibits a dual role in cancer, acting as an oncogene in some contexts, such as urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, while functioning as a tumor suppressor in others, including breast and renal cancers (Bao2022Zinc; Deng2021ZHX3).

## Structure
The ZHX3 protein is composed of 956 amino acid residues and features two Cys2-His2-type zinc finger motifs and five homeodomains, which are crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor (YAMADA2003Analysis). The zinc finger motifs and homeodomains are highly conserved and play a significant role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (YAMADA2003Analysis). The predicted molecular mass of ZHX3 is 104.7 kDa, with an isoelectric point of 5.68 (YAMADA2003Analysis).

ZHX3 forms both homodimers and heterodimers with ZHX1, with the dimerization domain located between amino acids 242 and 488 (YAMADA2003Analysis). This region also overlaps with the interaction domain for the nuclear factor-Y (NF-YA) and the repressor domain, indicating its multifunctional role (YAMADA2003Analysis). The protein contains a glutamic-acid-rich region between residues 670 and 710, which may serve as a transcription regulatory domain (YAMADA2003Analysis).

ZHX3 is localized in the nucleus, facilitated by two nuclear localization signals located at amino acids 1-107 and 497-555 (YAMADA2003Analysis). The protein's interaction with co-repressors like BS69 and ATF-IP further supports its role in transcriptional repression (YAMADA2003Analysis).

## Function
ZHX3 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It contains zinc-finger motifs and homeodomains, which are essential for its function as a transcriptional regulator. ZHX3 is known to form both homodimers and heterodimers with ZHX1, and these interactions are crucial for its repressor activity (YAMADA2003Analysis). The protein is localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins, such as the activation domain of NF-YA, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of various genes (YAMADA2003Analysis).

ZHX3 is involved in transcriptional repression by interacting with co-repressors like BS69 and ATF-IP, which mediate repression by interacting with components of the basal transcription machinery (YAMADA2003Analysis). It is also enriched at the transcription start sites of senescence-associated genes, such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (ARF-p16 INK4a) gene, indicating its role in preventing cellular senescence (Igata2022Loss). In mesenchymal stem cells, ZHX3 is upregulated during osteogenic differentiation, suggesting its involvement in early stages of osteoblast differentiation by regulating the expression of genes like Osterix (Suehiro2011Impact).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZHX3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, with its role differing depending on the cancer type. In urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB), ZHX3 is frequently gained or amplified, correlating with high mRNA expression levels. This overexpression is associated with advanced stages of the disease and poorer disease-free and overall survival, suggesting that ZHX3 acts as an oncogene in UCB. It enhances the invasive and migratory capacities of UCB cells, and its knockdown inhibits these properties, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Deng2021ZHX3).

Conversely, in other cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, and renal cancer, ZHX3 appears to function as a tumor suppressor. In these cancers, lower expression of ZHX3 is linked to more aggressive disease and poorer clinical outcomes. For instance, in breast cancer, decreased ZHX3 expression is associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced tumor stages, serving as an independent prognostic factor for poor outcomes (You2019&lt; Kwon2017Expression; Bao2022Zinc; p&gt; Attenuated). This dual role of ZHX3 highlights its complex involvement in cancer biology.

## Interactions
ZHX3 is known to participate in several protein-protein interactions, forming both homodimers and heterodimers. It can heterodimerize with ZHX1 and ZHX2, as well as form homodimers with itself. The interaction domains for these dimerizations are located between amino acid residues 242 and 488 of ZHX3, which are crucial for its dimerization capabilities (YAMADA2003Analysis; Kawata2003The). 

ZHX3 also interacts with the nuclear factor-Y subunit A (NF-YA), a transcription factor. This interaction occurs through the serine/threonine-rich activation domain of NF-YA, specifically between residues 141-269, while ZHX3 uses its 242-488 region for this interaction (YAMADA2003Analysis; Kawata2003The). 

In the context of cancer, ZHX3 interacts with TRIM21, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which regulates ZHX3 through proteasomal degradation. This interaction affects the stability and expression of ZHX3, influencing its role in cancer cell migration and invasion (Deng2021ZHX3). 

ZHX3 is also involved in transcriptional repression by interacting with co-repressors such as BS69 and ATF-IP, which may modulate its repressor activity by affecting interactions with transcriptional co-activators (YAMADA2003Analysis).
