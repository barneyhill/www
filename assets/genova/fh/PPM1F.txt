# PPM1F

## Overview
PPM1F is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1F, a member of the PPM family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases. This protein is characterized by its requirement for divalent metal ions, such as magnesium or manganese, to perform its catalytic functions. As a serine/threonine phosphatase, PPM1F plays a pivotal role in regulating intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), by dephosphorylating and inactivating it. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular processes such as cytoskeletal architecture, cell contractility, migration, and proliferation. PPM1F is also involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular functions, including neurofilament network formation and cancer progression. Its activity is modulated by oxidative stress, linking it to cellular responses to environmental changes (Kamada2020Metaldependent; Leng2024PPM1F; Harvey2004Regulation).

## Structure
The PPM1F protein, also known as CaMKP, is a member of the PPM family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, which are characterized by their dependence on divalent metal ions such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ for catalytic activity (Kamada2020Metaldependent). The primary structure of PPM1F includes a conserved catalytic domain essential for its phosphatase activity, although specific amino acid sequences are not detailed in the available context. The secondary structure likely involves common elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of the PPM family, but specific details are not provided.

The tertiary structure of PPM1F has not been explicitly described in the context, but it is known to form complexes with other proteins, indicating a functional quaternary structure. PPM1F interacts with various proteins, including neurofilament L (NFL), affecting its filament association, which is crucial for neurofilament network formation during neuronal differentiation (Ozaki2016Ca). The phosphatase activity of PPM1F is regulated by the oxidation/reduction of cysteine residues, particularly Cys359, which plays a role in the oxidative stress response (Kamada2020Metaldependent). Specific post-translational modifications and splice variants are not detailed in the context.

## Function
PPM1F is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by dephosphorylating specific proteins. It is involved in the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those associated with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). PPM1F dephosphorylates and inactivates CaMKII, which is essential for maintaining cytoskeletal architecture and regulating cellular events such as cell contractility, migration, and proliferation (Harvey2004Regulation). 

PPM1F also interacts with other proteins, such as the Kinesin superfamily protein 3 (KIF3) and Protein diaphanous homolog 1 (mDia1), influencing processes like neurofilament association and RhoA-dependent transcription (Kamada2020Metaldependent). It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, affecting cellular functions like proliferation and differentiation. 

In the context of cancer, PPM1F has been shown to regulate the actin cytoskeleton by targeting proteins such as FHOD1, impacting cell shape and migration, which are critical during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Jurmeister2012MicroRNA200c). Its activity is modulated by the oxidation/reduction of Cys359, linking it to the oxidative stress response (Kamada2020Metaldependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PPM1F gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In pediatric cholestatic liver disease, a novel homozygous variant in PPM1F was identified in a consanguineous family, leading to a syndrome characterized by sclerosing cholangitis, short stature, hypothyroidism, and abnormal tongue pigmentation. This variant is absent in gnomAD and local exome databases and is predicted to be pathogenic, suggesting a significant role in liver disease and related systemic manifestations (Maddirevula2019Identification).

PPM1F is also involved in cancer progression. In ovarian cancer, PPM1F promotes proliferation and metastasis by regulating the dephosphorylation of ITGB1, a process crucial for tumor growth and cell migration. High expression levels of PPM1F are associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients, indicating its role as an oncogene (Leng2024PPM1F).

In breast cancer, PPM1F is targeted by microRNA-200c, which suppresses cell migration and invasion by affecting actin-regulatory proteins. Alterations in PPM1F expression, influenced by miR-200c, are significant in controlling cancer cell motility and invasion (Jurmeister2012MicroRNA200c).

## Interactions
PPM1F, a serine/threonine phosphatase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), where it dephosphorylates and deactivates CaMKII, impacting calcium signaling pathways in fibroblasts (Harvey2004Regulation). This interaction is significant for regulating CaMKII activity, particularly in non-neuronal cells (Harvey2004Regulation).

PPM1F also interacts with integrin beta-1 (ITGB1) in ovarian cancer cells, where it dephosphorylates ITGB1 at the T788/T789 sites. This dephosphorylation is crucial for cancer progression, as it affects cell adhesion and migration (Leng2024PPM1F).

In neuronal contexts, PPM1F binds to the neurofilament light chain (NFL), although this interaction does not significantly alter its phosphatase activity. This binding is important for neurofilament network regulation (Ozaki2016Ca).

PPM1F also interacts with protocadherin-γC5 (Pcdh-γC5), where the C-terminal cytoplasmic fragment of Pcdh-γC5 acts as an endogenous activator of PPM1F, facilitating its role in dephosphorylating Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI) (Onouchi2015Regulation). These interactions highlight PPM1F's role in diverse cellular functions and its potential as a therapeutic target.
