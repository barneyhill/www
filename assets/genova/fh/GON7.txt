# GON7

## Overview
GON7 is a gene that encodes a protein subunit of the KEOPS complex, which is essential for the biosynthesis of threonylcarbamoyl adenosine (t6A), a critical tRNA modification necessary for accurate and efficient protein translation. The GON7 protein is categorized as an intrinsically disordered protein that gains partial structure upon interaction with other KEOPS subunits, such as LAGE3 and OSGEP, forming a stable quaternary complex. This structural transformation is vital for the KEOPS complex's enzymatic activity and cellular functions, including genomic stability and stress response. Mutations in the GON7 gene are linked to Galloway-Mowat syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by nephrotic syndrome and neurological impairments, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Arrondel2019Defects).

## Structure
The human GON7 protein is an intrinsically disordered protein that becomes partially structured upon forming a complex with LAGE3 and OSGEP, subunits of the KEOPS complex. On its own, GON7 lacks a well-defined structure, but when it interacts with LAGE3, it adopts specific secondary structural elements. The N-terminal region of GON7 forms a β-hairpin between Met1 and Ser20, and a helix between Gly25 and Pro50, which lies parallel to the β-hairpin. The C-terminal half of GON7 is predicted to be unfolded, characterized by an enrichment in acidic and a scarcity of hydrophobic amino acids (Arrondel2019Defects).

In the quaternary structure of the KEOPS complex, GON7 interacts with LAGE3, aligning its β-hairpin with the β-sheet of LAGE3 to form a continuous five-stranded anti-parallel sheet. The helix of GON7 packs in an anti-parallel orientation against the C-terminal helix of LAGE3. This interaction is primarily stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. Despite low sequence similarity, the structures of human GON7 and yeast Gon7 are almost identical, indicating a conserved structural role within the KEOPS complex (Arrondel2019Defects).

## Function
The GON7 gene encodes a subunit of the KEOPS complex, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of threonylcarbamoyl adenosine (t6A), a modification essential for the accuracy and efficiency of protein translation. In healthy human cells, GON7 plays a vital role in maintaining the stability and proper quaternary structure of the KEOPS complex. This stability is necessary for the complex's enzymatic activity, which includes t6A biosynthesis, a modification of tRNA that is critical for cellular function (Arrondel2019Defects).

GON7 is an intrinsically disordered protein that becomes partially structured upon binding to the LAGE3 subunit, indicating its role in the cellular stability and organization of the KEOPS complex (Arrondel2019Defects). The presence of GON7 is essential for the stability of the entire KEOPS complex, as its absence leads to decreased protein levels of other KEOPS subunits, affecting the complex's function (Arrondel2019Defects).

GON7 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, contributing to genomic stability and cellular processes such as stress response and genome maintenance (Abel2020KEOPS). Its role in these processes is crucial for cell proliferation and development (Arrondel2019Defects).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GON7 gene, which encodes a subunit of the KEOPS complex, are associated with Galloway-Mowat syndrome (GAMOS), a rare neuro-renal disorder. GAMOS is characterized by early-onset steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome and microcephaly, among other neurological impairments. Specifically, mutations such as the p.Tyr*7 in GON7 lead to truncated, non-functional proteins, resulting in a milder form of GAMOS compared to mutations in other KEOPS subunit genes or the YRDC gene (Arrondel2019Defects). These mutations impact the stability and enzymatic activity of the KEOPS complex, affecting t6A tRNA modification, which is crucial for translational accuracy and efficiency (Arrondel2019Defects).

The absence of GON7 affects the stability of the KEOPS complex, leading to decreased protein levels of its subunits and potentially impacting t6A levels, which are important for cellular function (Arrondel2019Defects). This instability can result in decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, which are critical for cell survival (Arrondel2019Defects). The requirement for t6A-modified tRNAs may vary by cell type and cycle, with highly proliferative cells being more affected by the absence of t6A modification (Arrondel2019Defects).

## Interactions
The GON7 subunit of the KEOPS complex is involved in several critical protein interactions that are essential for its function in tRNA modification. GON7 interacts with LAGE3 and OSGEP to form a subcomplex within the KEOPS complex. This interaction is characterized by the formation of a continuous five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet, where the β-hairpin of GON7 aligns with the β-sheet of LAGE3. The helix of GON7 packs in an anti-parallel orientation against the C-terminal helix of LAGE3, and the complex is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions (Arrondel2019Defects). 

GON7 is an intrinsically disordered protein that becomes partially structured upon binding to LAGE3, which is crucial for the stability and quaternary arrangement of the KEOPS complex (Arrondel2019Defects). The presence of GON7 affects the stoichiometry of the KEOPS complex, preventing the dimerization of LAGE3 and maintaining a 1:1:1:1:1 stoichiometry (Arrondel2019Defects). 

In yeast, GON7 interacts with Pcc1, preventing the formation of a dimer that is otherwise observed in the four-subunit KEOPS from archaea (Zheng2024Molecular). This interaction is crucial for the function of the KEOPS complex in both yeast and humans.
