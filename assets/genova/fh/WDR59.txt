# WDR59

## Overview
WDR59 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 59 protein, which is a crucial component of the GATOR2 complex involved in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for cellular growth and metabolism, responding to nutrient availability, particularly amino acids. The WDR59 protein is characterized by its β-propeller structures, which facilitate interactions with other proteins within the GATOR2 complex, such as GATOR1 and KICSTOR, thereby playing a pivotal role in mTORC1 activation (Valenstein2022Structure). Additionally, WDR59 contributes to the structural integrity of the GATOR2 complex through interactions mediated by conserved C-terminal domains, including zinc finger and RING domains (Valenstein2022Structure). The gene's involvement in critical cellular processes underscores its significance in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cardiovascular diseases and sleep-related traits (Fei2024Exome; Natarelli2018miR103).

## Function
WDR59 is a component of the GATOR2 complex, which plays a crucial role in the nutrient-sensing pathway that regulates mTORC1, a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism in response to amino acid availability. The WDR59 protein contains β-propeller structures that are essential for its interactions with other components of the GATOR2 complex, such as GATOR1 and KICSTOR, which are necessary for mTORC1 activation (Valenstein2022Structure). The β-propeller of WDR59 is specifically required for the interaction between GATOR2 and these components, highlighting its critical role in coupling GATOR2 to the nutrient-sensing machinery (Valenstein2022Structure).

WDR59 also contributes to the structural integrity of the GATOR2 complex. It forms part of a stable scaffold through interactions with other proteins like MIOS and WDR24, facilitated by conserved C-terminal domains (CTDs) that include zinc finger and RING domains (Valenstein2022Structure). These interactions are vital for the assembly and function of the GATOR2 complex, which is involved in amino acid signaling to mTORC1, thereby influencing cellular growth and metabolism (Valenstein2022Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the WDR59 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In the context of cardiovascular diseases, the long non-coding RNA lncWDR59, which is targeted by miR-103, plays a significant role in endothelial maladaptation and atherosclerosis. The suppression of lncWDR59 by miR-103 leads to increased DNA damage and reduced endothelial cell proliferation, contributing to the progression of atherosclerosis. This interaction suggests that lncWDR59 may have an athero-protective role, and its dysregulation could be clinically relevant in cardiovascular diseases (Natarelli2018miR103).

In sleep-related traits, WDR59 has been associated with snoring and other sleep disorders. Exome sequencing studies have identified a loss-of-function variant in WDR59 linked to snoring, suggesting a genetic basis for this condition. The gene's involvement in lipid metabolism, through its role in the GATOR2 complex and mTORC1 activation, implies a connection between WDR59, obesity, and sleep-related traits. This association remains significant even after adjusting for body mass index, indicating potential mechanisms beyond obesity that require further investigation (Fei2024Exome).

## Interactions
WDR59 is a component of the GATOR2 complex, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of mTORC1 signaling, a key pathway for cell growth and metabolism in response to nutrient availability. Within the GATOR2 complex, WDR59 interacts with other core subunits such as WDR24 and MIOS. These interactions are mediated by conserved C-terminal domains (CTDs) that include zinc finger and RING domains, forming a scaffold through heterodimeric CTD-CTD junctions (Valenstein2022Structure). The α-solenoid regions of WDR59 and WDR24 are essential for the structural integrity of the GATOR2 scaffold, and mutations in these regions can disrupt interactions, affecting mTORC1 signaling (Valenstein2022Structure).

WDR59 also interacts with SEC13, forming a six-bladed β-propeller structure. This interaction is stabilized by the donation of a β-blade from WDR59 to SEC13, which is critical for the stability of the GATOR2 complex (Valenstein2022Structure). The β-propeller structure of WDR59 is necessary for binding to GATOR1 and KICSTOR, linking GATOR2 to these complexes and facilitating mTORC1 signaling (Valenstein2022Structure).

WDR59 is involved in interactions with Sestrin2, a protein that modulates mTORC1 activity. Sestrin2 binds to GATOR2 components, including WDR59, and inhibits the formation of the GATOR1-GATOR2 complex, thereby influencing mTORC1 signaling (Kim2015Sestrin2).
