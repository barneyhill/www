# OR12D2

## Overview
The OR12D2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 12 subfamily D member 2, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. The OR12D2 protein is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, which allows it to traverse the cell membrane and interact with intracellular signaling pathways. Variations in the OR12D2 gene have been associated with several health conditions, including asthma, autism spectrum disorder, and systemic lupus erythematosus, suggesting its broader significance beyond olfaction (Kulski2013Variation; Almandil2023Exomewide).

## Clinical Significance
The OR12D2 gene has been implicated in several conditions due to its genetic variations and interactions. Studies have suggested a potential link between the OR12D2 gene and asthma, as SNPs within this gene have been associated with the condition (Kulski2013Variation). Additionally, variations in the OR12D2 gene have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Saudi females. An exome-wide analysis identified significant SNPs in the OR12D2 gene that may increase the risk of developing ASD, highlighting its role in the genetic predisposition to this condition (Almandil2023Exomewide). The gene has also been linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with functional enrichment analysis revealing associations with this disease (Almandil2023Exomewide).

The AluOR insertion near the OR12D2 gene, located about 450 base pairs upstream, may influence the gene's transcriptional levels, potentially affecting its expression and contributing to disease susceptibility (Kulski2013Variation). The AluOR dimorphism serves as an informative marker for identifying allele and haplotype lineages, which could be useful in understanding the gene's role in disease and MHC-associated behavioral functions (Kulski2013Variation).
