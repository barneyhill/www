# KRT34

## Overview
KRT34 is a gene that encodes keratin 34, a type I intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in hair follicles. This protein is integral to the structural framework of epithelial cells, contributing to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair. Keratin 34 plays a vital role in the development and cycling of hair follicles, influencing processes such as dermal papilla condensation and germ formation from outer root sheath cells, which are essential for hair growth and follicle cycling (Chang2014The; An2022Keratinmediated). The protein's function extends to maintaining cell integrity under mechanical stress, highlighting its importance in the cytoskeletal architecture of hair cells (Chang2014The). Alterations in KRT34 expression have been linked to various medical conditions, including potential roles in ciliary function and cancer progression, although these associations require further investigation (Aridi2022Detection; Pereira2020Unveiling).

## Function
KRT34, or keratin 34, is a type I hair keratin gene that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of hair follicles. It is primarily expressed in hair follicles, where it contributes to hair strength and resilience by providing mechanical support and protection to epithelial cells (Chang2014The). KRT34 is involved in the condensation of dermal papilla (DP) cells and germ formation from outer root sheath (ORS) cells, processes essential for hair growth and follicle cycling (An2022Keratinmediated). 

The protein encoded by KRT34 is active in the cytoskeleton, where it forms intermediate filaments that maintain cell structure and integrity, especially under mechanical stress (Chang2014The). In the context of hair biology, KRT34 is implicated in the regulation of hair follicle development and cycling, influencing the transition between different phases of the hair growth cycle (An2022Keratinmediated). The downregulation of KRT34 has been shown to suppress anagen hair follicle formation and hair growth, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal hair growth processes (An2022Keratinmediated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KRT34 gene have been implicated in various medical conditions. In the context of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a study identified a 0.7-fold increase in KRT34 expression in a patient, suggesting a potential, yet unconfirmed, role in ciliary function due to the complexity of the ciliary proteome (Pereira2020Unveiling). Although no direct association between KRT34 and PCD or Kartagener syndrome is known, the study hypothesizes that the upregulation of KRT34 may cause protein misallocation in respiratory cells, similar to mechanisms observed in tumor cells (Pereira2020Unveiling).

KRT34 has also been associated with cancer. It is noted for its role in invasive or early tumorigenesis in skin keratinocyte lines and is classified among genes with a known role in metastasis in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) (Aridi2022Detection). In prostate cancer, KRT34 is mentioned among keratin genes with differential expression between African American and European American patients, although its expression levels were too low to evaluate differences meaningfully (Mori2022Molecular). These findings suggest that KRT34 may play a role in cancer progression and metastasis, although further research is needed to confirm these associations.
