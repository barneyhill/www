# OR10G4

## Overview
OR10G4 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily G member 4, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory system. The receptor is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to specific odor molecules, initiating a cascade of neuronal responses that contribute to the perception of smell (Logan2014Do). Genetic variations in OR10G4 can influence individual differences in odor perception, highlighting its significance in sensory biology (Alonso2008Overdominance). While OR10G4 is crucial for olfactory function, its activity may vary depending on the context and specific odorants involved (Ieki2022Functional).

## Function
OR10G4 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR10G4 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Logan2014Do).

Genetic variations in OR10G4, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), can affect the intensity and valence of odor perception, particularly for compounds like guaiacol. These variations lead to phenotypic differences in how individuals perceive certain odors (Logan2014Do). The receptor's activity is influenced by its genetic diversity, which may enhance olfactory acuity by increasing the diversity of odorant-binding sites, allowing for better discrimination among similar odorants (Alonso2008Overdominance).

Despite its role in olfactory perception, OR10G4 did not show significant functional responses to certain odorants in specific experimental settings, suggesting that its activity may be context-dependent or limited to particular odorants not tested in those studies (Ieki2022Functional).
