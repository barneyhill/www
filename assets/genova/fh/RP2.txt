# RP2

## Overview
The RP2 gene encodes the RP2 activator of ARL3 GTPase, a protein that plays a critical role in intracellular trafficking, particularly within the photoreceptor cells of the retina. This protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the small GTPase Arl3, facilitating the regulation of vesicle transport between the Golgi complex and the primary cilium, which is essential for maintaining photoreceptor cell function and vision (Evans2010The). Structurally, the RP2 protein comprises an N-terminal β-helix domain and a C-terminal ferredoxin-like α/β domain, with post-translational modifications such as myristoylation and palmitoylation crucial for its membrane localization (Holopainen2010Interaction; Kühnel2006Crystal). Mutations in the RP2 gene are linked to X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), a severe retinal degenerative disease characterized by progressive vision loss (Holopainen2010Interaction; Pelletier2006Comprehensive).

## Structure
The RP2 protein, encoded by the RP2 gene, is composed of 350 amino acids and features two main domains: an N-terminal β-helix domain and a C-terminal ferredoxin-like α/β domain (Holopainen2010Interaction; Kühnel2006Crystal). The N-terminal domain, spanning residues 1-228, forms a right-handed β-helix with a rectangular barrel shape, consisting of seven coils, where the first six are regular and form parallel β sheets (Kühnel2006Crystal). The C-terminal domain, from residues 229-350, resembles a nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK)-like structure but lacks conserved catalytic residues (Kühnel2006Crystal).

RP2 is myristoylated and palmitoylated at its N-terminus, which is crucial for its localization to the plasma membrane (Holopainen2010Interaction; Chapple2000Mutations). These post-translational modifications are essential for its membrane association, with myristoylation occurring at the N-terminal glycine and palmitoylation at adjacent cysteine residues (Chapple2000Mutations). The protein interacts specifically with the small GTPase Arl3 in a GTP-dependent manner, acting as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Arl3 (Holopainen2010Interaction; Kühnel2006Crystal). The N-terminal domain is critical for this interaction, particularly the first 34 residues (Kühnel2006Crystal).

## Function
The RP2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the small GTPase Arl3, playing a crucial role in intracellular trafficking processes, particularly in photoreceptor cells of the retina. RP2 is involved in the regulation of vesicle transport between the Golgi complex and the primary cilium, essential for maintaining photoreceptor cell function and vision (Evans2010The). It localizes to the basal body, Golgi complex, and periciliary ridge, where it regulates the trafficking of proteins to the ciliary membrane (Evans2010The).

In healthy human cells, RP2 is necessary for the proper localization and trafficking of ciliary tip kinesins, such as Kif7 and Kif17, to the cilia tips, which are vital for ciliary function and stability (Schwarz2017Arl3). RP2's interaction with Arl3 is critical for vesicle trafficking, as it helps in the inactivation of Arl3, preventing the accumulation of Arl3-GTP inside cilia, which is necessary for the correct release and localization of ciliary proteins (Schwarz2017Arl3). This function is essential for processes like Hedgehog signaling, which is important for cellular signaling pathways (Schwarz2017Arl3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RP2 gene are primarily associated with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), a severe form of retinal degeneration characterized by progressive vision loss. XLRP accounts for 10-20% of retinitis pigmentosa cases and is marked by early onset and significant visual impairment, often before the age of 30 (Holopainen2010Interaction; Pelletier2006Comprehensive). Mutations such as E138G and ΔI137 disrupt RP2's interaction with N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), affecting protein trafficking in retinal photoreceptor cells (Holopainen2010Interaction). The ∆S6 mutation interferes with the protein's localization to the plasma membrane, leading to a milder form of retinitis pigmentosa (Chapple2000Mutations).

The RP2 gene mutations can lead to severe bilateral peripheral visual field depression, reduced rod electroretinogram amplitudes, and low visual acuity by the third decade of life (Pelletier2006Comprehensive). A novel missense mutation, Q158P, has been shown to impair RP2 protein stability, contributing to the pathogenesis of XLRP (Zhang2019A). These mutations often result in null alleles or mislocalized proteins, potentially leading to nonsense-mediated decay of mRNA or incorrect protein targeting (Pelletier2006Comprehensive).

## Interactions
The RP2 protein interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in photoreceptor function and ciliary trafficking. RP2 is known to bind to ADP ribosylation factor-like 3 (Arl3), acting as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Arl3, which is essential for regulating vesicle transport between the Golgi complex and the primary cilium in photoreceptors (Holopainen2010Interaction; Evans2010The). This interaction is crucial for maintaining Golgi cohesion and facilitating vesicle transport to the photoreceptor connecting cilium (Evans2010The).

RP2 also interacts with N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) in retinal photoreceptor cells. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal domain of NSF, and mutations in RP2 that cause X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) disrupt this interaction (Holopainen2010Interaction). The colocalization of RP2 and NSF is observed in various retinal layers, suggesting a role in vesicle trafficking in photoreceptors (Holopainen2010Interaction).

Additionally, RP2 interacts with kinesins Kif7 and Kif17, regulating their trafficking to the ciliary tip. This interaction is important for the localization of these kinesins, which are crucial for ciliary function (Schwarz2017Arl3a). The loss of RP2 affects the localization of these proteins, impacting ciliary function and stability (Schwarz2017Arl3a).
