# CCM2

## Overview
The CCM2 gene encodes the CCM2 scaffold protein, also known as malcavernin, which is integral to the formation and function of the cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) complex. This protein is categorized as a scaffold protein due to its role in organizing and stabilizing protein complexes within cells. The CCM2 protein is involved in maintaining vascular integrity and endothelial cell function by interacting with other proteins such as KRIT1 (CCM1) and PDCD10 (CCM3) to form a trimeric complex. This complex is crucial for stabilizing endothelial cell-cell junctions and regulating signaling pathways that ensure vascular stability and limit inflammatory responses (Draheim2014Cerebral; Baranoski2016Cerebral). Mutations in the CCM2 gene are linked to cerebral cavernous malformations, which can lead to significant clinical symptoms, including headaches and seizures, due to their impact on vascular structures in the central nervous system (Scimone2018Two; d2011mutation).

## Structure
The CCM2 protein, also known as malcavernin, is a scaffold protein involved in cerebral cavernous malformations. It contains a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain at its N-terminus, which is part of the Dab-like subfamily and interacts with NPXY motifs, such as those found in KRIT1 (Fisher2015Structural). The PTB domain has a PH/PTB fold and includes a C-terminal α-helix and seven β-strands arranged in two anti-parallel β-sheets (Fisher2015Structural). The CCM2 protein also features a C-terminal harmonin-homology domain (HHD), which is a folded helical domain similar to the Usher syndrome protein harmonin (Fisher2012Structural).

CCM2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct cellular functions and subcellular localizations (Jiang2019Alternatively). Some isoforms contain a novel atypical PTB domain (aPTB) composed of exons 6 and 6A, forming a horseshoe structure with two α-helices capable of binding to CCM1 or CCM3 proteins (Jiang2019Alternatively). The protein's structure is further regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its interactions and stability (Fisher2015Structural). These structural features enable CCM2 to play a crucial role in cellular signaling and vascular integrity.

## Function
CCM2, also known as malcavernin, is a scaffold protein that plays a critical role in maintaining vascular integrity and endothelial cell function. It is a part of the cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) complex, which includes CCM1 and CCM3, and is involved in various signaling pathways essential for endothelial quiescence and vascular stability (Schwefel2020Fibronectin; Swamy2022Is). CCM2 interacts with KRIT1 (CCM1) and PDCD10 (CCM3) to form a heterotrimeric complex that stabilizes cell-cell junctions and limits inflammatory and angiogenic signaling (Schwefel2020Fibronectin; Swamy2022Is).

In healthy human cells, CCM2 is involved in the regulation of the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway, which is crucial for controlling endothelial permeability and maintaining the integrity of cell-cell junctions (Lisowska2018The). It also plays a role in the production of a functional fibronectin matrix, which is vital for cell adhesion, proliferation, and vascular stability (Schwefel2020Fibronectin). CCM2 is active in the cytoplasm and can shuttle to the nucleus, where it may influence nuclear functions and cellular responses to osmotic stress (Draheim2014Cerebral; Jiang2019Alternatively). The protein's interaction with MEKK3 is essential for maintaining the blood-brain barrier and regulating vascular permeability (Fisher2015Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCM2 gene are associated with cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), which are vascular lesions in the central nervous system. These lesions can lead to a variety of clinical symptoms, including headaches, seizures, neurological deficits, and intracerebral hemorrhages (Scimone2018Two; d2011mutation). CCMs can occur sporadically or as a familial condition with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Familial cases often present multiple lesions, while sporadic cases typically have a single lesion (d2011mutation).

The penetrance of CCM2 mutations was initially thought to be 100%, but recent studies suggest it may be lower, around 70% (Scimone2018Two; Riolo2021Molecular). Mutations in CCM2 can disrupt its role in maintaining endothelial cell junctions and regulating vascular morphogenesis, leading to increased endothelial permeability and abnormal vascular development (Scimone2018Two; d2011mutation). The gene encodes the protein malcavernin, which is part of a complex involved in cell junction integrity and vascular permeability (Riolo2021Molecular).

CCM2 mutations can result in a range of genetic alterations, including nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants, contributing to the heterogeneous clinical presentation of CCMs (Much2019Novel; Han2021A). The presence of multiple lesions is common in familial cases, and genetic counseling is recommended for affected individuals (Han2021A).

## Interactions
CCM2, also known as malcavernin, is a scaffold protein that plays a critical role in the formation and function of the cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) complex. It interacts with KRIT1 (CCM1) and PDCD10 (CCM3) to form a trimeric complex that is essential for stabilizing endothelial cell-cell junctions and maintaining vascular integrity (Draheim2014Cerebral; Baranoski2016Cerebral). The interaction between CCM2 and KRIT1 is mediated by the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of CCM2, which binds to conserved NPxY/F motifs in KRIT1 (Fisher2012Structural; Zawistowski2005CCM1). CCM2 also interacts with PDCD10 through LD motifs, which helps stabilize the complex and prevent its degradation (Baranoski2016Cerebral).

CCM2 is involved in several signaling pathways, including the MEKK3-mediated p38 MAPK pathway. It acts as a scaffold for MEKK3, Rac1, and MKK3, facilitating p38 MAPK activation, particularly during osmotic stress (Zawistowski2005CCM1; Baxter2014Role). CCM2 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF1, promoting the degradation of RhoA, which is crucial for actin polymerization and endothelial cell integrity (Draheim2014Cerebral; Baranoski2016Cerebral). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of CCM2 in cellular signaling and structural maintenance.
