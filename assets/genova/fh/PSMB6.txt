# PSMB6

## Overview
PSMB6 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 20S subunit beta 6, a critical component of the proteasome complex involved in protein degradation. The proteasome is a multi-subunit protease complex that plays a vital role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, responsible for degrading ubiquitinated proteins and maintaining protein homeostasis within the cell. The PSMB6-encoded protein is categorized as a protease and is integral to the 20S core proteasome, which performs essential proteolytic activities. These activities are crucial for regulating various cellular processes, including the cell cycle, stress responses, and immune modulation. The gene's expression and function have significant implications in health and disease, particularly in cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and patient outcomes (Li2021Integrated; Ansar2020Biallelic; Sun2013Identification).

## Function
PSMB6 encodes a subunit of the 20S proteasome, which is a core component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for degrading ubiquitinated proteins. This process is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating the cell cycle, and modulating immune responses. The 20S proteasome, composed of α and β-type subunits, performs proteolytic activities, including caspase-like, trypsin-like, and chymotrypsin-like activities, which are essential for the degradation of intracellular proteins (Ansar2020Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, PSMB6 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to protein turnover and cellular stress responses. The proteasome's function is vital for removing misfolded or damaged proteins, thereby preventing the accumulation of potentially toxic protein aggregates. This activity is essential for cellular regulation and development, as it ensures the proper concentration of specific proteins and the degradation of those that are no longer needed or are damaged (Ansar2020Biallelic).

The proteasome, including the PSMB6 subunit, plays a critical role in various cellular processes, such as cell cycle regulation, stress response, and DNA repair. Its function is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is involved in numerous cellular pathways and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Sun2013Identification).

## Clinical Significance
PSMB6, a component of the proteasome complex, has significant clinical implications in various cancers. High expression of PSMB6 is associated with poor survival outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and is considered a risk factor in kidney chromophobe (KICH) cancer. Conversely, in ovarian cancer (OV), high PSMB6 expression correlates with better survival, suggesting a protective role in this context (Li2021Integrated). The expression of PSMB6 also varies significantly across pathological stages in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression (Li2021Integrated).

PSMB6 expression is linked to the immune microenvironment in cancers, showing widespread negative associations with certain immune cells, such as naïve B cells and activated mast cells (Li2021Integrated). This suggests that PSMB6 may influence immune responses in the tumor microenvironment, impacting cancer progression and patient outcomes.

The role of PSMB6 in cancer highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions and as a biomarker for predictive diagnostics. Its involvement in various cancers underscores the importance of understanding proteasome gene alterations for developing targeted therapies and personalized medicine approaches (Li2021Integrated).

## Interactions
PSMB6, or proteasome 20S subunit beta 6, is a component of the 20S core proteasome complex, which plays a crucial role in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. It is involved in forming the 20S core proteasome complex by interacting with other proteasome subunits. This core complex can associate with regulatory particles, such as the 19S complex, to form the 26S proteasome, facilitating protein degradation.

In the context of deltamethrin resistance in mosquitoes, PSMB6 has been identified as significantly elevated in deltamethrin-resistant cells, suggesting its involvement in resistance mechanisms. The study by Sun et al. demonstrated that inhibiting PSMB6 increased susceptibility to deltamethrin in resistant cells and larvae, indicating a functional interaction within the ubiquitin-proteasome system that contributes to insecticide resistance (Sun2013Identification).

While specific protein-protein interactions involving PSMB6 were not detailed in the provided context, its role in the proteasome complex suggests interactions with other proteasome subunits are essential for its function in protein degradation and cellular regulation (Sun2013Identification).
