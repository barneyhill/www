# AKR1D1

## Overview
AKR1D1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme aldo-keto reductase family 1 member D1, also known as steroid 5β-reductase. This enzyme is a member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, characterized by its role in the reduction of steroid substrates. AKR1D1 is primarily expressed in the liver, where it plays a critical role in steroid metabolism and bile acid biosynthesis. The enzyme catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the C4-C5 double bond in Δ4-ketosteroids, facilitating the formation of an A/B cis-ring junction, which is essential for the production of bile acids. These bile acids are crucial for the emulsification and absorption of dietary fats and cholesterol. Additionally, AKR1D1 is involved in the inactivation of steroid hormones, such as glucocorticoids, androgens, and progestins, thereby regulating their physiological activity. Mutations in the AKR1D1 gene can lead to congenital bile acid synthesis defects, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Chen2015InDepth; Nikolaou2019AKR1D1; Rižner2014Role).

## Structure
The AKR1D1 protein, also known as human steroid 5β-reductase, is part of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and features a conserved (α/β)8-barrel fold, a common structural motif in this family (Di2009Structure). The enzyme is monomeric in solution, as indicated by the small interface surface areas between monomers in the crystal structure (Di2009Structure). The active site of AKR1D1 is defined by loops A, B, and C, which cap the upper part of the β-barrel, and it includes a catalytic tetrad composed of Asp 53, Tyr 58, Lys 87, and Glu 120 (Di2009Structure; Faucher2008The). This tetrad is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic mechanism, facilitating the reduction of the C4-C5 double bond in steroid substrates (Faucher2008The).

A notable feature of AKR1D1 is the substitution of histidine with glutamate at position 120, which allows deeper penetration of the steroid substrate into the active site, optimizing reactant positioning (Di2009Structure). The enzyme also contains a 'switch tryptophan' residue, Trp 230, which can adopt different rotamers to influence ligand binding and access to the active site (Lee2009Structure–activity; Faucher2008Crystal). The protein is expressed with an N-terminal His6-tag for purification and crystallization purposes (Lee2009Structure–activity).

## Function
The AKR1D1 gene encodes the enzyme steroid 5β-reductase, which plays a crucial role in steroid metabolism and bile acid biosynthesis in humans. This enzyme is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the C4-C5 double bond in Δ4-ketosteroids, forming an A/B cis-ring junction. This structural change is essential for the biosynthesis of bile acids, which are critical for emulsifying dietary fats and cholesterol, thus aiding in lipid digestion and cholesterol homeostasis (Rižner2014Role; Chen2011Substrate).

AKR1D1 is responsible for generating all 5β-dihydrosteroids in the C19-C27 steroid series, which are important for various physiological processes, including the regulation of nuclear receptors and the modulation of neuroactive steroids (Chen20145βReduced). The enzyme also plays a significant role in the inactivation of steroid hormones such as glucocorticoids, androgens, and progestins, thereby regulating their availability and activity in the body (Appanna2021Differential; Nikolaou2019AKR1D1). By influencing glucocorticoid clearance, AKR1D1 helps maintain metabolic balance and protect against glucocorticoid excess (Nikolaou2020Glucocorticoids).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AKR1D1 gene, which encodes the enzyme steroid-5β-reductase, are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting bile acid metabolism. One significant disorder linked to AKR1D1 mutations is congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 2 (CBAS 2), an autosomal recessive condition characterized by bile acid deficiency. This deficiency can lead to severe neonatal hepatitis and cholestasis, as the enzyme's impaired function results in the accumulation of hepatotoxic bile acids and a reduction in primary bile acids (Chen2015InDepth; Drury2010Characterization).

Specific mutations, such as P133R, L106F, P198L, G223E, and R261C, have been identified in patients with 5β-reductase deficiency. These mutations affect the enzyme's stability, kinetic properties, and expression levels, contributing to the disease phenotype (Drury2010Characterization). The P133R mutation, in particular, causes a significant decrease in catalytic efficiency, impacting the enzyme's ability to bind NADP(H) cofactors and perform hydride transfer, which is crucial for bile acid synthesis (Chen2015InDepth).

Treatment for these conditions often involves the administration of primary bile acids, such as cholic acid, which can help normalize liver function and improve clinical outcomes (Gardin2023∆43oxo5βreductase; Drury2010Characterization).

## Interactions
AKR1D1, also known as aldo-keto reductase family 1 member D1, is involved in several interactions that influence its function in steroid metabolism. The enzyme interacts with the cofactor NADPH, which is essential for its catalytic activity. The binding of NADPH is the initial step in the enzyme's activity, and it is maintained in the binding site by a flexible loop B, which acts as a 'safety belt' (Faucher2008Crystal). 

AKR1D1 also interacts with various steroid substrates, such as androstenedione and progesterone, which can inhibit the enzyme by occupying an alternative binding site and blocking access to the catalytic site (Faucher2008Crystal). The enzyme's interaction with these substrates involves key residues, including Tyr 132, Ser 225, and Asn 227, which form hydrogen bonds, and Val 309 and Trp 230, which participate in hydrophobic interactions (Faucher2008Crystal).

Inhibition studies have shown that AKR1D1 can be inhibited by finasteride, a competitive inhibitor, which binds to the enzyme in a manner similar to progesterone (Drury2009Inhibition). These interactions highlight the enzyme's role in regulating steroid metabolism and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
