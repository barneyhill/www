# C12orf76

## Overview
C12orf76 is a gene located on chromosome 12 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 12 open reading frame 76. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. It has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including schizophrenia, colorectal cancer, and lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting its potential role in disease mechanisms and as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (AmlieWolf2018INFERNO:; Bao2022Development; Yang2019TIMP1). The expression of C12orf76 can be influenced by external factors such as viral infections, which can modify chromatin interactions and gene expression (Satou2016The).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
C12orf76 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and interactions. In schizophrenia, the gene is associated with the 12q24 region, where the variant rs4766428 shows high association signals. This variant overlaps with transcription factor binding sites and is linked to multiple eQTL signals, suggesting a role in transmembrane cellular processes related to schizophrenia (AmlieWolf2018INFERNO:).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), C12orf76 is part of a co-expression module identified in tumor-educated platelets, which shows a strong correlation with CRC. This suggests that C12orf76, along with other genes in the module, may play significant roles in CRC development and could serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis (Yang2019TIMP1).

In lung adenocarcinoma, C12orf76 is included in a prognostic model based on alternative splicing events. The deregulation of these genes, including C12orf76, is associated with poor outcomes, indicating its potential impact on tumor progression and patient prognosis (Bao2022Development).

Additionally, the presence of the retrovirus HTLV-1 can alter the expression of C12orf76 by inserting a CTCF-binding site into the human genome, affecting chromatin interactions and gene expression (Satou2016The).
