# CTCF

## Overview
CTCF, or CCCTC-binding factor, is a highly conserved gene that encodes a multifunctional DNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin architecture. The CTCF protein is categorized as a transcriptional regulator and is pivotal in establishing chromatin boundaries and insulators, which are essential for maintaining the independent regulation of adjacent genes. It plays a crucial role in the formation of chromatin loops, facilitating enhancer-promoter interactions necessary for precise gene regulation (Merkenschlager2013CTCF; de2015CTCF). CTCF is ubiquitously expressed across vertebrates, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular processes, including imprinting control, X chromosome inactivation, and the regulation of noncoding RNAs (Merkenschlager2013CTCF; Kim2007Analysis). Its interactions with various protein partners, such as cohesin and nucleophosmin, further highlight its integral role in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation (Parelho2008Cohesins; Zlatanova2009CTCF).

## Function
CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is a multifunctional DNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in regulating gene expression and chromatin organization in human cells. It is involved in establishing insulators, which are elements that prevent enhancers from inappropriately activating genes across boundaries, thereby maintaining the independent regulation of neighboring genes (Bell1999The). CTCF is essential for the formation of chromatin loops, which facilitate interactions between enhancers and promoters, crucial for gene regulation (Merkenschlager2013CTCF; de2015CTCF).

CTCF binding sites are often located at the boundaries of topological domains, where they help maintain the integrity of these domains by preventing interactions between neighboring domains (Zuin2013Cohesin). The protein's role extends to imprinting control, as seen in the H19/IGF2 locus, where it blocks IGF2 expression by binding to unmethylated maternal alleles (Merkenschlager2013CTCF). CTCF also influences X chromosome inactivation and the transcription of noncoding RNAs (Merkenschlager2013CTCF).

CTCF is ubiquitously expressed and its binding sites are highly conserved across vertebrates, indicating its fundamental role in cellular function (Kim2007Analysis). It acts as both a transcriptional repressor and activator, depending on the sequence context (Kim2007Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CTCF gene are associated with a range of diseases, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. CTCF mutations, such as the R567W point mutation, have been linked to developmental disorders due to their impact on 3D genome rearrangement and abnormal neurodevelopment. This mutation affects CTCF's ability to bind DNA, leading to changes in chromatin structure and gene expression, which can result in intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, and other neurodevelopmental issues (Zhang2024CTCF).

CTCF-related disorder (CRD) is an autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, growth retardation, and other anomalies. The disorder is caused by mutations in the CTCF gene, which affect its DNA-binding zinc finger domains, crucial for maintaining chromatin organization (Valverde2022Expansion).

In cancer, CTCF acts as a tumor suppressor, with mutations and deletions in the CTCF locus linked to various cancers, including breast and prostate cancers. These mutations can alter chromatin accessibility and gene expression, contributing to oncogenic processes (Do2024Brain). CTCF haploinsufficiency is also a known mechanism of tumorigenesis, highlighting its critical role in maintaining genomic stability (Price2023An).

## Interactions
CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is a versatile transcriptional regulator that interacts with a variety of protein partners, influencing chromatin organization and gene expression. It forms complexes with cohesin, a critical partner in mediating long-range chromosomal interactions and gene regulation. CTCF and cohesin colocalize extensively at CTCF-binding sites, such as the Myc insulator element, and cohesin's positioning is largely determined by CTCF (Parelho2008Cohesins; Zlatanova2009CTCF).

CTCF also interacts with nucleophosmin, a nuclear-matrix phosphoprotein, at insulator sites, suggesting a role in recruiting insulators to the nucleolus periphery. This interaction is crucial for CTCF's insulator function (Zlatanova2009CTCF). Additionally, CTCF interacts with RNA polymerase II, particularly the hypophosphorylated form involved in transcription initiation, indicating a role in transcriptional regulation (Zlatanova2009CTCF).

CTCF's interaction with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, particularly the BRG1 subunit, highlights its role in chromatin remodeling and genome topology. This interaction is independent of nucleic acids and involves the zinc finger domains of CTCF (Valletta2020Exploring; Marino2019Interactome). CTCF also interacts with PARP1, affecting DNA methylation and gene imprinting through poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (Zlatanova2009CTCF).
