# PLA2G4E

## Overview
PLA2G4E is a gene that encodes the protein cytosolic phospholipase A2 epsilon (cPLA2ε), a member of the phospholipase A2 enzyme family. This enzyme is categorized as a cytosolic phospholipase and is involved in the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids, leading to the release of arachidonic acid, a precursor for eicosanoids, which are important signaling molecules in inflammation and other cellular processes (Kitsiouli2009Phospholipase; Khan2023The). cPLA2ε is characterized by its ability to bind to membranes independently of calcium through a polybasic domain, and it plays a significant role in membrane remodeling and recycling, particularly within the clathrin-independent endocytic pathway (Capestrano2014Cytosolic). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, where it is implicated in synaptic function and memory, contributing to neural plasticity and cognitive processes (PérezGonzález2020PLA2G4E). Its involvement in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and panic disorder, underscores its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (PérezGonzález2020PLA2G4E; Morimoto2018Wholeexome).

## Structure
The PLA2G4E gene encodes the cytosolic phospholipase A2 epsilon (cPLA2ε), which is part of the cPLA2 enzyme family. This protein features several important domains that contribute to its function and localization. It includes a C2 domain, which is typically involved in calcium-dependent membrane binding, although cPLA2ε can associate with membranes independently of calcium through a polybasic (PB) domain at its C-terminus (Capestrano2014Cytosolic; Binte2018The). The PB domain interacts with phosphoinositides, particularly PI(4,5)P2, facilitating membrane association (Capestrano2014Cytosolic).

The protein also contains a lipase domain with a catalytic dyad composed of Ser-412 and Asp-700, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Binte2018The). Mutations in these domains, such as the S420A mutation, result in a loss of phospholipase activity, highlighting their importance for function (Capestrano2014Cytosolic). The structure of cPLA2ε allows it to participate in the clathrin-independent endocytic pathway, where it plays a role in membrane remodeling and recycling processes (Capestrano2014Cytosolic). The protein's activity and localization are influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

## Function
PLA2G4E encodes a cytosolic phospholipase A2 enzyme, which plays a significant role in the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids to release arachidonic acid, a precursor for eicosanoids, which are crucial signaling molecules involved in inflammation and other cellular processes (Kitsiouli2009Phospholipase; Khan2023The). This enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in cellular responses to external stimuli (Khan2023The).

PLA2G4E is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, testis, and skeletal muscle, and is particularly noted for its role in synaptic function and memory (PérezGonzález2020PLA2G4E). It is involved in the production of N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines, which are precursors of lipid transmitters like anandamide, contributing to neural plasticity and memory (PérezGonzález2020PLA2G4E). The enzyme's activity is linked to synaptic plasticity, as it increases dendritic spine density, which is associated with cognitive improvement (PérezGonzález2020PLA2G4E).

PLA2G4E also functions as a Ca2+-dependent N-acyltransferase, involved in the biosynthesis of N-acylethanolamines, which are endocannabinoid lipid mediators (Murakami2020Updating). This activity is crucial for maintaining synaptic efficacy and memory retention, particularly in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PérezGonzález2020PLA2G4E).

## Clinical Significance
The PLA2G4E gene has been implicated in several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), alterations in PLA2G4E expression have been associated with cognitive resilience. Overexpression of PLA2G4E in the hippocampus of AD mouse models has been shown to restore memory and increase dendritic spine density, suggesting its role in synaptic plasticity and memory function (PérezGonzález2020PLA2G4E). Conversely, downregulation of PLA2G4E is observed in severe AD cases, indicating its potential involvement in disease progression and dementia onset (PérezGonzález2020PLA2G4E).

PLA2G4E has also been studied in the context of panic disorder (PD). Whole-exome sequencing and gene-based rare variant association tests suggest that rare variants in PLA2G4E might contribute to the genetic predisposition to PD, although these findings require further validation (Morimoto2018Wholeexome). Additionally, epigenetic variations in PLA2G4E have been linked to neurodevelopmental issues in preterm infants, potentially affecting neurobehavioral outcomes (Everson2019Epigenomewide). These studies highlight the gene's potential role in various neurological conditions, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
PLA2G4E, also known as cytosolic phospholipase A2 epsilon (cPLA2ε), participates in several interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with phosphoinositide lipids, particularly PI(4,5)P2, which is essential for targeting cPLA2ε to clathrin-independent endosomes. This interaction is mediated by a polybasic C-terminal stretch, which allows cPLA2ε to bind to PI(4,5)P2-enriched membranes, facilitating its role in membrane tubulation and recycling processes (Capestrano2014Cytosolic).

cPLA2ε also interacts with phospholipase D2 (PLD2), which produces phosphatidic acid. This interaction aids in the fission of tubular elements into transport carriers, highlighting the enzyme's role in membrane remodeling and recycling within the clathrin-independent endocytic route (Capestrano2014Cytosolic).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, PLA2G4E expression is associated with synaptic activity and memory function. It is involved in the activation of CREB and GluA1 pathways, which are crucial for synaptic plasticity. Knockdown of PLA2G4E blocks these pathways, indicating its essential role in synaptic signaling (PérezGonzález2020PLA2G4E).
