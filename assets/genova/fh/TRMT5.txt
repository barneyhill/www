# TRMT5

## Overview
TRMT5 is a gene that encodes the enzyme tRNA methyltransferase 5, which is a member of the class I-like methyltransferase superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNA, specifically catalyzing the methylation of guanosine at position 37 (m1G37) in mt-tRNA. This modification is crucial for maintaining the stability and function of mitochondrial tRNA, thereby ensuring translational efficiency and accuracy within the mitochondria (Powell2015TRMT5). The TRMT5 protein is localized to the mitochondria and contains a SAM-dependent methyltransferase domain essential for its catalytic activity (Powell2015TRMT5). Mutations in the TRMT5 gene can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and are associated with various clinical conditions, including mitochondrial disorders and certain cancers (Powell2015TRMT5; Yuan2024Dysregulation).

## Structure
TRMT5 (tRNA methyltransferase 5) is an enzyme involved in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNA, specifically methylating guanosine at position 37 (m1G37) in mt-tRNA. The primary structure of TRMT5 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the TRMT5 gene. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of TRMT5 forms a three-dimensional shape that is crucial for its enzymatic activity, featuring a Rossmann fold, a common motif in methyltransferases that facilitates binding to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl donor in the methylation process (Powell2015TRMT5).

TRMT5 contains a SAM-dependent methyltransferase domain, which is essential for its catalytic function. Mutations in this domain, such as p.Arg291His and p.Met386Val, can destabilize the active-site structure, impairing the enzyme's function (Powell2015TRMT5). The protein is localized to the mitochondria, as confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis and cellular fractionation experiments, indicating its role in mitochondrial tRNA modification (Powell2015TRMT5). While specific post-translational modifications of TRMT5 are not detailed in the provided context, such modifications could potentially influence its activity and stability.

## Function
TRMT5 (tRNA methyltransferase 5) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNA in healthy human cells. It is responsible for the methylation of guanosine at position 37 (m1G37) in mitochondrial tRNA, specifically in mt-tRNA Leu(CUN). This modification is essential for maintaining the stability and function of mitochondrial tRNA, preventing readthrough during reverse transcription, which would otherwise indicate a lack of modification (Powell2015TRMT5). The methylation of guanine at position 37 is crucial for maintaining translational efficiency and accuracy, as it prevents Watson-Crick base pairing that could lead to frame shifting and misacylation of tRNA. The absence of m1G37 can result in increased frameshifting, altered protein sequences, and reduced stringency in aminoacyl-tRNA selection, impairing mitochondrial protein synthesis (Powell2015TRMT5).

TRMT5 is a mitochondrial protein that belongs to the class I-like methyltransferase superfamily. Its activity is vital for the proper functioning of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS), which is responsible for energy production in cells. Mutations in TRMT5 can lead to hypomodification of G37, resulting in multiple mitochondrial respiratory-chain deficiencies and associated clinical phenotypes (Powell2015TRMT5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRMT5 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders and other conditions due to their impact on mitochondrial tRNA modification. Specifically, mutations such as p.Arg291His and p.Met386Val lead to defects in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNA, particularly affecting the m1G37 modification. This defect is linked to multiple respiratory-chain deficiencies, resulting in clinical manifestations like lactic acidosis, exercise intolerance, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, growth retardation, and developmental delays (Powell2015TRMT5).

TRMT5 mutations are also implicated in Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 26 (COXPD26), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by developmental delay, muscle weakness, and exercise intolerance. This condition is linked to compound heterozygous mutations in TRMT5, which disrupt tRNA methylation crucial for maintaining the reading frame during protein synthesis (Wu2022Novel).

In cancer, TRMT5 has been associated with liver cancer progression. Its role as an m1G methyltransferase is crucial for reshaping mitochondrial metabolism, which is important for cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Targeting TRMT5 has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating hepatocellular carcinoma by inhibiting the HIF-1α pathways (Yuan2024Dysregulation).

## Interactions
TRMT5, a tRNA methyltransferase, is primarily involved in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNA, specifically the methylation of guanosine at position 37 (m1G37). This modification is crucial for maintaining translational efficiency and accuracy, preventing frameshifting and misacylation of tRNA (Powell2015TRMT5). TRMT5 interacts with tRNA molecules to facilitate this modification, which is essential for proper tRNA function and stability (Christian2013Conservation).

The enzyme's activity involves the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet) to the N1 of G37 in tRNA, a process that is conserved across eukaryotic and archaeal species (Christian2013Conservation). The structural and mechanistic similarities between human TRMT5 (HsTrm5) and its archaeal counterpart (MjTrm5) suggest a conserved catalytic mechanism, including a one-proton transfer in the methyl transfer process (Christian2013Conservation).

While specific protein-protein interactions involving TRMT5 are not detailed in the provided context, its role in RNA processing and modification pathways implies potential interactions with other proteins involved in these processes. However, the context does not provide direct evidence of such interactions. Therefore, further research is needed to elucidate the full range of TRMT5's interactions with other proteins.
