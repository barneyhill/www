# ELF3

## Overview
ELF3, or E74 like ETS transcription factor 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the ETS transcription factor family, which is characterized by a conserved ETS DNA-binding domain. This domain is essential for the protein's role in binding specific DNA sequences and regulating gene expression. The ELF3 protein is notable for its involvement in epithelial differentiation and the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes, playing a crucial role in maintaining epithelial characteristics. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues such as the digestive tract, bladder, and lungs. ELF3's function is modulated by its prion-like domain, which is involved in temperature sensing and phase transition behavior, particularly in plants. The gene's expression and mutations have significant implications in various cancers, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, depending on the context (Agarkar2009Preliminary; Luk2018ELF3; Subbalakshmi2023The).

## Structure
The ELF3 protein, also known as E74 like ETS transcription factor 3, is a member of the ETS transcription factor family, characterized by a conserved ETS DNA-binding domain. This domain is crucial for its role in binding to specific DNA sequences and regulating gene expression (Agarkar2009Preliminary). The protein structure includes a prion-like domain (PrD) that is involved in temperature sensing, particularly in plants like Arabidopsis thaliana. This PrD contains a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract, which influences the protein's temperature responsiveness by modulating its phase transition behavior (Lindsay2023Molecular; Jung2020A).

The ELF3 protein is largely disordered, with the PrD contributing significantly to its sequence. This domain is enriched in polar amino acids such as glutamine and asparagine, typical of prion-like domains, and is involved in forming reversible nuclear condensates at higher temperatures (Lindsay2023Molecular). The presence of aromatic residues, particularly around the polyQ tract, plays a significant role in the protein's structural dynamics and temperature sensitivity (Lindsay2023Molecular). The ELF3 protein's structure and function are influenced by the length of the polyQ tract, which varies among different populations (Lindsay2023Molecular).

## Function
ELF3 (E74 like ETS transcription factor 3) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in maintaining epithelial characteristics and regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) processes. In healthy human cells, ELF3 is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues such as the digestive tract, bladder, and lungs, where it contributes to differentiation and homeostasis (Subbalakshmi2023The).

ELF3 functions by interacting with a core EMT regulatory circuit, which includes both EMT-inducing transcription factors like ZEB1/2, SNAIL, and SLUG, and EMT-inhibiting factors such as the miR-200 family and KLF4. It stabilizes a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal state and delays the transition to a mesenchymal phenotype in response to external signals (Subbalakshmi2023The). ELF3 also binds to the promoter region of the Grhl3 gene, activating its expression, which is crucial for MET and the maintenance of epithelial markers like E-cadherin (Sengez2019The).

In addition to its role in epithelial differentiation, ELF3 is involved in regulating the type II TGFβ receptor gene in epithelial cells, influencing intestinal epithelial differentiation (Sengez2019The). ELF3's expression is context-dependent and can be induced in non-epithelial cells by proinflammatory cytokines, highlighting its versatile role in cellular processes (Sengez2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ELF3 gene are implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In bladder, cervical, ovarian, and several gastrointestinal cancers, ELF3 mutations, particularly inactivating ones, suggest a tumor suppressive role. In bladder cancer, these mutations occur in about 6% of tumors, with a higher frequency in luminal subtypes. Loss of ELF3 expression in ovarian cancer is linked to poorer outcomes, while re-expression inhibits tumor progression (Luk2018ELF3). In biliary tract cancers, ELF3 mutations are common and suggest a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor role (Luk2018ELF3; Suzuki2021E74Like).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ELF3 acts as an oncogene, with overexpression linked to poor patient outcomes. This overexpression is driven by gene amplification and promoter hypomethylation, affecting up to 80% of LUAD cases (Enfield2019Epithelial). ELF3 is also implicated in thyroid cancer, where increased expression is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in BRAF-mutant papillary thyroid carcinoma (Chen2018E26).

In ampullary carcinoma, ELF3 mutations increase cancer cell invasion and motility, promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Yachida2016Genomic). These findings highlight ELF3's dual role as both a tumor suppressor and oncogene, depending on the cancer type and context.
