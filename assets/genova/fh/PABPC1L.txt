# PABPC1L

## Overview
PABPC1L is a gene that encodes the poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 like, a member of the poly(A) binding protein family. This protein is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation by binding to the poly(A) tail of mRNA molecules. It plays a crucial role in post-transcriptional gene regulation, influencing processes such as mRNA stabilization, translation initiation, and mRNA decay. The protein's function is particularly significant in the context of cellular proliferation and differentiation, as evidenced by its involvement in various signaling pathways. Dysregulation of PABPC1L expression has been associated with oncogenic processes, particularly in colorectal cancer and colon adenocarcinoma, where it is implicated in promoting tumor growth and progression through pathways such as PI3K/AKT (Zhang2019A; Wu2019PABPC1L).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
PABPC1L has been implicated in various cancers, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC) and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). In CRC, PABPC1L is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis. Studies have shown that silencing PABPC1L in CRC cell lines reduces cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasive capabilities, suggesting its role as a potential oncogene. Mechanistically, PABPC1L influences CRC progression through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, as its depletion leads to decreased levels of phosphorylated AKT and PI3K, which are crucial for cell growth and migration (Wu2019PABPC1L).

In COAD, PABPC1L is frequently amplified and overexpressed in tumor samples. High expression levels are linked to aberrant mRNA splicing events, which may contribute to cancer progression. Knockdown of PABPC1L has been shown to reduce cell proliferation significantly, indicating its potential oncogenic role. Additionally, higher PABPC1L expression correlates with poor overall survival rates in COAD patients (Zhang2019A).

These findings suggest that PABPC1L dysregulation contributes to cancer progression and that targeting PABPC1L could have therapeutic potential in treating these cancers.
