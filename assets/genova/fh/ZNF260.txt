# ZNF260

## Overview
ZNF260 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 260, a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger protein 260 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, by binding to DNA and influencing the expression of specific genes. The precise biological functions and mechanisms of action of ZNF260 remain an active area of research, with studies suggesting its potential role in gene expression modulation and cellular differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
