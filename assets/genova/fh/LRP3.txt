# LRP3

## Overview
LRP3, or low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 3, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor protein belonging to the LDL receptor family. This protein is involved in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling, playing a crucial role in receptor-mediated endocytosis and cholesterol homeostasis. LRP3 is expressed in various human tissues, with notable expression in skeletal muscle and the ovary, and is implicated in the regulation of extracellular matrix metabolism, particularly in cartilage (Cao2022Cholesterolinduced). The protein's structural features include ligand-binding-type repeat domains and atypical CUB domains, which facilitate its interactions with various ligands and other proteins (CuchilloIbañez2021The; Pohlkamp2017Functional). LRP3's involvement in processes such as amyloid precursor protein processing and β-amyloid secretion links it to Alzheimer's disease pathology, while its interactions with syndecan-4 in osteoarthritis highlight its role in cartilage ECM degradation (CuchilloIbañez2021The; Cao2022Cholesterolinduced).

## Structure
The LRP3 protein is a member of the LDL receptor family and is characterized by several structural features. It contains ligand-binding-type repeat domains (LBDs) and atypical CUB domains in its extracellular region, which are involved in binding ligands such as Complement, Uegf, and Bmp1 (CuchilloIbañez2021The; Pohlkamp2017Functional). Unlike some other members of the LDL receptor family, LRP3 lacks EGF-like repeats and the NPxY motifs in its intracellular domain, which are typically involved in protein interaction and signal transduction. Instead, it contains a similar tyrosine-based sequence (EDFPVY) (CuchilloIbañez2021The).

The protein may form homo or heterodimers with other LRP receptors, although specific details on its quaternary structure are not provided (Rey2009Wnt). LRP3 is involved in endocytosis and signal transduction, and it plays a role in the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-amyloid secretion, which is relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathology (CuchilloIbañez2021The). Specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for LRP3 are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
LRP3 (LDL receptor-related protein 3) is a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, involved in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling. It is primarily active in the cell membrane and endosomes, where it plays a role in receptor-mediated endocytosis, a process by which cells internalize regulatory and nutritional molecules (Cao2022Cholesterolinduced). LRP3 is expressed in a wide range of human tissues, with the highest expression observed in skeletal muscle and ovary (Cao2022Cholesterolinduced).

In healthy human cells, LRP3 is suggested to mediate feedback control of cholesterol synthesis and endocytosis, potentially as a protective mechanism against excessive extracellular cholesterol (Cao2022Cholesterolinduced). This function is crucial for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism, particularly in cartilage, where LRP3 positively regulates chondrocyte ECM metabolism (Cao2022Cholesterolinduced). The protein's involvement in these processes suggests its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue health, particularly in contexts where cholesterol metabolism is critical.

While the specific molecular activities of LRP3 in healthy cells are not fully understood, its role in lipid metabolism and endocytosis indicates its potential impact on cardiovascular health and other physiological processes related to cholesterol regulation (Cao2022Cholesterolinduced).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
LRP3 (LDL receptor-related protein 3) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of osteoarthritis (OA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In OA, LRP3 interacts with syndecan-4 (SDC4), a protein associated with cartilage degeneration. The downregulation of LRP3 leads to the upregulation of SDC4 through the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. This interaction contributes to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation in cartilage, as SDC4 binds and activates ADAMTS-5, an enzyme involved in ECM breakdown (Cao2022Cholesterolinduced).

In the context of AD, LRP3 interacts with apolipoprotein E (apoE) and amyloid precursor protein (APP). LRP3 co-immunoprecipitates with apoE and APP, suggesting a role in APP processing and Aβ generation. Overexpression of LRP3 reduces levels of full-length APP and its fragments, indicating that LRP3 may influence APP degradation via lysosomal pathways (CuchilloIbañez2021The). These interactions highlight LRP3's involvement in key signaling pathways and its potential impact on disease pathogenesis.
