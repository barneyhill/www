# TEX26

## Overview
TEX26 is a gene that encodes the protein testis expressed 26, which is predominantly expressed in the testis. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions remain to be fully elucidated. TEX26 is categorized as a testis-specific protein, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis or other testis-related functions. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their roles in reproductive biology and potential implications in fertility disorders. Current studies are exploring the interactions and pathways involving TEX26 to uncover its biological significance and potential clinical applications (Qiu2020aarFDC).
