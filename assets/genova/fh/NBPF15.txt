# NBPF15

## Overview
The NBPF15 gene is a member of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family, located on the 1q21 region of the human genome, which is known for its genomic instability. This gene encodes the NBPF member 15 protein, characterized by the presence of Olduvai domains, previously referred to as DUF1220 domains. These domains are associated with brain size, cognitive function, and neural stem cell proliferation. The NBPF15 protein is notable for its structural properties, particularly its N-terminal region, which influences protein aggregation and phase transitions. These characteristics are significant for its role in brain development and cognitive processes. Alterations in the NBPF15 gene, such as microduplications, have been linked to developmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Wu2020The; Keeney2014DUF1220; Zhu2021Case).

## Structure
The NBPF15 protein is a member of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family, characterized by the presence of DUF1220 domains, which are associated with brain size and cognitive function. The protein is composed of 670 amino acids and includes six clades of Olduvai domains, which are significant in its structure and function (Wu2020The). The N-terminal region of NBPF15 is particularly notable for its mosaic of disordered and ordered segments, including a helical-rich region that forms a coiled-coil structure. This region is crucial for the protein's self-aggregation and phase transition behaviors, as it can form different types of aggregates when the protein concentration reaches a threshold (Wu2020The).

The N-terminal sequence from amino acids 9 to 59 strongly promotes self-aggregation, leading to high-order aggregates. Proteins with longer N-terminal truncations, such as NBPF15 120-263, are more homogeneous and less prone to aggregation, suggesting that the sequence from 9 to 119 mediates multiple types of aggregates (Wu2020The). The presence of cysteine residues, particularly cysteine 42, contributes to the formation of disulfide bonds, which play a role in the protein's aggregation properties (Wu2020The). The Olduvai domain-containing proteins are typically homogeneous extended monomers (Wu2020The).

## Function
The NBPF15 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in human neural stem cell proliferation and brain development. The protein contains DUF1220 domains, which are associated with increased proliferation in human neural stem cells. This was demonstrated in experiments where neural stem cells transfected with NBPF15 cDNA showed a greater rate of increase in cell coverage compared to control cells, indicating that NBPF15 promotes cell proliferation (Keeney2014DUF1220). The expression of DUF1220 domains, encoded by NBPF15, is localized to brain regions undergoing neural stem cell expansion, particularly in the ventricular and subventricular zones during the cortical neurogenic window of human fetal brain development. This suggests that NBPF15 is crucial for neural stem cell proliferation and brain development (Keeney2014DUF1220).

The NBPF15 protein also exhibits unique structural properties, particularly in its N-terminal region, which is involved in protein aggregation and phase transitions. This region can cause multiple types of aggregates and undergoes a liquid-to-solid phase transition, potentially influencing its biological role in the brain (Wu2020The). The protein's aggregation behavior is influenced by its N-terminal coiled-coil sequence, which may be relevant to its function in cognitive processes (Wu2020The).

## Clinical Significance
The NBPF15 gene, part of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family, is implicated in various clinical conditions due to its involvement in the 1q21 region of the human genome, which is known for its genomic instability. Alterations in this region, such as microduplications, have been associated with developmental disorders. A case report highlighted a newborn with microduplications involving NBPF15, presenting with developmental delay, craniofacial dysmorphism, congenital heart disease, and sensorineural hearing loss, suggesting a potential link between NBPF15 and these clinical features (Zhu2021Case).

The NBPF15 gene encodes the Olduvai domain, previously known as the DUF1220 domain, which is associated with cognitive functions. Variations in the copy number of these domains have been correlated with cognitive phenotypes, including autism and schizophrenia severity, as well as brain size and neural stem cell proliferation (Wu2020The). The N-terminal region of NBPF15 is noted for causing protein aggregation and phase transitions, which may be linked to cognitive dysfunction diseases, although specific conditions directly associated with NBPF15 mutations are not detailed (Wu2020The). The complex architecture of the 1q21 region, rich in DUF1220 domains, complicates the understanding of its role in neuropsychiatric diseases (O’Bleness2014Finished).
