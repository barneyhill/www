# WDCP

## Overview
The WDCP gene, also known as C2orf44, encodes the WD repeat and coiled coil containing protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction. This protein is characterized by the presence of WD repeats and a leucine-rich coiled coil domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and oligomerization, respectively. The WD repeats contribute to the formation of a beta-propeller structure, which is crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways. The protein's interaction with the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of the hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck) suggests its involvement in tyrosine kinase-regulated signaling pathways. Although the precise biological functions of WDCP are not fully understood, its interactions and post-translational modifications indicate a significant role in cellular regulation and potential implications in cancer pathogenesis (Andersson2017Insufficient; YOKOYAMA2014Molecular).

## Structure
The WDCP protein, encoded by the human C2orf44 gene, consists of 721 amino acids and features several distinct structural elements. The amino-terminal half of the protein contains two WD repeats, which are known to participate in various biological functions such as apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction (YOKOYAMA2014Molecular). These WD repeats are typically involved in protein-protein interactions and contribute to the formation of a beta-propeller structure.

The carboxy-terminal half of WDCP includes a proline-rich sequence (PPRLPQR) that resembles known ligands for Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, facilitating interactions with proteins like the Src family kinase hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck) (YOKOYAMA2014Molecular). This region also contains a leucine-rich coiled coil domain, which is predicted to be located at the C-terminus, suggesting a role in oligomerization and structural stability (YOKOYAMA2014Molecular).

Experimental evidence supports the oligomeric nature of WDCP, as gel filtration experiments indicate that it co-elutes with higher molecular weight standards than its predicted 79 kDa (YOKOYAMA2014Molecular). The protein is also subject to tyrosine phosphorylation when co-expressed with Hck, indicating potential post-translational modifications that may influence its function (YOKOYAMA2014Molecular).

## Function
The WDCP gene encodes a protein that plays a role in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction. The WDCP protein consists of 721 amino acids and features two WD repeats and a proline-rich sequence, which are crucial for its biological functions. These WD repeats are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, contributing to processes such as cell cycle regulation and signal transduction (YOKOYAMA2014Molecular).

The protein also contains a leucine-rich coiled coil region, which suggests a role in protein oligomerization. Experiments have demonstrated that WDCP can form oligomers in mammalian cells, indicating its potential involvement in cellular structural organization (YOKOYAMA2014Molecular). The proline-rich sequence of WDCP specifically binds to the SH3 domain of the Hck non-receptor tyrosine kinase, leading to its tyrosine phosphorylation. This interaction suggests that WDCP may participate in signaling pathways regulated by tyrosine kinases (YOKOYAMA2014Molecular).

While the exact function of WDCP in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its ability to bind kinases and interact with the Src homology domain indicates a potential role in cellular signaling and regulation (Andersson2017Insufficient).

## Clinical Significance
The WDCP gene, also known as C2orf44, has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis, although its exact role remains under investigation. In colorectal cancer, WDCP has been identified as part of a fusion protein with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), suggesting a potential involvement in tumorigenesis (Woo2024GenomeWide). This fusion may contribute to cancer development by altering normal cellular signaling pathways, although the precise mechanisms are not fully understood.

In liver cancer, frameshift deletion mutations in the WDCP gene have been detected, indicating a possible role in the disease. However, the clinical significance of these mutations is not clearly defined, and further research is needed to understand their impact on liver cancer progression and treatment outcomes (Sultana2019A).

Additionally, in melanoma, WDCP expression is negatively correlated with the expression of the HSD11B2 gene, which is associated with poorer survival outcomes. This suggests that alterations in WDCP expression may have prognostic implications in melanoma, although the specific clinical significance requires further exploration (Fu2020Analysis). Overall, while WDCP is associated with various cancers, its exact role and clinical implications remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
WDCP, encoded by the C2orf44 gene, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that suggest its role in cellular signaling pathways. It has been identified as a binding partner for the SH3 domain of the Hck non-receptor tyrosine kinase. This interaction is facilitated by a proline-rich sequence within WDCP, which is crucial for binding, as mutations in this sequence disrupt the interaction. The binding to Hck leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of WDCP, indicating that Hck may promote WDCP phosphorylation either directly or indirectly (YOKOYAMA2014Molecular).

WDCP also interacts with the full-length Hck kinase in mammalian cells, and this interaction is associated with the oligomerization of WDCP, as shown by gel filtration chromatography. This oligomerization may play a role in the oncogenic activity of the ALK-C2orf44 fusion protein in colorectal cancer, where WDCP imposes an oligomeric structure on ALK, resulting in constitutive kinase activation and signaling (YOKOYAMA2014Molecular).

In addition, WDCP was detected in immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis in conjunction with the estrogen receptor beta (ERb) when using the PPZ0506 antibody, suggesting a potential interaction, although this could also be an unspecific binding (Andersson2017Insufficient).
