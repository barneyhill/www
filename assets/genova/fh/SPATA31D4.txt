# SPATA31D4

## Overview
SPATA31D4 is a gene that encodes the protein SPATA31 subfamily D member 4, which is part of the SPATA31 gene family. This family is recognized for its role in DNA repair and the maintenance of genomic stability, processes that are vital for cellular health and longevity. The SPATA31D4 gene has been subject to positive selection in hominoids, highlighting its evolutionary importance and potential impact on human lifespan by preserving genomic integrity (Gao2023A). The protein encoded by SPATA31D4 is implicated in cellular responses to ultraviolet radiation, suggesting a protective function against DNA damage from environmental sources. While the specific activities of SPATA31 subfamily D member 4 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, its association with DNA repair mechanisms underscores its significance in safeguarding cellular function and preventing mutations (Gao2023A).

## Function
SPATA31D4 is a gene that belongs to the SPATA31 gene family, which is implicated in several critical cellular processes. This gene family is known for its involvement in DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability, which are essential for cellular health and longevity (Gao2023A). SPATA31D4, in particular, has been identified as having a strong signal of positive selection in hominoids, suggesting its evolutionary significance (Gao2023A). The gene is part of the core duplicon families, which have contributed significantly to hominoid evolution, potentially influencing human lifespan by maintaining genomic integrity (Gao2023A).

The SPATA31D4 gene is also associated with responses to ultraviolet radiation, indicating a role in protecting cells from DNA damage caused by environmental factors (Gao2023A). Although specific functions of SPATA31D4 in healthy human cells are not detailed, its involvement in DNA repair and genomic stability suggests it plays a crucial role in cellular processes that prevent mutations and maintain cellular function over time (Gao2023A). The gene's activity is likely concentrated in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression and chromatin remodeling, contributing to the regulation of the cell cycle and genomic integrity.
