# CD3D

## Overview
The CD3D gene encodes the CD3 delta (CD3δ) protein, a transmembrane component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex, which is pivotal for T-cell development and immune function. The CD3δ protein is integral to the assembly and surface expression of the TCR complex on T lymphocytes, facilitating signal transduction necessary for T-cell activation and differentiation. As part of the CD3 complex, which includes other subunits such as CD3γ, CD3ε, and CD3ζ, CD3δ plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and signaling capabilities of the TCR. Mutations in the CD3D gene can lead to severe immunodeficiencies, such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), due to impaired TCR expression and function (Basile2004Severe; Gil2011A).

## Structure


## Function
The CD3D gene encodes the CD3δ protein, a critical component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex, which is essential for T-cell development and function. In healthy human cells, CD3δ is part of the TCR complex on the surface of T lymphocytes, playing a vital role in T-cell activation and immune response. The TCR complex consists of variable chains (α and β or γ and δ) and several invariant chains, including CD3δ, CD3γ, CD3ε, and TCRζ (CD247), which support TCR expression and signal transduction necessary for T-cell differentiation and antigen recognition (Gil2011A).

CD3δ is crucial for the surface expression of the TCR complex, as it facilitates the incorporation of ζζ/CD247 dimers into the TCR complex. Its absence leads to retention of nascent TCRs in the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing their surface expression (Garcillán2021CD3G). The CD3δ protein is involved in the selection and signaling processes of αβ and γδ T cells, with a stronger binding affinity to the TCRαβ heterodimer compared to TCRγδ, which may explain differences in TCR surface levels between these T cell types (Gil2011A). CD3δ is active primarily in the plasma membrane of T cells, where it plays a key role in T-cell activation, differentiation, and immune response.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CD3D gene, which encodes the delta subunit of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex, are associated with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a condition characterized by defective T-cell development. Patients with CD3D mutations often exhibit a T-B+NK+ SCID phenotype, marked by the absence of mature T lymphocytes while B and NK cell maturation remains normal (Basile2004Severe). These mutations can lead to a premature stop codon, resulting in the truncation of the CD3δ protein and a complete lack of T cells, as observed in patients with homozygous mutations (Basile2004Severe).

A specific mutation involving a homozygous C-to-T transition at nucleotide position 202 in the CD3D gene has been identified, leading to a premature stop codon and truncation of the protein. This mutation results in reduced CD3δ mRNA levels due to nonsense-mediated decay, and the CD3δ protein becomes undetectable (Dadi2003Effect). The absence of CD3δ is crucial for T-cell development, as it prevents the synthesis of the CD3δ protein, leading to early arrest in T-cell development and a nearly complete absence of mature T cells (Dadi2003Effect).

Another mutation in the CD3D gene involves a splicing defect that causes an in-frame deletion of exon 2, affecting the extracellular Ig-like domain of the CD3δ protein. This mutation results in reduced CD3D transcripts and CD3δ protein levels, impairing TCR expression and signaling, and leading to severe immunodeficiency symptoms (Gil2011A).

## Interactions
The CD3D protein, a component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex, plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of the TCR by interacting with other CD3 subunits and TCR chains. CD3D forms part of the CD3 complex, which includes CD3ε, CD3γ, and CD3ζ subunits. These subunits are essential for the structural integrity and signaling capabilities of the TCR complex (Dave1997CD3delta; Brazin2014Constitutively).

CD3D interacts with the TCRα and TCRβ chains, forming non-covalent associations that are vital for the assembly and surface expression of the TCR complex on T cells. These interactions facilitate the transmission of signals from the TCR to intracellular signaling pathways, which are crucial for T-cell activation (Garcillán2021CD3G; Brazin2014Constitutively).

The CD3D protein also plays a role in the proper assembly and surface expression of the TCR complex by interacting with the CD3ζ chain. This interaction is critical for the efficient association of the CD3ζ chain with the rest of the TCR/CD3 complex, particularly affecting the development of αβ T cells (Garcillán2021CD3G; Dave1997CD3delta). 

Mutations in CD3D can disrupt these interactions, leading to impaired TCR expression and function, which can result in immunodeficiency (Gil2011A).
