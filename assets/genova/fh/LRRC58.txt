# LRRC58

## Overview
The LRRC58 gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat-containing 58 protein, which is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that LRRC58 may play a role in cellular signaling pathways or structural assemblies. While the precise biological functions of the LRRC58 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in various cellular processes is indicated by its expression patterns and interactions. The gene has been associated with several diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its potential significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (yazdani2019transcriptomic; Dmitriev2015Identification; Zhu2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The LRRC58 gene has been implicated in several diseases through its altered expression and potential role in cancer recurrence and progression. In colorectal cancer (CRC), LRRC58 is identified as one of the genes modified by N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications, which are associated with CRC recurrence. These modifications influence immune cell infiltration and overall survival, suggesting that LRRC58 could serve as a predictive biomarker or therapeutic target for CRC patients (Zhu2022Identification).

In prostate cancer, LRRC58 is located in the 3q13.33 region and has been identified as a novel epigenetic marker. Although its specific role in prostate cancer is not well understood, it is part of a set of markers that can diagnose prostate tumors with high accuracy. The study suggests that further investigation is needed to elucidate its function in prostate cancer (Dmitriev2015Identification).

Additionally, LRRC58 has been identified as a mediator gene in transcriptomic causal networks related to schizophrenia, indicating its involvement in gene regulation within the human brain. This suggests a potential role in neurological conditions, although its exact impact requires further research (yazdani2019transcriptomic).
