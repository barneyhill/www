# HSPA5

## Overview
HSPA5, also known as the 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) or BiP, is a gene that encodes a member of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family, specifically the heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5. This protein functions as a molecular chaperone predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a pivotal role in protein folding, assembly, and the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Wang2017HSPA5). BiP is essential for maintaining ER homeostasis by preventing the aggregation of misfolded proteins and facilitating their degradation through ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways (Wang2017HSPA5). Additionally, BiP is involved in calcium homeostasis and can influence cell signaling and viability under stress conditions (Wang2017HSPA5). The protein's interactions with various cellular and viral proteins underscore its significance in diverse biological processes, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and viral infections (Aran2018CD5L; Li2023New; François-Moutal2022Heat).

## Structure
The HSPA5 gene encodes the BiP protein, a member of the Hsp70 family, which is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a crucial role in protein folding and the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Wang2017HSPA5). Structurally, BiP consists of two main domains: the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) at the N-terminus and the substrate-binding domain (SBD) at the C-terminus. The NBD is responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis, while the SBD binds polypeptides (Wang2017HSPA5; DoresSilva2020Interaction). The SBD is further divided into two subdomains, SBDα and SBDβ, with SBDβ serving as a binding pocket for client proteins and SBDα acting as a helical lid (Wang2017HSPA5).

BiP undergoes post-translational modifications such as sulfenylation, glutathionylation, phosphorylation, ADP-ribosylation, and AMPylation, which regulate its activity and stability (Wang2017HSPA5). These modifications allow BiP to adapt to various stress conditions and maintain protein homeostasis (Wang2017HSPA5). BiP can also oligomerize via intermolecular disulfide bonds, particularly involving the N-terminal end, which may contribute to its quaternary structure (DoresSilva2020Interaction). The protein is highly conserved across eukaryotes and is expressed in various tissues, with its half-life varying significantly depending on genetic and environmental factors (Wang2017HSPA5).

## Function
The HSPA5 gene encodes the chaperone protein BiP, also known as GRP78, which is a crucial component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in healthy human cells. BiP plays a significant role in maintaining ER homeostasis by facilitating protein folding and assembly, preventing the aggregation of misfolded proteins, and ensuring quality control within the ER. It is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular stress response related to the ER, where it binds to ER stress sensors such as IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, modulating their activation during ER stress (Wang2017HSPA5; Ni2007ER).

BiP functions as both a foldase, actively folding substrates, and a holdase, preventing substrates from refolding or aggregating. Its activity is regulated by an allosteric ATPase cycle, which involves binding and hydrolysis of ATP and ADP, affecting its substrate binding affinity (Wang2017HSPA5). BiP also plays a role in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) by recognizing, solubilizing, and releasing misfolded or unfolded proteins for degradation (Wang2017HSPA5).

In addition to its role in protein folding, BiP is involved in calcium homeostasis within the ER, binding significant amounts of Ca2+ and regulating its leakage into the cytosol (Wang2017HSPA5). BiP's presence on the cell surface under stress conditions influences cell signaling and viability, interacting with proteins to activate pathways that promote cell proliferation (Wang2017HSPA5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HSPA5 gene, also known as GRP78 or BiP, have been implicated in various diseases. In bipolar disorder, specific polymorphisms in the HSPA5 gene have been associated with the condition, particularly in Japanese populations. These polymorphisms may affect the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, contributing to the genetic risk for bipolar disorder (Kakiuchi2005Functional).

HSPA5 is also linked to neurodegenerative disorders. In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), HSPA5 interacts with TDP-43, a protein associated with ALS pathology, and helps mitigate its toxicity. This suggests that HSPA5 could be a therapeutic target for TDP-43-associated diseases (François-Moutal2022Heat). In Alzheimer's disease, HSPA5 is involved in tau phosphorylation, contributing to neurodegeneration (Booth2015HSPA5/Dna).

In cancer, HSPA5 is highly expressed in tumor cells, supporting oncogenic signaling and tumor progression. Its expression is associated with resistance to therapy, making it a potential target for anticancer treatments (Booth2015HSPA5/Dna; Wang2017HSPA5). Additionally, polymorphisms in HSPA5 have been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer, particularly in non-smokers (Liu2022ER).

## Interactions
HSPA5, also known as BiP or GRP78, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It directly binds to TDP-43, a protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS. This interaction occurs specifically at the RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains of TDP-43, where HSPA5 helps mitigate TDP-43-induced toxicity by preventing its aggregation and misfolding (François-Moutal2022Heat).

HSPA5 also interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, acting as a coreceptor that facilitates viral entry into host cells. This interaction is significant in the context of COVID-19, as HSPA5 is upregulated during infection and is involved in the translocation of ACE2 to the cell surface, enhancing viral susceptibility (Li2023New).

In cancer biology, HSPA5 binds to CD5L in hepatocellular carcinoma, promoting cancer cell proliferation and antiapoptotic responses. This interaction is implicated in the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is crucial for tumorigenic processes (Aran2018CD5L).

Additionally, HSPA5 interacts with PARK7, particularly under oxidative stress conditions. This interaction involves the N-terminally arginylated form of HSPA5 and is part of a complex with SQSTM1, playing a role in autophagic processes (Lee2018PARK7).
