# SYT10

## Overview
The SYT10 gene encodes the protein synaptotagmin 10, a member of the synaptotagmin family, which is primarily involved in calcium-dependent exocytosis processes. Synaptotagmin 10 functions as a calcium sensor, playing a critical role in the release of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in neurons, particularly within the olfactory bulb. This protein is characterized by its two cytoplasmic calcium-binding C2 domains, which facilitate interactions with SNARE proteins, essential for its role in membrane fusion events (Wolfes2020The; Craxton2004Synaptotagmin). The SYT10 gene is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in various isoforms that may have distinct functional roles. Synaptotagmin 10 is implicated in neuroprotection and has been associated with several neurological and developmental conditions, including Parkinson's disease and epilepsy, as well as being proposed as a prognostic biomarker in esophageal cancer (Cao2011ActivityDependent; DaneshmandParsa2023Identification; Hirabayashi2019Copy; AleknonytėResch2023Genomewide).

## Structure
Synaptotagmin 10 (SYT10) is a member of the synaptotagmin family, characterized by its involvement in calcium-dependent membrane fusion events. The protein structure of SYT10 includes two cytoplasmic calcium-binding C2 domains, which are crucial for its role in membrane interactions (Wolfes2020The; Craxton2004Synaptotagmin). These C2 domains allow SYT10 to bind calcium ions and interact with SNARE proteins, facilitating its function in exocytosis (Wolfes2020The).

SYT10 is part of a group of synaptotagmins, including Syt3, Syt5, and Syt6, which share homologous N-terminal cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, contributing to its quaternary structure by enabling dimerization (Cao2011ActivityDependent). This dimerization can occur with other synaptotagmins, although the functional consequences of these interactions are not fully understood (Wolfes2020The).

Post-translational modifications of SYT10 may include phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions. Alternative splicing of the SYT10 gene can result in different isoforms, potentially leading to distinct functional roles within the cell (Craxton2004Synaptotagmin). These structural features underscore SYT10's specific role in calcium-dependent exocytosis processes.

## Function
Synaptotagmin 10 (SYT10) is a calcium-binding protein that plays a crucial role in the exocytosis of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in neurons, particularly within the olfactory bulb. SYT10 functions as a calcium sensor, triggering the release of IGF-1 from nonsynaptic vesicles in response to neuronal activity. This process is essential for the development and maintenance of neuronal structures, as IGF-1 supports neurogenesis, differentiation, and the formation of olfactory maps (Cao2011ActivityDependent).

In SYT10 knockout mice, the absence of SYT10 leads to impaired IGF-1 secretion, resulting in reduced neuronal size, decreased dendritic arborization, and impaired synaptic transmission. These deficits can be rescued by the addition of exogenous IGF-1, highlighting the protein's role in maintaining normal neuronal function (Cao2011ActivityDependent).

SYT10 is also implicated in neuroprotection. It acts as a downstream effector in the NPAS4-mediated signaling pathway, which is involved in protecting neurons from excitotoxic neurodegeneration. The expression of SYT10 is upregulated in response to increased NPAS4 levels, suggesting its involvement in the release of neuroprotective factors (Woitecki2016Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SYT10 gene have been implicated in several neurological and developmental conditions. In the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), SYT10 has been associated with modifying the age-at-onset phenotype, particularly in individuals carrying the LRRK2 mutation p.G2019S. This suggests that SYT10 may influence the phenotypic expression of PD rather than directly affecting disease risk (AleknonytėResch2023Genomewide). Additionally, variations near the SYT10 gene have been linked to mortality in PD patients, indicating a potential role in disease progression (Tan2022Genomewide).

In epilepsy, SYT10 has been identified as a novel candidate gene due to its upregulation in the hippocampus during status epilepticus in rat models. Although the pathogenicity of SYT10-related copy number variations remains uncertain, its function in neuronal exocytosis suggests a possible involvement in epileptic conditions (Hirabayashi2019Copy).

SYT10 has also been proposed as a prognostic biomarker in esophageal cancer (ESCA). Its down-regulation is associated with poor survival outcomes, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (DaneshmandParsa2023Identification). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of SYT10 across different diseases.

## Interactions
Synaptotagmin 10 (SYT10) is involved in calcium-dependent exocytosis processes in neurons. It acts as a Ca2+ sensor, particularly in the exocytosis of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in olfactory bulb neurons. SYT10 colocalizes with IGF-1 in somatic and dendritic vesicles, and its function is crucial for the activity-dependent secretion of IGF-1. This process is distinct from the synaptic vesicle exocytosis controlled by synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1), indicating that SYT10 operates through a separate pathway (Cao2011ActivityDependent).

SYT10 is part of a group of synaptotagmins, including Syt3, Syt5, and Syt6, which share similar Ca2+-dependent phospholipid and SNARE-binding properties. These proteins are characterized by N-terminal disulfide bonds that facilitate dimerization, suggesting a role in forming multiprotein complexes involved in exocytosis (Cao2011ActivityDependent). The interaction of SYT10 with these proteins highlights its role as a Ca2+ sensor for a distinct class of vesicles, separate from those involved in neurotransmitter release (Cao2011ActivityDependent).
