# FSHR

## Overview
The FSHR gene encodes the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, a critical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in human reproductive processes. This receptor is primarily expressed in the gonads, where it mediates the biological effects of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In females, FSHR is located on the surface of granulosa cells in the ovaries, facilitating follicular growth and oocyte maturation. In males, it is found on Sertoli cells in the testes, supporting spermatogenesis. The receptor's structure includes a large extracellular domain for hormone binding and a seven-transmembrane domain typical of GPCRs, which is essential for signal transduction. FSHR activation triggers intracellular signaling pathways, such as the cAMP/PKA pathway, influencing gene expression and cellular responses crucial for fertility. Mutations and polymorphisms in the FSHR gene can lead to various reproductive disorders, highlighting its significance in reproductive health (De2018FollicleStimulating; Achrekar2010Follicle; UlloaAguirre2018StructureFunction).

## Structure
The follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of FSHR consists of 695 amino acids, which are reduced to 678 in the mature form after signal sequence cleavage (UlloaAguirre2018StructureFunction). The receptor features a large extracellular domain (ECD) that is crucial for binding the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This domain contains leucine-rich repeats forming a horseshoe-shaped tertiary structure, essential for ligand selectivity and protein interactions (UlloaAguirre2018StructureFunction).

The secondary structure includes a seven-transmembrane domain (7TMD) typical of GPCRs, which is involved in receptor activation and intracellular signaling (UlloaAguirre2018StructureFunction). The ECD is linked to a hinge region that plays a significant role in receptor activation, acting as a tethered inverse agonist (UlloaAguirre2018StructureFunction).

FSHR undergoes N-linked glycosylation, which is crucial for proper folding, maturation, and trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. This modification results in molecular weights of approximately 80 to 87 kDa (UlloaAguirre2018StructureFunction). The receptor also has splice variant isoforms that do not transduce signals via the canonical Gs protein pathway but likely through Gi2, affecting pathways like MEK/Erk, NF-kB, and Akt (UlloaAguirre2018StructureFunction).

## Function
The follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in human reproduction by mediating the effects of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the gonads. In females, FSHR is expressed in the granulosa cells of the ovaries, where it is essential for the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles. The binding of FSH to FSHR activates intracellular signaling pathways, including the cAMP/PKA pathway, which leads to the expression of genes involved in follicular development and oocyte maturation (De2018FollicleStimulating; Recchia2021Actions). In males, FSHR is expressed in Sertoli cells within the testes, where it supports spermatogenesis by promoting Sertoli cell proliferation and function (De2018FollicleStimulating; Recchia2021Actions).

FSHR activation involves a two-step process where FSH binds to the hormone-binding domain, causing conformational changes that stabilize the receptor's active state. This activation triggers downstream signaling cascades, such as the activation of adenylate cyclase and increased cAMP levels, which subsequently activate protein kinase A (PKA) and other effectors (De2018FollicleStimulating). These molecular processes are critical for regulating gene expression and cellular responses, ultimately influencing fertility and reproductive health (De2018FollicleStimulating).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FSHR gene are linked to several reproductive conditions. In females, inactivating mutations can lead to primary and secondary amenorrhea, characterized by the absence of menstruation, often due to hypergonadotropic ovarian failure (Simoni1997The; Achrekar2010Follicle). Specific mutations, such as Ala189Val, are associated with pure ovarian dysgenesis, resulting in high gonadotropin levels and streaky gonads (Dierich1998Impairing). Premature ovarian failure (POF) is also linked to inactivating mutations like p.Ala189Val and p.Ile418Ser, which impair FSHR function and follicular development (Yang2023Current).

Polymorphisms in the FSHR gene, such as p.680Asn/Ser, can influence the severity of ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) and affect responses to infertility treatments like IVF and ICSI (Tafazoli2021Pharmacogenomic). The AA genotype at the -29 position is associated with increased serum FSH levels and is more prevalent in women with amenorrhea (Achrekar2010Follicle).

In males, FSHR mutations are not a major cause of infertility, but can lead to varying degrees of spermatogenic failure, as seen in male siblings of affected females (Simoni1997The). Overall, FSHR mutations and polymorphisms significantly impact reproductive health and treatment outcomes.

## Interactions
The follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that engages in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in reproductive signaling pathways. FSHR can form homomers and heterodimers, notably with the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHCGR), which modulates intracellular signaling by amplifying Gαq-mediated signaling and inhibiting FSHR-dependent cAMP production (Casarini2019Molecular; Szymańska2018FSHR). 

FSHR interacts with several adapter proteins, including APPL1 and APPL2, which are involved in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. APPL1 is linked to the activation of the PI3K/AKT anti-apoptotic pathway and calcium ion mobilization, while APPL2 is constitutively associated with FSHR (Casarini2019Molecular; Nechamen2007APPL1). The 14-3-3τ protein also interacts with FSHR, influencing its signaling by reducing cAMP levels and potentially affecting receptor conformation and function (Dias2010Emerging; Cohen2004Human).

FSHR's interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors, such as the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), further modulates signaling pathways, including ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT, and JAK/STAT, contributing to granulosa cell differentiation and steroidogenesis (Casarini2019Molecular). These interactions highlight FSHR's role in complex signaling networks essential for reproductive function.
