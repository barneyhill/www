# C2orf50

## Overview
C2orf50 is a gene located on chromosome 2 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 2 open reading frame 50. This protein is characterized by the presence of a SNYG module, a motif commonly found in microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) that are integral to ciliary function. The SNYG module suggests a role in binding to tubulin heterodimers, which are crucial for the structural integrity and function of microtubules (Andersen2024Uncovering). C2orf50 is notably enriched in motile cilia of human bronchial epithelial cells and ciliated fallopian tube epithelial cells, indicating its significant role in cilia biology (Lindskog2024A). While the precise molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, the gene's association with ciliary structures suggests its involvement in cellular processes such as signaling and motility, which are vital for the proper functioning of ciliated tissues (Andersen2024Uncovering).

## Function
C2orf50 is a gene located on chromosome 2 that encodes a protein associated with ciliary function. The protein contains a SNYG module, a motif found in certain microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) that are involved in cilia function. This module is characterized by a conserved sequence that suggests a role in binding to tubulin heterodimers, which are essential components of microtubules (Andersen2024Uncovering). 

C2orf50 has been identified as being enriched along the length of motile cilia in human bronchial epithelial cells, indicating its involvement in cilia biology. This was confirmed through localization studies using Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) and CRISPR-Cas9 knockout experiments (Andersen2024Uncovering). The presence of C2orf50 in the cilia structure of ciliated fallopian tube epithelial cells further supports its role in ciliary functions (Lindskog2024A).

While the exact molecular processes and organismal outcomes of C2orf50's function in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its association with cilia suggests it may play a role in cellular processes such as signaling and motility, which are critical for the proper functioning of ciliated tissues (Andersen2024Uncovering).

## Clinical Significance
C2orf50 has been implicated in several clinical conditions. It is associated with developmental delay, as identified through clinical correlations using the NCBI Clinical variations database, ClinVar (Narayanan2015Atlas). In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), C2orf50 is one of the top 25 differentially methylated genes. A specific CpG site, cg09167828, on chromosome 2 associated with C2orf50, shows significant methylation changes between ASD cases and controls, suggesting a potential role in autism detection (BahadoSingh2019Artificial).

C2orf50 is also linked to ciliary functions. It contains the SNYG module, a motif associated with cilia biology, and is enriched along the length of motile cilia in human bronchial epithelial cells. This suggests its involvement in ciliary functions, which may have implications for understanding cilia-related disorders (Andersen2024Uncovering). The presence of the SNYG module in C2orf50 and its co-regulation with ciliary genes across tissues further supports its potential role in cilia-related functions and disorders (Andersen2024Uncovering). These findings highlight the gene's potential involvement in various diseases, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its clinical significance.
