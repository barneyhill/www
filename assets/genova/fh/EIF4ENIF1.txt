# EIF4ENIF1

## Overview
EIF4ENIF1 is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E nuclear import factor 1, a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein involved in the regulation of mRNA translation. This protein, also known as 4E-T, plays a pivotal role in translational repression by interacting with eIF4E, a key factor in the initiation of protein synthesis. EIF4ENIF1 is characterized by its eIF4E-binding domain, which allows it to mediate the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of eIF4E and regulate mRNA stability and translation. The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular growth and proliferation. It is also involved in mRNA transport and stability, impacting gene expression across various species and cellular contexts (Zhao2019A; Anisimova2023Human; Kamenska2014eIF4Ebinding).

## Structure
EIF4ENIF1, also known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E nuclear import factor 1, is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein involved in the regulation of mRNA translation. The protein contains specific domains, including the eIF4E-binding domain, which facilitates its interaction with eIF4E, a key player in the initiation of translation. This interaction is crucial for the protein's role in mediating translational repression by interfering with the binding of eIF4E to eIF4G, thereby controlling the access of ribosomes to the 5′ cap of specific mRNAs (Zhao2019A).

The secondary structure of EIF4ENIF1 includes α-helices, with the Q842 residue being critical for α-helix formation. A mutation at this site, specifically the c.2525A > C:p.Q842P variant, has been shown to potentially disrupt the α-helical structure, affecting the protein's stability and function (Zhao2019A). This mutation is associated with diminished ovarian reserve and premature ovarian insufficiency, highlighting the importance of the structural integrity of EIF4ENIF1 in its biological role.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may influence the function and interactions of EIF4ENIF1, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. The protein does not function as a dimer, indicating that it likely operates through a haploinsufficiency mechanism (Zhao2019A).

## Function
EIF4ENIF1, also known as 4E-T, is a multifunctional eIF4E-binding protein involved in the regulation of mRNA translation. It plays a crucial role in translational repression by mediating the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of eIF4E, a key factor in the initiation of protein synthesis (Anisimova2023Human). 4E-T binds not only to the canonical eIF4E protein but also to its orthologs, including eIF4E1B, and is highly expressed in the testis, suggesting a significant role in this tissue (Anisimova2023Human).

In healthy human cells, EIF4ENIF1 inhibits protein translation by binding to eIF4E, which can lead to increased protein translation and mRNA stability when its levels decrease (Zhao2019A). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting cellular growth and proliferation. It is also involved in mRNA transport and stability, influencing gene expression (Kamenska2014eIF4Ebinding).

In Xenopus oocytes, 4E-T is involved in an eIF4E-independent mechanism of translational repression, which is cap-independent, suggesting a unique mechanism of repression that does not rely on the cap structure of mRNA (Waghray2015Xenopus). This highlights its diverse roles in regulating translation across different species and cellular contexts.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EIF4ENIF1 gene have been linked to diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). A specific mutation, c.2525A > C:p.Q842P, was identified in a study involving a proband with DOR and her mother with POI, suggesting a genetic link. This mutation affects a highly conserved region of the protein, potentially disrupting its secondary structure and function, leading to ovarian dysfunction (Zhao2019A).

In a mouse model, a stop-gain mutation in the Eif4enif1 gene replicated the POI phenotype observed in humans. Heterozygous mice exhibited decreased follicle numbers and fertility, similar to the human condition. The mutation affected oocyte and follicle development, leading to early follicle loss and suggesting a critical role for Eif4enif1 in embryogenesis and oocyte development (Moriwaki2024HeterozygousEif4nif1Stop).

Alterations in EIF4ENIF1 expression have also been implicated in cancer. In gliomas, decreased expression of EIF4ENIF1 may affect mRNA recycling and eIF4E subcellular localization, potentially contributing to tumor biology (Marina2019Relevance). Additionally, alternative splicing events influenced by mutations in related genes can lead to changes in EIF4ENIF1, affecting cancer progression and patient prognosis (Li2017Revealing).

## Interactions
EIF4ENIF1, also known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E nuclear import factor 1, is involved in several key interactions that regulate mRNA translation and stability. It interacts with eIF4E, a critical factor in translation initiation, by binding at the same site used by eIF4G, thereby inhibiting eIF4E's role in the translation initiation complex (Zhao2019A; Moriwaki2024HeterozygousEif4nif1Stop). This interaction is crucial for controlling the access of ribosomes to the 5′ cap of specific mRNAs, mediating translational repression (Zhao2019A).

EIF4ENIF1 also interacts with DDX6, a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, which is involved in mRNA stability and gene silencing (Moriwaki2024HeterozygousEif4nif1Stop). This interaction suggests a role in mRNA regulation during early embryogenesis. In nonmammalian species, EIF4ENIF1 homologues are involved in targeting bound mRNA to specific sites in oocytes, indicating a potential role in mRNA localization and storage (Moriwaki2024HeterozygousEif4nif1Stop).

Additionally, EIF4ENIF1 is known to interact with eIF4E1b, a non-canonical eIF4E, promoting its localization to P-bodies, which are involved in mRNA regulation (LorenzoOrts2023eIF4E1b). This interaction is significant for stabilizing deadenylated mRNAs and is linked to infertility in women, highlighting its role in maternal mRNA dormancy (LorenzoOrts2023eIF4E1b).
