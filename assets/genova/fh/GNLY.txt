# GNLY

## Overview
The GNLY gene encodes granulysin, a member of the saposin-like protein (SAPLIP) family, which plays a crucial role in the immune system. Granulysin is a cationic, cytolytic protein predominantly expressed in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. It exists in two forms: a 15-kDa precursor and a 9-kDa mature form, with the latter being the active version involved in immune responses. Granulysin is characterized by its helical structure, which facilitates its interaction with phospholipid bilayers, leading to the lysis of tumor cells and microbial pathogens. It functions as an immune alarmin, enhancing immune responses by recruiting and activating antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and promoting dendritic cell maturation. Granulysin's ability to disrupt microbial membranes and induce apoptosis in infected or malignant cells underscores its importance in both innate and adaptive immunity (Ernst2000Granulysin; Peña1997Granulysin; Tewary2010Granulysin).

## Structure
Granulysin (GNLY) is a member of the saposin-like protein (SAPLIP) family and is characterized by a helical structure. It is composed of a four α-helical bundle, with hydrophobic residues on one surface and hydrophilic residues on the opposite surface, a common structure among proteins interacting with phospholipid bilayers (Ernst2000Granulysin). The protein is highly basic, containing 74 residues, with a significant proportion being arginine and lysine, contributing to its positive charge (Ernst2000Granulysin).

The tertiary structure of granulysin is modeled on the backbone of NK-lysin, revealing a five-helix bundle arrangement (Clayberger2003Granulysin; Bruhn1999Comparative). This structure is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and is characterized by a net positive charge, with cationic residues distributed across the molecule (Bruhn1999Comparative). Granulysin's structure includes small surface cavities and a large one between helices 1 and 5 (Bruhn1999Comparative).

Granulysin is expressed in two forms, 15 kDa and 9 kDa, with the latter being derived from post-translational processing of the former (Hanson1999Biosynthesis). The 9 kDa form corresponds to the SAPLIP domain, which is involved in lipid binding and cytolytic activity (Hanson1999Biosynthesis). The protein's activity is influenced by its three-dimensional structure, with electrostatic interactions playing a significant role (Ernst2000Granulysin).

## Function
Granulysin (GNLY) is a protein expressed in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, playing a significant role in the immune defense system. It exists in two forms: a 15-kDa precursor and a 9-kDa mature form. The 9-kDa form is the active version, stored in cytolytic granules and released during immune responses to target cells (Peña1997Granulysin; Ogawa2003Granulysin). Granulysin is involved in the lysis of tumor cells and microbial pathogens by disrupting their membranes, leading to cell death (Ernst2000Granulysin; Stenger1998An).

In healthy human cells, granulysin functions as an immune alarmin, recruiting and activating antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to enhance immune responses. It promotes the maturation of dendritic cells, which are crucial for initiating adaptive immunity (Tewary2010Granulysin). Granulysin's antimicrobial activity is attributed to its ability to increase the permeability of microbial membranes, causing osmotic lysis (Ernst2000Granulysin). It is also involved in the apoptosis of infected or malignant cells by disrupting mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Tewary2010Granulysin). Granulysin's role in immune defense highlights its importance in both innate and adaptive immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GNLY gene, which encodes granulysin, have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In the context of leprosy, increased expression of granulysin is observed in tuberculoid leprosy lesions, correlating with a more effective cell-mediated immune response. Conversely, lower expression levels are noted in lepromatous leprosy, which is associated with a less effective immune response (Ochoa2001Tcell; Tewary2010Granulysin).

In cancer, granulysin expression levels have been linked to patient outcomes. High expression is associated with better prognoses in colorectal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, neuroblastoma, and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Low expression correlates with worse cancer progression, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (MartinezLostao2015Death). Granulysin's ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells through mechanisms involving mitochondrial pathways and lysosomal permeabilization further underscores its role in tumor immunosurveillance (MartinezLostao2015Death).

Granulysin is also implicated in autoimmune conditions and transplant rejection, where elevated expression levels are observed. In contrast, low levels are associated with severe immunodeficiencies and carcinoma, where they inversely correlate with tumor progression (Tewary2010Granulysin). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GNLY expression in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
Granulysin (GNLY) is known for its interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of immune responses. It is stored in cytolytic granules alongside perforin and granzymes in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Granulysin requires perforin to facilitate its entry into target cells, where it can exert its cytolytic effects. This interaction is crucial for granulysin-mediated apoptosis, as perforin forms pores in the target cell membrane, allowing granulysin to enter and induce cell death (Veljkovic2013Granulysin; Saini2011Granulysin).

Granulysin also interacts with bacterial membranes, where it aggregates to form a dense carpet that increases membrane permeability, leading to cell lysis. This interaction is facilitated by the crystalline arrangement of granulysin molecules, which are held together by salt bridges and other interactions, such as ion pairs between specific amino acids (Anderson2003Granulysin).

In the maternal-fetal interface, granulysin is expressed in decidual lymphocytes, where it often co-localizes with perforin in cytolytic granules. However, in decidual lymphocytes, granulysin and perforin rarely co-localize, suggesting a differential intracellular distribution and interaction under different conditions (Veljkovic2013Granulysin).
