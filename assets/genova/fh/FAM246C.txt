# FAM246C

## Overview
FAM246C is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 246, member C. This gene is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by FAM246C is categorized as a pseudogene, indicating that it may not produce a functional protein product under normal circumstances. However, pseudogenes can play roles in gene regulation and expression, potentially influencing the activity of other genes. The study of FAM246C and its encoded pseudogene is ongoing, with research focusing on its potential implications in cellular pathways and disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
