# C1QL1

## Overview
C1QL1 is a gene that encodes the protein complement C1q like 1, a member of the C1q/TNF superfamily. This protein is secreted and plays a pivotal role in synaptic organization and function, particularly within the central nervous system. C1QL1 is characterized by its unique structure, which includes a globular C1q domain and collagen-like repeats, facilitating its assembly into trimers and higher-order oligomers. Functionally, the protein is crucial for the development and maintenance of synapses, especially in the cerebellum, where it interacts with the receptor Bai3 on Purkinje cells to regulate synaptic pruning and plasticity. This interaction is essential for motor learning and coordination, as it ensures the proper formation of climbing fiber-Purkinje cell synapses (Yuzaki2017The; Kakegawa2015Anterograde). Additionally, alterations in C1QL1 expression have been linked to various clinical conditions, including auditory impairments and potential roles in tumorigenesis (Qi2021Deletion; Moghimyfiroozabad2023Mapping).

## Structure
The C1QL1 protein is a member of the C1q/TNF superfamily and is characterized by a distinct molecular structure. It is secreted and not membrane-bound, featuring an N-terminal signal peptide, a short conserved sequence with two cysteine residues crucial for oligomerization, a spacer region, 17 G-X-Y collagen-like repeats, and a C-terminal globular C1q domain (Ressl2015Structures; Bolliger2011The). The globular C1q domain, approximately 140 residues in length, forms a 10-strand jelly-roll fold consisting of two antiparallel beta strands, which is a hallmark of the superfamily (Ressl2015Structures; Ghai2007C1q).

The protein assembles into trimers, a common quaternary structure within the C1q family, and features conserved Ca2+ binding sites along the trimeric symmetry axis, which are important for stability and protein interactions (Ressl2015Structures). The electrostatic potential surface of C1QL1 is largely negatively charged, which may facilitate specific protein interactions (Ressl2015Structures). The presence of conserved cysteine residues and collagen-like regions supports the formation of higher-order oligomers, which are essential for the protein's function (Ressl2015Structures).

## Function
The C1QL1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the C1q family, which plays a crucial role in synaptic organization and function within the central nervous system. C1QL1 is involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses, particularly in the cerebellum, where it is essential for the proper development and function of climbing fiber-Purkinje cell (CF-PC) synapses. This protein is expressed in climbing fibers, which are axons of inferior olivary neurons, and it binds to the receptor Bai3 on Purkinje cells. This interaction is critical for determining and maintaining a 'single-winner' CF, which becomes the dominant input to a Purkinje cell, a process that involves the pruning of surplus CFs (Kakegawa2015Anterograde).

C1QL1 also plays a role in synapse homeostasis and motor learning. It strengthens existing CF synapses and eliminates weaker ones, contributing to synaptic plasticity and the maintenance of neuronal networks in the cerebellum (Yuzaki2017The; Ressl2015Structures). The protein's interaction with Bai3 is necessary for synaptic pruning and the maintenance of synaptic connections, which are crucial for motor learning and coordination (Kakegawa2015Anterograde; Aimi2023C1ql1Bai3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the C1QL1 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. C1QL1 is implicated in hearing loss, as its deletion in mice leads to significant auditory impairments. This includes elevated auditory brainstem response thresholds and abnormal auditory nerve fiber function, indicating its crucial role in maintaining normal auditory function (Qi2021Deletion). Additionally, C1QL1 is upregulated in several malignancies, including colorectal cancer, differentiated thyroid carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and glioblastoma, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Moghimyfiroozabad2023Mapping).

In the cerebellum, C1QL1 is involved in synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Disruption of C1QL1-Bai3 signaling affects the development and maintenance of climbing fiber synapses on Purkinje cells, which is essential for motor learning and synaptic plasticity. Mice lacking C1QL1 or its receptor Bai3 exhibit impaired motor learning, highlighting the gene's importance in cerebellar function (Kakegawa2015Anterograde). Although not directly linked to specific diseases, these findings underscore the significance of C1QL1 in maintaining synaptic integrity and function across different systems.

## Interactions
C1QL1, a member of the C1q family of proteins, plays a significant role in synaptic organization, particularly in the cerebellum. It is crucial for the formation and maintenance of climbing fiber-Purkinje cell (CF-PC) synapses. C1QL1 interacts specifically with the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor Bai3 (also known as ADGRB3) through its CUB domain. This interaction is essential for its function, as C1QL1 does not bind to other family members such as Bai1 or Bai2. In C1ql1-null mice, the absence of this interaction leads to a significant reduction in CF-PC synapses, a phenotype that can be rescued by reintroducing C1QL1 in the inferior olivary nucleus (Yuzaki2017The).

The interaction between C1QL1 and Bai3 is critical for synaptic development, as evidenced by similar phenotypes observed in PC-specific Bai3-null mice. Reintroduction of Bai3, but not a mutant lacking the CUB domain, rescues the synaptic deficits, indicating that Bai3 serves as a postsynaptic receptor for C1QL1 in vivo (Yuzaki2017The). This interaction may activate intracellular signaling pathways involving ELMO1, although this has not been confirmed (Yuzaki2017The).
