# EFR3B

## Overview
EFR3B is a gene that encodes the protein EFR3 homolog B, which is a critical component in the regulation of phosphoinositide signaling at the plasma membrane. This protein is part of a complex that includes phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, playing a pivotal role in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, a lipid essential for membrane trafficking and signal transduction. EFR3 homolog B functions as a membrane scaffolding protein, influencing various cellular processes by maintaining phosphoinositide levels, which are crucial for cellular communication and homeostasis. Its involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cell biology, particularly in the regulation of membrane dynamics and intracellular signaling networks (Liebeskind2020Mapping; Adhikari2021Oncogenic).

## Function
EFR3B encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of phosphoinositide signaling, particularly at the plasma membrane. It is a component of a complex that includes phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, which is crucial for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. This lipid molecule is essential for various cellular functions, including membrane trafficking and signal transduction. The activity of EFR3B at the plasma membrane is vital for maintaining cellular communication and homeostasis. By influencing the production of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, EFR3B indirectly affects numerous downstream signaling pathways that are critical for normal cellular operations. The protein's function in these processes underscores its importance in the broader context of cell biology, where it contributes to the regulation of membrane dynamics and intracellular signaling networks.

## Clinical Significance
The EFR3B gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), overexpression of EFR3B is associated with better survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Mishra2019Survival). In Alzheimer's disease, EFR3B interacts with ARHGAP15, affecting white matter integrity, which is crucial for cognitive function. This interaction suggests that EFR3B may play a role in maintaining white matter health in Alzheimer's patients (Wang2021Genomewide).

EFR3B is also involved in oncogenic KRAS signaling in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The loss of EFR3B, along with EFR3A, has been shown to inhibit oncogenic signaling pathways, reducing tumorigenic growth. This indicates that EFR3B could be a target for therapeutic intervention in KRAS-driven cancers (Adhikari2021Oncogenic). Although the primary focus of some studies is on EFR3A, EFR3B is part of the EFR3-TTC7-FAM126-PI4KA complex, which is crucial for KRAS localization and function (Adhikari2021Oncogenic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of EFR3B in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
EFR3B is a protein involved in phosphoinositide signaling, playing a crucial role in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) at the plasma membrane. It forms part of a complex with other proteins, including TTC7A, FAM126A, and PI4KA, which is essential for maintaining PI(4)P levels. This complex is significant for the spatial-temporal regulation of KRAS, affecting its localization and nanoclustering at the plasma membrane (Adhikari2021Oncogenic).

In the mouse brain, EFR3B is identified as a membrane scaffolding protein involved in the synthesis of PIP2, a lipid that regulates AMPA receptor activity and trafficking. It is part of a postsynaptic complex that includes AMPA receptor subunits, the voltage-gated sodium channel Na v 1.2, and N-cadherin. These proteins interact physically or functionally, with N-cadherin and AMPA receptors interacting at the cell surface, and AMPA receptors and Na v channels both involved in postsynaptic depolarization (Liebeskind2020Mapping).

While specific interactions of EFR3B with nucleic acids are not detailed, its role in protein-protein interactions within the PI4KA complex and its involvement in synaptic transmission highlight its importance in cellular signaling and function (Liebeskind2020Mapping; Adhikari2021Oncogenic).
