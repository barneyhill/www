# SMPD4

## Overview
SMPD4 is a gene that encodes the enzyme sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 4, which is integral to sphingolipid metabolism. This enzyme, categorized as a transmembrane protein, is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope, where it plays a pivotal role in hydrolyzing sphingomyelin into ceramide and phosphorylcholine. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular membrane integrity and regulating intracellular signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Ji2022Case; Magini2019Loss). The enzyme's activity is particularly significant in the brain during embryonic and fetal development, underscoring its importance in neurodevelopment (Magini2019Loss). Mutations in SMPD4 are linked to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, highlighting the gene's clinical significance in human health (Ji2022Case; Magini2019Loss).

## Structure
The SMPD4 gene encodes sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 4, an enzyme involved in sphingolipid metabolism. SMPD4, also known as NSM-3, is a C-tailed anchor protein with an ER-localization motif at the C-terminus and a transmembrane domain near the C-terminus containing 23 amino acids (Xiang2021Physiological). The protein consists of 866 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 97.8 kDa. It lacks an N-terminal signal peptide and features a proline-rich region, which may facilitate protein-protein interactions (Xiang2021Physiological).

The tertiary structure of SMPD4 was modeled using the AlphaFold Protein Structure database, which provides insights into its 3D conformation (Ji2022Case). The protein's structure includes specific domains, such as the catalytic domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The study of SMPD4 mutations using ChimeraX1.3 highlights the importance of understanding its structural features in relation to its function and associated neurodevelopmental disorders (Ji2022Case).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, may influence the function and localization of SMPD4, although specific modifications have not been detailed in the available context. The presence of splice variant isoforms with different functional properties is also a possibility, but specific isoforms have not been described.

## Function
SMPD4 encodes the enzyme sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 4, which plays a crucial role in sphingolipid metabolism by hydrolyzing sphingomyelin into ceramide and phosphorylcholine. This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining cellular membrane integrity and regulating intracellular signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Ji2022Case; Magini2019Loss). SMPD4 is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the nuclear envelope, where it interacts with nuclear pore complexes, suggesting a role in the cross-talk between the ER and nuclear envelope, linking membrane sphingolipid homeostasis to cell fate decisions (Magini2019Loss).

In healthy human cells, SMPD4 is involved in the post-translational processing of proteins, including N-linked glycosylation, and is implicated in maintaining proper cell cycle progression and preventing apoptosis under stress conditions (Magini2019Loss). The enzyme's activity is particularly high in the brain during embryonic and fetal development, indicating its critical role in brain development and function (Magini2019Loss). SMPD4's function in producing ceramide is also vital for the formation of primary cilia, which are important for cellular signaling and development (Inskeep2023SMPD4mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SMPD4 gene are associated with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder known as Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Microcephaly, Arthrogryposis, and Structural Brain Anomalies (NEDMABA). This condition is characterized by microcephaly, congenital arthrogryposis, and various structural brain anomalies, including a simplified gyral pattern, hypomyelination, and cerebellar hypoplasia (Ji2022Case; Magini2019Loss). Affected individuals often present with intrauterine growth restriction, neonatal respiratory distress, and a high mortality rate in infancy due to central hypoventilation and respiratory infections (Magini2019Loss). Survivors typically experience severe developmental delays and limited motor and cognitive skills (Magini2019Loss).

The disorder is caused by bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in SMPD4, which lead to disruptions in sphingomyelin metabolism, affecting cell membrane integrity and signaling pathways crucial for brain development (Ji2022Case; Magini2019Loss). The prevalence of NEDMABA is estimated to be about one in 1,580,000, based on the gene carrier rate (Ji2022Case). The condition exhibits phenotypic variability, with some cases showing milder symptoms due to missense mutations, while others with truncating variants experience more severe manifestations (Marchiori2022MetaAnalysis).

## Interactions
SMPD4, also known as sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 4, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. SMPD4 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the nuclear envelope, with a significant portion near nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). It interacts with several proteins associated with these structures, including those involved in post-translational processing, molecular transport, and RNA trafficking (Magini2019Loss). Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry have identified 254 interacting peptides, highlighting its role in membrane structures such as the ER, proteasome, and NPC (Magini2019Loss).

SMPD4 also interacts with nuclear pore proteins, which suggests a role in the regulation of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport and possibly in the pathogenesis of related disorders (Ravenscroft2020Neurogenetic). In the context of viral infections, SMPD4 has been shown to interact with mRFP-VP26 capsids, indicating a potential role in modulating viral protein functions (Tanneti2020The). These interactions underscore SMPD4's involvement in complex cellular networks and its potential impact on cellular signaling pathways and stress responses.
