# SYCP2L

## Overview
SYCP2L (synaptonemal complex protein 2 like) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the formation and function of the synaptonemal complex, a critical structure in meiosis. The protein encoded by SYCP2L is essential for the proper pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes, ensuring accurate chromosomal segregation during meiotic division. It is predominantly expressed in reproductive tissues, such as the testis and ovary, and plays a significant role during various stages of oocyte development. The protein's localization to centromeres is vital for maintaining chromosomal alignment and segregation, and its function is crucial for normal ovarian activity and fertility. Variants in the SYCP2L gene have been linked to premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), highlighting its importance in reproductive health (He2020Homozygous).

## Function
SYCP2L (synaptonemal complex protein 2 like) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC) during meiosis. This complex is crucial for the pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes, ensuring their proper segregation during the meiotic division. The protein is specifically expressed in reproductive tissues, including the testis and ovary, and is active during various stages of oocyte development, such as the germinal vesicle, metaphase I, and metaphase II stages (He2020Homozygous).

In healthy human cells, SYCP2L localizes to the centromeres, playing a critical role in ensuring proper chromosomal alignment and segregation. The protein's structure includes N-terminal regions essential for its function, and alterations in these regions can lead to mislocalization and impaired function (He2020Homozygous). The proper function of SYCP2L is necessary for maintaining normal ovarian activity and reproductive health, as variants in this gene have been associated with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition characterized by early depletion of ovarian function leading to infertility (He2020Homozygous). The protein's role in SC assembly underscores its importance in ensuring the fidelity of meiotic division, which is critical for fertility.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SYCP2L gene have been associated with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition characterized by the loss of normal ovarian function before the age of 40, leading to infertility. In a study involving patients from consanguineous families, two homozygous variants in the SYCP2L gene, c.150_151del (p.Ser52Profs*7) and c.999A>G (p.Ile333Met), were identified. These variants were predicted to be deleterious and were shown to cause mislocalization and loss of function of the SYCP2L protein in vitro. The frameshift variant p.Ser52Profs*7 leads to a truncated protein, likely undergoing nonsense-mediated decay, resulting in reduced stability and function. These findings suggest that SYCP2L variants contribute to the development of POI by disrupting the normal meiotic processes necessary for ovarian function (He2020Homozygous).

SYCP2L has also been mentioned as a candidate gene in the context of primary ovarian insufficiency due to its role in meiotic processes, although specific details about diseases or conditions associated with SYCP2L gene mutations or expression alterations are not extensively covered in some studies (Chen2023Selected).
