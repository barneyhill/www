# LCE2B

## Overview
The LCE2B gene encodes the late cornified envelope 2B protein, which is a crucial component of the epidermal differentiation complex. This protein plays a significant role in the formation of the cornified envelope, a structure essential for the skin's protective barrier. LCE2B is predominantly expressed in the upper layers of the epidermis, particularly in differentiated keratinocytes, where it contributes to skin integrity and hydration. The protein is involved in maintaining the skin's barrier function and is regulated by factors such as calcium and vitamin D receptor ligands. Alterations in LCE2B expression have been linked to skin disorders like atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, highlighting its importance in skin health and disease (Hoss2013Control; de2012Expression; Niehues2016Late).

## Function
LCE2B (late cornified envelope 2B) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a critical component of the skin's protective barrier. This protein is primarily active in the uppermost layers of the epidermis, particularly in the granular layer and the stratum corneum, where it contributes to skin differentiation and barrier function (Niehues2016Late). LCE2B is part of the epidermal differentiation complex and is expressed in differentiated keratinocytes, playing a role in maintaining skin integrity and hydration (Hoss2013Control).

The expression of LCE2B is regulated by calcium and vitamin D receptor ligands, such as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which enhance its expression in keratinocyte cell lines. This regulation suggests that LCE2B is involved in skin repair processes and the maintenance of an effective skin barrier (Hoss2013Control). However, its expression is downregulated following skin barrier disruption, indicating that LCE2B may be more involved in maintaining normal skin barrier function rather than in repair (de2012Expression). The protein's role in the cornified envelope is crucial for protecting the skin against environmental insults and maintaining overall skin health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LCE2B gene have been implicated in several skin disorders, most notably atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis. In atopic dermatitis, there is a significant downregulation of LCE2B, along with other genes associated with terminal differentiation, suggesting broad defects in keratinocyte terminal differentiation in AD lesions (GuttmanYassky2009Broad). This downregulation contrasts with psoriasis, where LCE genes, including LCE2B, are generally upregulated, potentially contributing to the disease's characteristic skin barrier defects and inflammation (Hoss2013Control).

In psoriasis, the LCE2B gene is part of the epidermal differentiation complex, and its expression can be influenced by vitamin D receptor ligands, which may aid in skin repair and improve treatment outcomes (Hoss2013Control). The deletion of other LCE genes, such as LCE3B and LCE3C, is a known risk factor for psoriasis, and the inability of LCE2B to fully compensate for these deletions may contribute to impaired skin barrier function (Hoss2013Control).

LCE2B expression is also relevant in the context of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where its decreased expression is associated with poor survival outcomes, indicating its potential role as a prognostic marker (Metzger2020A).
