# SLC25A53

## Overview
The SLC25A53 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 53, which is part of the mitochondrial carrier family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in the transport of various molecules across the inner mitochondrial membrane, playing a crucial role in cellular metabolism and energy production. The SLC25A53 protein is characterized as a transmembrane transporter, facilitating the exchange of metabolites between the mitochondria and the cytosol. Although the specific substrates and physiological roles of SLC25A53 are not fully elucidated, its function is essential for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and proper cellular function. Mutations or dysregulation of this gene may have implications in metabolic disorders and other pathophysiological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
