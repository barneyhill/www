# IQCE

## Overview
The IQCE gene encodes the IQ motif containing E protein, which is integral to the formation and function of primary cilia in human cells. This protein is characterized by its structural features, including IQ calmodulin-binding motifs, which suggest its involvement in calmodulin binding and signal transduction processes. IQCE is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, with notable expression in the lung, brain, and hippocampus. Functionally, the IQCE protein is crucial for anchoring the EVC-EVC2 sub-complex at the base of cilia, a key component of the EvC zone, which is essential for the propagation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. This signaling pathway is vital for developmental processes such as limb development and tissue homeostasis. Mutations in the IQCE gene have been linked to clinical conditions like postaxial polydactyly and ciliopathies, underscoring its significance in normal physiological and developmental processes (Estrada‐Cuzcano2019NovelIQCEvariations).

## Structure
The IQCE protein is involved in the formation and function of cilia, particularly at the base where it forms a complex with EFCAB7 to anchor the EVC-EVC2 sub-complex. The protein structure of IQCE includes one hydrophobic segment, coil-coil conserved domain regions, three IQ calmodulin binding motifs, and one acid region. These structural features suggest a role in calmodulin binding and possibly in signal transduction processes (Estrada‐Cuzcano2019NovelIQCEvariations). The IQ motif is a short sequence that can bind to calmodulin or other EF-hand proteins, indicating potential interactions with other cellular components. The protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with higher expression levels in the lung, brain, and hippocampus (Estrada‐Cuzcano2019NovelIQCEvariations).

While the context does not provide specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of the IQCE protein, it highlights the presence of specific domains and motifs that are crucial for its function. The study does not mention any post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms related to IQCE (Estrada‐Cuzcano2019NovelIQCEvariations).

## Function
The IQCE gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and function of primary cilia in human cells. This protein is located at the base of the cilia, where it forms a complex with EFCAB7 to anchor the EVC-EVC2 sub-complex, known as the EvC zone. This complex is essential for the propagation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, a pathway critical for various developmental processes, including limb development and tissue homeostasis (Estrada‐Cuzcano2019NovelIQCEvariations).

In healthy human cells, IQCE is ubiquitously expressed, with higher mRNA levels observed in the lung, brain, and hippocampus. Its presence at the base of the cilia is vital for the proper localization of the EVC-EVC2 sub-complex, which is necessary for effective Hh signaling. The absence of IQCE disrupts this localization, potentially compromising the signaling pathway and leading to developmental abnormalities (Estrada‐Cuzcano2019NovelIQCEvariations).

The IQCE protein's role in ciliary function and Hh signaling underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal physiology, influencing processes such as limb patterning and skeletal development (Estrada‐Cuzcano2019NovelIQCEvariations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IQCE gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily involving postaxial polydactyly and ciliary defects. Postaxial polydactyly is characterized by the presence of extra digits and is linked to variations in IQCE, which disrupt the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway crucial for limb development and digit patterning (Estrada‐Cuzcano2019NovelIQCEvariations). In zebrafish models, knockdown of iqce results in phenotypes associated with defective cilia, such as body curvature, kidney cysts, and retinal defects, indicating a role in ciliopathies (Estrada‐Cuzcano2019NovelIQCEvariations).

In humans, pathogenic variations in IQCE have been identified in families with postaxial polydactyly, retinal dystrophy, and hypogonadism, supporting an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (Estrada‐Cuzcano2019NovelIQCEvariations). These mutations can lead to a ciliopathy-like phenotype, which includes symptoms such as retinitis pigmentosa, hypogonadism, and speech delay (Estrada‐Cuzcano2019NovelIQCEvariations). The presence of other genetic variations, such as in the TULP1 and ATP6V1B1 genes, may explain additional phenotypes like deafness and renal anomalies in some cases (Estrada‐Cuzcano2019NovelIQCEvariations). The study of IQCE mutations highlights the complexity of genetic interactions and the need for comprehensive genetic analysis to understand the full spectrum of associated phenotypes (Estrada‐Cuzcano2019NovelIQCEvariations).

## Interactions
The IQCE protein is involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, primarily through its role in the EvC complex, which includes EVC, EVC2, and EFCAB7. IQCE interacts with EFCAB7 to form a module that anchors the EVC-EVC2 sub-complex at the base of cilia, a critical location for the propagation of Hh signaling. This interaction is essential for the proper localization of EVC2 at the base of the cilia, and its absence leads to mislocalization of the EVC-EVC2 sub-complex, potentially compromising Hh signaling (Estrada‐Cuzcano2019NovelIQCEvariations).

In zebrafish models, the absence of IQCE results in phenotypes associated with defective cilia, such as body curvature and kidney cysts, and affects Hh signaling, leading to ectopic expression of certain genes (Estrada‐Cuzcano2019NovelIQCEvariations). The EFCAB7-IQCE module is suggested to anchor the EVC-EVC2 complex in a signaling microdomain at the base of the cilia, and depletion of EFCAB7 mislocalizes EVC-EVC2 within cilia, impairing GLI2 activation (Estrada‐Cuzcano2019NovelIQCEvariations). These interactions highlight the role of IQCE in modulating key signaling pathways crucial for limb development and digit patterning.
