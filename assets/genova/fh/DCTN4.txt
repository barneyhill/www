# DCTN4

## Overview
The DCTN4 gene encodes the dynactin subunit 4, a critical component of the dynactin complex, which is involved in intracellular transport processes. This protein, also known as p62, is part of a multisubunit complex that interacts with the dynein motor protein to facilitate the movement of cellular cargo along microtubules. The dynactin complex, including DCTN4, plays a vital role in various cellular functions such as mitosis, cell division, and organelle transport. DCTN4 is characterized by a conserved cysteine-rich domain and is part of a heterotetrameric complex within the dynactin structure, contributing to its structural integrity and function. While the specific role of DCTN4 within the complex is not fully elucidated, it is known to participate in protein-protein interactions essential for cellular homeostasis (Viel2015DCTN4; Schroer2004DYNACTIN).

## Structure
The DCTN4 protein, also known as dynactin subunit 4, is a 53 kDa protein that is ubiquitously expressed and localizes to the cytoplasm and centrosomes. A notable feature of DCTN4 is its highly conserved cysteine-rich domain located in the N-terminal region. This domain includes eight cysteines that form structural domains composed of two contiguous zinc finger domains, separated by a two-amino acid residue hydrophobic linker known as the LIM domain (Viel2015DCTN4).

DCTN4 is a component of the dynactin complex, which is a multisubunit complex that interacts with microtubules and the dynein motor protein. The dynactin complex enhances the microtubule-binding capabilities and motility of dynein, linking it to cellular cargo. The complex consists of 11 different subunits, with DCTN4 being one of them, although its specific role within the complex is not fully understood (Viel2015DCTN4).

The molecular structure of DCTN4, including its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as specific domains, prominent folds, post-translational modifications, and splice variant isoforms, is not detailed in the available literature (ReckPeterson2018The; Chaaban2022Structure).

## Function
The DCTN4 gene encodes the dynactin subunit p62, which is a component of the dynactin complex. This complex is essential for dynein-mediated intracellular transport, playing a critical role in linking dynein to its cargo and facilitating movement along microtubules (ReckPeterson2018The; Schroer2004DYNACTIN). The dynactin complex, including p62, is involved in various cellular processes such as mitosis, cell division, and the transport of organelles and vesicles (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). 

The p62 subunit is part of a heterotetrameric complex with Arp11, p25, and p27, located at the pointed end of the Arp1 rod within the dynactin structure. This configuration is crucial for the structural integrity and function of the dynactin complex, although the loss of p62 does not significantly affect dynactin stability, suggesting its role is more related to specific protein-protein interactions (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). 

In healthy human cells, the dynactin complex, including DCTN4, is active in processes such as intracellular transport, mitotic spindle formation, and maintaining cellular organization, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and function (Kardon2009Regulators; Schroer2004DYNACTIN).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DCTN4 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In cystic fibrosis (CF), DCTN4 variants have been identified as modifiers of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. These variants are associated with an increased risk of earlier onset and severity of infection, which is a significant concern for CF patients due to its impact on lung function and overall health (Emond2012Exome; Viel2015DCTN4). The p.Tyr263Cys variant, in particular, has been linked to a higher incidence of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis in CF patients (Viel2015DCTN4).

In Wilson disease, a variant in the DCTN4 gene, c.1084A>G (p.Thr362Ala), has been associated with the disease in patients lacking mutations in the primary gene ATP7B. This variant may affect protein function and is involved in copper transport, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of Wilson disease (Lee2011Association).

In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), DCTN4 shows less promoter methylation and undergoes copy number alterations, which may influence its expression levels. Although these alterations are not statistically significant in affecting overall survival, they suggest a potential role in cancer progression (Ullah2022A).

## Interactions
DCTN4, a subunit of the dynactin complex, plays a crucial role in facilitating interactions within the complex and with other proteins. It is part of the pointed-end complex of dynactin, which includes other subunits such as p62 (DCTN4), p25 (DCTN5), p27 (DCTN6), and an N-terminal fragment of p50 (DCTN2) (Chaaban2022Structure). This complex is essential for the activation of dynein, a motor protein that transports cellular cargo along microtubules (Chaaban2022Structure).

DCTN4 interacts with the N4BP2L1 protein, which binds to the DCTN4-6 subunits of the dynactin complex. This interaction is hypothesized to influence the localization and trafficking of GLUT4, a glucose transporter, thereby affecting glucose uptake in adipocytes (Watanabe2021N4BP2L1). The interaction between N4BP2L1 and DCTN4 suggests that N4BP2L1 may form a complex with the pointed-end complex domain of dynactin, potentially playing a role in the activation of dynein (Watanabe2021N4BP2L1).

DCTN4 also has a role in modifying the severity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis patients, although the specific interactions in this context are not fully understood (Viel2015DCTN4).
