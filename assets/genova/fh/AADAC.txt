# AADAC

## Overview
The AADAC gene encodes the enzyme arylacetamide deacetylase, which is a crucial hydrolase involved in the metabolism of esters and amides. This enzyme is categorized as a serine hydrolase and is predominantly expressed in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, where it plays a significant role in drug metabolism and detoxification processes. AADAC is responsible for the hydrolysis of various clinical drugs, influencing their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The enzyme's activity is characterized by its preference for small acyl groups, particularly acetyl groups, and it is located in the endoplasmic reticulum of liver cells. Genetic polymorphisms in the AADAC gene can lead to variations in enzyme activity, affecting individual responses to drugs. Additionally, alterations in the AADAC gene have been associated with clinical conditions such as Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome and gastric cancer, highlighting its importance in both neurological and oncological contexts (Hirosawa2021Role; Zhan2023Correlation; Nakajima2011Human; Bertelsen2016Association).

## Structure


## Function
The human arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC) enzyme is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of esters and amides, playing a significant role in drug metabolism and detoxification processes. AADAC is highly expressed in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, where it catalyzes the hydrolysis of various clinical drugs, including flutamide, phenacetin, rifamycins, and ketoconazole (Hirosawa2021Role; Fukami2016Human; Nakajima2011Human). This enzyme is responsible for converting prodrugs into their active forms, such as the conversion of eslicarbazepine acetate to eslicarbazepine, and for reducing the cytotoxicity of certain drugs by deacetylation (Hirosawa2021Role; Nakajima2011Human).

AADAC's activity is characterized by its preference for small acyl groups, particularly acetyl groups, which aligns with its role in drug metabolism (Hirosawa2021Role). The enzyme is located in the endoplasmic reticulum of liver cells, where it contributes to the biotransformation of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds, influencing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (Fukami2016Human). Genetic polymorphisms in the AADAC gene can lead to variations in enzyme activity, affecting drug metabolism and response among individuals (Shimizu2012A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AADAC gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. A significant association has been found between deletions in the AADAC gene and Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS). Studies have shown that these deletions occur more frequently in GTS patients compared to controls, suggesting a role in the disorder's pathogenesis (Bertelsen2016Association). The AADAC gene is expressed in various brain regions, which supports its involvement in neurological conditions like GTS (Bertelsen2016Association).

In the context of gastric cancer, AADAC expression levels have been linked to prognosis. High expression of AADAC is associated with a better prognosis in Borrmann type III advanced gastric cancer, while other studies suggest that higher AADAC expression correlates with poorer overall survival in gastric cancer patients (Wang2022Impact; Zhan2023Correlation). AADAC's role in drug metabolism and its potential to metabolize arylacetamide into carcinogens may contribute to its impact on cancer progression and patient outcomes (Zhan2023Correlation). These findings highlight the gene's significance in both neurological and oncological contexts.
