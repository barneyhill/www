# ZNF683

## Overview
ZNF683 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 683, a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in the development and function of natural killer (NK) cells. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. ZNF683 is crucial for the differentiation of NK cells from progenitor cells, influencing their maturation and functional capabilities, such as cytokine production (Post2017The). The gene's expression is notably high in the immature CD56 bright subpopulation of NK cells, which are known for their cytokine-producing potential (Post2017The). Beyond its role in NK cell biology, ZNF683 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Yang2021Tumor; Liu2023A; Rao2022Genomic).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF683, also known as Hobit, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development and function of human natural killer (NK) cells. It is highly upregulated during the differentiation of NK cells, particularly in the transition from CD34+ stem cells to CD56+ NK cells, indicating its importance in early NK-cell development (Post2017The). ZNF683 is essential for the efficient generation of CD56+ NK cells from progenitors, as its downmodulation significantly reduces the formation of these cells (Post2017The). Despite this reduction, the expression of important NK cell receptors such as NKG2A and KIR remains normal in the cells that do form (Post2017The).

ZNF683 also acts as a suppressor of IFN-γ production in NK cells, as its knockdown increases the proportion of IFN-γ-producing cells (Post2017The). This suggests that ZNF683 regulates the functional maturation of NK cells, particularly in enhancing their cytokine production capabilities (Post2017The). The transcription factor is predominantly expressed in the more immature CD56 bright subpopulation of NK cells, which are known for their cytokine-producing capacity (Post2017The). Overall, ZNF683 is a key regulatory factor in the generation, proliferation, and survival of NK-cell progenitors, influencing both their development and functional outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZNF683 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In achalasia, a disorder affecting the esophagus, there is an increased infiltration of tissue-resident memory T cells (T RM) expressing ZNF683, suggesting a role in the disease's pathophysiology (Liu2023A). In cancer, particularly lung and colon adenocarcinoma, higher altered expression of ZNF683 is associated with decreased survival, indicating it as a potential target for inhibitor development due to its classification as a 'survival-critical' gene (Rao2022Genomic). In ovarian cancer, ZNF683 is identified as a tumor microenvironment regulator, with its upregulation linked to poor prognosis, suggesting it as a potential risk factor (Yang2021Tumor).

ZNF683 is also associated with psoriasis, where a missense variant, rs10794532, has been identified as a genetic risk factor. This variant suggests a role for ZNF683 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, although the specific clinical significance requires further research (Zuo2015Wholeexome). These findings highlight the importance of ZNF683 in various pathological conditions, emphasizing its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
