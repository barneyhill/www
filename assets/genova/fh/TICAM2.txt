# TICAM2

## Overview
TICAM2, also known as TRAM (TIR domain-containing adaptor molecule 2), is a gene that encodes a critical adaptor protein involved in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway, specifically in the MyD88-independent pathway. The protein encoded by TICAM2 is characterized by the presence of a TIR (Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor) domain, which is essential for its role in mediating immune responses. As an adaptor protein, TICAM2 facilitates the interaction between TLR4 and TICAM1 (TRIF), playing a pivotal role in the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and the production of type I interferons, such as interferon-beta (IFN-β) (Oshiumi2003TIRcontaining). The protein's structure includes a core of parallel β-strands and surrounding α-helices, forming homo-dimers that are crucial for its signaling function (Enokizono2013Structures). TICAM2 is also involved in the immune response against bacterial components by activating caspase 4/11 and inducing inflammasome activation (Funami2017Functional). Its role in immune signaling underscores its importance in host defense mechanisms against various pathogens.

## Structure
TICAM2, also known as TRAM, is a protein involved in toll-like receptor and interferon signaling. It contains a TIR (Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor) domain, which is crucial for its role in the immune response. The TIR domain of TICAM2 is predicted to comprise residues 77-210, with flexible N-terminal (residues 1-76) and additional C-terminal (residues 211-235) regions (Ullah2015Recombinant). The protein's secondary structure includes a mixture of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, consistent with the TIR-domain fold (Ullah2015Recombinant).

The tertiary structure of TICAM2 involves a core structure consisting of five parallel β-strands surrounded by six or seven α-helices (Enokizono2013Structures). The quaternary structure is characterized by the formation of homo-dimers, which are essential for its function in signaling pathways. The homo-dimerization of TICAM2 TIR domains presents a surface that recruits the monomeric moiety of TICAM-1, forming an extended signaling network (Enokizono2013Structures).

TICAM2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as myristoylation, which facilitates its interaction with the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles, crucial for its signaling function (Funami2015Identification). Specific acidic motifs, such as E87/D88/D89, are critical for its signaling activity and interaction with TICAM-1 (Funami2015Identification).

## Function
TICAM2, also known as TRAM, is a crucial adaptor protein in the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway, primarily involved in the innate immune response. In healthy human cells, TICAM2 functions as a bridging adaptor that connects TLR4 to TICAM1 (TRIF), facilitating the transmission of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced signals. This interaction is essential for the induction of type I interferons, particularly interferon-beta (IFN-β), and the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (Oshiumi2003TIRcontaining).

TICAM2 is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with endosomal membranes, where it forms a complex with TLR4 and TICAM1. This complex is necessary for TLR4-mediated signaling from the endosome, leading to the production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Funami2017Functional; Funami2015Identification). The N-terminal myristoylation of TICAM2 allows it to anchor to the endosomal membrane, and specific acidic amino acids (D91/E92) are identified as functional motifs that determine its endosomal localization (Funami2017Functional).

TICAM2 also plays a role in activating caspase 4/11 and inducing cytoplasmic LPS-mediated inflammasome activation, contributing to the immune response against bacterial components (Funami2017Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TICAM2 gene, also known as TRAM, have been associated with various infectious diseases, particularly tuberculosis (TB) and SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections. In the context of TB, studies have identified significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TICAM2 and susceptibility to the disease. For instance, research has shown that certain SNPs in the TICAM2 gene are linked to an increased risk of developing pulmonary TB, with one SNP reaching experiment-wide significance (Hall2014Polymorphisms). These genetic variations may influence the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, potentially affecting disease progression (Mekonnen2018Novel).

In SARS-CoV infections, TICAM2 plays a critical role in modulating disease severity. Allelic variations in TICAM2 have been shown to contribute to differences in disease outcomes, such as weight loss and pulmonary hemorrhage, in mouse models. TICAM2-deficient mice exhibited more severe symptoms, indicating its importance in controlling the immune response to SARS-CoV (Gralinski2017Allelic). These findings suggest that TICAM2 is a key factor in the host's defense against certain viral and bacterial infections, and alterations in its expression or function can significantly impact disease susceptibility and severity.

## Interactions
TICAM2, also known as TRAM, is a TIR domain-containing adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway, particularly in the MyD88-independent pathway. TICAM2 interacts with TLR4, facilitating the recruitment of TICAM-1 (TRIF) to TLR4, which is essential for the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and the subsequent production of type I interferons (Oshiumi2003TIRcontaining; Ullah2015Recombinant).

The interaction between TICAM2 and TICAM-1 is mediated by specific acidic motifs, notably the E87/D88/D89 motif, which is critical for the formation of the TICAM-1-TICAM-2 heterodimer. This interaction is essential for downstream signaling and the activation of the IFN-β promoter (Funami2015Identification; Enokizono2013Structures). TICAM2 also forms homodimers and weak heterodimers with TICAM-1, although mutations in these motifs can disrupt these interactions (Oshiumi2003TIRcontaining).

TICAM2's interaction with TLR4 is not significantly affected by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, indicating a stable association that is necessary for TLR4 to recruit TICAM-1 (Oshiumi2003TIRcontaining). These interactions highlight TICAM2's role as a bridging adapter in the TLR4 signaling pathway, crucial for immune response regulation.
