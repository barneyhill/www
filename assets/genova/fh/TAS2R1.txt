# TAS2R1

## Overview
TAS2R1 is a gene that encodes the protein taste 2 receptor member 1, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of bitter compounds, playing a crucial role in the perception of bitter taste. The TAS2R1 protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, a hallmark of GPCRs, which facilitate its function in signal transduction pathways. These pathways are initiated upon the binding of bitter ligands, leading to a cascade of intracellular events that ultimately result in the perception of bitterness. While TAS2R1 is predominantly expressed in taste receptor cells within taste buds, it is also found in various non-gustatory tissues, indicating potential roles beyond taste perception, such as in digestion and respiratory defense (Behrens2020StructureFunction; Beckett2014Bitter; Chandrashekar2006The).

## Structure
The TAS2R1 protein is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, characterized by seven transmembrane domains (TMDs) connected by three extracellular and three intracellular loops (Behrens2020StructureFunction; Behrens2016G). The primary structure of TAS2R1 includes amino acid sequences that form these transmembrane helices, which are typical of GPCRs (Behrens2020StructureFunction). The secondary structure is primarily composed of alpha helices that span the cell membrane.

The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of these helices, creating a ligand-binding pocket typically located at the extracellular side of the transmembrane domains III, V, VI, and VII (Behrens2020StructureFunction). The extracellular loops, particularly the second extracellular loop (ECL2), are suggested to play a role in ligand binding (Behrens2020StructureFunction).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are crucial for the proper folding and function of TAS2R1, with a conserved glycosylation site in the second extracellular loop (Behrens2020StructureFunction; Behrens2016G). These modifications are necessary for the receptor's biosynthesis and expression on the cell surface (Meyerhof2011Molecular). The quaternary structure may involve oligomerization, although no functional changes due to heteromerization have been observed (Behrens2020StructureFunction).

## Function
TAS2R1 is a member of the T2R family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the perception of bitter taste. These receptors are primarily expressed in taste receptor cells located in taste buds on the tongue. TAS2R1, like other T2R receptors, detects bitter compounds and initiates a signal transduction pathway that involves the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. This activation leads to the stimulation of phospholipase Cβ2, resulting in the production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and the release of calcium ions from intracellular stores. The increase in intracellular calcium concentration ultimately leads to the opening of the TRPM5 channel, which is crucial for the transmission of the bitter taste signal to the brain (Chandrashekar2006The).

While TAS2R1 is a candidate receptor for the bitter compound 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PROP), its specific ligands and role in PROP sensitivity have not been experimentally confirmed (Bachmanov2007Taste). TAS2R1 and other T2R receptors are also expressed in various non-gustatory tissues, suggesting potential roles beyond taste perception, such as influencing digestion, metabolism, and respiratory defense mechanisms (Beckett2014Bitter). However, the precise functions of TAS2R1 in these contexts remain to be fully elucidated.
