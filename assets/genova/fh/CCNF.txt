# CCNF

## Overview
The CCNF gene encodes cyclin F, a unique member of the cyclin family that functions as an F-box protein within the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. Unlike other cyclins, cyclin F does not activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) but instead plays a pivotal role in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, thereby maintaining genomic stability and regulating the cell cycle, particularly during the G2 phase (Williams2016CCNF; D’Angiolella2013A). Cyclin F is characterized by its F-box domain, cyclin domains, and a PEST sequence, which are crucial for its function in protein interactions and stability (Yu2019Pathogenic; Williams2016CCNF). Mutations in the CCNF gene have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), highlighting its clinical significance in neuronal health and disease (Williams2016CCNF; Chia2018Novel).

## Structure
Cyclin F, encoded by the CCNF gene, is a protein composed of 786 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 87 kDa, although it migrates as a 100-110 kDa protein due to potential post-translational modifications (Bai1994Human). The protein structure includes several key domains: an F-box domain, two cyclin domains, and a PEST sequence (Yu2019Pathogenic; Williams2016CCNF). The F-box domain is part of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating interactions with other components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (D’Angiolella2013A). The cyclin domains form the substrate recruitment module, which recognizes and binds substrates for ubiquitylation (Williams2016CCNF). The PEST sequence, located in the C-terminal region, is involved in the regulation of protein stability and degradation (Yu2019Pathogenic; Bai1994Human).

Cyclin F is unique among cyclins as it does not bind or activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (Williams2016CCNF). It undergoes phosphorylation, with Ser621 being a critical site that regulates its E3 ligase activity (Lee2017Casein). Cyclin F contains two nuclear localization signals, ensuring its presence in the nucleus (Williams2016CCNF).

## Function
Cyclin F, encoded by the CCNF gene, is a unique member of the cyclin family that functions as part of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. Unlike other cyclins, it does not activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) but instead targets specific proteins for degradation, playing a crucial role in maintaining genome stability through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (D’Angiolella2010SCFCyclin; D’Angiolella2013A).

Cyclin F is primarily active during the G2 phase of the cell cycle, where it regulates the degradation of several key proteins. It targets RRM2, a subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, to control deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) levels, ensuring proper DNA synthesis and repair (D’Angiolella2013A; D’Angiolella2012Cyclin). Cyclin F also degrades CP110, a centrosomal protein, to maintain centrosome homeostasis and prevent mitotic abnormalities (D’Angiolella2010SCFCyclin).

In addition, cyclin F is involved in the regulation of DNA repair by promoting the degradation of atypical E2Fs, E2F7 and E2F8, facilitating G2-phase progression and preventing premature mitosis (Yuan2019Cyclin). Its activity is crucial for proper cell cycle progression and genomic stability, with implications for cancer development if dysregulated (D’Angiolella2013A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCNF gene, which encodes cyclin F, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). These neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, with TDP-43 being a major component (Williams2016CCNF). Mutations in CCNF can lead to abnormal ubiquitination and protein degradation pathways, contributing to the formation of TDP-43 aggregates, a hallmark of ALS pathology (Yu2019Pathogenic; Chia2018Novel).

The S621G mutation in cyclin F is associated with increased ubiquitination of specific targets and activation of apoptosis pathways, leading to neuronal dysfunction (Siebert2022ALS-linked; Cheng2021Unbiased). This mutation, along with others like K97R and S195R, can result in either gain- or loss-of-function effects, disrupting cellular pathways and contributing to proteostasis dysfunction (Cheng2021Unbiased).

In ALS patients, CCNF mutations have been linked to motor neuron axonopathies and reduced motor response, as observed in model organisms (Cheng2021Unbiased). The clinical presentation of CCNF mutations can vary, with some patients exhibiting typical ALS symptoms, while others may present with ALS combined with FTD or FTD alone (Chia2018Novel).

## Interactions
Cyclin F, encoded by the CCNF gene, is a key component of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets various proteins for degradation. Cyclin F interacts with CP110, a protein crucial for centrosome duplication, specifically during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. This interaction is mediated by the RxL motif in CP110 and the cyclin box domain in Cyclin F, leading to CP110's degradation, which is essential for maintaining mitotic fidelity and genome integrity (D’Angiolella2010SCFCyclin).

Cyclin F also interacts with CDC6, a protein involved in DNA replication origin licensing. This interaction occurs predominantly during the late stages of the cell cycle and is crucial for preventing DNA re-replication by promoting CDC6 ubiquitylation and degradation (Walter2016SCFCyclin).

In addition, Cyclin F binds to RRM2, a subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner during the G2 phase. This interaction leads to the degradation of RRM2, which is important for controlling deoxynucleotide triphosphate levels and maintaining genomic stability (D’Angiolella2012Cyclin).

Cyclin F also interacts with paraspeckle-associated proteins, such as RBM14, and is involved in the regulation of RNA processing and paraspeckle formation (Rayner2020BioID).
