# IP6K2

## Overview
Inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 2 (IP6K2) is a gene that encodes the enzyme inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 2, which belongs to the kinase family. This enzyme is involved in the phosphorylation of inositol phosphates, playing a pivotal role in various cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell signaling, and stress response. IP6K2 catalyzes the conversion of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) to diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (IP7), a reaction that is crucial for modulating signaling pathways, including those involving the tumor suppressor protein p53 and protein kinase Akt (Chakraborty2011Casein; Morrison2009Gene). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular homeostasis and developmental processes. IP6K2's interactions with various proteins underscore its significance in cellular signaling and apoptotic pathways, and its expression levels have been linked to cancer susceptibility and prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Heitmann2023The; Sandström2021IP6K2).

## Structure
The human inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 2 (IP6K2) protein is characterized by specific structural features that contribute to its function. The primary structure of IP6K2 includes key residues such as Lys236, Lys243, Arg278, and Cys257, which are crucial for substrate interaction and catalytic activity (Wang2014IP6K). The secondary structure features an alpha-helical pair and a rare two-turn 3_10 helix, forming a substrate-binding pocket with an open clamshell geometry, essential for binding inositol phosphates like InsP6 and InsP3 (Wang2014IP6K).

The tertiary structure of IP6K2 is not detailed in the provided context, but the enzyme's substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency are influenced by its structural elements. The quaternary structure is not described, indicating that IP6K2 may function as a monomer or that its multimeric state is not well-characterized in the available literature.

Post-translational modifications play a significant role in regulating IP6K2 activity. Phosphorylation by Casein kinase-2 (CK2) at serines 347 and 356 within the PEST motif signals for degradation via the ubiquitin pathway, affecting the protein's stability and function (Chakraborty2011Casein). Specific domains or prominent folds are not explicitly mentioned in the context.

## Function
Inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 2 (IP6K2) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell signaling, and stress response. In healthy human cells, IP6K2 is involved in the synthesis of diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (IP7) from inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), a reaction that is significant for regulating signaling pathways such as those involving the tumor suppressor protein p53 and protein kinase Akt (Chakraborty2011Casein; Morrison2009Gene). 

IP6K2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular homeostasis by modulating processes like autophagy and mitophagy. It can translocate to the cytoplasm in response to stress, contributing to increased levels of IP7, which is linked to the regulation of autophagosome formation and inhibition of mTOR signaling (Heitmann2023The). 

The enzyme also plays a role in the hedgehog signaling pathway, acting as a positive regulator and influencing developmental processes such as craniofacial structure formation and neural crest cell development (Sarmah2010Inositol). In the central nervous system, IP6K2 is involved in cerebellar development and function, affecting motor coordination and neuronal development (Heitmann2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the IP6K2 gene have been linked to various cancers. In aerodigestive tract carcinoma, deletion of IP6K2 predisposes individuals to increased cancer susceptibility. Studies using IP6K2 knockout mice have shown accelerated tumorigenesis when exposed to carcinogens like 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO), suggesting a protective role of IP6K2 against certain carcinogens (Morrison2009Gene). The absence of IP6K2 may lead to increased oncogene activity and decreased tumor suppressor function, contributing to tumorigenesis (Morrison2009Gene).

In breast cancer, high expression of IP6K2 is associated with favorable clinical outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Its expression is linked to smaller tumor size and specific molecular markers, suggesting a protective role against cancer progression (Sandström2021IP6K2).

IP6K2 also plays a role in ovarian carcinoma, where its overexpression sensitizes cells to apoptosis induced by interferon-β and radiation. This suggests that IP6K2 acts as a positive regulator of apoptosis, enhancing the effectiveness of cancer therapeutics (Morrison2002Inositol).

## Interactions
Inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 2 (IP6K2) is known for its interactions with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. IP6K2 directly binds to the Tti1/Tti2/Tel2 complex, specifically interacting with Tti1, as confirmed by tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry, as well as coimmunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction forms a ternary complex with DNA-PKcs and ATM, which are crucial for phosphorylating p53 to activate its apoptotic program (Rao2014Inositol).

IP6K2 also interacts with protein 4.1N in cerebellar granule cells, a binding that is selective to IP6K2 and not observed with other isoforms like IP6K1 or IP6K3. This interaction is crucial for the nuclear translocation of 4.1N, which is necessary for its primary functions (Nagpal2018Inositol). Additionally, IP6K2 binds to SNX-27 and Rab 5, which are involved in synaptic functions (Nagpal2018Inositol).

IP6K2's interaction with CK2 is also significant, as it enhances CK2's ability to phosphorylate Tti1/Tel2, facilitating the DNA-PK/ATM-p53 cell death pathway (Rao2014Inositol). These interactions highlight IP6K2's role in regulating phosphorylation processes and apoptotic pathways.
