# SLC35B3

## Overview
SLC35B3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member B3, which is a member of the solute carrier (SLC) family of transport proteins. This protein is primarily involved in the transport of nucleotide sugars across cellular membranes, a critical function for the glycosylation processes within cells. Glycosylation is essential for various cellular activities, including protein folding and cell signaling, underscoring the importance of SLC35B3 in maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein is thought to be part of larger multiprotein complexes and may interact with regulatory proteins and enzymes involved in glycosylation, although the specific details of these interactions are still under investigation. Understanding the role of SLC35B3 in these processes is crucial for elucidating its contributions to cellular function and its potential implications in human health and disease.

## Interactions
SLC35B3 is involved in transporting nucleotide sugars across cellular membranes and participates in interactions with other proteins that are crucial for glycosylation processes. It may form part of larger multiprotein complexes, which are essential for its function in cellular transport mechanisms. These interactions can include transient binding with regulatory proteins, which may modulate its activity or stability. Additionally, SLC35B3 might interact with nucleic acids, although the specific nature of these interactions is not fully detailed. The protein's role in glycosylation suggests that it could interact with enzymes or other proteins involved in this pathway, facilitating the transfer of nucleotide sugars to their respective substrates. These interactions are vital for maintaining proper cellular function and ensuring the fidelity of glycosylation processes, which are critical for various cellular activities, including protein folding and cell signaling. The precise partners and mechanisms of these interactions remain an area of active research, highlighting the complexity and importance of SLC35B3 in cellular homeostasis.
