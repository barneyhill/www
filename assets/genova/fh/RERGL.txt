# RERGL

## Overview
RERGL is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, which are pivotal in regulating various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and survival. The protein encoded by RERGL, similar to the RERG protein, is believed to function as a tumor suppressor, playing a crucial role in modulating cellular signaling pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Deprez2020A; Mangiola2018Periprostatic). RERGL is expressed in multiple tissues, notably in pericytes, suggesting its involvement in vascular biology (Deprez2020A). The gene has been implicated in familial colorectal cancer, with structural variations and somatic mutations linked to cancer predisposition and progression (Yang2013Genome-wide). Despite its potential significance in tumor suppression, the precise biological functions and mechanisms of RERGL in normal and pathological states remain to be fully elucidated.

## Function
RERGL is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, which are involved in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and survival. The protein encoded by RERGL is thought to play a role in modulating cellular signaling pathways, impacting cellular responses to external stimuli and contributing to normal cellular function and homeostasis (Deprez2020A). Although the specific function of RERGL in healthy human cells is not fully understood, it shares significant sequence homology with the RERG gene, which is known to encode a tumor-suppressing GTPase (Mangiola2018Periprostatic).

RERGL is expressed in various tissues, including pericytes, which are mesenchymal cells located on the vascular basement membrane of capillaries. This suggests a potential role in the characteristics or functions of these cells (Deprez2020A). The protein is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it may influence signal transduction pathways. In the context of cancer, loss of RERGL expression has been associated with poorer survival in colorectal cancer, indicating its potential involvement in tumor suppression (Mangiola2018Periprostatic). However, the precise molecular activities and organismal outcomes of RERGL's functions in healthy cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The RERGL gene has been implicated in familial colorectal cancer (CRC) through its association with increased copy number variations (CNVs) and a rare structural variation at chromosome 12p12.3. This structural variation, specifically a 94.4 kb deletion, affects the RERGL gene and has been identified in familial CRC cases but not in healthy controls, suggesting a potential role in cancer predisposition (Yang2013Genome-wide). The RERGL gene is proposed to function as a tumor suppressor, similar to its closely related gene RERG, which is known to suppress cell growth and is often downregulated in various tumors, including those of the colon (Yang2013Genome-wide).

Somatic mutations in the RERGL gene have also been reported in CRC tumors, supporting its involvement in cancer (Yang2013Genome-wide). The presence of chromothripsis, a complex chromosomal rearrangement, in a familial CRC patient further indicates significant genomic instability associated with RERGL (Yang2013Genome-wide). While the gene has been included in studies of familial Meniere's disease, no specific mutations in RERGL have been linked to this condition (Gabriková2010Familiar).
