# ATP2A2

## Overview
ATP2A2 is a gene that encodes the protein ATPase sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transporting 2, commonly referred to as SERCA2. This protein is a transmembrane calcium ATPase that plays a critical role in calcium homeostasis by transporting Ca2+ ions from the cytoplasm into the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum. This process is essential for various cellular functions, including muscle contraction and relaxation, signal transduction, and maintaining cellular calcium balance. SERCA2 exists in multiple isoforms, such as SERCA2a and SERCA2b, which are generated through alternative splicing and exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns. SERCA2a is predominantly found in cardiac muscle, while SERCA2b is expressed ubiquitously across different tissues. Mutations in the ATP2A2 gene are associated with Darier disease, a genetic skin disorder, and have been implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions and cardiac abnormalities (Sakuntabhai1999Spectrum; Frustaci2024Novel; Britzolaki2018The).

## Structure
The ATP2A2 gene encodes the SERCA2 protein, a calcium ATPase involved in calcium transport across the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The primary structure of SERCA2 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific isoforms produced through alternative splicing: SERCA2a and SERCA2b. SERCA2a is primarily expressed in cardiac muscle, while SERCA2b is ubiquitous across tissues (Ver2000Structure; Korošec2006Alterations).

The secondary structure of SERCA2 consists of 10 transmembrane helices and three cytoplasmic domains, which include a β-strand, a phosphorylation domain, and an ATP-binding domain (Sakuntabhai1999Spectrum; Korošec2006Alterations). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape crucial for its function, with calcium-binding sites located within four of the transmembrane helices (M4, M5, M6, and M8) (Korošec2006Alterations).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, acetylation, and methylation play a significant role in regulating SERCA2a's activity and stability. These modifications occur on isoform-specific residues and are crucial for the protein's regulatory control, particularly in the context of heart failure (Sitsel2019Structures).

## Function
The ATP2A2 gene encodes the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase type 2 isoform (SERCA2), which is crucial for maintaining calcium homeostasis in cells. SERCA2 is responsible for transporting Ca2+ ions from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, thereby reducing cytosolic calcium concentrations and replenishing ER calcium stores. This process is essential for various cellular functions, including muscle relaxation, signal transduction, and maintaining cellular calcium balance (Britzolaki2018The; Lipskaia2008Role).

SERCA2 isoforms, such as SERCA2a and SERCA2b, are generated through tissue-dependent alternative splicing and have distinct expression patterns. SERCA2a is primarily found in cardiac and slow-twitch muscle, while SERCA2b is ubiquitously expressed in smooth muscle and non-muscle tissues (Britzolaki2018The). The function of SERCA2 is driven by ATP hydrolysis, which facilitates conformational changes between high-Ca2+-affinity (E1) and low-Ca2+-affinity (E2) states, allowing efficient calcium transport (Britzolaki2018The).

In neurons, SERCA2 plays a key role in calcium signaling pathways, which are vital for processes such as learning, memory, and motor function (Britzolaki2018The). Proper SERCA2 function is essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis, which is critical for various cellular processes and overall organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP2A2 gene, which encodes the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase isoform 2 (SERCA2), are primarily associated with Darier disease (DD), an autosomal dominant skin disorder. DD is characterized by keratotic papules, nail abnormalities, and palmo-plantar pits. These mutations disrupt calcium homeostasis, leading to impaired keratinocyte adhesion and abnormal epidermal differentiation, which manifest as the clinical features of DD (Sakuntabhai1999Spectrum; Godic2010Four).

The mutations in ATP2A2 can be diverse, including nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, and missense mutations, which often result in haploinsufficiency or a dominant negative effect. These genetic alterations lead to reduced SERCA2 activity, affecting calcium transport and contributing to the pathophysiology of DD (Sakuntabhai1999Spectrum; Nellen2017Mendelian).

Beyond skin manifestations, ATP2A2 mutations have been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, although a direct causal relationship remains unconfirmed (Nellen2017Mendelian). Additionally, certain mutations may have systemic effects, including cardiac involvement, as evidenced by a novel mutation causing cardiomyocyte disconnection and related cardiac symptoms (Frustaci2024Novel).

## Interactions
ATP2A2, also known as SERCA2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in calcium homeostasis. It interacts with phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN), which regulate its activity by competing for binding sites or stabilizing ATP2A2 in its active form (Zhao2018The). ATP2A2 also interacts with the ER-localized autophagy protein EPG-3/VMP1, which modulates ATP2A2 activity to regulate calcium transport and ER contacts with other organelles (Zhao2018The).

In the context of cardiac function, ATP2A2 is regulated by intranuclear cardiac troponin I (cTnI), which binds to specific DNA sequences in the ATP2A2 promoter region, suggesting a role in gene expression regulation (Lu2022Intranuclear). This interaction involves the transcription factor YY1, which binds to the CCAT motif in the ATP2A2 promoter, facilitating transcriptional activation by cTnI (Lu2022Intranuclear).

ATP2A2 also interacts with TRPML1, a protein associated with actin-mediated cell contraction and action potential regulation, although these interactions have not been extensively validated (Krogsaeter2019The). These interactions highlight ATP2A2's role in complex regulatory networks essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis and cellular function.
