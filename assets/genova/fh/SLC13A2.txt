# SLC13A2

## Overview
The SLC13A2 gene encodes the Na+/dicarboxylate cotransporter 1 (NaDC1), a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the transport of dicarboxylates, such as succinate and citrate, across cell membranes. NaDC1 is primarily expressed in the apical membrane of epithelial cells in the small intestine and renal proximal tubule, where it facilitates the absorption and reabsorption of these anions through an electrogenic mechanism that couples their transport with sodium ions (Rendina2016Evidence; Pajor2013Sodiumcoupled). The protein's structure includes 11 transmembrane domains and features a homodimeric arrangement, which is essential for its function (Pajor2000Molecular; Pajor2013Sodiumcoupled). NaDC1's activity is modulated by the vitamin D/VDR system, highlighting its regulatory complexity and significance in maintaining acid-base balance and preventing nephrolithiasis (Rendina2016Evidence; Nowik2008Genomewide).

## Structure
The SLC13A2 gene encodes the Na+/dicarboxylate cotransporter 1 (NaDC1), which is involved in the transport of dicarboxylates such as succinate and citrate across cell membranes. The protein is composed of 586 amino acids and features 11 transmembrane domains, with the N-terminus located intracellularly and the C-terminus extracellularly (Pajor2000Molecular; Pajor2013Sodiumcoupled). The structure of NaDC1 is characterized by a homodimeric arrangement, where specific transmembrane helices interact between protomers (Pajor2013Sodiumcoupled).

The secondary structure includes transmembrane helices and hairpin loops, which are crucial for substrate and cation binding. These loops contain conserved motifs, such as the SNT motif, which are essential for binding and transport activity (Pajor2013Sodiumcoupled). The protein also has two N-glycosylation sites at the COOH terminus and potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C, which may influence its function and regulation (Pajor2000Molecular).

NaDC1 operates via an electrogenic mechanism, coupling the transport of three sodium ions with each divalent anion substrate, contributing to its role in reabsorbing citric acid cycle intermediates in the kidney (Pajor2013Sodiumcoupled).

## Function
The SLC13A2 gene encodes the Na+-dicarboxylate cotransporter NaDC1, which is primarily active in the apical membrane of epithelial cells in the small intestine and renal proximal tubule. This transporter plays a crucial role in the absorption and reabsorption of dicarboxylates, such as citrate and succinate, through an electrogenic process that couples the transport of these anions with sodium ions (Rendina2016Evidence; Nowik2008Genomewide). NaDC1 is a major determinant of urinary citrate excretion, influencing the amount of citrate that is reabsorbed at the tubular level, which is significant for maintaining acid-base balance and preventing nephrolithiasis (Rendina2016Evidence).

The function of NaDC1 is modulated by the vitamin D/VDR biological system, which affects its expression through vitamin D response elements in the promoter region of the SLC13A2 gene (Rendina2016Evidence). During metabolic acidosis, SLC13A2 expression is upregulated, suggesting its involvement in transporting TCA cycle intermediates that may provide substrates for bicarbonate production, thus contributing to cellular homeostasis and energy production under metabolic stress (Nowik2008Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC13A2 gene, encoding the Na+/dicarboxylate cotransporter 1 (NaDC1), is implicated in the pathogenesis of hypocitraturia, a metabolic risk factor for calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis (CaOx NL). Hypocitraturia is characterized by low urinary citrate excretion, which can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones. The study by Rendina et al. highlights the genetic interaction between the SLC13A2 gene and the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene, suggesting that specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes may contribute to the development of hypocitraturia in individuals with recurrent calcium oxalate stones (Rendina2016Evidence).

The research identified that the SLC13A2 GG genotype, in combination with the VDR TT genotype, was more prevalent in hypocitraturic stone formers compared to healthy controls. This suggests a significant epistatic interaction between these genotypes, which may influence the risk of developing hypocitraturia and, consequently, calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis (Rendina2016Evidence). The study emphasizes the role of genetic factors in nephrolithiasis, with SLC13A2 being a candidate locus due to its influence on citrate excretion (Rendina2016Evidence). However, the study's cross-sectional design and lack of validation in diverse populations are noted as limitations.

## Interactions
The SLC13A2 gene encodes the Na+/dicarboxylate cotransporter 1 (NaDC1), which is involved in the transport of dicarboxylates such as succinate and citrate across cell membranes. NaDC1 interacts with the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which modulates its expression and function. This interaction is facilitated by vitamin D response elements (VDREs) in the promoter region of the SLC13A2 gene, indicating that the vitamin D/VDR system plays a crucial role in regulating NaDC1 activity (Rendina2016Evidence).

NaDC1 also interacts with the SLC26A6 protein, an organic anion exchanger. This interaction is mediated by specific residues in the H4c domain of NaDC1, particularly R108, K107, and R112. These residues are essential for maintaining the transport function and facilitating protein-protein interactions with SLC26A6. Mutations in these residues can affect the binding and regulatory interactions with SLC26A6, impacting the transport kinetics of NaDC1 (Khamaysi2020A).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving NaDC1, which are crucial for its role in metabolite transport and its potential involvement in pathophysiological conditions such as nephrolithiasis.
