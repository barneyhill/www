# EMX2

## Overview
The EMX2 gene encodes the empty spiracles homeobox 2 protein, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in embryonic development, particularly within the central nervous system. As a transcription factor, EMX2 is integral to the regulation of gene expression during the development of the telencephalon and other brain regions, influencing processes such as neuroblast proliferation, migration, and differentiation. The protein is also involved in the WNT signaling pathway, affecting morphogenesis and cell differentiation. Beyond its developmental roles, EMX2 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, acting as a tumor suppressor in several cancers and being associated with developmental disorders such as schizencephaly and uterus didelphysis (Falcone2016Emx2as; Liu2015Nonsense; Okamoto2010EMX2).

## Function
The EMX2 gene encodes a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that plays a crucial role in embryonic development, particularly in the central nervous system. It is involved in the large-scale patterning of the rostral central nervous system along the rostro-caudal and dorso-ventral axes, contributing to the specification of the telencephalic prethalamic field and the dorsal telencephalon as the pallium (Falcone2016Emx2as). EMX2 regulates the proliferation and migration of cortical neuroblasts, establishes cell roles and identities within proliferative layers, and maintains position-dependent signals within the developing cortex. It promotes cell cycle progression in early neural precursors and inhibits premature neuronal differentiation, while in more advanced neural stem cells, it halts proliferation and promotes neuronal differentiation (Falcone2016Emx2as).

EMX2 is also linked to the WNT signaling pathway, affecting morphogenesis and cell differentiation during embryogenesis by activating or repressing target genes (Okamoto2010EMX2). It regulates the frequency of symmetric divisions in adult neural stem cells, influencing their proliferation (Okamoto2010EMX2). Additionally, EMX2 controls mammalian reproduction by adjusting endometrial cell proliferation without affecting differentiation (Okamoto2010EMX2).

## Clinical Significance
The EMX2 gene is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In cancer, EMX2 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation, often through promoter hypermethylation, is associated with increased malignancy in various cancers, including lung cancer, gastric cancer, and malignant pleural mesothelioma. In lung cancer, EMX2 suppression leads to increased cell proliferation and activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, contributing to cancer progression (Giroux2014The; Li2012Adenoviral; Okamoto2010EMX2). Restoration of EMX2 expression in these cancers has been shown to suppress tumor growth and enhance sensitivity to chemotherapy (Li2012Adenoviral; Okamoto2010EMX2).

In developmental disorders, EMX2 mutations are linked to schizencephaly, a congenital brain malformation, although such mutations are rare and not a common cause of the condition (Tietjen2007Comprehensive). A nonsense mutation in EMX2 has been associated with uterus didelphysis, a condition characterized by incomplete fusion of the Müllerian ducts, suggesting a role in reproductive tract development (Liu2015Nonsense). These findings highlight the clinical significance of EMX2 in both oncological and developmental contexts.

## Interactions
EMX2, a homeobox transcription factor, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in development and gene regulation. It interacts with Sp8, a zinc-finger transcription factor, which is thought to play a role in neocortical arealization (Groves2019Identification). EMX2 also forms heterodimers with Pbx1 on oligonucleotides containing a consensus binding sequence, indicating a role in skeletal development (Groves2019Identification). 

Through a yeast two-hybrid screen, EMX2 was found to interact with several proteins involved in mRNA metabolism, such as Cnot6l and QkI-7, suggesting roles in post-transcriptional gene expression regulation (Groves2019Identification). The interaction with QkI-7 was confirmed, although pull-down assays indicated that EMX2 might also interact with other QkI isoforms (Groves2019Identification). EMX2's interaction with Cnot6l was confirmed, although it appears weaker compared to its interaction with quaking isoforms (Groves2019Identification).

EMX2 also interacts with eIF4E, a translation initiation factor, outside the nucleus in P-bodies of olfactory sensory neurons, indicating a potential role in translational regulation (Groves2019Identification). These interactions highlight EMX2's involvement in diverse cellular processes beyond its transcriptional regulatory functions.
