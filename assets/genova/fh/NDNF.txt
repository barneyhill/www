# NDNF

## Overview
Neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF) is a gene that encodes a secretory protein involved in various neural and vascular functions. The NDNF protein is characterized by its glycosylation and disulfide-bonded structure, which includes fibronectin type III domains. It plays a critical role as a neurotrophic factor, promoting neuronal growth, migration, and survival, as well as supporting endothelial cell survival and vessel formation. NDNF is also implicated in maintaining cellular adhesion and preventing epithelial-mesenchymal transition, thereby contributing to normal cellular and tissue homeostasis. In the neocortex, NDNF-expressing interneurons are involved in complex interactions with other interneurons, influencing cortical microcircuits and modulating sensory processing and prediction error circuits (Kuang2010Spatiotemporal; Xia2019NDNF; Naumann2024Layerspecific).

## Structure
The neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF) protein is encoded by the human NDNF gene and consists of 568 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 65 kDa (Kuang2010Spatiotemporal). The primary structure includes a signal peptide, indicating its entry into the secretory pathway (Kuang2010Spatiotemporal). The secondary structure of NDNF is predominantly composed of beta-sheets, accounting for about 43% of its structure, with a smaller portion forming alpha-helices, approximately 5% (Kuang2010Spatiotemporal).

NDNF contains two fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains, which are part of a conserved protein family, and a domain of unknown function, referred to as the NDNF domain. This domain partially overlaps with the first FnIII domain and shows additional conservation between the two FnIII domains (Yang2022The). The protein is predicted to be compact and globular, suggesting it is glycosylated and disulfide-bonded, with two potential N-linked glycosylation sites conserved among mammals (Kuang2010Spatiotemporal). NDNF is a secreted protein involved in neural function, with its glycosylation confirmed by Western blot analysis (Kuang2010Spatiotemporal). The protein's tertiary structure is likely stabilized by disulfide bonds, as indicated by the presence of ten cysteines, five of which are conserved from nematodes to humans (Kuang2010Spatiotemporal).

## Function
The Neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF) is a glycosylated, disulfide-bonded secretory protein that contains a fibronectin type III domain. It is primarily known for its role as a neurotrophic factor, promoting neuron migration, growth, survival, and neurite outgrowth. NDNF supports endothelial cell survival and vessel formation, contributing to revascularization through nitric oxide synthase 3-dependent mechanisms (Xia2019NDNF). In healthy human cells, NDNF is involved in maintaining normal cell proliferation and preventing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that, when dysregulated, can lead to cancerous transformations. By influencing EMT markers, NDNF increases the expression of E-cadherin, an epithelial marker, while decreasing N-cadherin and vimentin, which are mesenchymal markers associated with increased invasiveness (Xia2019NDNF). This suggests that NDNF plays a role in maintaining cellular adhesion and structural integrity, thereby inhibiting processes that could lead to tumorigenesis. While the primary focus of studies has been on its role in cancer, these functions imply that NDNF is crucial for normal cellular and tissue homeostasis, particularly in the nervous and vascular systems.

## Interactions
Neuron-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (NDNF) is involved in various interactions within the cortical microcircuits, particularly in layer 1 of the neocortex. NDNF-expressing interneurons engage in presynaptic inhibition of somatostatin-expressing (SOM) interneurons through GABAergic volume transmission. This interaction targets presynaptic GABA B receptors, modulating the outputs of SOM interneurons and introducing a competitive dynamic for dendritic inhibition between NDNF and SOM interneurons (Naumann2024Layerspecific).

NDNF interneurons also interact with parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons, where they can disinhibit excitatory neurons by inhibiting PV interneurons. This disinhibition shifts inhibition from the soma to the apical dendrites of excitatory neurons, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio during sensory stimulation (CohenKashi2021NDNF).

In the context of prediction error circuits, NDNF interneurons modulate the balance of sensory and prediction inputs, influencing the representation of predictions and prediction errors. This modulation is affected by factors such as cholinergic inputs, which can alter the activity of NDNF interneurons and, consequently, the functional flexibility of cortical circuits (Naumann2024Layerspecific).
