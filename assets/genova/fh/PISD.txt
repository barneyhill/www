# PISD

## Overview
The PISD gene encodes the enzyme phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, a crucial component of the inner mitochondrial membrane. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of phosphatidylserine to phosphatidylethanolamine, a key phospholipid involved in maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity and function. Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase is categorized as a decarboxylase enzyme and undergoes an autocatalytic processing event to form a functional heterodimer, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Zhao2019PISDis; Choi2015From). The enzyme's activity is vital for mitochondrial processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain, and its dysfunction can lead to significant mitochondrial and cellular abnormalities (Vance2013Formation; Zhao2019PISDis). Mutations in the PISD gene have been linked to various multisystem disorders, highlighting its importance in human health (Peter2019The; Girisha2018The).

## Structure
The PISD gene encodes the enzyme phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, which is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This enzyme is responsible for converting phosphatidylserine to phosphatidylethanolamine, a crucial lipid for membrane curvature and cellular membrane composition (Zhao2019PISDis). The enzyme undergoes an autocatalytic processing event that generates two subunits, α and β, which are necessary for forming a functional enzyme (Zhao2019PISDis). The pyruvoyl prosthetic group, essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity, is formed through an autoendoproteolytic cleavage of the PSD proenzyme (Choi2015From).

The primary structure of PISD consists of a polypeptide chain encoded by the PISD gene. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which fold into a functional enzyme in its tertiary structure. The enzyme typically forms a homodimer as its quaternary structure (Watanabe2020Structural). The enzyme's activity is influenced by the surrounding lipid composition, with certain phospholipids promoting or inhibiting the autocatalytic cleavage (Di2017Cell). Pathogenic variants in PISD can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, affecting the enzyme's processing and activity (Zhao2019PISDis).

## Function
The PISD gene encodes the enzyme phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, which is crucial for the conversion of phosphatidylserine (PS) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) within the inner mitochondrial membrane. This conversion is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity, as PE is a significant component of mitochondrial membranes, contributing to membrane curvature and stability (Zhao2019PISDis; Girisha2018The). The enzyme's activity is vital for mitochondrial protein homeostasis, affecting processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain (Vance2013Formation; Zhao2019PISDis).

In healthy human cells, PISD ensures proper mitochondrial function by facilitating the production of PE, which is necessary for maintaining the mitochondrial network's structure and function. The enzyme undergoes an autocatalytic processing event to form a functional heterodimer, highlighting its complex regulation (Zhao2019PISDis; Girisha2018The). Disruption of PISD activity can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by altered mitochondrial respiration and fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, underscoring the enzyme's critical role in cellular energy production and overall mitochondrial health (Zhao2019PISDis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PISD gene are associated with several multisystem disorders, primarily affecting the eyes, ears, bones, and brain. One such condition is Liberfarb syndrome, characterized by severe scoliosis, joint laxity, skeletal dysplasia, pigmentary degeneration of the retina, severe sensorineural hearing loss, and moderate developmental delay. Patients with this syndrome often exhibit early-onset retinal degeneration, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, intellectual disability, and skeletal dysplasia. A specific homozygous 10-bp deletion in the PISD gene has been identified, which disrupts normal splicing and leads to the production of aberrant transcripts (Peter2019The).

PISD mutations also result in mitochondrial dysfunction, as seen in patients with skeletal dysplasia, cataracts, and white matter changes. These mutations impair the enzyme's activity, leading to decreased conversion of phosphatidylserine to phosphatidylethanolamine, which is crucial for mitochondrial function. This dysfunction is characterized by fragmented mitochondrial networks, enlarged lysosomes, and decreased maximal oxygen consumption rates (Zhao2019PISDis).

Additionally, a specific variant, c.797G>A [p.(Cys266Tyr)], is linked to spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, a condition marked by large epiphyses and disturbed mitochondrial function (Girisha2018The).
