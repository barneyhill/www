# UNC5A

## Overview
UNC5A is a gene that encodes the unc-5 netrin receptor A, a transmembrane receptor belonging to the UNC5 family of netrin receptors. This receptor plays a crucial role in axon guidance, cell migration, and apoptosis, acting as a dependence receptor that can induce cell death in the absence of its ligand, netrin-1. The protein structure of unc-5 netrin receptor A includes immunoglobulin-like domains and thrombospondin type-1 repeats, which are essential for its interaction with netrin-1 and other cellular components (Lu2015Structural). UNC5A is involved in various cellular processes, including neurite outgrowth and cellular signaling pathways, and has been implicated in tumor suppression, particularly in cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer (Zhu2021UNC5; Ding2020UNC5A). Its expression and function are regulated by factors such as the tumor suppressor p53, linking it to apoptotic pathways and highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Arakawa2010Identification).

## Structure
The UNC5A protein is a member of the UNC5 family of netrin receptors, which are involved in axon guidance and cell migration. The primary structure of UNC5A includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains crucial for its function. These domains include immunoglobulin-like domains and thrombospondin type-1 repeats, which are characteristic of UNC5 family proteins (Lu2015Structural).

The secondary structure of UNC5A likely consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of proteins with immunoglobulin-like domains. The tertiary structure involves the overall three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with netrin-1 and other proteins. The quaternary structure of UNC5A may involve dimerization or multimerization, as studies have shown that UNC5A can form stable dimers and trimers, suggesting potential interactions with other proteins or co-receptors (Picard2009Spatial).

Post-translational modifications of UNC5A, such as phosphorylation, may play a role in its function, although specific details are not provided in the context. Splice variants of UNC5A could result in different isoforms with distinct functions, but specific variants are not detailed in the provided information. Overall, the structural features of UNC5A are integral to its role in neurite outgrowth and cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
UNC5A (unc-5 netrin receptor A) is a dependence receptor that plays a significant role in cell survival, migration, and differentiation in healthy human cells. It is part of the UNC5 receptor family, which interacts with the ligand netrin-1 to mediate these cellular processes. In the presence of netrin-1, UNC5A transmits signals that promote cell survival and are crucial for the development of tissues with branched architecture, such as the nervous system, blood vessels, lungs, pancreas, and mammary glands (Zhu2021UNC5).

UNC5A contains two immunoglobulin-like domains and two thrombospondin type I domains in its extracellular sequence, and a ZU5 domain and a death domain in its intracellular sequence. These structural features enable it to function as a dependence receptor, which can induce apoptosis in the absence of netrin-1, acting as a potential tumor suppressor (Zhu2021UNC5). The receptor's apoptotic function involves caspase cleavage, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating cell death (Bredesen2005Receptors).

UNC5A is also a transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor p53, linking it to p53-dependent apoptotic pathways. This connection underscores its role in apoptosis regulation, particularly in response to DNA damage (Arakawa2010Identification).

## Clinical Significance
UNC5A (unc-5 netrin receptor A) plays a significant role in various cancers, acting primarily as a tumor suppressor. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), UNC5A expression is significantly downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, which can be reversed by demethylation agents like 5-Aza. This downregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its overexpression inhibits these processes, highlighting its tumor suppressive role (Ding2020UNC5A).

In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor-positive subtypes, UNC5A is inducible by estrogen and its low expression correlates with poor outcomes. Its knockdown leads to increased EGFR expression and AKT activity, contributing to aggressive tumor growth and altered ERα signaling (Padua2018Dependence).

In bladder cancer, UNC5A is downregulated, correlating with increased tumor invasiveness. It is inducible by cisplatin in cells with wild-type p53, suggesting a role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Its reexpression inhibits tumor cell survival, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhu2014DNA).

UNC5A's expression and genetic alterations are linked to clinical outcomes in various cancers, including its potential as a prognostic biomarker and immunotherapy target (Zhou2022A).

## Interactions
UNC5A interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It interacts with Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), a key player in the autophagy pathway. This interaction is sensitive to netrin-1, which stabilizes the proximity of DAPK and UNC5A, influencing hepatitis C virus (HCV) propagation by regulating autophagy (Plissonnier2017Reciprocal). UNC5A also interacts with the Fanconi anemia C protein (FANCC), which delays UNC5A-mediated apoptosis. This interaction is crucial for neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth, as both proteins localize to neurite-like structures and are necessary for this process (Huang2018FANCC).

In the context of neurite outgrowth, UNC5A interacts with small GTPases such as Rac1 and Cdc42, which are required for its function in this process. The interaction with netrin-1 is essential, as it induces neurite outgrowth in a netrin-1-dependent manner (Picard2009Spatial). These interactions highlight UNC5A's role in regulating autophagy, apoptosis, and neuronal development through its interactions with various proteins.
