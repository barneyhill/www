# KCNG4

## Overview
The KCNG4 gene encodes the protein potassium voltage-gated channel modifier subfamily G member 4, also known as Kv6.4, which is a member of the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel family. Kv6.4 is categorized as a transmembrane protein and functions as a silent subunit that requires co-assembly with other Kv channel subunits, particularly those of the Kv2 family, to form functional heterotetrameric channels. These channels play a crucial role in modulating the electrical excitability of cells by influencing the activation and inactivation kinetics of the Kv2 channels, thereby affecting current density and voltage dependence. The KCNG4 gene and its encoded protein are implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including male fertility, migraine, multiple sclerosis, and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Regnier2017Targeted; Lacroix2024KCNG4; VilariñoGüell2019Exome).

## Structure
The KCNG4 gene encodes the Kv6.4 protein, a member of the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel superfamily. Kv6.4 is characterized by six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) and a pore loop between S5 and S6, which forms the ion-conducting pathway. The protein does not form functional channels on its own but requires co-expression with Kv2 family members, such as Kv2.1, to form heteromeric channels (Grizel2014Mechanisms; Lacroix2024KCNG4).

The Kv6.4 protein includes a voltage-sensing domain (S1-S4) and a pore domain (S5-S6), with the S4-S5 linker connecting these domains. This linker is crucial for coupling the voltage-sensor domain to the pore domain, facilitating channel opening in response to voltage changes (Grizel2014Mechanisms; Lacroix2024KCNG4). The leucine at position 360 in the S4-S5 linker is highly conserved and plays a significant role in maintaining the alpha-helical structure, which is essential for proper channel function (Lacroix2024KCNG4).

Kv6.4 forms heterotetrameric complexes with Kv2.1 in a 2:2 stoichiometry, influencing the activation and inactivation kinetics of the channels. This interaction modulates the Kv2.1 activity by altering current density and voltage-dependence of inactivation (Shen2016Functional; Lacroix2024KCNG4).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KCNG4 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In multiple sclerosis (MS), two variants, p.Arg474His and p.Arg365His, have been identified. The p.Arg474His variant is associated with an early onset of relapsing-remitting MS with mild disability, while the p.Arg365His variant correlates with a later onset and a primary progressive course with higher disability levels (VilariñoGüell2019Exome). 

In male fertility, the deletion of the Kv6.4 subunit, encoded by KCNG4, in mice results in male sterility due to disrupted spermiogenesis, characterized by oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (Regnier2017Targeted). 

The KCNG4 gene is also implicated in migraine pathology. A specific mutation, Kv6.4-L360P, affects the expression of the KCNB1 gene by preventing the formation of functional Kv2-Kv6 complexes, which may contribute to migraine development (Lacroix2024KCNG4).

Additionally, the KCNG4 gene is upregulated in tumor-associated blood vessels in bladder cancer, suggesting a role in altered angiogenesis in cancer (Biasiotta2016Ion). These findings highlight the gene's potential involvement in various diseases through its impact on ion channel function and regulation.

## Interactions
The KCNG4 gene encodes the Kv6.4 subunit, which is part of the voltage-gated potassium channel family. Kv6.4 is a silent subunit that does not form functional homotetrameric channels on its own due to retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, it can co-assemble with Kv2 subfamily members, such as Kv2.1, to form functional heterotetrameric Kv2/KvS channel complexes. This interaction relieves ER retention and results in channels with distinct biophysical properties compared to Kv2 homotetramers (Bocksteins2012Electrically; Regnier2017Targeted).

The Kv6.4 subunit modulates the properties of Kv2 channels, causing shifts in voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, changes in gating kinetics, and alterations in current density (Regnier2017Targeted). The interaction between Kv2.1 and Kv6.4 involves specific molecular determinants, such as the T1 domain, which facilitates subfamily-specific tetramerization (Regnier2017Targeted). The Kv2.1/Kv6.4 heterotetramers can exist in multiple stoichiometric configurations, typically with a 3:1 or 2:2 stoichiometry, provided that Kv6.4 subunits alternate in the channel complex (Regnier2017Targeted). These interactions are crucial for the functional expression and modulation of Kv2 channel activity.
