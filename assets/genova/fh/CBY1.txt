# CBY1

## Overview
CBY1 is a gene that encodes the protein chibby 1, a crucial component in cellular processes such as ciliogenesis and the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Chibby 1 is characterized as a small, conserved protein with a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which facilitates its interaction with other proteins involved in ciliary function and membrane remodeling (Cyge2021Loss; Li2016BAR). As a β-catenin antagonist, chibby 1 plays a significant role in modulating β-catenin's transcriptional activity, thereby influencing cell proliferation and differentiation (Li2008Chibby). The protein's interactions with various partners, such as FAM92A, FAM92B, and DZIP1, underscore its involvement in both ciliogenesis and signaling pathways (Guo2021DZIP1; Li2016BAR). Mutations in the CBY1 gene have been linked to ciliopathies and other disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Epting2020Loss; Cyge2021Loss).

## Structure
CBY1, also known as chibby 1, is a small, conserved protein characterized by a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which is essential for its interactions with other proteins involved in ciliogenesis (Cyge2021Loss; Li2016BAR). This coiled-coil domain facilitates the binding of CBY1 to various proteins, including FAM92A and FAM92B, which contain BAR domains known for lipid-binding and membrane curvature generation (Li2016BAR). The interaction between CBY1 and these proteins is mediated by the BAR domains, which are sufficient for binding and are involved in membrane remodeling processes essential for ciliogenesis (Li2016BAR).

CBY1 also interacts with DZIP1, with specific interaction motifs identified between amino acids 485 to 612 of DZIP1, suggesting a complex formation that may sequester β-catenin (Guo2021DZIP1). The protein can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and stability. CBY1 exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, allowing for functional diversity. The structural organization of CBY1, particularly its coiled-coil domain, is crucial for its role in ciliary protein trafficking and the regulation of β-catenin signaling (Lee2014Cby1).

## Function
The CBY1 gene encodes the Chibby1 protein, which plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, in healthy human cells. Chibby1 localizes to the distal end of the mother centriole, a key component of the centrosome, and is essential for the recruitment of proteins such as ARL13B and AHI1, which are critical for ciliary function (Epting2020Loss; Lee2014Cby1). It interacts with proteins like Cenexin and CEP164 to facilitate the assembly of ciliary membranes and the docking of basal bodies to the plasma membrane, which is vital for the extension of the axoneme and the growth of the ciliary membrane (Steere2012A; Cyge2021Loss).

Chibby1 also acts as an antagonist to β-catenin, a key player in the Wnt signaling pathway, by binding to it and inhibiting its transcriptional activity. This interaction is important for regulating β-catenin's subcellular distribution and signaling activity, thereby maintaining normal cellular signaling and preventing hyperactivation of the Wnt pathway (Li2008Chibby). The protein's role in these processes is crucial for various cellular functions, including cell proliferation and differentiation, and its dysfunction can lead to ciliopathies and other disorders (Lee2014Cby1; Epting2020Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CBY1 gene are associated with a range of ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome (JBTS). JBTS is characterized by symptoms such as cerebellar ataxia, developmental delays, and polydactyly. Studies have identified biallelic loss-of-function variants in CBY1 in patients presenting with these features, suggesting that CBY1 dysfunction is a rare cause of ciliopathy (Epting2020Loss). Zebrafish models with CBY1 depletion exhibit ciliopathy-related phenotypes, including reduced Hedgehog signaling, which is often implicated in JBTS (Epting2020Loss).

CBY1 mutations also have implications in pancreatic health. In mice, the loss of CBY1 leads to exocrine pancreatic degeneration and pancreatitis, characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and ductal hyperplasia. This is associated with altered signaling pathways, such as down-regulation of Hedgehog signaling and up-regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Cyge2021Loss).

CBY1 interacts with DZIP1 in cardiac valve development, and mutations affecting this interaction can lead to mitral valve prolapse (MVP). These mutations result in increased β-catenin signaling, contributing to myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve (Guo2021DZIP1). The disruption of the DZIP1-CBY1-β-catenin complex is linked to changes in extracellular matrix remodeling, further implicating CBY1 in cardiac valve pathologies (Guo2021DZIP1).

## Interactions
CBY1 (chibby 1) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function as a β-catenin antagonist. It interacts with 14-3-3σ, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, which are adapter proteins that bind to phosphorylated motifs of client proteins. This interaction is crucial for the nuclear export of β-catenin, thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity (Mancini20151433). The binding of CBY1 to 14-3-3σ is modulated by phosphorylation events mediated by kinases such as AKT and JNK, which affect CBY1's stability and localization (Mancini20151433).

CBY1 also interacts with FAM92A and FAM92B proteins, which contain BAR domains. These interactions are important for ciliogenesis, as CBY1 and FAM92 proteins colocalize at centrioles/basal bodies, facilitating membrane remodeling processes essential for cilia formation (Li2016BAR). The interaction between CBY1 and FAM92 proteins involves both the N-terminal region and the C-terminal coiled-coil motif of CBY1, and is selective, as other BAR domain proteins do not bind to CBY1 (Li2016BAR).

Additionally, CBY1 interacts with Ahi1 at the centriole-cilium interface, promoting its recruitment to the transition zone, which is critical for proper cilium formation and function (Lee2014Cby1). These interactions highlight CBY1's role in both Wnt signaling and ciliogenesis.
