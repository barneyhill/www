# TRIM44

## Overview
TRIM44 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 44, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family. Unlike typical TRIM proteins, TRIM44 lacks the RING-finger domain associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, instead featuring a zinc-finger ubiquitin binding domain (ZF-UBP) that confers deubiquitinating functions (Yamada2020TRIM44; Chen2018TRIM44). This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy, protein stabilization, and cancer progression, by modulating the ubiquitination status of target proteins (Wang2024TRIM44; Zhang2022TRIM44). TRIM44's interactions with other proteins, such as BRCA1 and TLR4, further underscore its role in DNA repair and signaling pathways that influence tumor progression and resistance to therapies (Zhang2022TRIM44; Wei2019TRIM44). The gene's expression and activity have been linked to the prognosis of various cancers, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Yamada2020TRIM44; Kawabata2017TRIM44).

## Structure
TRIM44 is an atypical member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, characterized by the absence of the RING-finger domain typically associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Instead, TRIM44 contains a zinc-finger ubiquitin binding domain (ZF-UBP) at its N-terminus, which is common in ubiquitin-specific proteases and is crucial for its deubiquitinating function (Yamada2020TRIM44; Chen2018TRIM44). This domain is involved in the deubiquitination of proteins such as SQSTM1 and HIF-1α, stabilizing them by reducing their polyubiquitination (Wang2024TRIM44; Chen2018TRIM44).

The protein also includes a B-box (BB) domain and a coiled-coil (CC) domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and oligomerization (Wang2024TRIM44). The ZF-BB tandem domain is particularly important for reducing polyubiquitination of target proteins (Chen2018TRIM44). TRIM44's structure allows it to function similarly to ubiquitin-specific proteases, contributing to its role in various cellular processes, including autophagy and stabilization of proteins involved in cancer progression (Wang2024TRIM44; Zhang2022TRIM44).

TRIM44 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, which may influence its function and stability, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the available literature (He2024TRIM44).

## Clinical Significance
TRIM44 has been implicated in the progression and prognosis of several cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, high TRIM44 immunoreactivity is associated with poor prognosis, higher nuclear grade, and increased proliferative activity. TRIM44 promotes cell proliferation and migration by modulating gene expression and activating the NF-κB pathway. Its gene locus is frequently amplified in epithelial cancers, including breast cancer, correlating with poorer outcomes (Kawabata2017TRIM44). In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), TRIM44 overexpression is linked to advanced clinical stages and lymphatic invasion. It promotes RCC progression by inhibiting the tumor suppressor gene FRK, and its overexpression is a significant risk factor for cancer-specific mortality (Yamada2020TRIM44). In prostate cancer, TRIM44 is upregulated and its knockdown reduces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This effect is mediated through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, suggesting TRIM44's role in cancer progression (Tan2017Knockdown). In colorectal cancer, TRIM44 enhances NF-κB and CXCR4 expression, promoting cancer cell migration and invasion, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Kou2020The). These findings highlight TRIM44's significant role in cancer progression and its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
TRIM44 is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), TRIM44 interacts with BRCA1 and filamin A (FLNA) to promote cisplatin resistance. TRIM44 enhances BRCA1-mediated homologous recombination repair, which is crucial for DNA damage repair, by stabilizing FLNA through deubiquitination. This interaction prevents FLNA degradation, thereby supporting BRCA1's function in DNA repair (Zhang2022TRIM44).

In multiple myeloma (MM), TRIM44 stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) by deubiquitination, which is essential for MM cell survival in hypoxic conditions. This stabilization is achieved by reducing K48-linked polyubiquitination of HIF-1α, thereby extending its half-life and enhancing the expression of downstream genes (Chen2018TRIM44).

TRIM44 also plays a role in melanoma progression by interacting with TOLL-like receptor 4 (TLR4). It stabilizes TLR4, leading to the activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor progression (Wei2019TRIM44).

Additionally, TRIM44 is involved in autophagy regulation by promoting the oligomerization of sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1) in response to oxidative stress. This interaction enhances the cytoprotective activity of NFE2L2, a transcription factor involved in the oxidative stress response (Wang2024TRIM44).
