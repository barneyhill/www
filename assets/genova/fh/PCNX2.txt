# PCNX2

## Overview
PCNX2 is a gene that encodes the pecanex 2 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes. Pecanex 2 is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a role in intracellular signaling pathways and cellular communication. The gene is expressed in multiple tissues and has been associated with several diseases, including COVID-19, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and multiple system atrophy. Genetic variations and expression levels of PCNX2 have been linked to disease severity and progression, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for clinical outcomes (Ren2021Identification; Chen2016Characterization; Fan2022Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
The PCNX2 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its genetic variations and altered expression levels. In the context of COVID-19, a genome-wide association study identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the PCNX2 gene, specifically rs1033323, which is associated with the severity of the disease in a Chinese population. This suggests that genetic variations in PCNX2 may influence the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (Fan2022Genomewide).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), PCNX2 is one of the top genes showing a strong positive correlation with TRIM46, a gene linked to poor survival outcomes. Higher expression levels of PCNX2 are associated with advanced stages of ccRCC and poorer overall survival, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Ren2021Identification).

Additionally, PCNX2 has been identified as a gene producing multiple circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the context of multiple system atrophy (MSA), a neurodegenerative disease. Although the specific clinical significance of PCNX2 in MSA is not detailed, its involvement in circRNA production suggests a potential role in neurological conditions (Chen2016Characterization).
