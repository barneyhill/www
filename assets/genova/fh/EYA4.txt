# EYA4

## Overview
EYA4 is a gene that encodes the EYA transcriptional coactivator and phosphatase 4, a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. The EYA4 protein is categorized as a transcriptional coactivator and tyrosine phosphatase, playing a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. It is characterized by a conserved C-terminal Eya domain, essential for its phosphatase activity, and an N-terminal transactivation domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions crucial for developmental processes (Morín2020Insights; Borsani1999EYA4). EYA4 is involved in the regulation of mitosis through its interaction with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and influences gene regulation and cellular differentiation by interacting with transcription factors such as SIX1 and SIX3 (Nelson2024The; Abe2009EYA4). Mutations in the EYA4 gene are linked to autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss and have been implicated in other conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy and certain cancers, underscoring its importance in both auditory and systemic health (Morín2020Insights; Ahmadmehrabi2021Genomefirst).

## Structure
The EYA4 protein is characterized by a conserved C-terminal Eya domain, which is crucial for its phosphatase activity and is shared among the EYA family proteins (Morín2020Insights; Borsani1999EYA4). This domain consists of 271 amino acids and is involved in protein-protein interactions essential for developmental processes (Borsani1999EYA4). The EYA4 protein also contains an N-terminal transactivation domain, which includes a variable region with transactivating function and a Neuronal helix-loop-helix transcription factor domain (Morín2020Insights; Nelson2024The).

EYA4 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may affect its function and interactions. Three major transcript forms have been identified, with variations affecting the conserved C-terminal domain and leading to different protein isoforms (Borsani1999EYA4). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its interactions and activity. For instance, phosphorylation of serine residue S128 within the N-terminal domain influences its interaction with PLK1, a key player in mitotic processes (Nelson2024The). The EYA4 protein's structure and modifications are integral to its role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes.

## Function
The EYA4 gene encodes a protein that functions as both a transcriptional coactivator and a tyrosine phosphatase, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, EYA4 is involved in the regulation of mitosis by interacting with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), an essential mitotic kinase. EYA4 dephosphorylates PLK1 at the tyrosine residue pY445 during the G2 phase of the cell cycle, which is critical for PLK1 activation and subsequent processes such as centrosome maturation, spindle formation, and mitotic progression (Nelson2024The). This dephosphorylation enhances PLK1's interaction with activation complexes, promoting mitotic entry and ensuring accurate mitosis (Nelson2024The).

EYA4 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it interacts with transcription factors like SIX1 and SIX3, influencing gene regulation and cellular differentiation (Zhang2004A; Abe2009EYA4). The protein's phosphatase activity is essential for preventing mitotic defects and cell death, highlighting its role in maintaining proper cell cycle regulation and mitotic function (Nelson2024The). EYA4's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in cell biology and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EYA4 gene are primarily associated with autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL), specifically the DFNA10 subtype. These mutations include frameshift, nonsense, missense, and splice-altering variants, which can lead to progressive hearing loss, often beginning in early childhood and extending into adulthood (Morín2020Insights; Shinagawa2020Prevalence). The hearing loss is typically characterized by a 'cookie bite' audiogram pattern, affecting mid and high frequencies (Hildebrand2007A).

EYA4 mutations have also been linked to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in some cases, suggesting a pleiotropic effect where the gene influences both auditory and cardiac phenotypes (Morín2020Insights; Ahmadmehrabi2021Genomefirst). The gene's expression in cardiac tissue, particularly in conduction cells, is associated with conditions such as Mobitz Type II AV block (Ahmadmehrabi2021Genomefirst).

Alterations in EYA4 expression have been implicated in cancer progression, including breast and colorectal cancers, due to its role in cell proliferation and survival pathways (Zambrano2023Identification). The gene's involvement in these diverse conditions highlights its significance in both auditory and systemic health.

## Interactions
EYA4, a member of the EYA family of proteins, participates in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes. EYA4 interacts with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a key player in cell cycle regulation, particularly during the G2 phase. This interaction is mediated by a conserved PDS motif within EYA4, involving the phosphorylation of serine 128 (S128). The interaction is crucial for PLK1 activation, as EYA4 dephosphorylates PLK1 at the pY445 site, supporting mitotic progression and preventing mitotic cell death (Nelson2024The).

EYA4 also interacts with the transcription factor SIX3, forming a complex that regulates gene expression. This interaction is essential for EYA4's recruitment to the nucleus, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy studies. The EYA domain is critical for binding with SIX3, and this interaction is implicated in developmental processes such as holoprosencephaly (Abe2009EYA4).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, EYA4 interacts with the NF-κB/RAP1 signaling pathway. It acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting RAP1 transactivation, mediated by NF-κB, through its serine/threonine phosphatase activity. This interaction results in the repression of NF-κB activity and RAP1 expression, highlighting EYA4's role in cancer biology (Mo2018EYA4).
