# OR10G9

## Overview
The OR10G9 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily G member 9, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a critical role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Yin2020Functional). The OR10G9 protein is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, and is expressed in the olfactory epithelium. It shares significant structural homology with other olfactory receptors, such as OR10G7 and OR10G4, which suggests a conserved mechanism of action within this receptor subfamily (Veithen2017High). Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR10G9 is implicated in broader physiological processes, including neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions and pathways related to cancer, highlighting its potential impact on cellular communication and signaling (Yin2020Functional).

## Function
The OR10G9 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Yin2020Functional). OR10G9, along with its closely related paralogs OR10G7 and OR10G4, shares up to 95% homology in their transmembrane domains and loops, indicating a high degree of structural similarity. This receptor responds to compounds with a short hydrophobic substituent in the para position, although its selectivity is narrower compared to OR10G7 (Veithen2017High).

The olfactory receptors, including OR10G9, are involved in broader biological pathways such as GPCR signaling, which is essential for various physiological processes beyond olfaction. These processes include roles in neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions and pathways related to cancer (Yin2020Functional). The involvement of OR10G9 in these pathways suggests its potential impact on cellular communication and signaling, contributing to the organism's ability to perceive and respond to environmental stimuli.

## Clinical Significance
The OR10G9 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through mutations and alterations in its expression. In breast cancer, OR10G9 is one of several olfactory receptor genes found to be differentially hypomethylated, which is associated with transcriptional activation and may contribute to cancer progression (Fessahaye2021Breast). This hypomethylation suggests a potential role in tumorigenesis, warranting further investigation into its impact on hormone function and interactions with other genes (Fessahaye2021Breast).

In the context of schizophrenia, OR10G9 has been identified as having likely pathogenic variants shared among Sudanese families, suggesting a potential link between these variants and the disorder. The gene is involved in pathways such as GPCR signaling and synaptic pathways, which are relevant to brain function and schizophrenia (Saeed2023Smell).

In lung adenocarcinoma, a missense mutation in the OR10G9 protein, specifically a K3N mutation, has been observed in invasive adenocarcinoma samples. This mutation may cause structural changes in the protein, potentially affecting its function and contributing to the development of pulmonary nodules (Dong2021Mutational).

Additionally, OR10G9 has been associated with emergent mutations in post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy samples of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, particularly in cases resistant to platinum-based treatments (Marchocki2022Impact).
