# MIB2

## Overview
MIB2, or Mindbomb E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2, is a gene that encodes the MIB E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2, a multi-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, primarily through its role in ubiquitination, a post-translational modification that tags proteins for degradation or functional modulation. MIB2 is characterized by its structural domains, including MIB/HERC2, zinc finger, ankyrin repeat, and RING finger domains, which are essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity (Stempin2011The; Piccolo2016MIB2variants). Functionally, MIB2 is involved in critical signaling pathways such as NF-κB and Notch, influencing immune responses, cell survival, and developmental processes (Stempin2011The; Koo2005Mind). Clinically, mutations in the MIB2 gene have been associated with conditions like left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy and Ménétrier-like gastropathy, highlighting its significance in cardiac and gastric health (Piccolo2016MIB2variants). Additionally, MIB2's role in cancer progression, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Kong2023MIB2).

## Structure
The MIB2 protein is a multi-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in protein ubiquitination. It contains several key structural domains, including two MIB/HERC2 domains, a zinc finger domain, multiple ankyrin repeat domains, and two C-terminal RING finger domains, which are crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity (Stempin2011The; Piccolo2016MIB2variants). The RING finger domains are particularly important for the protein's function, as they facilitate the formation of K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, essential for protein degradation and function (Stempin2011The).

The ankyrin repeats in MIB2 are involved in protein-protein interactions and are critical for its structural integrity and function. Mutations in these repeats can lead to significant phenotypic changes, indicating their essential role in maintaining protein stability (Piccolo2016MIB2variants; Domsch2017Identification). MIB2 also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may affect its activity and interactions (Piccolo2016MIB2variants).

MIB2 has multiple splice variants, resulting in different isoforms that may influence its function and interactions with other proteins (Piccolo2016MIB2variants). The protein's 3D structure has not been fully determined, but some models suggest similarities to known structures, such as ankyrin repeat proteins and RING domains (Piccolo2016MIB2variants).

## Function
MIB2 (MIB E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in the regulation of immune response signaling pathways, particularly through its involvement in the activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor crucial for immune responses and cell survival. MIB2 is a component of the BCL10 signaling complex, where it promotes the ubiquitination of IKKγ/NEMO and the recruitment and activation of TAK1, leading to NF-κB activation. This process is essential for the regulation of genes associated with cell survival and inflammation (Stempin2011The).

MIB2 is also involved in the Notch signaling pathway, where it ubiquitinates Notch ligands such as Delta, facilitating their endocytosis and subsequent signaling. This activity is crucial for various developmental processes, including cell differentiation and communication (Koo2005Mind). MIB2's ubiquitin ligase activity is mediated through its RING finger domains, which are essential for its function in ubiquitination processes (Koo2005Mind).

In healthy human cells, MIB2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing pathways that are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper immune function (Stempin2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MIB2 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) and Ménétrier-like gastropathy. The MIB2 variants p.V742G and p.V984L are associated with LVNC, a cardiac disorder characterized by hypertrabeculation of the left ventricle. These mutations lead to altered NOTCH signaling, which is crucial for cardiac development and function. The p.V742G variant is linked to reduced auto-ubiquitination activity, suggesting decreased ubiquitin ligase activity, while the p.V984L variant is unstable and rapidly degraded by the proteasome (Piccolo2016MIB2variants).

In addition to cardiac implications, MIB2 mutations are associated with a gastropathy resembling Ménétrier disease, a premalignant gastric disorder. The p.V742G variant has been found to segregate with this condition in affected families, indicating its potential role in gastric hypertrophy through disrupted NOTCH signaling (Piccolo2016MIB2variants).

Alterations in MIB2 expression levels have also been linked to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where MIB2 promotes cancer progression by regulating cell cycle control pathways. Overexpression of MIB2 enhances cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, while its knockdown reduces these abilities (Kong2023MIB2).

## Interactions
MIB2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence multiple cellular pathways. It interacts with deubiquitylases such as Usp1, Usp5, Usp9, and Trabid, which are part of the ubiquitin proteasome system, suggesting a role in regulating the Notch signaling pathway (Tseng2014New). MIB2 also interacts with the hypoxia-inducible factor 1, alpha subunit inhibitor (Fih-1), indicating a potential regulatory role in hypoxia signaling (Tseng2014New).

MIB2 is known to ubiquitylate cFLIP L, a protein involved in apoptosis regulation, by attaching K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are associated with protein degradation and signal transduction (Nakabayashi2021MIND). This interaction is crucial for suppressing apoptosis induced by TNF/BV6 and TNF/CHX, as it prevents the proper oligomer formation of caspase 8, thereby inhibiting its activation (Nakabayashi2021MIND).

In the context of cellular trafficking, MIB2 interacts with endocytic adaptor proteins like EPS15 and Epsin-2-like, which may help form endocytotic structures or regulate endocytosis directly (Tseng2014New). MIB2 also interacts with components of the NF-κB signaling pathway, such as IKKα and IKKγ, promoting their ubiquitination and influencing NF-κB promoter activity (Li2020Mib2).
