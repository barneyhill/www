# ZNF334

## Overview
ZNF334 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 334, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its role as a transcription factor. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Yang2022Targeted). ZNF334 is expressed in several cell types, including CD4+ lymphocytes, where its expression is modulated by cytokines like TNFα, suggesting a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Henc2015The). The gene has garnered attention for its potential involvement in immune responses and its implications in cancer, where alterations in its expression and promoter methylation have been linked to tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Sun2022DNA; Yang2023Targeted).

## Function
ZNF334, a zinc finger protein, is involved in transcriptional regulation within healthy human cells. It functions primarily in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and influences gene expression. This protein is part of a large family of transcription factors that play roles in various biological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Yang2022Targeted). In CD4+ lymphocytes, ZNF334 expression is modulated by the cytokine TNFα, which acts as a homeostat to normalize its expression levels across individuals. This suggests a potential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Henc2015The).

The exact biological role of ZNF334 in healthy cells is not fully elucidated, but it is suggested to have a significant role in immune response, as its expression increases with anti-CD3 stimulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Henc2015The). The protein's involvement in regulating gene expression related to cell proliferation hints at its importance in cellular processes, although further research is needed to fully understand its functions in healthy human cells (Henc2015The).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF334 has been implicated in several cancers due to alterations in its expression and promoter methylation. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZNF334 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is often inhibited by hypermethylation of its promoter, which is associated with decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation of liver cancer cells. Clinically, lower ZNF334 expression correlates with poorer patient outcomes, including reduced overall survival and relapse-free survival (Sun2022DNA). 

In colorectal cancer (CRC), ZNF334 is significantly downregulated, particularly in early-stage tumors, due to promoter hypermethylation. This downregulation is linked to increased tumor proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Treatment with demethylation agents has been shown to restore ZNF334 expression and inhibit CRC cell growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yang2023Targeted).

ZNF334 is also downregulated in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), where its reduced expression is associated with lymph node metastasis. The gene's expression is altered under conditions of cellular senescence, which may contribute to cancer progression and metastasis (Khashei2024Implications). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZNF334 in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.
