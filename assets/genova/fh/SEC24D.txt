# SEC24D

## Overview
SEC24D is a gene that encodes the protein SEC24 homolog D, a component of the COPII coat complex involved in intracellular transport. This protein plays a critical role in the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus, a process essential for proper protein folding, modification, and secretion. As a part of the COPII vesicle assembly, SEC24D is involved in sorting cargo molecules and facilitating their transport by deforming the lipid bilayer at ER exit sites. The protein is particularly important in the context of cellular activation and signaling pathways, including the activation of hepatic stellate cells. Mutations in SEC24D are associated with various skeletal disorders, such as osteogenesis imperfecta and Cole-Carpenter syndrome-2, due to impaired protein transport and secretion (Garbes2015Mutations; Tomoishi2017CREB3L2mediated; Miao2022Case).

## Function
The SEC24D gene encodes a component of the COPII coat complex, which is crucial for the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. This process is essential for the proper folding, modification, and secretion of proteins, including procollagen, a precursor to collagen necessary for bone strength and structure (Garbes2015Mutations). SEC24D plays a significant role in sorting cargo molecules through direct or indirect interactions during COPII vesicle assembly, facilitating the transport of cargo by deforming the lipid bilayer into buds at ER exit sites and completing vesicle scission (Garbes2015Mutations).

In healthy human cells, SEC24D is involved in intracellular transport processes, particularly in the context of cellular activation and signaling pathways. It is required for the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), as its knockdown reduces the expression of α-SMA, a marker of HSC activation (Tomoishi2017CREB3L2mediated). The protein is active in the ER-Golgi transport, which is necessary for various cellular functions, including the activation of specific cell types like HSCs (Tomoishi2017CREB3L2mediated). The proper function of SEC24D is critical for maintaining normal skeletal development and function, as defects in this process can lead to conditions such as osteogenesis imperfecta (Garbes2015Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SEC24D gene are associated with a syndromic form of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a condition characterized by brittle bones and skeletal abnormalities. This form of OI is linked to compound heterozygous mutations in SEC24D, which result in craniofacial malformations similar to those seen in cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia (CLSD) (Garbes2015Mutations; Lu2020Consequences). The mutations lead to inefficient export of procollagen from the endoplasmic reticulum, causing its retention and resulting in skeletal defects (Garbes2015Mutations).

In zebrafish, mutations in sec24d, known as bulldog mutations, cause severe craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities due to disrupted secretion of cartilage matrix proteins (Sarmah2010Sec24D-Dependent). These mutations lead to increased collagen biosynthesis and endoplasmic reticulum stress in chondrocytes (Lu2020Consequences).

In humans, SEC24D mutations have also been linked to Cole-Carpenter syndrome-2, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal skeletal development, low bone mass, and recurrent fractures (Miao2022Case). Alterations in SEC24D expression levels have been observed in breast cancer, where high expression is associated with worse relapse-free survival, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker (Liu2019Analysis).

## Interactions
SEC24D, a component of the COPII coat complex, plays a crucial role in the sorting and packaging of cargo proteins into vesicles for transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. It interacts with various proteins, including SNARE proteins, which are essential for vesicle fusion. SEC24D specifically binds to the IxM SNARE-sorting motif in Syntaxin5, a Q-SNARE protein, facilitating its packaging into COPII vesicles. Mutations in SEC24D, such as S1016F, can severely impair this interaction, affecting the packaging of other Q-SNAREs like Bet1 and GS27, indicating that these SNAREs are recruited as a complex (Adolf2018Proteomic).

SEC24D also interacts with neurotransmitter transporters, such as noradrenaline, glycine, and GABA transporters, and other proteins like the potassium channel Kv1.3 and the GPCR ER exit regulator CNIH4. These interactions are influenced by specific sequence motifs, such as the R-I/L motif, which is specific to Sec24C/D (Chatterjee2021A).

Additionally, SEC24D is involved in the sorting of proteins like ERGIC1 and the SM protein SCFD1, which binds the ER-to-Golgi Q-SNARE complex before its packaging into COPII vesicles (Adolf2018Proteomic).
