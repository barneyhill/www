# EVI2B

## Overview
The EVI2B gene encodes the ecotropic viral integration site 2B protein, a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly within the hematopoietic system. This protein is characterized by its structural features, including a signal peptide, a hydrophilic extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain, which suggest its role in cell signaling and interaction (Cawthon1991cDNA). EVI2B is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells, where it is essential for granulocytic differentiation and the maintenance of hematopoietic progenitor cell functions. It is a direct target of the C/EBPα transcription factor, underscoring its importance in myeloid lineage development (Zjablovskaja2017EVI2B). Clinically, EVI2B has been implicated in various conditions, including acute myeloid leukemia and osteosarcoma, where its expression levels serve as potential prognostic biomarkers (Zjablovskaja2017EVI2B; Dai2023EVI2B). Additionally, its expression in metastatic melanoma is associated with favorable prognostic outcomes, highlighting its potential role in immune response modulation (Yonekura2021EVI2B).

## Structure
The EVI2B gene encodes a protein with a predicted length of 448 amino acids. The primary structure includes an N-terminal signal peptide, which is likely cleaved after the serine residue at position 21, indicating the protein is directed to the secretory pathway (Cawthon1991cDNA). The protein features a 181-residue hydrophilic extracellular domain with four potential N-glycosylation sites, suggesting it undergoes glycosylation, a common post-translational modification (Cawthon1991cDNA). A single transmembrane domain is present, characterized by a 24-residue hydrophobic segment, indicating the protein spans the cell membrane (Cawthon1991cDNA). The C-terminal domain is hydrophilic and cytoplasmic, also containing four potential N-glycosylation sites (Cawthon1991cDNA).

The protein is notably proline-rich, containing 47 proline residues, including several proline doublets and stretches of consecutive prolines, which may influence the protein's structural conformation (Cawthon1991cDNA). There are six cysteine residues, one in the signal peptide and five in the C-terminal domain, which could form disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's stability (Cawthon1991cDNA). The EVI2B protein does not contain structural motifs characteristic of known oncogenes (Cawthon1991cDNA).

## Function
The EVI2B gene encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a significant role in hematopoiesis, particularly in granulocytic differentiation and the functionality of hematopoietic progenitors. It is a direct target of the C/EBPα transcription factor, which is essential for myeloid differentiation. EVI2B is abundantly expressed on the surface of primary hematopoietic cells, with the highest levels found in mature granulocytes. Its expression is crucial for proper myeloid lineage development, as downregulation of EVI2B impairs granulocytic differentiation and alters progenitor functions, partly due to deregulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis (Zjablovskaja2017EVI2B).

EVI2B is also involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and survival of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), maintaining their functional properties. In knockout models, EVI2B deficiency affects the repopulating ability of HSPCs, indicating its importance in bone marrow transplantation and recovery (Zjablovskaja2017EVI2B). Despite its critical role in hematopoiesis, EVI2B expression is also abundant in lymphoid cells, suggesting that other transcription factors might regulate its expression in these cells (Zjablovskaja2017EVI2B).

## Clinical Significance
The EVI2B gene, also known as CD361, is implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression or interactions. In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), EVI2B is downregulated in patient samples with defects in the CEBPA gene, which is crucial for granulocytic differentiation. This downregulation is associated with differentiation arrest, a hallmark of AML (Zjablovskaja2017EVI2B). 

EVI2B is also considered a prognostic biomarker in osteosarcoma, where it is significantly upregulated. Its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration, particularly monocytes and macrophages, suggesting a role in the tumor's immune microenvironment (Dai2023EVI2B). 

In metastatic melanoma, higher EVI2B expression is linked to a favorable prognosis, associated with increased infiltration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, including CD8+ T cells. This expression pattern is correlated with better overall survival and may predict responses to immune checkpoint therapies (Yonekura2021EVI2B). 

Despite its location within the NF1 gene, no direct mutations in EVI2B have been linked to neurofibromatosis type 1, although its proximity to viral integration sites suggests a potential role in tumorigenesis (Cawthon1991cDNA).
