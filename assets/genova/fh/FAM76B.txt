# FAM76B

## Overview
FAM76B is a gene that encodes a protein known as family with sequence similarity 76 member B, which is primarily localized in nuclear speckles. This protein is involved in the regulation of inflammation, particularly through the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway. FAM76B plays a crucial role in modulating the translocation of the hnRNPA2B1 protein, which is significant for mRNA binding and splicing, thereby influencing inflammatory responses (Wang2022FAM76B). Additionally, FAM76B is implicated in macrophage polarization by stabilizing PIK3CD mRNA, a component of the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway, which is essential for maintaining the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotypes (Wang2024FAM76B). The protein's interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids suggest broader roles in RNA processing and gene expression regulation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases (Wang2024FAM76B).

## Function
The FAM76B gene encodes a nuclear speckle-localized protein involved in regulating inflammation through the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway. In healthy human cells, FAM76B plays a critical role in modulating the translocation of the hnRNPA2B1 protein, which is involved in mRNA binding and splicing. FAM76B binds to hnRNPA2B1 in the nucleus, preventing its translocation to the cytoplasm and thereby inhibiting NF-κB-mediated inflammation (Wang2022FAM76B). This regulatory mechanism is significant in controlling systemic and neuroinflammation, particularly in the brain and spleen, where FAM76B expression is highest (Wang2022FAM76B).

FAM76B also influences macrophage polarization by stabilizing PIK3CD mRNA, which is part of the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway. This stabilization is crucial for maintaining the balance between pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage phenotypes, thereby impacting inflammatory responses in tissues (Wang2024FAM76B). The protein's nuclear localization and association with RNA splicing complexes suggest broader roles in RNA processing and gene expression regulation (Wang2024FAM76B).

## Clinical Significance
FAM76B has been implicated in several inflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions due to its role in modulating inflammatory pathways. Alterations in FAM76B expression or function can lead to increased inflammation, particularly through the NF-κB-mediated pathway. In traumatic brain injury (TBI) and neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP), FAM76B is involved in regulating neuroinflammation by affecting the translocation of hnRNPA2B1, a protein associated with mRNA processing. Its deficiency is linked to increased microglial activation and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, suggesting a protective role against excessive inflammation in these conditions (Wang2022FAM76B).

In the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), FAM76B influences macrophage polarization by stabilizing PIK3CD mRNA, which is crucial for the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway. Knockout studies have shown that loss of FAM76B exacerbates colitis symptoms, indicating its potential protective role against IBD by inhibiting pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization (Wang2024FAM76B). These findings suggest that FAM76B could be a target for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating inflammation in various diseases.

## Interactions
FAM76B is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the hnRNPA2B1 protein, a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein involved in mRNA binding and splicing. This interaction is significant in regulating the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway. FAM76B binds to hnRNPA2B1, affecting its localization by keeping it in the nucleus under normal conditions. When FAM76B expression is reduced, hnRNPA2B1 translocates to the cytoplasm, leading to increased NF-κB-mediated inflammation (Wang2022FAM76B).

FAM76B also interacts with PIK3CD mRNA, which encodes the catalytic subunit p110δ of PI3K. This interaction is crucial for regulating the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway, particularly in the context of M1 macrophage polarization. FAM76B binds to PIK3CD mRNA, influencing its stability and thereby affecting the expression of proteins involved in this pathway. The interaction was confirmed through RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq) and other experimental approaches (Wang2024FAM76B).

These interactions suggest that FAM76B plays a role in modulating inflammation and macrophage polarization through its influence on protein and mRNA interactions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.
