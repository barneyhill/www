# YWHAH

## Overview
The YWHAH gene encodes the 14-3-3 eta protein, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, which is involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. This protein is categorized as an adapter protein, facilitating interactions between various signaling molecules by binding to phosphorylated serine/threonine residues on target proteins. The 14-3-3 eta protein is particularly significant in neuronal physiology, where it plays a protective role against apoptosis by interacting with pro-apoptotic factors. It is highly expressed in brain tissue and cochlear cells, contributing to cellular integrity and function. Dysregulation of the YWHAH gene has been linked to several pathological conditions, including hearing loss, cancer, and neurological disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Eisa2019YWHA; Buret2016Loss; De2020The).

## Function
The YWHAH gene encodes the 14-3-3 eta protein, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, 14-3-3 eta functions by binding to phosphorylated serine/threonine residues on target proteins, thereby influencing their activity, stability, and localization within the cell (De2020The). This protein is particularly important in neuron physiology, where it helps inhibit apoptosis by retaining pro-apoptotic factors such as Bad or Bax in the cytoplasm, preventing them from initiating cell death pathways (Buret2016Loss).

The 14-3-3 eta protein is highly expressed in brain tissue and is involved in maintaining cellular integrity and function, particularly in neurons and cochlear cells. It plays a significant role in protecting cochlear outer hair cells from apoptosis, which is crucial for auditory function (Buret2016Loss). The protein's interaction with pro-apoptotic proteins like Bad is essential for cell survival, as it prevents these proteins from promoting apoptosis, thereby maintaining cell viability (Buret2016Loss). The YWHAH gene's dysfunction can lead to increased susceptibility to apoptosis, highlighting its importance in cellular survival mechanisms (Buret2016Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the YWHAH gene, which encodes the 14-3-3 eta protein, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of auditory physiology, loss of function mutations in YWHAH are associated with hearing loss and degeneration of cochlear outer hair cells, particularly affecting high-frequency hearing. This is due to increased apoptosis mediated by the pro-apoptotic protein Bad, as the mutated 14-3-3 eta protein fails to bind and retain Bad in the cytoplasm, allowing it to promote apoptosis in the mitochondria (Buret2016Loss).

YWHAH is also involved in cancer, where its expression and interactions can influence tumor progression. In neuroblastoma, YWHAH acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway. However, its expression is downregulated by METTL14-mediated m6A methylation, which promotes tumor growth (Wang2024METTL14). In other cancers, such as large B-cell lymphoma and papillary thyroid cancer, YWHAH may act as a tumor promoter (Wang2024METTL14).

Additionally, YWHAH is implicated in neurological disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder, although specific details about its role in these conditions are less clear (Torrico2020Involvement).

## Interactions
YWHAH, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with multiple Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) proteins, suggesting a role in the virus's pathogenic mechanisms, particularly in neuroinflammation (Liu2023YWHAH). In the context of gastric cancer, YWHAH interacts with the transcription factor Fra-1, positively regulating its expression. This interaction activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, promoting gastric cancer cell proliferation (HE2023YWHAH).

In mouse oogenesis, YWHAH interacts with CDC25B phosphatase, a key regulator of oocyte maturation. This interaction is confirmed through Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) analysis and in situ proximity ligation assays, indicating a strong protein-protein interaction (Eisa2019YWHA). Despite these interactions, the absence of YWHAH does not affect oocyte development or release from meiotic arrest, suggesting that while YWHAH interacts with CDC25B, it may not be essential for normal oocyte maturation (Eisa2019YWHA).

YWHAH also interacts with PIG-2, a protein overexpressed in various human cancers. This interaction, identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by GST pull-down assays, may play a role in cancer-related intracellular processes (Namkoong2006The).
