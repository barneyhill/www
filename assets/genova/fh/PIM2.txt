# PIM2

## Overview
PIM2 is a gene that encodes the Pim-2 proto-oncogene, a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis regulation. The Pim-2 protein is part of the Pim kinase family, which also includes Pim1 and Pim3, and is characterized by its ability to phosphorylate target proteins, thereby modulating their activity. This kinase is particularly significant in hematopoietic cells, where it influences cell cycle progression and immune response modulation. PIM2 is known for its role in the regulation of the mTORC1 pathway and its interactions with other signaling pathways, such as NF-κB and AKT/mTOR, which are crucial for cell survival and proliferation. The overexpression of PIM2 has been implicated in various hematological malignancies, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (GómezAbad2011PIM2; Fox2003The; KapelkoSlowik2016ElevatedPIM2gene).

## Structure
The PIM2 protein is a serine/threonine kinase that shares significant structural similarities with other members of the Pim family, such as Pim1 and Pim3. The primary structure of PIM2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a protein with 334 amino acids, as deduced from its open reading frame (Baytel1998The). The protein is characterized by the presence of 12 conserved sub-domains typical of the active site of serine/threonine kinases, including a conserved lysine residue at position 199, which is crucial for its kinase activity (Baytel1998The).

While specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of PIM2 are not provided, it is implied that PIM2 shares structural features with Pim1, which includes N-terminal antiparallel β sheets and C-terminal α helices connected by a hinge region important for adenosine binding (Zhukova2011Pim). PIM2 is known to produce three protein isoforms through translation from alternative initiator codons, which may affect its function or localization (Zhukova2011Pim). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell survival and proliferation, and is implicated in the regulation of the mTORC1 pathway through phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (GómezAbad2011PIM2).

## Function
PIM2 is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating cell survival and apoptosis in healthy human cells. It is transcriptionally regulated and acts as an apoptotic inhibitor, primarily in response to growth factors such as interleukin-3 (IL-3) (Fox2003The). PIM2 maintains cell survival by phosphorylating proapoptotic proteins, such as the translational inhibitor 4E-BP1 and the BH3 protein BAD, which are crucial for cell survival and growth (Fox2003The). This phosphorylation activity is resistant to rapamycin, indicating that PIM2 functions independently of the TOR pathway (Fox2003The).

PIM2 is involved in maintaining mitochondrial potential and promoting glucose uptake, which is essential for cell survival in the absence of cytokines (Fox2003The). It operates through a mechanism distinct from the PI3K/Akt pathway, as it does not significantly affect Akt's expression or activity (Fox2003The). PIM2's kinase activity is essential for its antiapoptotic function, providing resistance to apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal and other stimuli (Fox2003The).

In terms of cellular localization, PIM2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell cycle progression and inhibits pro-apoptotic factors, contributing to hematopoietic cell development and immune response modulation (Fox2003The).

## Clinical Significance
The PIM2 gene, encoding a serine/threonine kinase, is implicated in several hematological malignancies due to its role in promoting cell survival and resistance to apoptosis. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), overexpression of PIM2 is associated with poor prognosis, including lower complete remission rates and shorter leukemia-free and event-free survival. This overexpression correlates with high-risk cytogenetics and resistance to induction therapy, suggesting a role in chemotherapy resistance through mechanisms like the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and P-glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux (KapelkoSlowik2016ElevatedPIM2gene).

In B-cell lymphomas, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), PIM2 overexpression is linked to aggressive clinical outcomes, particularly in the activated B-like subtype. The gene's expression is associated with key survival pathways, including NF-κB and JAK-STAT, and its inhibition has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy (GómezAbad2011PIM2). PIM2's role in these malignancies highlights its potential as a prognostic marker and a target for therapeutic intervention (GómezAbad2011PIM2; Hammerman2004Lymphocyte).

## Interactions
PIM2, a serine/threonine kinase, engages in various interactions with other proteins that influence cell survival and proliferation. It interacts with tristetraprolin (TTP), a protein involved in mRNA stability, in breast cancer cells. PIM2 decreases TTP protein levels through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which leads to the derepression of TTP-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation and migration, promoting tumor growth (Ren2018PIM2). PIM2 also phosphorylates Cot, a kinase that activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), thereby enhancing NF-κB activity and promoting T-cell survival (Hammerman2004Lymphocyte).

In acute myeloid leukemia, PIM2 is associated with the activation of NF-κB signaling, which is crucial for cell survival. It interacts with the AKT/mTOR pathway, regulating downstream elements like 4E-BP1 and BAD, inactivating their proapoptotic functions (KapelkoSlowik2016ElevatedPIM2gene). PIM2 phosphorylates the cell cycle inhibitor p21 Cip1/WAF1 on Thr145, enhancing its stability and inhibiting cell proliferation (Wang2010Pim-2). Additionally, PIM2 phosphorylates eIF4B at Ser406, a process that is specific to PIM2 and not shared by other kinases like AKT1 (Peng2006Pim). These interactions highlight PIM2's role in modulating various signaling pathways and cellular processes.
