# HOXB4

## Overview
The HOXB4 gene is a member of the homeobox gene family, which encodes the homeobox B4 protein, a transcription factor characterized by its homeodomain. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), influencing their expansion, self-renewal, and differentiation. As a transcription factor, homeobox B4 modulates the expression of various genes by binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby impacting critical cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. The gene's expression is tightly regulated and is particularly significant in the context of hematopoiesis, where it is expressed in CD34-positive human cell populations and downregulated upon differentiation. HOXB4's interactions with other proteins, such as PBX1, and its involvement in signaling pathways like FGF, underscore its complex role in cellular function and its potential implications in oncogenesis and stem cell therapy (Schiedlmeier2007HOXB4’s; Krosl1998Cellular; Bowles2006HOXB4).

## Function
The HOXB4 gene encodes a homeodomain transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). It is involved in the expansion and self-renewal of these cells by modulating various signaling pathways, including cytokine, Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, FGF, TGF-β/Activin/BMP, and TNF-α signaling, which are crucial for the self-renewal, differentiation, and survival of adult HSCs (Schiedlmeier2007HOXB4’s). HOXB4 acts as a transcription factor that can either activate or repress gene expression depending on the cellular context, influencing processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle, apoptosis, and response to stress (Schiedlmeier2007HOXB4’s).

In human hematopoietic progenitor cells, HOXB4 is identified as a positive regulator of primitive growth activity, enhancing the growth of stem and progenitor cells without affecting differentiation (Buske2002Deregulated). It is expressed in CD34-positive human cell populations enriched for HSCs and is downregulated upon differentiation into committed hematopoietic progenitors (Bowles2006HOXB4). HOXB4 also interacts with the FGF signaling pathway, where its inhibition enhances the expansion of HOXB4-expressing HSCs, suggesting its role in modulating extrinsic signaling pathways to achieve specific biological outcomes (Schiedlmeier2007HOXB4’s).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HOXB4 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In ovarian cancer, high levels of HOXB4 expression are associated with poor prognosis, shorter overall survival, and progression-free survival times. HOXB4 promotes malignant progression by enhancing cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, partly through the activation of the transcriptional target DHDDS and the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers such as Snail and Zeb1 (Li2020HOXB4). 

In cervical cancer, HOXB4 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation is linked to increased tumor progression, as it normally inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumorigenesis. Overexpression of HOXB4 in cervical cancer cells leads to decreased β-catenin and c-Myc expression, reducing tumor growth and proliferation (Lei2021HOXB4).

In the context of stem cell gene therapy, overexpression of HOXB4 has been associated with a high incidence of leukemia in large animal models. This is due to its role in promoting stem cell self-renewal and inhibiting differentiation, which can lead to leukemogenesis (Zhang2008High).

## Interactions
HOXB4 interacts with PBX1 proteins, significantly influencing its transforming capacity. The interaction enhances DNA binding specificity for target sequences, crucial for HOXB4's transforming activity. Mutations in HOXB4 that disrupt its interaction with PBX1 or its DNA binding ability significantly reduce its transforming potential. A tetrapeptide region and a homeodomain within HOXB4 are essential for its interaction with PBX1 and DNA, respectively. The presence of PBX1 enhances tumor growth induced by HOXB4, as evidenced by larger tumors in mice injected with cells overexpressing both HOXB4 and PBX1 compared to those with HOXB4 alone (Krosl1998Cellular).

HOXB4 also interacts with Prep1 and 4EHP, which inhibit the translation of Hoxb4 mRNA. Prep1 binds specifically to the 3'UTR of Hoxb4 mRNA, and this interaction is enhanced by 4EHP. The Prep1-4EHP complex sequesters the target mRNA, inhibiting its translation, which is significant for oocyte growth and development (Villaescusa2009Cytoplasmic).

CDX2 regulates HOXB4 gene expression by binding to its enhancer in intestinal epithelial cells. This interaction is confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, indicating a physical interaction between CDX2 and the HOXB4 enhancer, influencing its expression (Jørgensen2016HOXB4).
