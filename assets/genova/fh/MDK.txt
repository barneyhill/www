# MDK

## Overview
The MDK gene encodes the midkine protein, a heparin-binding growth factor involved in a variety of biological processes, including development, repair, and immune response. Midkine is characterized by its structure, which includes two main domains connected by a hinge region, and is known for its role in promoting cell growth and survival, particularly in neural and endothelial cells (Iwasaki1997Solution; Muramatsu2014Structure). The protein is implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes, such as embryogenesis, tissue repair, and cancer progression, due to its interactions with various cellular receptors and signaling pathways (Xia2022Midkine; Muramatsu2014Structure). Overexpression of midkine is associated with several cancers and inflammatory diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Filippou2019Midkine; Neumaier2023The).

## Structure
Midkine (MDK) is a heparin-binding growth factor with a molecular weight of 13 kDa, composed of 121 amino acids. The protein is structured into two main domains: the N-domain (amino acids 15-52) and the C-domain (amino acids 62-104), connected by a hinge region (amino acids 53-61) (Muramatsu2014Structure). Both domains consist of antiparallel β-sheets and are stabilized by disulfide bridges, with the N-domain having three and the C-domain having two (Muramatsu2014Structure; Singh2012Recombinant). The C-domain is particularly significant for heparin-binding activity and contains a flexible loop with a heparin-binding consensus sequence (Iwasaki1997Solution).

The tertiary structure of MDK is characterized by the relative independence of its two domains, with no specific interactions between them (Muramatsu2014Structure). The active form of MDK is a dimer, which enhances its biological activity, particularly in endothelial and neuronal cells (Iwasaki1997Solution). MDK undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are common for proteins of its class (Singh2012Recombinant).

The MDK gene produces multiple mRNA isoforms due to alternative splicing, resulting in different protein variants with potentially distinct functions (Muramatsu2014Structure). These structural features and modifications are crucial for MDK's role in development, repair, and disease processes.

## Function
Midkine (MDK) is a heparin-binding growth factor involved in various biological processes, including development, repair, and immune response. During embryogenesis, MDK is strongly expressed, particularly in the mid-gestation period, and plays roles in neurogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, and mesoderm remodeling (Muramatsu2014Structure). It enhances the growth and survival of neural precursor cells and promotes the survival, migration, and neurite outgrowth of embryonic neurons (Muramatsu2014Structure). In epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, MDK is more strongly expressed in epithelial tissues and plays a central role in the interactions between endothelial and smooth muscle cells (Muramatsu2014Structure).

In adults, MDK expression is limited to specific sites such as the kidney, gut, epidermis, bronchial epithelium, lymphocytes, and macrophages, but is induced in many tissues following injury (Muramatsu2014Structure). MDK is crucial for follicular maturation in the ovary, promoting the maturation of oocytes and subsequent fertilization (Muramatsu2014Structure). It also influences mesoderm remodeling by stimulating adipocyte differentiation, chondrogenesis, osteoclast differentiation, and promoting osteoblast differentiation while suppressing their proliferation (Muramatsu2014Structure). MDK's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal physiological functions and its potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Clinical Significance
The MDK gene, encoding the midkine protein, is significantly implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. Overexpression of MDK is observed in numerous cancers, including prostatic, hepatocellular, gastric, pancreatic, breast, and melanoma cancers, where it promotes tumor growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance (Filippou2019Midkine; Neumaier2023The). In glioblastoma, MDK is associated with poor prognosis and interacts with glioma initiating cells, potentially contributing to tumor initiation (Neumaier2023The). 

MDK also plays a role in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. It is a significant regulator in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory bowel diseases, where it promotes inflammation by inducing cytokine release and recruiting immune cells (Neumaier2023The). In the central nervous system, MDK is involved in neuroinflammation and immune cell migration following injuries, such as traumatic brain injury and cerebral infarcts, influencing both reparative and pathological processes (Neumaier2023The).

MDK's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential as a therapeutic target. Strategies to inhibit MDK, such as using antibodies, siRNAs, and small molecule inhibitors, are being explored to suppress tumor growth and overcome chemoresistance (Neumaier2023The; Filippou2019Midkine).

## Interactions
Midkine (MDK) is known to participate in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. MDK interacts with the LKB1-STRAD-Mo25 complex, which is crucial for the activation of AMPK, a key energy sensor in cells. MDK binds to LKB1 and STRADα, but not Mo25a, suggesting that it disrupts the LKB1-STRAD-Mo25 complex, thereby inhibiting AMPK activation (Xia2022Midkine). This interaction is significant in cancer progression, as MDK expression is upregulated in various cancers and correlates with poor prognosis (Xia2022Midkine).

MDK also interacts with integrins, specifically α4β1- and α6β1-integrins, which serve as functional receptors. These interactions are involved in cell migration and signaling, as evidenced by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin upon MDK binding to α4β1-integrins (Muramatsu2004α4β1). MDK forms complexes with LRP6 and PTPζ, which are involved in MK-dependent migration of osteoblastic cells and embryonic neurons (Muramatsu2004α4β1).

Additionally, MDK binds to the receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPζ/RPTPβ, with high-affinity binding influenced by specific amino acid residues and glycosaminoglycans (Maeda1999A). These interactions highlight MDK's role in modulating various cellular processes through its diverse protein interactions.
