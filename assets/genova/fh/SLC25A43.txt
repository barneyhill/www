# SLC25A43

## Overview
SLC25A43 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 43, which is part of the mitochondrial carrier family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in the transport of various molecules across the inner mitochondrial membrane, playing a crucial role in cellular metabolism and energy production. The SLC25A43 protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter, and its function is essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function. Research has shown that alterations in the expression of SLC25A43 can have significant implications for cancer biology, particularly in the context of drug resistance and tumor suppression (GABRIELSON2013The; Tina2012The).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC25A43 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in relation to cancer. In HER2-positive breast cancer, SLC25A43 is frequently deleted, with a deletion observed in 80% of cases. This deletion is associated with a lower S-phase fraction in tumors with low or no expression of SLC25A43, suggesting a potential role in cell proliferation and tumor suppression (Tina2012The). The gene's deletion has also been noted in other cancers, including cervical and lung cancer, indicating a broader relevance in oncogenesis (Tina2012The).

Alterations in SLC25A43 expression affect drug efficacy in breast cancer treatment. Knockdown of SLC25A43 in breast cancer cell lines reduces the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel and diminishes the inhibitory effect of trastuzumab on cell proliferation, suggesting a role in drug resistance (GABRIELSON2013The). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in mitochondrial function and its potential impact on cancer cell metabolism and treatment response. The exact mechanisms by which SLC25A43 influences these processes remain an area of active research (GABRIELSON2013The).
