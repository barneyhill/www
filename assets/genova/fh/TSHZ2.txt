# TSHZ2

## Overview
The TSHZ2 gene encodes the teashirt zinc finger homeobox 2 protein, a nuclear transcriptional repressor involved in various cellular processes, including gene regulation and cell cycle control. This protein is characterized by its zinc-finger domains, homeobox domain, and coiled-coil domain, which facilitate its interaction with other proteins and nucleic acids. TSHZ2 plays a crucial role in maintaining normal cellular functions by forming complexes with transcriptional corepressors such as CtBP2 and transcription factors like GLI1, thereby preventing the activation of target genes implicated in tumorigenesis (Riku2015Downregulation; Uribe2021TSHZ2). The gene's expression is regulated by the EGF receptor pathway, and its downregulation is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, highlighting its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Uribe2021TSHZ2). Additionally, TSHZ2 interacts with proteins involved in mitosis and spindle organization, suggesting its involvement in maintaining genomic stability (Uribe2021TSHZ2).

## Structure
TSHZ2 is a nuclear protein characterized by its molecular structure, which includes four zinc-finger (ZF) domains, a homeobox domain, and a coiled-coil domain (Riku2015Downregulation). The protein's subcellular localization is influenced by a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) located between the first and second ZF domains, specifically the sequence 245-RKKDKLRPTSYSKPRKR, which is crucial for its nuclear accumulation (Riku2015Downregulation). TSHZ2 also contains a putative CtBP-interaction motif (CIM) at 764-PIDLT, which is involved in its function as a CtBP-dependent transcriptional repressor (Riku2015Downregulation).

The protein interacts with several other proteins, including PRC1, KIF4A, and ACTN1, which are associated with mitosis and spindle organization (Uribe2021TSHZ2). TSHZ2 is localized to the nucleus and is associated with heterochromatin, as indicated by its colocalization with HP1a (Uribe2021TSHZ2). The interaction between TSHZ2 and CtBP2 is essential for its role in suppressing the activation of certain promoters, such as the thymidine kinase minimal promoter (Riku2015Downregulation). The protein's role as a transcriptional repressor is further supported by its ability to form a ternary complex with CtBP2 and GLI1, a transcription factor in the Hedgehog signaling pathway (Riku2015Downregulation).

## Function
The TSHZ2 gene encodes a nuclear protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor in healthy human cells, particularly within the mammary gland duct epithelium. TSHZ2 contains zinc-finger domains, a homeobox domain, and a coiled-coil domain, which facilitate its role in gene regulation. It is characterized by a bipartite nuclear localization signal, ensuring its accumulation in the nucleus where it exerts its repressive functions (Riku2015Downregulation).

In normal cells, TSHZ2 forms a complex with the transcriptional corepressor CtBP2 and the transcription factor GLI1, sequestering GLI1 in the nucleus and preventing the activation of its target genes, such as AEBP1 and CXCR4. This repression is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing tumorigenesis (Riku2015Downregulation; Uribe2021TSHZ2). TSHZ2 also interacts with proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and cytokinesis, such as PRC1, KIF4A, and ACTN1, suggesting a role in regulating mitosis and maintaining genomic stability (Uribe2021TSHZ2).

The gene's expression is regulated by the EGF receptor pathway, and its down-regulation is associated with shorter patient survival in breast cancer, indicating its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Uribe2021TSHZ2).

## Clinical Significance
The TSHZ2 gene has been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer, where its expression is often downregulated. This downregulation is frequently due to promoter hypermethylation, which suppresses TSHZ2 expression despite the amplification of its locus on chromosome 20q13.2 (Uribe2021TSHZ2). In breast cancer, low expression of TSHZ2 correlates with increased cell motility and invasion, critical factors for cancer metastasis (Uribe2021TSHZ2). The gene acts as a tumor suppressor by interacting with the cytokinesis regulator PRC1, inhibiting metastasis through increased inhibitory phosphorylation and decreased transcription of PRC1 (Uribe2021TSHZ2).

TSHZ2's role as a tumor suppressor is further supported by its ability to bind and inactivate oncoproteins, contributing to growth arrest and tumor suppression (Uribe2021TSHZ2). In breast cancer models, overexpression of TSHZ2 has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its potential in inhibiting metastasis (Uribe2021TSHZ2). The gene's downregulation is associated with shorter survival in breast cancer patients, indicating its clinical significance in cancer prognosis (Uribe2021TSHZ2). Additionally, TSHZ2 is downregulated in prostate cancer, suggesting a broader role in carcinogenesis (Yamamoto2011Rare).

## Interactions
TSHZ2, a zinc-finger homeobox protein, participates in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. TSHZ2 functions as a transcriptional repressor in conjunction with the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), forming a complex that includes GLI1, a transcription factor in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. This complex confines GLI1 in the nucleus, suppressing its transcriptional activity. The down-regulation of TSHZ2 releases GLI1, allowing it to activate target genes such as AEBP1 and CXCR4, which are implicated in breast cancer progression (Riku2015Downregulation).

TSHZ2 also interacts with the cytokinesis regulator PRC1, inhibiting its transcription and activity. This interaction is crucial for TSHZ2's role as a tumor suppressor, as PRC1 is involved in microtubule bundling and cell cycle regulation. TSHZ2's binding to PRC1 is confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, highlighting its role in inhibiting metastasis (Uribe2021TSHZ2).

Additionally, TSHZ2 forms complexes with other proteins involved in spindle assembly and mitosis, such as KIF4A and ACTN1. These interactions suggest a role for TSHZ2 in regulating cell cycle progression and maintaining spindle architecture during cell division (Uribe2021TSHZ2).
