T cells; it is involved in the regulation of T-cell functions, including those of effector CD8+ T cells. In addition, this protein can also promote the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into T regulatory cells. PDCD1 is expressed in many types of tumors including melanomas, and has demonstrated to play a role in anti-tumor immunity. Moreover, this protein has been shown to be involved in safeguarding against autoimmunity, however, it can also contribute to the inhibition of effective anti-tumor and anti-microbial immunity.
