# TMEM241

## Overview
TMEM241 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 241, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is hypothesized to be involved in cellular transport processes, potentially functioning as a sugar transport protein, and is phylogenetically related to the SLC35 family of solute carriers (Gyimesi2022Systematic; Liu2022Circular). Although the precise function of TMEM241 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, it is expressed at low levels across various tissues, including the liver (Krasnov2020Human). Additionally, a circular RNA derived from TMEM241, known as circTmem241, has been identified to play a significant role in immune regulation, particularly in the differentiation of group III innate lymphoid cells, which are crucial for gut homeostasis and antibacterial immunity (Liu2022Circular). TMEM241 has also been implicated in clinical contexts, such as acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, where it is significantly over-expressed, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression (Pelleri2014Integrated).

## Function
The specific function of TMEM241 in healthy human cells remains largely unknown. However, TMEM241 is a transmembrane protein that is predicted to be involved in cellular transport processes, potentially acting as a sugar transport protein (Liu2022Circular). Phylogenetic analysis suggests that TMEM241 is closely related to the SLC35 family of solute carriers, particularly clustering with SLC35D proteins, and shows similarity to the TC# 2.A.7.13 subfamily, which includes Golgi GDP-mannose:GMP antiporters from plants and yeast (Gyimesi2022Systematic). Despite its unclear function, TMEM241 is expressed in various tissues, including liver tissue and HepG2 cells, although at low levels (Krasnov2020Human). 

In the context of immune function, the circular RNA derived from TMEM241, known as circTmem241, plays a significant role in the differentiation of group III innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) by regulating the transcription of the Elk3 gene. This process is crucial for maintaining gut homeostasis and antibacterial immunity, suggesting that TMEM241 may have indirect roles in immune regulation through its circular RNA form (Liu2022Circular). However, the direct molecular activities of TMEM241 in healthy human cells require further investigation.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM241 has been implicated in several clinical contexts due to its altered expression levels. In acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), TMEM241 is significantly over-expressed, with a 59-fold increase in Down syndrome (DS) AMKL cells and a 156-fold increase in non-DS AMKL cells compared to normal megakaryocytes. This suggests TMEM241 as a potential marker for disease progression in AMKL, particularly in children with DS (Pelleri2014Integrated). The gene also shows a 126-fold over-expression in transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) cells, which can precede AMKL in DS children, indicating its role in early disease stages (Pelleri2014Integrated).

In the context of immune function, the circular RNA derived from TMEM241, known as circTmem241, plays a crucial role in the differentiation of group III innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s). Deficiency in circTmem241 impairs ILC3 differentiation, leading to reduced antibacterial immunity and increased susceptibility to infections (Liu2022Circular). This highlights the potential impact of TMEM241 expression alterations on immune responses, particularly in gut-associated lymphoid tissues (Liu2022Circular).
