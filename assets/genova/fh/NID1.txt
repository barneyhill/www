# NID1

## Overview
NID1 is a gene that encodes the protein nidogen 1, a critical component of the basement membrane, which is a specialized structure within the extracellular matrix. Nidogen 1 is categorized as an extracellular matrix protein and is characterized by its modular structure, which includes three globular domains that facilitate interactions with other basement membrane components such as laminin and collagen IV. These interactions are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the basement membrane, influencing processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and tissue stability. Nidogen 1 also plays significant roles in neural development and pancreatic β-cell function, highlighting its importance in various physiological contexts (HO2008Nidogens—Extracellular; Patel2014Structural). The NID1 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including familial non-medullary thyroid carcinoma and Dandy-Walker spectrum disorders, underscoring its relevance in human health and disease (de2022Identification; Darbro2013Mutations).

## Structure
Nidogen-1, encoded by the NID1 gene, is a key component of the basement membrane, characterized by a modular structure comprising three globular domains: G1, G2, and G3. These domains are connected by linker segments, with a 10 nm segment between G1 and G2 and a 15 nm rod-like segment between G2 and G3 (HO2008Nidogens—Extracellular; Patel2014Structural). The primary structure of nidogen-1 includes approximately 1217 amino acid residues, with a signal peptide and several EGF-like repeats, which are involved in separating the globular domains (Mann1989Amino).

The secondary structure of nidogen-1 features EGF-like repeats and other motifs that contribute to its stability and function (Mann1989Amino). The tertiary structure forms an elongated molecule with a characteristic curve near the center, as revealed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies (Patel2014Structural). The quaternary structure involves specific interactions with laminin γ-1, forming a 248 kDa heterocomplex, primarily through the G3 domain (Patel2014Structural).

Post-translational modifications of nidogen-1 include glycosylation, which is common in basement membrane proteins, and potential calcium-binding sites within the EGF-like repeats (HO2008Nidogens—Extracellular; Mann1989Amino). These structural features enable nidogen-1 to interact with various basement membrane components, such as laminin and collagen IV, playing a crucial role in maintaining basement membrane integrity (Mann1989Amino).

## Function
NID1, encoding nidogen 1, is a crucial component of the basement membrane, a specialized extracellular matrix that provides structural support and regulates cellular functions. Nidogen 1 interacts with laminin and collagen type IV, forming a bridge that stabilizes the basement membrane architecture and maintains tissue integrity (Dong2002Neurologic; Fox1991Recombinant). This protein is involved in cell adhesion, spreading, and motility by interacting with integrin receptors on the cell surface, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues (Dong2002Neurologic).

In the nervous system, nidogen 1 is secreted by astrocytes and radial glia, providing a substrate for neuronal migration and supporting Schwann cell proliferation and myelin production in the peripheral nervous system (Kuan2021Human). It plays a role in neural development, influencing brain capillary formation, cortical development, and neural network excitability (Kuan2021Human).

Nidogen 1 also has protective and stimulative effects on pancreatic β-cells, enhancing their function and survival under stress conditions like hypoxia. It signals through integrin αvβ3 and activates the MAPK pathway, which is involved in cell survival and function (Zbinden2020Nidogen‐1). These interactions highlight nidogen 1's role in supporting cellular organization and stability across various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NID1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In familial non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (FNMTC), a specific missense variant, p.Ile657Met, in the NID1 gene has been identified as a potential susceptibility factor. This variant is associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and is linked to more aggressive disease phenotypes, including a higher likelihood of relapse and metastasis (de2022Identification).

NID1 mutations are also associated with Dandy-Walker spectrum disorders, including autosomal dominant Dandy-Walker malformation and occipital cephaloceles (ADDWOC). These mutations disrupt interactions with extracellular matrix proteins, leading to developmental anomalies (Darbro2013Mutations; McNiven2019NID1).

In the context of melanoma, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the NID1 gene, such as rs3768080 and rs10754833, have been linked to altered melanoma risk. These SNPs may influence NID1 expression and its interactions, potentially affecting melanoma susceptibility (Nan2011Genomewide).

Additionally, NID1 expression is upregulated in Hirschsprung's disease, where it is regulated by microRNAs miR-192 and miR-215. This upregulation affects cell migration and proliferation, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Zhu2015Nidogen‐1).

## Interactions
Nidogen-1 (NID1) is a key extracellular matrix protein that participates in various interactions crucial for basement membrane stability and function. It forms high-affinity complexes with laminin, specifically binding to the laminin γ1 chain through its G3 domain. This interaction is mediated by the laminin γ1 EGF-like repeat (LE) III4, which fits into the G3 domain's amphitheater-like surface (HO2008Nidogens—Extracellular). Nidogen-1 also binds to collagen IV, with the binding site located on the G2 domain, distinct from the laminin-binding region, facilitating the formation of ternary complexes with laminin and collagen IV (Fox1991Recombinant).

Nidogen-1 interacts with the basement membrane proteoglycan perlecan, primarily through its G2 domain, with the third immunoglobulin module (IG3) in perlecan's domain VI being the major binding site (HO2008Nidogens—Extracellular). It also binds to fibulin-1 and fibulin-2, but not with endostatin or tropoelastin, which are binding partners of nidogen-2 (HO2008Nidogens—Extracellular).

Nidogen-1 has been identified as a ligand for the NKp44 activating receptor, where it can inhibit NKp44-mediated activation of natural killer cells, affecting cytokine release (Gaggero2018Nidogen1). It also interacts with integrin αvβ3, which is crucial for its effects on cardiomyocytes and β-cells, activating the MAPK pathway (Zbinden2020Nidogen‐1).
