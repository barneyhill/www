# CCN6

## Overview
CCN6, also known as WISP3, is a gene that encodes the protein cellular communication network factor 6, a member of the CCN family of matricellular proteins. These proteins are characterized by their involvement in cell signaling and communication, playing crucial roles in various biological processes. The CCN6 protein is distinguished by its unique structural features, including a multimodular architecture with domains such as the insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) domain and the von Willebrand factor type C repeat (VWC) domain. Functionally, CCN6 is involved in modulating growth factor signaling pathways, particularly acting as an antagonist to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and Wnt proteins, which are essential for embryonic development and cellular differentiation. The protein's role extends to maintaining cartilage integrity and influencing skeletal health, with mutations in the CCN6 gene linked to progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia, a disorder affecting joint and skeletal function (Chen2009Functions; Schütze2007CYR61CCN1; Sheth2021Case).

## Structure
CCN6, also known as WISP3, is a member of the CCN family of proteins, characterized by a multimodular structure. The primary structure of CCN6 includes a series of cysteine residues, although it lacks four cysteines in the second module compared to other CCN proteins, which typically have 38 cysteine residues forming 17 disulfide bonds (Planque2003A; Krupska2015Eyeing). The protein consists of four conserved domains: an insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) domain, a von Willebrand factor type C repeat (VWC) domain, a thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSP-1) domain, and a carboxyl-terminal (CT) domain with a cysteine knot motif (Perbal2013CCN; Krupska2015Eyeing).

The secondary structure of CCN6 is unique among CCN proteins, as it contains only α-helix structures in its variable region, unlike other members that have β-sheets and β-turns (Planque2003A). This structural difference may influence its function. The tertiary structure is influenced by the flexibility and rigidity provided by the linker regions between domains, with the IGFBP and CT domains positioned in opposite directions (Krupska2015Eyeing). The quaternary structure involves dimerization and heparin binding, particularly in the CT domain, although specific details for CCN6 are not provided (Krupska2015Eyeing).

## Function
CCN6, also known as WISP3, is a matricellular protein that plays a significant role in cellular communication and signaling. It is involved in various molecular processes, including the modulation of growth factor signaling pathways. CCN6 interacts with growth factors such as BMPs and Wnt proteins, where it acts as an antagonist, inhibiting BMP signaling and Wnt signaling during embryonic development (Chen2009Functions). This regulatory function is crucial for proper embryonic development and cellular differentiation.

In the context of cartilage integrity, CCN6 is essential for maintaining healthy cartilage by stimulating the expression and activity of collagen type II, aggrecan, and superoxide dismutase in chondrocytes. This activity is vital for cartilage health and is linked to conditions like progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia when mutated (Schütze2007CYR61CCN1). CCN6 also acts as a chemoattractive ligand for human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), influencing their migration through the integrin receptor ανß5, which is important for skeletal development and repair (Schütze2007CYR61CCN1).

CCN6's role in healthy human cells is underscored by its involvement in skeletal health, as evidenced by its association with skeletal diseases when mutated, indicating its importance in maintaining skeletal integrity (Chen2009Functions).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCN6 gene are primarily associated with progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPRD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by joint deformities, stiffness, and gait disturbances. PPRD is caused by biallelic mutations in the CCN6 gene, which lead to cartilage degradation and loss due to the abnormal function of the CCN6 protein, a crucial component of the extracellular matrix involved in maintaining cartilage integrity (Sheth2021Case; Alkhaldi2023Progressive). 

In the Indian population, specific variants such as c.298T>A (p.Cys100Ser) have been identified, particularly in the Patni community, suggesting a link to endogamous practices (Sheth2021Case). In the Chinese population, a unique mutation spectrum has been observed, with certain variants like c.624dupA associated with later onset and more extensive joint involvement (Wang2023Unique).

CCN6 mutations also impact mitochondrial function, disrupting mitochondrial respiratory complex assembly and activity. This disruption leads to mitochondrial damage and decreased cell viability, contributing to the musculoskeletal symptoms observed in PPRD (Padhan2020CCN6). The exact mechanism by which these mitochondrial defects manifest primarily in the skeletal system remains unclear (Padhan2020CCN6).

## Interactions
CCN6, also known as WISP3, is involved in various interactions with proteins that influence cellular processes. It is part of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes, where it interacts with several subunits, including those of Complex I (NDUFB8, NDUFS1), Complex III (UQCRC2), Complex IV (MTCO1), and Complex V (ATP5A1) (Padhan2020CCN6; Sengupta2021Ccn6). These interactions suggest that CCN6 plays a role in the assembly and activity of these complexes, which are crucial for mitochondrial function (Padhan2020CCN6).

CCN6 also interacts with integrin receptors, particularly integrin ανß5, to mediate cell migration. This interaction is significant in the context of mesenchymal stromal cells, where CCN6 acts as a chemoattractive ligand, stimulating directed migration (Schütze2007CYR61CCN1). The interaction with integrin ανß5 is specific, as preincubation with an antibody against this integrin completely prevents the migratory effect of CCN6 (Schütze2007CYR61CCN1).

In the context of cancer, CCN6 interacts with the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway. It decreases IGF-1-induced activation of the IGF-IR and its downstream signaling molecules, which affects the growth and motility of cancer cells (LI2015Emerging).
