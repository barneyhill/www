# IL5RA

## Overview
The IL5RA gene encodes the interleukin 5 receptor subunit alpha, a critical component of the interleukin-5 (IL-5) receptor complex, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system by regulating eosinophil and basophil activities. This gene is located on chromosome 3 and is expressed in various immune cells, including eosinophils and basophils. The IL5RA protein is a transmembrane receptor that specifically binds IL-5, forming a high-affinity receptor complex with a shared beta chain, which is also part of the receptors for interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Kusano2012Structural; Tavernier1991A). The receptor is involved in signal transduction pathways that activate JAK kinases and STAT proteins, essential for immune response modulation and inflammation (Cornelis1995Characterization). The IL5RA gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in both membrane-bound and soluble isoforms, with the latter having antagonistic properties that can regulate eosinophil recruitment and activation (Tavernier1991A; Tavernier1992Molecular). Alterations in IL5RA have been associated with various diseases, including chronic eosinophilic leukemia, atopic dermatitis, and lung adenocarcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Fan2021Clinical; Burgstaller2007The; Smieszek2020“Genomic).

## Structure
The IL5RA protein is composed of three tandem domains: D1, D2, and D3. The N-terminal D1 domain adopts a fibronectin III-like (FnIII) domain fold, while the D2 and D3 domains form the canonical cytokine receptor homology module (CRM), consisting of a pair of FnIII domains arranged orthogonally (Kusano2012Structural). Each domain includes seven anti-parallel beta strands. The D1 domain contains a cysteine (Cys86) that is not involved in disulfide bond formation. The D2 domain has two conserved disulfide bonds (Cys134-Cys155 and Cys182-Cys196), and the D3 domain contains one disulfide bond (Cys269-Cys316) and the conserved WSXWS motif (Kusano2012Structural).

The IL5RA protein forms a complex with interleukin-5 (IL-5), where IL-5 forms a homodimer and IL5RA sandwiches the IL-5 dimer using a 'wrench-like' architecture (Kusano2012Structural). The interaction involves specific residues and domains, with the D3 domain interacting with the common beta subunit (bc) shared with other cytokine receptors (Kusano2012Structural). The IL5RA gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in both membrane-anchored and soluble isoforms, with the soluble form having antagonistic properties (Tavernier1991A; Tavernier1992Molecular). The soluble isoform is suggested to regulate eosinophil recruitment and activation (Tavernier1991A).

## Function
The IL5RA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the interleukin-5 receptor, which is crucial for the binding and signaling of interleukin-5 (IL-5), a cytokine involved in the regulation of eosinophils and basophils. The IL5RA subunit specifically binds IL-5, forming a high-affinity receptor complex with a shared beta chain, which is also part of the receptors for IL-3 and GM-CSF (Kusano2012Structural; Tavernier1991A). This receptor complex is essential for the proliferation, differentiation, and activation of eosinophils, which play a significant role in immune responses, particularly in allergic inflammatory diseases such as asthma (Kusano2012Structural).

The IL5RA protein is involved in signal transduction pathways that include the activation of JAK kinases and STAT proteins, which are critical for transmitting growth signals upon IL-5 binding (Cornelis1995Characterization). The receptor's cytoplasmic domain contains a proline-rich sequence necessary for these signaling processes (Cornelis1995Characterization). The IL5RA subunit is active on the cell surface, where it facilitates the binding of IL-5 and the subsequent recruitment of the beta chain to form the complete receptor complex, initiating downstream signaling pathways that influence immune function and inflammation (Broughton2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL5RA gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving eosinophilic activity. In chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), the severity of FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive cases has been associated with polymorphic variations at the IL5RA locus. Specifically, the SNP rs4054760 in the 5' UTR of IL5RA is linked to higher eosinophil counts and tissue infiltration, although these associations were not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing (Burgstaller2007The).

In atopic dermatitis (AD), rare variants in IL5RA differentiate between milder and more severe forms of the condition. The variant rs200005614 is associated with higher eosinophil counts, which are prevalent in severe AD cases (Smieszek2020“Genomic). IL5RA is also enriched in antibody-expressing cells in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), suggesting a role in antibody production and class switching, which may contribute to the disease's pathophysiology (Buchheit2020IL5Rα).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), IL5RA is part of a five-interleukin receptor-based signature that has prognostic significance, indicating its potential role in cancer progression and as a target for therapeutic strategies (Fan2021Clinical).

## Interactions
The interleukin 5 receptor subunit alpha (IL5RA) is a critical component of the IL-5 receptor complex, which also includes the common beta subunit (bc). IL5RA specifically binds to the cytokine IL-5, forming a binary complex that recruits the bc subunit to create a ternary complex essential for signal transduction (Broughton2012The; Kusano2012Structural). This interaction is crucial for the activation of JAK2 and JAK1 tyrosine kinases, which are constitutively associated with IL5RA and bc, respectively, leading to downstream signaling pathways that involve STAT1/STAT5, PI3K, and MAP kinases (Kusano2012Structural).

IL5RA interacts with IL-5 through multiple structural domains, including an Ig-like N-terminal domain and two fibronectin type III domains, which contribute significantly to the binding energy for IL-5 (Broughton2012The). The interaction involves specific residues that form hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, enhancing the binding affinity and specificity (Broughton2012The). The cytoplasmic domain of IL5RA is essential for signal transduction, as it interacts with JAK2 kinase, facilitating its activation and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT proteins (Cornelis1995Characterization).
