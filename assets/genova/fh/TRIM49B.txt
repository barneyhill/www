# TRIM49B

## Overview
TRIM49B is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 49B, which is part of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, which are involved in various cellular processes, including regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TRIM49B, like other TRIM proteins, is implicated in the modulation of immune responses and may play a role in antiviral defense mechanisms. The specific functions and interactions of TRIM49B are still under investigation, but its involvement in critical cellular pathways suggests potential significance in understanding disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets (Qiu2020aarFDC).
