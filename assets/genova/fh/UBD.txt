# UBD

## Overview
Ubiquitin D (UBD), also known as FAT10, is a gene that encodes a ubiquitin-like protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily protein degradation. The UBD protein is characterized by its two ubiquitin-like domains, which facilitate its role as a ubiquitin-like modifier. It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it tags proteins for proteasomal degradation, thus maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating processes such as immune response, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis (Brozzi2016Ubiquitin; Grabbe2009Functional). UBD's interactions with proteins like p53 and IRE1α underscore its significance in cellular regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target, particularly in cancer and inflammatory conditions (Su2021UbiquitinLike; Brozzi2016Ubiquitin). The gene's expression and the protein's functional dynamics make UBD a critical component in understanding disease mechanisms and developing prognostic biomarkers (Wu2022UBD; Su2021UbiquitinLike).

## Structure
Ubiquitin D (UBD), also known as FAT10, is a ubiquitin-like protein involved in protein degradation. The primary structure of UBD consists of two ubiquitin-like domains, with 29% and 36% identity to ubiquitin at its N- and C-terminus, respectively (Su2021UbiquitinLike). The secondary structure of UBD includes both beta sheets and alpha helices, which are common structural elements in ubiquitin-like proteins (Su2021UbiquitinLike). UBD functions as a monomer and lacks a quaternary structure (Su2021UbiquitinLike).

UBD is known for its role in the degradation of proteins, such as the tumor suppressor protein p53, by facilitating its degradation through the proteasome system. This process involves the binding of UBD to substrates via two glycine residues at its C-terminus, forming a complex that is targeted for degradation (Su2021UbiquitinLike). The protein's involvement in cellular processes, particularly in cancer, highlights its significance as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker (Su2021UbiquitinLike). UBD's structural characteristics and its role in protein degradation underscore its importance in cellular regulation and disease progression.

## Function
UBD, also known as ubiquitin D, is a ubiquitin-like modifier involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in protein degradation by tagging proteins for proteasomal degradation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Grabbe2009Functional). UBD is active primarily in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular activities, including immune response regulation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis (Brozzi2016Ubiquitin).

In healthy human cells, UBD is involved in the regulation of the IRE1α/JNK pathway, which is crucial for cytokine-induced apoptosis. It acts to protect pancreatic beta cells from cytokine-induced death by modulating stress and apoptotic pathways, particularly under inflammatory conditions (Brozzi2016Ubiquitin). UBD's interaction with IRE1α suggests its role in modulating JNK activity, although it does not directly influence IRE1α's enzymatic functions (Brozzi2016Ubiquitin).

UBD is also implicated in the immune response, as its expression is induced by cytokines, particularly IFN-γ, in both rat and human beta cells. This indicates its involvement in inflammatory responses, highlighting its protective role in cellular stress conditions (Brozzi2016Ubiquitin).

## Clinical Significance
UBD (Ubiquitin D) is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), UBD is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. This overexpression is associated with larger tumor size and advanced TNM stage, suggesting that UBD acts as a tumor promoter by facilitating the degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, thereby promoting cell proliferation (Su2021UbiquitinLike). UBD's role in CRC is further supported by its interaction with p53, enhancing its proteolysis through the proteasome degradation pathway (Su2021UbiquitinLike).

In colon cancer, UBD expression correlates with cancer progression and recurrence, particularly in stage II and III patients after curative surgery. Patients with positive UBD expression have worse 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates, making UBD an independent prognostic factor for increased disease recurrence and decreased survival (Yan2010Ubiquitin).

UBD is also overexpressed in glioma, where it serves as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. High UBD expression is linked to poor prognosis, including lower overall survival and disease-specific survival. It is associated with pathways like P53 and immune cell infiltration, indicating its role in tumor progression (Wu2022UBD).

## Interactions
Ubiquitin D (UBD) interacts with several proteins, influencing their stability and function. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, UBD physically interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, leading to its degradation via the proteasome pathway. This interaction is facilitated by the E1 enzyme UBA6 and the E2 enzyme USE1, which form UBD-substrate complexes targeting p53 for degradation (Su2021UbiquitinLike). Immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the binding between UBD and p53, demonstrating a direct interaction that results in the downregulation of p53 expression (Su2021UbiquitinLike).

In pancreatic beta cells, UBD interacts with IRE1α, a key protein in the unfolded protein response and apoptosis regulation. This interaction is independent of the phosphorylation state of IRE1α and does not significantly involve its endoribonuclease domain. UBD modulates the IRE1α-dependent activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, which is crucial for cytokine-induced apoptosis. Knockdown of UBD increases JNK phosphorylation, indicating that UBD normally acts to suppress this pathway, thereby playing a protective role against apoptosis in beta cells (Brozzi2016Ubiquitin). These interactions highlight UBD's role in regulating protein stability and cell survival in different cellular contexts.
