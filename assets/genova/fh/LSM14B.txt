# LSM14B

## Overview
LSM14B is a gene that encodes the protein LSM family member 14B, which is part of the RNA-associated protein (RAP) family. This protein plays a critical role in RNA metabolism, particularly in the regulation of mRNA pools during oocyte development and early embryonic stages. LSM14B is characterized by its conserved N-terminal LSM14 domain, which facilitates RNA binding and is essential for the formation of P-body-like granules and maternal RNA decay organelles (MARDO) (ZHANG2017RNAassociated; Shan2023LSM14B). These structures are crucial for the stability and proper activation of maternal mRNAs. Additionally, LSM14B is involved in mitochondrial clustering, which is vital for energy metabolism during oocyte maturation (Wan2023LSM14B). Clinically, alterations in LSM14B expression have significant implications for female fertility and cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma, where its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis (Zhuang2022Identification).

## Structure
The LSM14B protein is a member of the RNA-associated protein (RAP) family, characterized by its involvement in RNA metabolism. It contains a well-conserved N-terminal LSM14 domain, which forms a closed hetero-heptameric ring barrel structure using antiparallel β-strands and α-helices. This domain is crucial for recognizing and binding specific RNAs, playing a significant role in RNA processing and regulation (ZHANG2017RNAassociated). The LSM14 domain is shared with RAP55, indicating a conserved function in mRNA storage and regulation (ZHANG2017RNAassociated).

The LSM14B protein is part of the like-Sm (LSM) protein family, which is known for forming ring-shaped quaternary complexes essential for their function. These complexes typically consist of seven distinct proteins in eukaryotes, forming heteromeric assemblies (M.2011The). The LSM proteins, including LSM14, are characterized by a highly bent five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and an N-terminal α-helix, with specific RNA-binding sites that facilitate interactions through base stacking and hydrogen bonding (M.2011The).

While specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of LSM14B are not detailed in the provided context, its structural features and domain architecture suggest a critical role in RNA binding and regulation.

## Function
LSM14B is a crucial RNA-associated protein involved in the regulation of mRNA pools, particularly in oocytes. It plays a significant role in oocyte meiotic maturation by controlling the expression and degradation of mRNAs necessary for cell cycle progression, such as Cyclin B1 and Cdc20. The absence of LSM14B leads to meiotic arrest at metaphase, misalignment of chromosomes, and issues with spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and maturation promoting factor (MPF) activation (ZHANG2017RNAassociated).

LSM14B is also essential for the storage and stability of maternal mRNAs in oocytes, acting as a component of P-body-like granules and maternal RNA decay organelles (MARDO). These structures are membraneless compartments that ensure the stability and proper activation of maternal mRNAs during meiosis and early embryonic development. The loss of LSM14B disrupts these granules, leading to reduced mRNA levels and impaired oocyte maturation (Shan2023LSM14B).

In addition, LSM14B is involved in mitochondrial clustering during oocyte meiosis, which is crucial for energy metabolism. Its absence results in abnormal mitochondrial distribution, decreased ATP levels, and increased oxidative stress, highlighting its role in maintaining mitochondrial function during oocyte maturation (Wan2023LSM14B).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LSM14B gene have been linked to significant clinical implications, particularly in female fertility and cancer. In female fertility, the absence of LSM14B leads to compromised fertility and premature ovarian failure. Studies using Lsm14b knockout mice have shown that the gene is crucial for primordial follicle assembly, and its deficiency results in infertility due to the failure of embryos to develop beyond the 2-cell stage. This is attributed to disrupted oocyte mRNA storage and stability, which are essential for oocyte maturation and early embryonic development (Shan2023LSM14B).

In the context of cancer, LSM14B overexpression is associated with poor clinical outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is linked to shorter overall survival and disease-free survival in HCC patients. The gene's overexpression correlates with immune suppression, including lower infiltration of activated CD8+ T cells and higher expression of immune checkpoints like PD-L1, suggesting a role in immunotolerance and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Knockdown of LSM14B in HCC cells has been shown to inhibit proliferation and invasion, indicating its role in tumor progression (Zhuang2022Identification).

## Interactions
LSM14B is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in oocyte development and mRNA regulation. It co-localizes with the germ cell-specific marker DDX4 in all stages of follicles, indicating its involvement in oocyte development (Shan2023LSM14B). LSM14B interacts with several proteins, including DDX6, YBX2, CPEB1, ZAR1, EDC4, LSM5, and 4E-T, which are components of P-body structures and MARDO (maternal RNA decay and organization) (Shan2023LSM14B). The interaction between LSM14B and DDX6 is particularly significant, as it mediates translational repression and P-body assembly, crucial for mRNA metabolism regulation during early developmental stages (Shan2023LSM14B).

LSM14B also interacts with ZAR1 in an RNA-mediated manner, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction is weakened by RNase A treatment, suggesting that RNA molecules mediate the interaction between LSM14B and ZAR1 (Wan2023LSM14Ba). LSM14B's role in mitochondrial clustering and energy metabolism is linked to its co-localization with mitochondria in oocytes, indicating its involvement in the formation of MARDO, which stores maternal mRNAs (Wan2023LSM14Ba). These interactions highlight LSM14B's essential role in regulating maternal mRNA storage and stability, crucial for oocyte maturation and female fertility.
