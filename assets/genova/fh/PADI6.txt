# PADI6

## Overview
PADI6 is a gene that encodes the protein peptidyl arginine deiminase 6, a member of the peptidylarginine deiminase family. Unlike other members of this family, PADI6 is characterized by its lack of catalytic activity, as it does not possess the calcium-binding sites necessary for the enzymatic function typical of other PAD isozymes (Alghamdi2019An). The protein plays a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of cytoplasmic lattices in oocytes, which are essential for early embryonic development (Alghamdi2019An). PADI6 is involved in post-translational modifications through citrullination, impacting protein function and interactions (Chavanas2004Comparative). It is a crucial component of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), which is vital for embryogenesis, particularly before the activation of the embryonic genome (Wang2022A). Mutations in PADI6 are linked to reproductive health issues, including female infertility and imprinting disorders, underscoring its importance in reproductive biology (Cubellis2020Lossoffunction; Xu2016Mutations).

## Structure
The molecular structure of PADI6, a member of the peptidylarginine deiminase family, is characterized by its unique lack of catalytic activity compared to other PAD isozymes. PADI6 is involved in the formation and maintenance of cytoplasmic lattices in oocytes, essential for early embryonic development (Alghamdi2019An). Unlike other PADs, PADI6 lacks calcium-binding sites, which are crucial for the folding and stability of other PAD isoforms, indicating that it relies on other factors for activity regulation (Alghamdi2019An).

PADI6 contains conserved serine residues that serve as potential 14-3-3 binding sites, with two specific sites, Ser-10 and Ser-446, identified as capable of binding to 14-3-3 proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Rose2012Identification). These interactions are facilitated by the structural flexibility and intrinsic disorder within PADI6, which is a common feature among PADs (Alghamdi2019An).

The protein's structure includes regions predicted to be intrinsically disordered, aligning with the characteristic of 14-3-3 protein partners (Alghamdi2019An). The interaction with 14-3-3 proteins is crucial for the regulation of PADI6 activity, highlighting its role in cellular processes related to fertility and embryonic development (Rose2012Identification).

## Function
PADI6 (peptidyl arginine deiminase 6) is an enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through the conversion of arginine residues into citrulline, a process known as citrullination. This modification can significantly alter the charge and folding of target proteins, impacting their function and interactions (Chavanas2004Comparative). PADI6 is particularly active in oocytes and early embryonic development, where it plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal organization and cellular structure maintenance (Kan2012Potential).

In oocytes, PADI6 is essential for the formation and maintenance of cytoplasmic lattices (CPLs), which are hypothesized to store ribosomes. These structures are crucial for proper ribosomal storage and translational control, affecting protein synthesis and embryonic genome activation (Yurttas2008Role). The absence of PADI6 leads to developmental arrest at the two-cell stage in embryos, highlighting its importance in early development (Yurttas2008Role).

PADI6 is also part of the human subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), a multiprotein complex critical for embryogenesis, particularly in the early stages before the embryonic genome becomes active. Mutations in PADI6 can disrupt protein expression and mRNA levels, leading to infertility issues such as early embryo arrest (Wang2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PADI6 gene are associated with several reproductive health issues, primarily female infertility characterized by early embryonic arrest. These mutations disrupt the process of zygotic genome activation (ZGA), which is crucial for normal embryonic development. In humans, this disruption leads to developmental arrest between the 2-cell and 5-cell stages, resulting in infertility (Xu2016Mutations). The PADI6 gene is part of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), essential for embryonic progression beyond the 2-cell stage (Xu2022Novel).

PADI6 mutations have also been linked to imprinting disorders such as Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) with multi-locus imprinting disturbance (MLID). These mutations can cause a wide spectrum of DNA methylation profiles and clinical phenotypes, including features of Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) (Cubellis2020Lossoffunction). Additionally, biallelic missense variants in PADI6 have been associated with recurrent pregnancy losses, including miscarriages and hydatidiform moles (Qian2018Biallelic). These findings underscore the critical role of PADI6 in maintaining reproductive health and its involvement in various reproductive disorders.

## Interactions
PADI6 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which are regulatory adapter proteins involved in various physiological processes. The interaction is mediated through phosphorylation-dependent binding sites on PADI6, specifically at Ser-10 and Ser-446. These sites meet the criteria for 14-3-3 binding, including the presence of serine or threonine residues that are accessible for phosphorylation. The binding of PADI6 to 14-3-3 proteins has been confirmed through fluorescence polarization competition and X-ray crystallography, indicating that these interactions are significant for PADI6's regulatory functions (Rose2012Identification).

In mouse oocytes, PADI6 also interacts with YWHA proteins, a family of proteins that includes 14-3-3. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent and occurs only in mature eggs. The phosphorylation of PADI6 at specific sites facilitates its binding to YWHA, which may regulate PADI6's activity and its role in oocyte maturation (Snow2008PhosphorylationDependent).

PADI6 is also associated with the cytoplasmic lattices (CPLs) in oocytes, where it interacts with α-tubulin. This interaction is crucial for the stability and function of microtubules, affecting organelle positioning and redistribution during oocyte maturation (Kan2011Regulation).
