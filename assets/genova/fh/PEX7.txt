# PEX7

## Overview
PEX7 is a gene that encodes the peroxisomal biogenesis factor 7, a crucial receptor involved in the import of peroxisomal targeting signal type 2 (PTS2)-containing proteins into peroxisomes. This protein is characterized by a WD40 repeat domain, which forms a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, facilitating protein-protein interactions essential for its function (Pan2013Crystal; Lazarow2006Chapter). As a soluble receptor in the cytosol, PEX7 binds PTS2-containing peptides and transports them to the peroxisome, where it interacts with the peroxisomal docking/translocation machinery (Rodrigues2014A; Braverman1998An). The proper functioning of PEX7 is vital for peroxisomal metabolic activities, including fatty acid oxidation and lipid synthesis (Okumoto2018Identification). Mutations in the PEX7 gene are linked to Rhizomelic Chondrodysplasia Punctata type 1 (RCDP1) and can also result in phenotypes similar to Adult Refsum disease, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Fallatah2022A; Braverman2002Mutation).

## Structure
The PEX7 protein is characterized by a WD40 repeat domain, which forms a seven-bladed β-propeller structure. This structure is typical of WD40 proteins and is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Pan2013Crystal; Lazarow2006Chapter). The N-terminal region of PEX7, although having low sequence similarity to other WD40 motifs, assumes a WD40-like fold and completes the ring structure. A unique feature of this region is the 'bulge loop', which contains a conserved six-residue consensus motif and forms part of a hydrophobic ridge on the top surface of PEX7 (Pan2013Crystal). This ridge is involved in interactions with other proteins, such as Pex21p, facilitating complex formation (Pan2013Crystal).

PEX7 interacts with peroxisomal targeting signal-2 (PTS2) through a large cleft that contains both hydrophilic and hydrophobic grooves. These grooves accommodate key residues from PTS2, forming salt bridges and hydrogen bonds that are essential for the recognition and binding of PTS2-containing proteins (Pan2013Crystal). The protein's structure is stabilized by interactions with co-receptors like Pex21p, which enhance its binding to PTS2 cargo (Pan2013Crystal).

## Function
PEX7 (peroxisomal biogenesis factor 7) encodes a protein that functions as a receptor for peroxisomal targeting signal type 2 (PTS2)-containing proteins, facilitating their import into peroxisomes. In healthy human cells, PEX7 operates as a soluble receptor in the cytosol, binding PTS2-containing peptides and transporting them to the peroxisome, where it interacts with the peroxisomal docking/translocation machinery (DTM) (Rodrigues2014A; Braverman1998An). PEX7 forms a complex with PEX5, a peroxisomal shuttling receptor, which stabilizes the interaction and assists in the translocation of cargo proteins into the peroxisomal matrix (Rodrigues2015Revisiting; Rodrigues2014A).

The import of PTS2 proteins is crucial for peroxisomal metabolic activities, including fatty acid oxidation and the synthesis of important lipids (Okumoto2018Identification). PEX7 is essential for maintaining normal metabolic functions, as it ensures the proper functioning of peroxisomes by importing specific proteins necessary for these processes (Rodrigues2014A). The export of PEX7 back to the cytosol is linked to the export of PEX5, although these processes are not strictly coupled, indicating separate export pathways (Rodrigues2014A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PEX7 gene are primarily associated with Rhizomelic Chondrodysplasia Punctata type 1 (RCDP1), a peroxisome biogenesis disorder. RCDP1 is characterized by skeletal abnormalities, congenital cataracts, severe mental deficiency, and growth retardation. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and results from impaired import of peroxisomal matrix enzymes due to defective PEX7, which serves as a receptor for peroxisome targeting signal 2 (PTS2) (Waterham2012Genetics; Braverman2002Mutation).

The severity of RCDP1 can vary, with classic forms presenting severe symptoms such as congenital cataracts, skeletal dysplasia, and cerebral hypomyelination, while nonclassic forms show milder symptoms with better growth and cognitive outcomes (Fallatah2022A). The most common mutation, p.L292X, is associated with the classic form of RCDP1 due to a founder effect (Waterham2012Genetics; Braverman2002Mutation).

PEX7 mutations can also lead to a phenotype similar to Adult Refsum disease (ARD), characterized by retinitis pigmentosa, anosmia, peripheral neuropathy, and hearing loss, due to the accumulation of phytanic acid (Fallatah2022A). The phenotypic spectrum of PEX7-related disorders is broader than previously recognized, with some mutations leading to milder variants with longer survival and less neurological involvement (Braverman2002Mutation).

## Interactions
PEX7, a receptor involved in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins, interacts with several proteins to facilitate the transport of peroxisome-targeting signal type 2 (PTS2) proteins into peroxisomes. PEX7 specifically binds to PTS2 proteins in the cytosol, forming PEX7-PTS2 complexes. These complexes interact with the longer isoform of the PTS1 receptor, PEX5L, which is essential for the translocation of PEX7-PTS2 protein complexes to the peroxisomal membrane (Mukai2006Molecular).

PEX7 also interacts with PEX14p, the initial docking site on peroxisomal membranes, and PEX13p, where PTS2 proteins are released into the peroxisomal matrix. The interaction with PEX13p suggests that PTS2 cargo may be released at this site (Mukai2006Molecular). PEX7's interaction with PEX5L is PTS2-dependent, and PEX7 undergoes conformational changes upon binding to PTS2 cargo, which are necessary for its interaction with PEX5pL (Mukai2006Molecular).

In yeast, PEX7 interacts with Pex18p and Pex21p, which promote the formation of an import-competent PTS2 substrate complex, indicating a role in the early steps of the import process (Stein2002Interactions).
