# GABBR2

## Overview
GABBR2 is a gene that encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 2, a critical component of the GABA_B receptor, which is a class C G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in inhibitory neurotransmission. The protein product of GABBR2, known as the GB2 subunit, forms a heterodimeric complex with the GB1 subunit encoded by the GABBR1 gene. This receptor complex plays a pivotal role in modulating synaptic transmission by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity, thereby reducing intracellular cyclic AMP levels and exerting slow, long-lasting inhibitory effects on neural signaling (Mao2020CryoEM; Yoo2017GABBR2). The GB2 subunit is essential for G-protein coupling and receptor activation, involving significant conformational changes within its transmembrane domains (Mao2020CryoEM). Beyond its neurological functions, GABBR2 is also expressed in pancreatic beta cells, where it influences insulin secretion, underscoring its role in both neural and non-neural processes (Rachdi2020Regulated). Mutations in GABBR2 have been linked to various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and epileptic encephalopathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Bielopolski2023Characterization; Yoo2017GABBR2).

## Structure
The GABBR2 gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 2, which is a component of the GABA B receptor, a class C G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). This receptor functions as a heterodimer composed of two subunits, GABA B1 (GB1) and GABA B2 (GB2), with GABBR2 corresponding to the GB2 subunit (Mao2020CryoEM). The GB2 subunit contains a seven-transmembrane domain typical of GPCRs, with distinct extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular regions (Mao2020CryoEM).

The GB2 subunit plays a critical role in G-protein coupling, particularly through its intracellular loop 3 (ICL3), which undergoes conformational changes to accommodate the G i protein. This involves the opening of ICL3 and movement of the TM3, TM4, and TM5 helices (Mao2020CryoEM). The receptor's activation involves a reorientation of the transmembrane domains from a TM3-TM5/TM3-TM5 interface in the inactive state to a TM6/TM6 interface in the active state (Mao2020CryoEM).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are essential for the proper function and surface expression of the receptor. The interaction between GABA B R1 and GABA B R2 is necessary for the terminal glycosylation and cell surface expression of GABA B R1, resulting in a fully functional receptor (White1998Heterodimerization).

## Function
GABBR2 encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 2, which is a crucial component of the GABA_B receptor complex, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. This receptor forms a heterodimeric complex with GABBR1, and together they modulate synaptic transmission by reducing intracellular cyclic AMP levels through the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. This process results in slow, long-lasting inhibitory effects on neural signaling, helping to maintain a balance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activities (Yoo2017GABBR2).

GABBR2 is involved in the activation of Kir3-type potassium channels, which contribute to generating late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, and it also plays a role in inhibiting high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (Kaupmann1998GABABreceptor). The receptor is active at the cell membrane, where it facilitates the coupling to G proteins, enhancing agonist binding potency and ensuring effective receptor transport (Kaupmann1998GABABreceptor).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, GABBR2 is expressed in human pancreatic beta cells, where it regulates insulin secretion by modulating cAMP signaling pathways (Rachdi2020Regulated). This highlights its involvement in both neural and non-neural cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GABBR2 gene have been implicated in several neurological and developmental disorders. Variants such as p.Arg212Gln and p.Arg212Trp are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The p.Arg212Gln variant leads to increased constitutive activity of the GABA B receptor and reduced receptor surface expression, potentially causing an imbalance in brain excitation and inhibition, which may contribute to ASD symptoms (Bielopolski2023Characterization). The p.Arg212Trp variant, although less studied, is predicted to have a deleterious impact on receptor function (Bielopolski2023Characterization).

In Rett syndrome (RTT) and epileptic encephalopathy (EE), mutations such as Ala567Thr, S695I, and I705N in GABBR2 disrupt receptor function by affecting structural integrity and activation processes. These mutations lead to reduced receptor activity, with the Ala567Thr mutation showing a hypomorphic effect, reducing activity to about 30% of the wild type. The EE-associated mutations further decrease receptor activity, indicating a more severe impact (Yoo2017GABBR2).

Alterations in GABBR2 expression and function can significantly affect synaptic signaling and neuronal excitability, contributing to the pathophysiology of these disorders (Yoo2017GABBR2; Bielopolski2023Characterization).

## Interactions
GABBR2, a subunit of the GABA_B receptor, interacts with GABBR1 to form a functional heterodimeric receptor complex. This interaction is crucial for the receptor's role in inhibitory neurotransmission (D’Onofrio2022Paroxysmal). The GABBR2 protein is involved in forming stabilizing bonds with the GB1 subunit, which is essential for maintaining the receptor's conformation and function. Variants in the GABBR2 gene, such as p.Arg212Gln and p.Arg212Trp, can disrupt these interactions, leading to altered receptor activity and conformation (Bielopolski2023Characterization).

GABBR2 also interacts with other proteins that modulate its signaling and synaptic localization. It associates with 14-3-3 proteins, which are known to influence receptor signaling pathways. Additionally, GABBR2 can interact with scaffolding proteins like Homer, which play a role in synaptic localization and function (D’Onofrio2022Paroxysmal).

These interactions are significant in the context of various neurological disorders. For instance, mutations in GABBR2 have been linked to conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, Rett syndrome, and epileptic encephalopathy, highlighting the importance of its interactions in maintaining normal neurological function (Yoo2017GABBR2; Bielopolski2023Characterization).
