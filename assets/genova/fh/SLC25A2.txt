# SLC25A2

## Overview
SLC25A2 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial protein solute carrier family 25 member 2 (ORNT2), which is part of the solute carrier family 25. This family is known for its role in transporting various metabolites across the mitochondrial inner membrane. ORNT2 is a transmembrane protein characterized by six alpha-helices that facilitate the transport of ornithine, lysine, and arginine, among other substrates, into the mitochondrial matrix. This transport is crucial for the urea cycle, a metabolic pathway that converts ammonia to urea for excretion. Although ORNT2 has a lower affinity and activity compared to its isoform ORNT1, it can partially compensate for ORNT1 deficiencies, highlighting its importance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Palmieri2013The; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological; Palmieri2004The).

## Structure
The SLC25A2 protein, a member of the solute carrier family 25, is characterized by a tripartite structure with three homologous domains, each approximately 100 amino acids in length. These domains contain two hydrophobic stretches that span the mitochondrial inner membrane as alpha-helices, resulting in a total of six transmembrane alpha-helices (Palmieri2013The; Palmieri2004The). The protein's structure includes a signature sequence motif, PX[D/E]XX[K/R]X[K/R], which is crucial for its function (Palmieri2013The).

The tertiary structure of SLC25A2 is likely to form a compact configuration with a central substrate-binding site, as seen in other mitochondrial carriers. This site is formed by residues in the even-numbered transmembrane alpha-helices, facilitating the transport of specific substrates across the mitochondrial membrane (Palmieri2013The). The quaternary structure of SLC25A2 may involve homodimerization, a common feature among mitochondrial carriers, allowing for coordinated transport activity (Palmieri2004The).

SLC25A2 is involved in the transport of various amino acids, including ornithine, lysine, and arginine, and its activity can be inhibited by polyamines, suggesting a regulatory mechanism (Monné2019Mitochondrial).

## Function
The SLC25A2 gene encodes the mitochondrial ornithine carrier ORNT2, which is involved in the transport of ornithine into the mitochondrial matrix in exchange for citrulline and protons (H+). This transport process is a critical step in the urea cycle, which is essential for converting ammonia to urea for excretion from the body. ORNT2 is expressed in several tissues, including the liver, testis, spleen, lung, and pancreas, although its expression levels are generally lower than those of ORNT1, another ornithine carrier (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

ORNT2 has a lower activity and affinity for ornithine and citrulline compared to ORNT1, but it can also transport histidine. Despite its lower efficiency, ORNT2 can partially compensate for ORNT1 deficiencies, suggesting some functional redundancy between the two isoforms. This compensation is particularly relevant in the context of HHH syndrome, a disorder caused by mutations in SLC25A15 (ORNT1), where ORNT2 can improve urea cycle function (Palmieri2004The). The function of ORNT2 is crucial not only for the urea cycle but also for importing amino acids necessary for mitochondrial protein synthesis (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).
