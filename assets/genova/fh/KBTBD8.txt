# KBTBD8

## Overview
KBTBD8 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch repeat and BTB domain containing 8, which is a member of the BTB-kelch family. This protein is characterized by its BTB/POZ domain, BACK domain, and kelch repeats, which facilitate its role as a ubiquitin ligase involved in protein-protein interactions and cellular regulation (Lührig2013The). KBTBD8 is highly conserved across species and plays a significant role in various biological processes, including neural crest cell differentiation and oocyte quality maintenance. It functions as a CUL3 adaptor, forming a complex that modifies ribosomal output, crucial for neural development (Werner2015Cellfate). Additionally, KBTBD8 is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in epithelial ovarian cancer, where its expression correlates with tumor malignancy (Du2020Downregulation). The protein's involvement in key signaling pathways underscores its importance in both normal physiological and pathological contexts.

## Structure
The KBTBD8 protein is a member of the BTB-kelch family, characterized by the presence of a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and five kelch repeats. The BTB/POZ domain is involved in protein dimerization and oligomerization, which is crucial for its function in various cellular processes (Lührig2013The). The kelch repeats form part of the 'N-dimer, C-propeller' subfamily, contributing to the protein's ability to interact with other proteins (Lührig2013The). 

KBTBD8 is highly conserved between species, with a 95% homology between mouse and human sequences. The human KBTBD8 gene encodes a protein of 601 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 68.8 kDa (Lührig2013The). In terms of cellular localization, KBTBD8 is found in the Golgi apparatus in non-dividing cells and translocates to the spindle apparatus during mitosis, indicating a dynamic role in cell division (Lührig2013The).

The protein exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the full-length isoform being 599 amino acids in mice and a shorter isoform of 522 amino acids (Lührig2013The). These isoforms may have distinct functional roles, although specific structural differences are not detailed in the available literature.

## Function
KBTBD8 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into neural crest cells. It functions as a developmentally regulated CUL3 adaptor, forming a ribosome modification platform with CUL3 that alters the translational output of cells. This modification is essential for suppressing the production of proteins that specify central nervous system precursors until neural crest specification is complete (Werner2015Cellfate).

KBTBD8 is involved in the monoubiquitylation of TCOF1 and NOLC1, which stabilizes these proteins and prevents their degradation during neural conversion. This process is critical for neural crest specification, as it engages with RNA polymerase I and other complexes involved in ribosomal processing and modification (Werner2015Cellfate).

In addition to its role in neural differentiation, KBTBD8 is essential for maintaining oocyte quality by regulating PKM1 levels through a signaling pathway involving Erk1/2 and Aurora A. This regulation is crucial for energy metabolism and meiotic progression in oocytes (Li2019The). KBTBD8's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell morphology and signaling pathways (Mena2018Dimerization).

## Clinical Significance
KBTBD8 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in cellular processes and its expression levels. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), KBTBD8 is significantly upregulated, correlating with higher malignancy grades. Its overexpression is associated with increased proliferation and migration of cancer cells, while knockdown of KBTBD8 reduces tumor progression, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis-related pathways (Du2020Downregulation). The gene's role in stabilizing substrates rather than promoting degradation, as seen with other ubiquitin ligases, may contribute to cancer progression by maintaining high levels of proteins that drive tumor growth (Du2020Downregulation).

KBTBD8 is also crucial for female fertility, as it regulates PKM1 levels to ensure oocyte quality. Alterations in KBTBD8 expression can lead to compromised oocyte quality, characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and increased apoptosis, which may affect fertility (Li2019The). Additionally, KBTBD8 is involved in neural crest specification, and its depletion can lead to developmental disorders such as Treacher Collins Syndrome, highlighting its role in neural development (Werner2015Cellfate).

## Interactions
KBTBD8 is a ubiquitin ligase that interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with the protein CUL3, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) techniques, suggesting its involvement in the ubiquitination process, which is crucial for protein degradation and regulation within cells (Du2020Downregulation). In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells, KBTBD8 is implicated in maintaining the activity of several tumorigenesis-related kinases, including p-MTOR, p-Akt, p-Rps6, p-Erk1/2, and p-Src, by regulating their phosphorylation levels through ubiquitination (Du2020Downregulation).

In oocytes, KBTBD8 regulates PKM1 levels via a signaling pathway involving Erk1/2 and Aurora A, indicating its role in ensuring oocyte quality (Li2019The). The protein is part of a signaling cascade that affects the levels of important kinases such as Aurora A, Cdk1, Akt, and Erk1/2, specifically regulating PKM1 expression (Li2019The). KBTBD8's interactions and functions may vary across different cellular contexts, as it promotes Erk1/2→Aurora A signaling in oocytes (Li2019The).
