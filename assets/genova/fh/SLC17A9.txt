# SLC17A9

## Overview
SLC17A9 is a gene that encodes the protein known as solute carrier family 17 member 9, also referred to as the vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT). This protein is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains, which facilitate the transport of nucleotides such as ATP, ADP, and GTP across cellular membranes (Omote2016Structure; Cui2014Exome). VNUT plays a critical role in purinergic signaling by mediating the storage and exocytosis of ATP in various cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and osteoblasts (Sawada2008Identification; Inoue2020VNUTSLC17A9). The protein's function is essential for numerous physiological processes, such as neural-glial interactions, bone remodeling, and immune responses (Sawada2008Identification; Tokunaga2010Involvement). Alterations in the SLC17A9 gene have been associated with several diseases, including certain cancers and disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (Hasuzawa2020Physiopathological; Cui2014Exome).

## Structure
The SLC17A9 gene encodes a vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) protein, which consists of 436 amino acids and is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains (Cui2014Exome). These transmembrane domains are typical of transporter proteins, facilitating the movement of molecules across cellular membranes. The protein has both NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal tails facing the cytosol, which are important for its function in ATP vesicle formation and release regulation (Cui2014Exome).

The VNUT protein is part of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), a group known for its role in substrate transport across membranes (Cui2014Exome). The MFS domain is crucial for the protein's function, and missense variants within this domain can affect the protein's stability and membrane fusion properties (Cui2014Exome). The protein's ability to transport nucleotides like ATP, ADP, and GTP is facilitated by its flexible substrate recognition, which is similar to that of chromaffin granules (Omote2016Structure).

The SLC17A9 protein is also known to interact with various compounds, with its transport activity being inhibited by substances such as DIDS, Evans Blue, and glyoxylate (Omote2016Structure). These interactions highlight the protein's role in physiological functions, including neuroprotection and glucose homeostasis (Omote2016Structure).

## Function
The SLC17A9 gene encodes a protein known as the vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT), which is integral to the storage and exocytosis of ATP in purinergic signaling. This protein is primarily active in the membranes of vesicles within neurons and other cell types, such as astrocytes, adrenal chromaffin cells, and osteoblasts, where it facilitates the uptake of ATP, ADP, and GTP using membrane potential as the driving force (Sawada2008Identification; Inoue2020VNUTSLC17A9). VNUT is crucial for the vesicular storage of ATP, allowing for its release upon cellular stimulation, which is essential for various physiological processes, including neural-glial interactions, control of vessel tone, and platelet aggregation (Sawada2008Identification).

In osteoblasts, VNUT-mediated ATP release plays a regulatory role in bone remodeling and differentiation, with mechanical loading upregulating SLC17A9 expression and increasing extracellular ATP levels (Inoue2020VNUTSLC17A9). In T cells, VNUT is involved in ATP release during activation, which is important for cytokine production and immune responses (Tokunaga2010Involvement). The protein's activity in these processes highlights its significance in cellular communication and homeostasis across different tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SLC17A9 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In cancer, SLC17A9 is overexpressed in various types, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), colorectal cancer (CRC), gastric cancer (GC), and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). In T-ALL, a short mRNA transcript of SLC17A9 is aberrantly overexpressed, predicting a poor prognosis in adult patients (Hasuzawa2020Physiopathological). In CRC and GC, high SLC17A9 expression correlates with advanced cancer stages and poor survival outcomes, serving as an independent prognostic factor (Hasuzawa2020Physiopathological). In LIHC, high SLC17A9 expression is associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival times (Kui2022Comprehensive).

SLC17A9 is also linked to disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP), a rare autosomal dominant skin disorder. Mutations such as c.932G>A (p.Arg311Gln) and c.25C>T (p.Arg9Cys) in SLC17A9 have been identified in DSAP patients, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis (Cui2014Exome). These mutations disrupt the vesicular nucleotide transporter function, affecting ATP efflux and potentially influencing keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation (Cui2014Exome).

## Interactions
SLC17A9, a vesicular nucleotide transporter, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in ATP transport and cellular processes. It interacts with myosin Va, a motor protein, which is essential for the transport of ATP-containing vesicles. This interaction is significant in the context of purinergic transmission, particularly in diabetic bladder dysfunction, where increased expression of both SLC17A9 and myosin Va has been observed (Wang2019Suo).

SLC17A9 also plays a role in lysosomal function by interacting with Cathepsin D, a lysosomal aspartic protease. This interaction is vital for maintaining lysosomal ATP levels necessary for Cathepsin D activation. Knockdown of SLC17A9 results in reduced Cathepsin D activity, leading to lysosomal dysfunction and increased cell death. The interaction between SLC17A9 and Cathepsin D is crucial for cell viability, as demonstrated by experiments showing that overexpression of Cathepsin D can rescue the effects of SLC17A9 deficiency (Huang2022Lysosomal).

Additionally, SLC17A9 is involved in the vesicular storage and exocytosis of ATP, as evidenced by its role in secretory vesicles such as adrenal chromaffin granules and synaptic vesicles. This function is regulated by a membrane potential, and its activity can be inhibited by specific inhibitors like DIDS (Sawada2008Identification).
