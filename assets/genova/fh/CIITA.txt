# CIITA

## Overview
The CIITA gene encodes the Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex Transactivator, a pivotal transcriptional coactivator involved in the regulation of MHC class II gene expression. Unlike typical transcription factors, CIITA does not bind directly to DNA; instead, it functions as a scaffold that facilitates the assembly of transcriptional machinery and chromatin remodeling complexes at MHC class II promoters. This protein is characterized by several functional domains, including an acidic domain, a proline-serine-threonine-rich (PST) domain, a GTP-binding domain, and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which are essential for its regulatory activities (Sisk2001SelfAssociation; Linhoff2001Two). CIITA plays a crucial role in immune responses by regulating the expression of MHC class II molecules, which are necessary for antigen presentation to T helper cells (Steimle1993Complementation). Its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with various transcription factors and coactivators, highlighting its complex regulatory role in the immune system (Wright2006Epigenetic; Reith2005Regulation).

## Structure
The CIITA protein is a large transcriptional coactivator involved in the regulation of MHC class II genes. It consists of 1,130 amino acids and includes several distinct domains that contribute to its function and structure. The primary structure of CIITA includes an acidic domain, a proline-serine-threonine-rich (PST) domain, a GTP-binding domain, and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain (Sisk2001SelfAssociation; Linhoff2001Two).

The secondary structure of the LRR domain is characterized by alternating beta-sheets and alpha-helices, forming a horseshoe-like structure. This domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions and is involved in the nuclear localization of CIITA (Towey2002Nuclear; Linhoff2001Two). The GTP-binding domain, located between residues 336 to 702, is essential for CIITA's translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and for its self-association (Linhoff2001Two).

The tertiary structure involves the interaction of these domains, with the LRR domain playing a significant role in the protein's transactivation function. The quaternary structure is suggested by CIITA's ability to form dimers or multimers, which may enhance its role as a scaffold for transcription factors (Sisk2001SelfAssociation; Linhoff2001Two).

CIITA undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its activity and stability (Sisk2001SelfAssociation). Multiple splice variants of CIITA exist, contributing to its functional diversity (Sisk2001SelfAssociation).

## Function
The CIITA gene encodes the Class II Transactivator, a crucial regulatory protein for the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. CIITA functions as a non-DNA-binding co-activator that coordinates multiple events required for the activation of transcription. It recruits components of the general transcription-initiation machinery, such as transcription factor IID (TFIID) and TFIIB, and induces phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (Reith2005Regulation). CIITA also interacts with the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and recruits co-activators that modify chromatin accessibility through histone acetylation or methylation (Reith2005Regulation).

CIITA is essential for the expression of all MHC class II isotypes in cells, which are crucial for the activation of T helper lymphocytes and immune responses (Steimle1993Complementation). It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with various transcription factors and complexes, such as RFX, CREB, and NF-Y, to positively regulate MHC-II gene transcription (Wright2006Epigenetic). The protein's activity is modulated by posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, which can either enhance or downregulate its activity (Reith2005Regulation). CIITA's expression can be induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in various cell types, highlighting its role in immune response regulation (MuhlethalerMottet1997Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CIITA gene are implicated in various lymphoid cancers and autoimmune diseases. In malignant lymphomas, such as primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and follicular lymphoma (FL), CIITA mutations and structural variants are frequent. These genetic changes often lead to reduced MHC class II expression, contributing to immune escape by decreasing tumor cell immunogenicity and allowing tumors to evade immune surveillance (mottok2017characterization). In PMBCL, over 70% of cases exhibit CIITA alterations, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (mottok2017characterization).

CIITA is also involved in gene fusions in lymphoid cancers, such as the CIITA-BX648577 fusion transcript in DLBCL and PMBCL, which can affect immune responses by altering gene expression (Steidl2011MHC). These fusions are associated with poor prognosis and immune evasion mechanisms (Steidl2011MHC).

In autoimmune diseases, the rs4774 missense variant of CIITA has been linked to an increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), although its exact functional consequences remain unclear (Bronson2011The). CIITA has also been implicated in other autoimmune conditions, such as ulcerative colitis and celiac disease (Bronson2011The).

## Interactions
The CIITA protein is a transcriptional coactivator that plays a crucial role in the regulation of MHC class II gene expression. It does not bind directly to DNA but interacts with various DNA-binding proteins and components of the transcription machinery to facilitate transcriptional activation. CIITA interacts with the MHC class II promoter-bound enhanceosome complex, which includes proteins such as RFX5, RFXANK, NF-YB, NF-YC, and CREB (Sisk2001SelfAssociation; Linhoff2001Two). These interactions occur when these factors are organized into a multiprotein complex at the MHC class II promoter (Linhoff2001Two).

CIITA also interacts with coactivators like CBP (CREB-binding protein) and PCAF, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation (Sisk2001SelfAssociation). The protein's GTP-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain are essential for its self-association and interactions with other proteins, which are critical for its function (Hake2000CIITA; Linhoff2001Two). Additionally, CIITA interacts with components of the basal transcription machinery, including TFIIB and the TATA box binding protein (TBP), to facilitate transcription initiation and elongation (Mahanta1997Transactivation). These interactions highlight CIITA's role as a master regulator of MHC class II gene expression through complex protein-protein interactions.
