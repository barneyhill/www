# ADH5

## Overview
The ADH5 gene encodes the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 5, also known as formaldehyde dehydrogenase or S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), which is a zinc-containing enzyme categorized under class III alcohol dehydrogenases. This enzyme plays a critical role in cellular metabolism by detoxifying formaldehyde, a process essential for protecting cells from its cytotoxic and carcinogenic effects (Oka2020Digenic). The ADH5 protein is highly conserved across mammalian species, indicating its fundamental role in biological systems (Hur1992Cloning). It primarily functions in the cytosol, converting formaldehyde into formic acid in a glutathione-dependent manner, and is also involved in modulating nitric oxide signaling, which is important for circulatory regulation (Oka2020Digenic). Mutations in the ADH5 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Aldehyde Metabolism Deficiency Syndrome (AMeDS) and myelodysplastic syndrome, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing DNA damage (Oka2020Digenic; Kinoshita2021Trigenic).

## Structure
The human ADH5 gene encodes alcohol dehydrogenase 5, also known as formaldehyde dehydrogenase, which is a zinc-containing dimeric enzyme involved in the oxidation of long-chain alcohols and o-hydroxyfatty acids (Hur1992Cloning). The ADH5 protein is highly conserved among mammals, with over 91% amino acid identity in comparisons among human, rat, horse, and mouse (Hur1992Cloning). The gene consists of nine exons and eight introns, spanning approximately 15 kb, and its 5' region is characterized by a CpG island and high G+C content, suggesting ubiquitous expression (Hur1992Cloning).

ADH5 is part of the class-III alcohol dehydrogenases, which are widely expressed and conserved across species, indicating their essential role in cellular metabolism (Hur1992Cloning). The enzyme's activity and distribution suggest it is identical to formaldehyde dehydrogenase, playing a role in detoxifying formaldehyde and metabolizing other aldehydes (Hur1992Cloning). The ADH5 protein typically forms a homodimer, indicating a quaternary structure, and contains zinc-binding domains crucial for its catalytic activity. Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation. The gene produces alternatively spliced transcripts, resulting in proteins with different carboxyl terminals (Östberg2013Analysis).

## Function
The ADH5 gene encodes alcohol dehydrogenase 5, also known as formaldehyde dehydrogenase or S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), which is crucial for detoxifying formaldehyde in human cells. This enzyme primarily functions by converting formaldehyde into formic acid in a glutathione-dependent manner, a process essential for protecting cells from the cytotoxic and carcinogenic effects of formaldehyde, which can cause DNA damage (Oka2020Digenic). ADH5 is the principal enzyme responsible for formaldehyde detoxification, playing a key role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing DNA damage (Oka2020Digenic).

In addition to its role in formaldehyde metabolism, ADH5 is involved in modulating cellular nitric oxide signaling, which is important for regulating circulatory functions (Oka2020Digenic). Despite its critical functions, no congenital disorders due to the loss of ADH5 function had been reported prior to studies identifying its role in a multisystem disorder known as AMeDS, which involves digenic mutations in ADH5 and ALDH2 (Oka2020Digenic). ADH5 is active in the cytosol, where it contributes to cellular protection against formaldehyde-induced damage (Oka2020Digenic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADH5 gene, which encodes alcohol dehydrogenase 5, have been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in formaldehyde detoxification. A significant disorder associated with ADH5 mutations is Aldehyde Metabolism Deficiency Syndrome (AMeDS), a multisystem disorder characterized by aplastic anemia, mental retardation, and dwarfism. This condition arises from digenic mutations in both ADH5 and ALDH2, leading to impaired formaldehyde clearance and increased DNA damage (Oka2020Digenic). The presence of the ALDH2 rs671 defective allele exacerbates the condition, contributing to severe symptoms such as neurological abnormalities and early death (Oka2020Digenic).

In addition to AMeDS, trigenic mutations involving ADH5, ALDH2, and ADGRV1 have been identified in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and Usher syndrome. These mutations result in formaldehyde accumulation, causing hematopoietic disruption and reduced hematopoietic stem cells, which contribute to the development of MDS (Kinoshita2021Trigenic). The clinical features of MDS with ADH5 or ALDH2 mutations resemble Fanconi's anemia, with symptoms such as skin pigmentation, café-au-lait spots, and short stature (Kinoshita2021Trigenic).
