# PPP1R9A

## Overview
The PPP1R9A gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 9A, commonly known as Neurabin-1, which is a neural tissue-specific protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and synaptic function. Neurabin-1 is characterized by its ability to bind F-actin and interact with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), playing a crucial role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal morphology (Nakabayashi2004Genomic; Oliver2002Targeting). The protein contains several structural domains, including a PDZ domain and a Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its involvement in cellular signaling pathways (Casamayor2020Controlling; Ceulemans2002Regulator‐driven). Neurabin-1's functions are modulated by phosphorylation, impacting its role in synaptic transmission and cytoskeletal dynamics, which are essential for the development and maintenance of neuronal structures (Terry-Lorenzo2005Neurabin/Protein; Oliver2002Targeting). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its significance in brain health and disease (Konopaske2015Altered; Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

## Structure
The PPP1R9A gene encodes the protein Neurabin-1, which is involved in cytoskeleton organization and neuronal function. Neurabin-1 is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function. It contains a PDZ domain located between amino acids 512 and 592, which is a protein interaction module often binding to the cytosolic C terminus of transmembrane proteins (Casamayor2020Controlling; Ceulemans2002Regulator‐driven). The protein also features a Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domain from amino acids 1261 to 1327, and two coiled-coil regions spanning amino acids 598-627 and 697-839, which are involved in oligomerization (Casamayor2020Controlling; Ceulemans2002Regulator‐driven).

Neurabin-1 has several isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, with lengths ranging from 1374 to 1090 amino acids. Isoform 3 lacks the C-terminal SAM domain but includes an additional coiled-coil region near its C-terminus (Casamayor2020Controlling). The N-terminal region contains an RXVF motif crucial for interaction with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C), and this interaction is modulated by phosphorylation of Ser-461 by PKA, which is adjacent to the PP1C-binding motif (Casamayor2020Controlling). These structural features enable Neurabin-1 to play a significant role in synaptic signaling and actin cytoskeleton dynamics.

## Function
The PPP1R9A gene encodes neurabin I, a protein that plays a significant role in synaptic formation and function. Neurabin I is a neural tissue-specific F-actin-binding protein that is highly concentrated in the synapse of developed neurons, where it is involved in neurite formation and synaptic plasticity (Nakabayashi2004Genomic). It interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), forming a complex that is crucial for regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell morphology (Terry-Lorenzo2005Neurabin/Protein; Oliver2002Targeting). This interaction is essential for the development and maturation of neuronal structures, such as dendritic spines and filopodia, which are important for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Terry-Lorenzo2005Neurabin/Protein; Oliver2002Targeting).

Neurabin I enhances the targeting of AMPA receptors to the synapse, thereby mediating excitatory synaptic transmission (Terry-Lorenzo2005Neurabin/Protein; Esteves2012Protein). It also plays a role in the mTORC1 pathway, potentially acting as a negative regulator by dephosphorylating specific substrates involved in translation control (Fedoryshchak2024PDZdirected). The protein's activity is modulated by its phosphorylation state, which is influenced by its association with the actin cytoskeleton and PP1 binding (Oliver2002Targeting).

## Clinical Significance
The PPP1R9A gene, encoding neurabin-I, has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization. In primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), neurabin-I is identified as a predominant antigenic target of the B-cell receptor (BCR), leading to the activation of BCR signaling pathways that enhance the proliferation and survival of lymphoma cells. This suggests that alterations in PPP1R9A expression or function may contribute to the pathogenesis of PCNSL (Thurner2018HyperNglycosylated).

In bipolar disorder, PPP1R9A mRNA expression is significantly increased, indicating a potential role in the disorder's pathophysiology. Although the clinical significance in schizophrenia is less clear due to non-significant changes in expression, the gene's involvement in NMDA receptor signaling pathways suggests it may influence synaptic structure and function, which are critical in these psychiatric conditions (Konopaske2015Altered).

Neurabin-I's interaction with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and its involvement in synaptic plasticity and transmission further highlight its potential impact on neurological disorders, including intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders, due to its role in neuronal development (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

## Interactions
PPP1R9A, also known as neurabin I, is a protein that interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and plays a significant role in neuronal function. Neurabin I binds to actin filaments and is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for neurite formation and dendritic spine development (Esteves2012Protein; Casamayor2020Controlling). The interaction between neurabin I and PP1 is mediated through canonical PP1 binding motifs, and this complex is essential for maintaining normal dendritic spine number and morphology in hippocampal neurons (Esteves2012Protein).

Neurabin I also interacts with other proteins, such as p70S6K, through its PDZ domain. This interaction is competitive with PP1 binding, as PP1 binding precludes the interaction with p70S6K (Oliver2002Targeting). The phosphorylation of neurabin I by protein kinase A (PKA) at serine-461, adjacent to the PP1-binding motif, can attenuate its association with PP1, thereby influencing its interactions and functions (Casamayor2020Controlling; Oliver2002Targeting). These interactions highlight the role of neurabin I in synaptic transmission and cytoskeletal dynamics, impacting synaptic plasticity and neuronal morphology (Oliver2002Targeting).
