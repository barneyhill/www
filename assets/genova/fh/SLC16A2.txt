# SLC16A2

## Overview
The SLC16A2 gene encodes the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), a transmembrane protein that is integral to the transport of thyroid hormones across cell membranes. MCT8 is particularly crucial for the uptake of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) into neurons, playing a significant role in neuronal development and function. This transporter is characterized by 12 predicted transmembrane domains and is predominantly expressed in the brain, especially in regions such as the hypothalamus, where it influences thyroid hormone regulation. Beyond the central nervous system, MCT8 is also present in peripheral tissues like the liver, kidney, and thyroid, contributing to systemic thyroid hormone homeostasis. Mutations in the SLC16A2 gene are linked to Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, a disorder marked by severe intellectual and motor impairments due to disrupted thyroid hormone transport (Friesema2003Identification; Groeneweg2019Thyroid; Visser2009Novel).

## Structure
The SLC16A2 gene encodes the MCT8 protein, which is a thyroid hormone transporter with a molecular mass of approximately 60 kDa. The protein is characterized by 12 predicted transmembrane domains, typical of transporter proteins, and both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains are located intracellularly (Visser2009Novel). The MCT8 protein contains PEST domains near the N-terminal end, which are rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine residues. These domains are associated with proteolytic signals for rapid degradation, although the full-length protein is not rapidly degraded, suggesting a half-life of over 30 hours (Visser2009Novel).

The SLC16A2 gene has two in-frame translation start sites, potentially producing proteins of 613 or 539 amino acids. The shorter isoform is confirmed to be an active thyroid hormone transporter (Visser2009Novel). MCT8 is ubiquitinated, indicating regulation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, but this does not lead to rapid degradation (Visser2009Novel). The protein lacks consensus N-glycosylation sites, which is notable given its role in membrane transport (Visser2009Novel).

## Function
The SLC16A2 gene encodes the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), a protein that plays a critical role in the transport of thyroid hormones across cell membranes. MCT8 is primarily responsible for the uptake of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) into neurons, which is essential for normal neuronal development and function (Roberts2008Expression; Meredith2008The). This transporter is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in the hypothalamus, where it influences the negative feedback regulation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) expression by thyroid hormones (Meredith2008The).

MCT8 operates through a mechanism distinct from other transporters, as it is neither proton- nor sodium-linked, facilitating the uptake of iodothyronines without transporting aromatic amino acids or sulfoconjugated iodothyronines (Halestrap2013The). In the brain, MCT8 is crucial for transporting thyroid hormones across the blood-brain barrier, ensuring proper thyroid hormone signaling and function (Groeneweg2019Thyroid; Roberts2008Expression).

The protein is also expressed in other tissues, including the liver, kidney, and thyroid, where it contributes to thyroid hormone metabolism and homeostasis (Friesema2003Identification; Groeneweg2019Thyroid). MCT8's function is vital for maintaining normal metabolic processes and overall cellular function (Halestrap2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC16A2 gene, which encodes the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), are primarily associated with Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), a rare X-linked disorder. This condition is characterized by severe intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, and abnormal thyroid hormone levels, including elevated serum T3 and decreased T4 levels (Visser2009Novel). The syndrome manifests with symptoms such as hypotonia, spastic quadriplegia, and severe cognitive impairment, often preventing affected individuals from sitting, standing, or walking without support (Visser2009Novel).

The clinical severity of AHDS can vary depending on the specific mutation in the SLC16A2 gene. Some mutations allow partial thyroid hormone transport, resulting in milder phenotypes with better motor and speech development (Visser2009Novel). The condition is linked to a disrupted uptake of thyroid hormone in neurons, leading to significant neurological developmental disorders (Visser2009Novel).

In addition to AHDS, mutations in SLC16A2 can lead to a broader spectrum of neurological symptoms, including dystonia, choreoathetosis, and rigidity, with some patients experiencing seizures and other complications (Remerand2019Expanding). The variability in clinical presentations underscores the importance of early diagnosis and management (Remerand2019Expanding).
