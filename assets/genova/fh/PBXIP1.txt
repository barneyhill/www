# PBXIP1

## Overview
PBXIP1 is a gene that encodes the PBX homeobox interacting protein 1, also known as Hematopoietic PBX-interacting protein (HPIP). This protein is primarily involved in cellular processes such as hematopoiesis, cell cycle regulation, and cancer progression. HPIP is characterized by its ability to interact with various proteins, including PBX1, and modulate signaling pathways like PI3K/AKT and mTOR, which are crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation (Khumukcham2021Two). The protein is predominantly cytoplasmic but can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating its functional versatility (Abramovich2002Functional). HPIP's involvement in cancer biology is significant, as it is overexpressed in several cancer types, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis (Bugide2016HPIP; Bugide2014Hematopoietic). Its interactions with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and other signaling molecules underscore its role in enhancing cell migration and resistance to chemotherapy, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Bugide2016HPIP; Bugide2014Hematopoietic).

## Structure
The PBXIP1 gene encodes a protein known as Hematopoietic PBX-interacting protein (HPIP), which consists of 731 amino acids and is located on chromosome 1 at position q21.3. The protein features several functional domains, including two nuclear localization sequences, a nuclear export sequence, and a microtubule-binding sequence. It also contains a PBX1 binding domain and a nuclear receptor-interacting motif that interacts with estrogen receptors (Khumukcham2021Two). HPIP is involved in various signaling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/GSK3β, AKT/MAPK, and mTOR, which are crucial for its role in cell cycle regulation and cancer progression (Khumukcham2021Two).

HPIP has three transcript variants, each with distinct starting codons and different 5' UTRs, resulting in three isoforms of varying lengths. These isoforms suggest structural diversity that may affect the protein's function and interactions (Khumukcham2021Two). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its stability and function during mitosis (Khumukcham2019Hematopoietic). Despite its significant roles, the crystal structure of HPIP is not yet available, but its interaction sites and domains have been mapped (Khumukcham2021Two).

## Function
PBXIP1, also known as Hematopoietic PBX-interacting protein (HPIP), plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in hematopoiesis and cell cycle regulation. In hematopoiesis, PBXIP1 is involved in erythroid differentiation by modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. It acts as a co-repressor of PBX1 and is a target of the erythroid lineage-specific transcription factor GATA1, which binds to the HPIP promoter to activate its transcription. Overexpression of HPIP enhances hematopoietic colony formation and induces erythroid differentiation in human CD34+ cells and K562 cells, respectively (Manavathi2012Functional).

In cell cycle regulation, PBXIP1 is a substrate and inhibitor of the APC/C-Cdc20 complex, crucial for mitotic progression. It stabilizes cyclin B1 by inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation, promoting cell proliferation and normal cell division. Depletion of HPIP leads to faster metaphase-to-anaphase transition and defects in cytokinesis, indicating its role in maintaining chromosomal stability and proper cell division (Khumukcham2019Hematopoietic).

PBXIP1 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm but can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting its function is related to its ability to localize to specific cellular compartments (Abramovich2002Functional).

## Clinical Significance
The PBXIP1 gene, also known as HPIP, is implicated in various cancers due to its overexpression and role in promoting tumor progression and metastasis. In breast cancer, particularly infiltrative ductal carcinoma, HPIP is overexpressed in 87.5% of mammary carcinoma samples, correlating with poor patient outcomes and invasive cancer stages. It interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to regulate cell migration, a critical process in cancer dissemination (Bugide2014Hematopoietic). In ovarian cancer, HPIP promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and confers resistance to cisplatin, a common chemotherapy drug. This is achieved through the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, leading to Snail protein stabilization and E-cadherin repression (Bugide2016HPIP).

HPIP is also overexpressed in gliomas, including astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme, where it enhances tumor cell growth and migration. Its knockdown results in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (van2014PreBcell). The gene's involvement in multiple signaling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT and mTOR, further underscores its role in cancer biology and its potential as a biomarker for poor prognosis in several cancer types (Khumukcham2021Two).

## Interactions
PBXIP1, also known as HPIP, is a protein that engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It acts as a co-repressor of the pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) by inhibiting the ability of PBX-HOX heterodimers to bind to target DNA sequences, thereby modulating transcriptional activity (Khumukcham2021Two; Manavathi2012Functional). PBXIP1 interacts with PBX1, PBX2, and PBX3, and is involved in the regulation of estrogen receptor functions through its interaction with ERα and ERβ (Khumukcham2021Two).

In the context of cancer, PBXIP1 interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), activating it through its C-terminal domain, which enhances cell migration, a critical process in cancer progression (Bugide2014Hematopoietic). It also forms complexes with proteins such as Src and PI3K, facilitating the activation of signaling pathways like AKT/MAPK, which are crucial for tumorigenesis (Khumukcham2021Two).

PBXIP1 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle by interacting with the APC/C-Cdc20 complex, acting as both a substrate and an inhibitor, which stabilizes cyclin B1 and ensures proper mitotic progression (Khumukcham2019Hematopoietic). These interactions highlight PBXIP1's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential implications in cancer biology.
