# IPO9

## Overview
Importin 9 (IPO9) is a gene that encodes the protein importin 9, a member of the karyopherin family, which is involved in the nuclear transport of proteins and nucleic acids. Importin 9 functions as a nuclear transport receptor, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of nuclear actin levels, which are crucial for transcriptional activity and chromatin remodeling in eukaryotic cells. The protein facilitates the nuclear import of actin through interactions with cofilin, an actin-binding protein, and is also involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of specific mRNAs, such as IFN-ε, by binding to their 5′ untranslated regions. Additionally, importin 9 is implicated in the nuclear import of other proteins, such as NUAK1, by recognizing their nuclear localization signals. The dysregulation of IPO9 expression has been associated with various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Dopie2012Active; Mehmood2021Molecular; Herceg2023Diagnostic; Matsumiya2013Novel).

## Function
Importin 9 (IPO9) is a nuclear transport receptor that plays a critical role in the active maintenance of nuclear actin levels, which is essential for transcriptional activity in eukaryotic cells. IPO9 facilitates the nuclear import of actin, a process that involves a RanGTP/RanGDP gradient and is crucial for maintaining the balance between nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pools. This balance is important for various cellular functions, including transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling (Dopie2012Active).

The interaction between actin and IPO9 is mediated by cofilin, an actin-binding protein, which suggests a classical importin-cargo interaction. Depletion of IPO9 results in significantly reduced nuclear actin levels and decreased transcriptional activity, as evidenced by reduced incorporation of 5-fluorouridine into nascent mRNA. This transcriptional repression can be rescued by transfecting cells with an RNAi-resistant IPO9 construct, highlighting the specificity of IPO9's role in maintaining nuclear actin levels (Dopie2012Active).

In addition to its role in actin transport, IPO9 is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of specific mRNAs, such as IFN-ε, by binding to stem-loop structures within their 5′ untranslated regions. This interaction suppresses mRNA expression under normal conditions, indicating IPO9's role in selective post-transcriptional regulation (Matsumiya2013Novel).

## Clinical Significance
The IPO9 gene, encoding importin 9, plays a significant role in the clinical landscape of certain cancers due to its altered expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), IPO9 is notably upregulated, with overexpression observed in 31% of HCC samples. This overexpression is associated with higher histological grades and poorer patient survival outcomes, although its impact on survival is less severe compared to other karyopherin genes like KPNA2 (Herceg2023Diagnostic). The expression of IPO9 is linked to key cellular processes such as DNA replication and cell cycle progression, which are critical in cancer development (Herceg2023Diagnostic).

In breast cancer, IPO9 also shows significant expression changes and a mutation rate of 11%, primarily due to gene amplification. These alterations suggest a potential role for IPO9 in breast cancer prognosis and as a therapeutic target (Mehmood2021Molecular). Despite its involvement in these cancers, the specific roles of IPO9 mutations in other diseases remain less clear, as some studies have not reported direct associations with cancer etiology (Çağatay2018Karyopherins). Overall, the dysregulation of IPO9 expression and its interactions in cancer highlight its potential as a biomarker and target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
Importin 9 (IPO9) is involved in several key interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in nuclear transport processes. IPO9 interacts with actin and cofilin (CFL1), an actin-binding protein, to facilitate the nuclear import of actin. This interaction is essential for maintaining nuclear actin levels, which are important for transcriptional activity (Dopie2012Active; IZDEBSKA2016Downregulation). Cofilin is necessary for the interaction between actin and IPO9, as reducing cofilin levels decreases their association (Dopie2012Active).

IPO9 also interacts with the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of IFN-ε mRNA, specifically associating with a stem-loop structure to suppress its expression. This interaction highlights IPO9's role in post-transcriptional regulation (Matsumiya2013Novel).

In addition, IPO9 is involved in the nuclear import of the protein NUAK1. It interacts with the bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) of NUAK1, facilitating its transport into the nucleus. This interaction is crucial for the nuclear localization of NUAK1 and is mediated through IPO9's recognition of the NLS (Palma2019Identification).
