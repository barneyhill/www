# ABHD11

## Overview
ABHD11 is a gene that encodes the protein abhydrolase domain containing 11, which is a member of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family. This protein is characterized as a mitochondrial serine hydrolase, playing a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism by maintaining the functional lipoylation of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHc), a key component of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The ABHD11 protein is distinguished by its α/β hydrolase fold and catalytic motifs, which are essential for its enzymatic activity. It is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in brown adipose tissue, heart, and skeletal muscle. The gene is located on chromosome 7q11.23 and is implicated in metabolic and neurological conditions, including its association with Williams-Beuren syndrome. Research indicates that ABHD11 may have protective roles against lipid peroxidation damage in mitochondria, highlighting its importance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Lord2013Mammalian; Bailey2020ABHD11).

## Structure
ABHD11 is a protein encoded by the ABHD11 gene, belonging to the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family. This family is characterized by a core structure consisting of an eight-stranded beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices, typical of many proteases and lipases (Lord2013Mammalian; Bailey2020ABHD11). ABHD11 is predicted to localize to the mitochondria through a classical mitochondrial targeting sequence, and its structure includes a mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) cleavage site (Bailey2020ABHD11).

The protein features a typical α/β hydrolase fold with two catalytic motifs: a serine nucleophile motif (GXSXG) and a putative acyltransferase motif (HXXXXD) (Bailey2020ABHD11). These motifs are crucial for its hydrolase activity, which is necessary for maintaining the functional lipoylation of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHc) (Bailey2020ABHD11). The catalytic residues include Serine 141 and Histidine 296, which are essential for its enzymatic function (Bailey2020ABHD11).

ABHD11 is a 315 residue protein encoded by 6 exons located on chromosome 7q11.23 (Lord2013Mammalian). It is ubiquitously expressed in mice, with the highest expression in brown adipose tissue, heart, and skeletal muscle (Lord2013Mammalian). The protein's expression is influenced by diet and genetic factors, such as high-fat diet feeding and hormone-sensitive lipase knockout in mice (Lord2013Mammalian).

## Function
ABHD11 is a mitochondrial serine hydrolase that plays a crucial role in maintaining the functional lipoylation of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHc), which is essential for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA, a key step in cellular energy metabolism (Bailey2020ABHD11). ABHD11's enzymatic activity is necessary for the lipoylation of the DLST subunit of the OGDHc, and its loss leads to impaired lipoylation and accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), affecting cellular metabolism and oxygen sensing (Bailey2020ABHD11).

ABHD11 also protects mitochondrial lipoylated proteins from lipid peroxidation damage, preventing the formation of lipoyl adducts that can disrupt OGDHc function (Bailey2020ABHD11a). It is localized to the mitochondrial matrix, where it associates with OGDHc components, highlighting its role in mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism (Bailey2020ABHD11). The protein's activity is linked to the regulation of 2-oxoglutarate metabolism and the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway, underscoring its importance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in healthy human cells (Bailey2020ABHD11).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ABHD11 gene have been implicated in various metabolic and neurological conditions. ABHD11 is part of the 7q11.23 hemizygous deletion associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome, a rare multisystem disorder characterized by developmental and cardiac abnormalities. This syndrome also presents with metabolic abnormalities such as decreased triglycerides and lower body mass, although the direct association of ABHD11 with these metabolic features is not fully established (Escoubet2020ABHD11; Bailey2020ABHD11).

ABHD11 knockout mice exhibit resistance to diet-induced obesity and maintain normal biochemical parameters when subjected to a high-fat diet, suggesting a role in weight regulation and potential implications for obesity-related therapies (Escoubet2020ABHD11). These mice also show better insulin sensitivity and lower fasting glycemia levels compared to wild-type mice, indicating a potential protective effect against insulin resistance (Escoubet2020ABHD11).

The gene's involvement in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function further suggests its significance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Disruption of ABHD11 affects the lipoylation of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, impairing oxidative phosphorylation and promoting reductive metabolism, which could contribute to metabolic disorders (Bailey2020ABHD11).

## Interactions
ABHD11 is a mitochondrial enzyme that interacts with the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHc), playing a crucial role in its function. This interaction is essential for the lipoylation of the OGDHc, particularly affecting the DLST subunit, which is necessary for the complex's activity in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. ABHD11's enzymatic activity, which includes a serine hydrolase domain and a putative acyltransferase motif, is required for maintaining this lipoylation. Mutations in these domains, such as S141A and H296A, result in a failure to restore OGDHc lipoylation in ABHD11-deficient cells, highlighting the importance of these motifs (Bailey2020ABHD11).

ABHD11 also protects mitochondrial lipoylated proteins from lipid peroxidation damage, preventing the formation of lipoyl adducts on DLST due to lipid peroxidation products like 4-HNE. This protection is vital for maintaining the integrity of the TCA cycle and preventing inactivation of 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases (Bailey2020ABHD11).

While ABHD11's interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond its association with OGDHc are not detailed, its role in regulating lipoylation and glutarylation of specific ketoacid dehydrogenases is significant (Grice2024ABHD11).
