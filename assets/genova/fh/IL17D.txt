# IL17D

## Overview
Interleukin 17D (IL17D) is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein interleukin-17D, which is part of the interleukin-17 family known for its role in immune regulation. The IL17D gene is expressed predominantly in non-hematopoietic tissues and is involved in modulating immune responses, particularly by influencing the activity of immune cells such as CD8 T cells and macrophages. The protein interleukin-17D plays a crucial role in both immune suppression and activation, depending on the context, such as during infections or within the tumor microenvironment. It is implicated in various pathological conditions, including inflammatory diseases and cancer, where it can either suppress or promote disease progression through its interactions with immune cells and signaling pathways (Lee2019Interleukin17D; Lin2022Interleukin17D).

## Function
Interleukin-17D (IL-17D) is a cytokine that plays a significant role in modulating immune responses. It is primarily expressed in non-hematopoietic cells, including hepatocytes, and is involved in regulating immune cell activity, particularly by suppressing CD8 T cell responses during infections. This suppression is mediated through the regulation of dendritic cells, which are crucial for activating CD8 T cells. In the absence of IL-17D, as observed in IL-17D-deficient mice, there is an enhanced CD8 T cell response, leading to improved pathogen clearance, indicating that IL-17D normally acts to dampen this response (Lee2019Interleukin17D).

IL-17D also influences the tumor microenvironment, particularly in lung cancer, by promoting tumor-associated macrophage infiltration through the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. This cytokine is associated with the upregulation of genes related to macrophage recruitment and polarization, such as CCL3, CCL4, and CSF1, which support tumorigenesis (Lin2022Interleukin17D). IL-17D's expression is influenced by factors such as Nrf2 and is suppressed in advanced cancer, suggesting its involvement in both immune regulation and cancer progression (Lee2019Interleukin17D).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of IL17D have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. In skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis, IL-17D plays a role in amplifying inflammation by inhibiting the expression of DDX5 in keratinocytes. This inhibition enhances IL-36R-mediated skin inflammation, contributing to the pathogenesis of these conditions (Ni2022IL17Dinduced).

In the context of infections, IL-17D has been shown to suppress CD8 T cell activity, which can compromise host immunity. IL-17D-deficient mice exhibit enhanced CD8 T cell responses and reduced pathogen burden during infections with Listeria monocytogenes and influenza A virus, suggesting that IL-17D negatively regulates adaptive immunity during these infections (Lee2019Interleukin17D).

IL-17D is also involved in cancer progression, particularly in lung cancer. It is highly expressed in lung cancer tissues and is associated with poor survival outcomes. IL-17D promotes tumor growth by enhancing the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, thereby influencing the tumor microenvironment (Lin2022Interleukin17D).
