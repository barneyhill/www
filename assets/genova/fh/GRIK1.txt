# GRIK1

## Overview
The GRIK1 gene encodes the glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 1, also known as GluK1, which is a critical component of kainate receptors in the central nervous system. These receptors belong to the ionotropic glutamate receptor family and are involved in mediating excitatory neurotransmission. The GluK1 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including the amino-terminal domain, ligand-binding domain, and transmembrane domain, which facilitate its role in synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability (DíazRodríguez2024Delving; Dhingra2023Functional). Functionally, GluK1-containing receptors participate in both ionotropic and metabotropic signaling pathways, influencing neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity (Contractor2011Kainate; Lerma2013Kainate). The gene's involvement in various protein-protein interactions and its clinical significance in neurological disorders such as epilepsy and schizophrenia underscore its importance in maintaining neural network functionality and its potential as a therapeutic target (Hu2024Transcriptomic; Viard2022Chr21).

## Structure
The GRIK1 gene encodes the GluK1 subunit of kainate receptors, which are part of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family. The GluK1 protein is organized into several structural domains, including the amino-terminal domain (ATD), ligand-binding domain (LBD), and transmembrane domain (TMD) (Dhingra2023Functional). The ATD is involved in regulatory functions and can undergo alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms such as GluK1-1 and GluK1-2, which differ by a 15 amino acid insertion (Herbrechter2021Splicing). The GluK1-1a isoform, in particular, has been studied for its structural properties using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a conserved architecture in the desensitized state (Dhingra2023Functional).

The GluK1 receptor can form tetrameric complexes, either as homomeric or heteromeric assemblies with other kainate receptor subunits, contributing to its diverse functional properties (DíazRodríguez2024Delving). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are common in the extracellular domain, which may influence receptor function and interactions (Dhingra2023Functional). The His289Tyr polymorphism in the ATD is noted for introducing new hydrophobic-proximal interactions, potentially stabilizing the protein and affecting its trafficking and synaptic localization (DíazRodríguez2024Delving).

## Function
The GRIK1 gene encodes the GluK1 subunit of kainate receptors, which are involved in both ionotropic and metabotropic signaling pathways in the central nervous system. These receptors play a crucial role in modulating synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. GluK1-containing receptors are expressed in various brain regions, including cortical interneurons, Purkinje cells, and sensory neurons, where they influence neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity (Hansen2021Structure; Lerma2013Kainate).

GluK1 subunits can form both homomeric and heteromeric receptor complexes, which are involved in modulating synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. These receptors are known to regulate the release of neurotransmitters such as GABA and glutamate, impacting synaptic physiology and the maturation of neural circuits (Contractor2011Kainate; Lerma2013Kainate).

In addition to their ionotropic functions, GluK1 subunits are involved in noncanonical metabotropic signaling, which includes interactions with G proteins and second messengers. This metabotropic activity is particularly significant in presynaptic inhibition of GABA release, highlighting the diverse signaling capabilities of kainate receptors (Lerma2013Kainate). The GluK1 subunit also plays a role in the development of excitatory synapses and synapse maturation, contributing to the overall connectivity and functionality of neuronal networks (Hansen2021Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GRIK1 gene, which encodes a subunit of the kainate type glutamate receptor, have been implicated in several neurological disorders. In epilepsy, particularly juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), polymorphisms in GRIK1 have been associated with the condition. Studies have shown a significant increase in the frequency of certain alleles, such as the A9 allele, in individuals with JAE, suggesting a genetic linkage (Sander1997Allelic). The GRIK1 gene is also involved in the GASH/Sal model of audiogenic seizures, where the His289Tyr polymorphism affects receptor stability and expression, potentially contributing to seizure susceptibility (DíazRodríguez2024Delving).

In schizophrenia, deficiencies in GRIK1, along with other kainate receptor subunits, have been linked to disruptions in synaptic membrane-associated genes, which may contribute to the disorder's pathophysiology (Hu2024Transcriptomic). Alterations in GRIK1 expression have also been associated with Kawasaki Disease (KD) and its complications, such as coronary artery aneurysms, in certain populations, indicating a potential role in cardiovascular conditions (Lin2014Genetic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GRIK1 in various diseases, emphasizing its role in both neurological and systemic conditions.

## Interactions
GRIK1, a subunit of kainate receptors, participates in various protein-protein interactions within the central nervous system. It interacts with several proteins in dendritic spines, including HCN1, KCNQ2, SEPT7, KALRN, and DLG4 (PSD-95). The interaction between GRIK1 and HCN1 occurs in dendritic shafts and spines, while GRIK1 also interacts with KCNQ2, a potassium channel that functionally interacts with HCN1. SEPT7, a member of the septin family of GTPases, localizes to dendritic branching points and spine necks, and KALRN, a Rho-GEF, localizes to the postsynaptic side of excitatory synapses, binding the NMDA receptor subunit Nr2b (Grin2b) (Viard2019Chr21; Viard2022Chr21).

GRIK1 is part of two synaptic complexes: one near PSD-95 at the tip of the dendritic spine and another at the neck of the spines (Viard2019Chr21; Viard2022Chr21). These interactions suggest a role for GRIK1 in synaptic organization and signaling. The protein's interactions with other subunits and auxiliary proteins, such as Neto1/2, are crucial for its proper surface expression and synaptic trafficking, which are important for its function in synaptic transmission and plasticity (DíazRodríguez2024Delving; Dhingra2023Functional).
