# MARCHF5

## Overview
MARCHF5, also known as MARCH5, is a gene that encodes the membrane-associated RING-CH-type finger 5 protein, a mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is integral to the outer mitochondrial membrane and plays a pivotal role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics, particularly the processes of mitochondrial fission and fusion. The MARCHF5 protein is characterized by a RING-CH domain, which is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins involved in mitochondrial morphology and function (Karbowski2007The; Cherok2017Novel). Through its interactions with proteins such as Drp1 and mitofusin 2, MARCHF5 maintains mitochondrial integrity and is implicated in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and cellular homeostasis (Nakamura2006MARCH‐V; Karbowski2007The). Dysregulation of MARCHF5 has been associated with several diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Nie2020Chaperonemediated).

## Structure
MARCHF5, also known as MARCH5, is a mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase characterized by a RING-CH domain, which is crucial for its ubiquitin transfer activity (Karbowski2007The). The protein is composed of 278 amino acids and includes a cytosol-facing N-terminal RING finger domain spanning residues 6-75, four transmembrane domains, and a C-terminal extension from residues 259-278 (Nakamura2006MARCH‐V; Cherok2017Novel). The RING domain is essential for the protein's function in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in regulating mitochondrial fission and fusion processes (Karbowski2007The).

MARCHF5 is an integral membrane protein localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane, as indicated by its extraction properties and localization studies (Nakamura2006MARCH‐V). The protein interacts with other mitochondrial proteins such as Drp1 and mitofusin 2 (MFN2), playing a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial morphology (Nakamura2006MARCH‐V; Karbowski2007The). Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, are likely involved in its regulatory functions (Cherok2017Novel). MARCHF5 can also undergo degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy, facilitated by a KFERQ-like motif, specifically the QRWVD sequence, which is crucial for its interaction with CMA regulators (Nie2020Chaperonemediated).

## Function
MARCHF5, also known as MARCH5, is a mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics in healthy human cells. It is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane and is involved in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of proteins associated with mitochondrial fission and fusion, such as MiD49, Mcl1, Drp1, and mitofusin proteins (Mfn1 and Mfn2) (Park2010Loss; Cherok2017Novel; Xu2016Mitochondrial).

MARCHF5 regulates mitochondrial fission by controlling the stability of MiD49, a receptor for Drp1, thereby influencing mitochondrial division and morphology (Cherok2017Novel; Xu2016Mitochondrial). It also interacts with Drp1 and Mfn2, promoting their ubiquitination, which is essential for maintaining the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion (Nakamura2006MARCH‐V; Park2010Loss). The activity of MARCHF5 is critical for proper mitochondrial division, as its inhibition leads to abnormal mitochondrial elongation and interconnection, which can induce cellular senescence (Karbowski2007The; Park2010Loss).

Through these processes, MARCHF5 helps maintain mitochondrial morphology and function, preventing mitochondrial dysfunction associated with various diseases (Karbowski2007The). Its role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics is vital for cellular processes such as apoptosis, mitochondrial DNA distribution, and cellular homeostasis (Cherok2017Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the MARCHF5 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). MARCHF5 plays a critical role in mitochondrial dynamics by regulating the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion. In the context of PD, impaired chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) activity can lead to the stabilization of MARCHF5, resulting in excessive mitochondrial fission and dysfunction, which are key pathogenic features of the disease (Nie2020Chaperonemediated). Enhancing CMA activity has been shown to promote MARCHF5 turnover, reduce DNM1L translocation, and alleviate mitochondrial fragmentation, thereby protecting dopaminergic neurons in PD models (Nie2020Chaperonemediated).

MARCHF5 is also involved in regulating apoptosis through its interaction with BAK, a pro-apoptotic protein. The loss of MARCHF5 can impair BAK-dependent apoptosis, leading to resistance against apoptotic stimuli. This resistance is due to BAK forming inhibitory complexes with pro-survival proteins, which can affect cell survival and potentially contribute to diseases where apoptosis is dysregulated, such as cancers and autoimmune disorders (Huang2022E3).

## Interactions
MARCHF5, also known as membrane-associated RING-CH-type finger 5, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in mitochondrial dynamics and cellular homeostasis. MARCHF5 interacts with mitochondrial fission proteins such as Drp1 and Mff, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of mitochondrial fission. The interaction with Mff is particularly strong, as confirmed by immunoprecipitation and chemical crosslinking experiments (Cherok2017Novel). MARCHF5 also interacts with MiD49, a receptor for Drp1, and regulates its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which is crucial for controlling mitochondrial fission rates (Xu2016Mitochondrial).

MARCHF5 is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, coordinating the degradation of proteins like MiD49 and Mcl1, a pro-survival Bcl-2 family member. This interaction is essential for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function (Cherok2017Novel). MARCHF5 also interacts with the AAA-ATPase p97 and its cofactor Npl4, which are involved in the retrotranslocation of ubiquitinated substrates, highlighting its role in post-ubiquitination processes (Cherok2017Novel).

In addition to its role in mitochondrial dynamics, MARCHF5 is identified as a substrate for chaperone-mediated autophagy, interacting with key regulators HSPA8 and LAMP2A, which are crucial for its lysosomal degradation (Nie2020Chaperonemediated).
