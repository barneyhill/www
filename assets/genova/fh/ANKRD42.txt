# ANKRD42

## Overview
ANKRD42 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat domain 42, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats, a common protein motif involved in protein-protein interactions. The protein, also known as several ankyrin repeat protein variant 2 (SARP2), is primarily recognized for its role in reproductive biology, particularly in spermatogenesis and sperm function. SARP2 interacts with phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 (PPP1), specifically the catalytic subunit gamma 2 (PPP1CC2), and is involved in the regulation of sperm motility and the acrosome reaction (Silva2016Characterisation). Beyond its reproductive functions, ANKRD42 is implicated in cancer biology, particularly in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process associated with colorectal cancer metastasis, and in fibrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis through its circular RNA form, circANKRD42 (Zhang2023hucMSCs; Liu2024Genome‐wide). These diverse roles highlight the gene's significance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions.

## Function
The ANKRD42 gene encodes several ankyrin repeat protein variant 2 (SARP2), which is a phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 (PPP1)-interacting protein. SARP2 is highly expressed in human testis and spermatozoa, particularly in post-meiotic haploid spermatids during the mid-late stages of elongation. It interacts specifically with the PPP1 catalytic subunit gamma 2 (PPP1CC2) in testicular germ cells and spermatozoa, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis and sperm motility (Silva2016Characterisation).

SARP2 is localized in the nucleus of late elongating spermatids and in the flagellum and acrosome of spermatozoa, indicating its involvement in sperm motility and the acrosome reaction. The protein's interaction with a novel sperm-associated antigen 9 (SPAG9) variant further supports its role in spermiogenesis and sperm function (Silva2016Characterisation).

The ANKRD42 gene's expression profile, similar to SARP2-specific primers, suggests that SARP2 is the primary isoform present in testis and spermatozoa. The presence of a consensus RVxF PPP1 binding motif and ankyrin repeats in SARP2 facilitates its interaction with PPP1, inhibiting its catalytic activity when phosphorylase is used as a substrate (Silva2016Characterisation).

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD42 has been identified as a significant contributor to colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis. Alterations in its expression are associated with the progression and metastasis of CRC, particularly to the liver. The gene is upregulated in various tumor tissues, including colorectal, pancreatic, and gastric cancers, and is involved in promoting NF-κB transcription factor activity. This upregulation is linked to increased tumor cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, as well as the regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical process for cancer metastasis (Liu2024Genome‐wide).

In pulmonary fibrosis, ANKRD42 is implicated through its circular RNA form, circANKRD42, which is involved in the circANKRD42-YAP1 signaling pathway. This pathway contributes to mechanical stiffness in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) treatment has been shown to alleviate pulmonary fibrosis by reducing the expression of circANKRD42, thereby affecting the YAP1 signaling pathway and reducing mechanical stiffness in lung tissues (Zhang2023hucMSCs). These findings suggest that ANKRD42 and its related pathways could serve as potential therapeutic targets in both cancer and fibrotic diseases.

## Interactions
ANKRD42, also known as ankyrin repeat domain 42, is involved in several protein interactions that are significant for its biological functions. One of the key interactions of ANKRD42 is with the phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma 2 (PPP1CC2) in human spermatozoa. This interaction was confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that ANKRD42, specifically its variant SARP2, binds with PPP1CC2, suggesting a role in spermatid development and sperm motility (Silva2016Characterisation).

ANKRD42 also interacts with a variant of sperm-associated antigen 9 (SPAG9), a c-Jun N-terminal kinase-binding protein specific to testis and spermatozoa. This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid approach, highlighting ANKRD42's potential involvement in spermiogenesis and sperm function (Silva2016Characterisation).

In the context of colorectal cancer, ANKRD42 is implicated in the regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, potentially through interactions with the NF-κB transcription factor. This interaction promotes the expression of genes associated with EMT, contributing to cancer metastasis (Liu2024Genome‐wide). These interactions underscore ANKRD42's role in both reproductive biology and cancer progression.
