# UTP11

## Overview
UTP11 is a gene that encodes the UTP11 small subunit processome component, a protein integral to the assembly and function of the small subunit (SSU) processome, a ribonucleoprotein complex essential for ribosome biogenesis. The UTP11 protein is involved in the processing and maturation of 18S rRNA within the nucleolus, a critical step in the formation of the small ribosomal subunit. It plays a significant role in RNA remodeling, particularly in the stabilization of helix 18 of the 18S rRNA, and interacts with various proteins such as Nop1, Bud21, and Bms1 to maintain the structural integrity of the SSU processome (Barandun2017The). Beyond its fundamental role in ribosome assembly, UTP11 has clinical significance, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression levels serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target (Chen2024UTP11).

## Function
UTP11 is a component of the small subunit (SSU) processome, a ribonucleoprotein complex essential for ribosome biogenesis. In healthy human cells, UTP11 plays a critical role in the processing and assembly of the 18S rRNA, a key component of the small ribosomal subunit. This process occurs in the nucleolus, where UTP11 contributes to the maturation of pre-rRNA, ensuring proper ribosome function and protein synthesis (Barandun2017The).

UTP11 is involved in RNA remodeling, particularly in the remodeling of helix 18 (h18) of the 18S rRNA. This remodeling is crucial for the proper assembly of the ribosomal small subunit. UTP11's conserved N-terminal segment, in conjunction with proteins Bms1 and Sas10, stabilizes the remodeled RNA and ribosomal protein rpS23, preventing premature junction formation between 18S rRNA domains (Barandun2017The).

Within the SSU processome, UTP11 interacts with other proteins such as Nop1 and Bud21, connecting various regions of the processome and facilitating the incorporation of dynamic subcomplexes into a globular particle. This interaction is vital for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the SSU processome during ribosome assembly (Barandun2017The).

## Clinical Significance
UTP11 has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies have shown that UTP11 expression is significantly higher in HCC tissues compared to normal tissues, and its elevated levels are associated with poor prognosis in patients. High UTP11 expression correlates with advanced clinical stages of HCC and is considered a strong independent prognostic predictor for the disease. The gene's expression levels can accurately predict the presence of HCC, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.894, indicating its potential as a diagnostic biomarker (Chen2024UTP11).

Mechanistically, UTP11 is involved in RNA splicing and mRNA stability regulation, particularly enhancing the stability of mRNA for Oct4, a gene related to cancer stem cells (CSCs). This activity promotes CSC characteristics such as self-renewal and proliferation, contributing to tumor growth and progression. Knockdown of UTP11 in vitro and in vivo has been shown to reduce tumor growth and improve survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2024UTP11).

In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), UTP11 has been identified as a risk prognostic gene, with its expression linked to poorer overall survival. It is part of a prognostic gene signature used to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, impacting survival outcomes (Shi2020Identification).

## Interactions
UTP11 is a component of the small subunit (SSU) processome, a ribonucleoprotein complex essential for ribosome assembly. Within the SSU processome, UTP11 interacts with several proteins and RNA elements, playing a crucial role in the structural and functional organization of the complex. UTP11 is involved in connecting the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) with other regions of the SSU processome, interacting with proteins such as Nop1 and Bud21 (Barandun2017The). It also coordinates with proteins like Imp3, Bms1, and the N-terminus of Utp24 to stabilize RNA structures within the processome (Barandun2017The).

UTP11 participates in the remodeling of helix 18 of the 18S rRNA, working alongside Bms1 and Sas10 to stabilize the RNA and associated proteins (Barandun2017The). This interaction is crucial for the proper assembly of the ribosomal small subunit. UTP11 is also part of a group of multi-modular proteins characterized by unusual folds and numerous interaction partners, contributing to the assembly and stabilization of the SSU processome (Barandun2018Assembly). These interactions highlight UTP11's role in the intricate network of protein and RNA interactions necessary for ribosome biogenesis.
