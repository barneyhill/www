# CADPS2

## Overview
The CADPS2 gene encodes the protein calcium-dependent secretion activator 2, which is integral to the regulation of exocytosis in the nervous system. This protein is categorized as a synaptic protein and is crucial for the calcium-dependent release of neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), which are vital for neuronal development and function (Bonora2014Maternally; Sadakata2009Developmentally). CADPS2 is also involved in the refilling of catecholamine to releasable vesicles, playing a significant role in neurotransmission processes involving dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin (Hattori2012Blood). The protein's interactions with other synaptic components underscore its importance in maintaining synaptic function and communication between neurons. Mutations in the CADPS2 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability, highlighting its clinical significance (Bonora2014Maternally; Sadakata2009Developmentally).

## Function
The CADPS2 gene encodes a synaptic protein involved in the regulation of exocytosis, particularly in the nervous system. It plays a crucial role in the calcium-dependent release of neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), which are essential for neuronal development and function (Bonora2014Maternally; Sadakata2009Developmentally). CADPS2 is also involved in monoamine transmission, mediating the refilling of catecholamine to releasable vesicles, which is critical for neurotransmission processes involving dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin (Hattori2012Blood).

In healthy human cells, CADPS2 is expressed in a tissue- and temporal-specific manner, with monoallelic expression observed in the blood and amygdala, and biallelic expression in other brain areas like the cerebellum (Bonora2014Maternally). This expression pattern suggests that CADPS2 is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms, potentially involving differential methylation of CpG regions (Bonora2014Maternally).

The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it facilitates the docking and priming of secretory vesicles at the plasma membrane, ensuring proper synaptic function and communication between neurons (Sadakata2009Developmentally). CADPS2's role in synaptic function and neurotrophin release underscores its importance in maintaining normal neuronal development and function (Bonora2014Maternally).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CADPS2 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). The gene is located on chromosome 7q31-q33, a region associated with autism susceptibility. Studies have identified a novel intragenic deletion of maternal origin in CADPS2 in siblings with mild ID and epilepsy, suggesting a potential loss of function (Bonora2014Maternally). Additionally, several rare coding variants in CADPS2 have been associated with ASD and ID, including a missense variant, p.Asp1113Asn, which disrupts the interaction between CADPS2 and dopamine receptor type 2 (D2DR) (Bonora2014Maternally).

CADPS2 is involved in the release of neurotrophins like neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which are crucial for normal neuronal development. Knockout mice for CADPS2 exhibit autistic-like behaviors, such as impaired social interaction and increased anxiety, due to reduced secretion of these neurotrophins (Sadakata2009Developmentally). Aberrant splicing of CADPS2 mRNA, leading to exon 3 skipping, has been observed in some autistic patients, potentially affecting protein transport and contributing to autism susceptibility (Sadakata2007Autisticlike). These findings underscore the gene's role in neurodevelopmental disorders through disrupted protein interactions and altered expression patterns.

## Interactions
CADPS2, a synaptic protein, is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, influencing neurotrophin release and synaptic function. One significant interaction is with the dopamine receptor type 2 (D2DR). A specific missense variant, p.Asp1113Asn, disrupts this interaction, highlighting the importance of CADPS2 in modulating dopamine receptor activity (Bonora2014Maternally). CADPS2 also interacts with p150 Glued, a subunit of the dynactin complex involved in axonal transport. This interaction is mediated by the region coded by exon 3 of CADPS2, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Sadakata2007Autisticlike).

In the cerebellum, CADPS2 is associated with secretory granules containing neurotrophins such as BDNF and NT-3, distinct from typical synaptic vesicles. This association suggests a role in neurotrophin release, crucial for cerebellar development and maintenance (Sadakata2004The). The protein's interactions with these neurotrophins are essential for the survival and differentiation of neuronal cells, particularly Purkinje cells (Sadakata2007Autisticlike). These interactions underscore CADPS2's role in synaptic transmission and its potential implications in neurodevelopmental disorders.
