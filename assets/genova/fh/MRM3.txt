# MRM3

## Overview
MRM3, or mitochondrial rRNA methyltransferase 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the SpoU family of methyltransferases. This protein plays a pivotal role in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) by catalyzing the 2'-O-ribose methylation at the G1370 site on the A-loop of the 16S rRNA. Such modifications are crucial for the proper assembly and function of the mitochondrial large subunit (mt-LSU) of the mitoribosome, which is essential for mitochondrial translation and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) in human cells (Lopez2020Methylation; Cheng2021A). The MRM3 protein functions as a homodimer, a structural feature that facilitates its interaction with other assembly factors during the late stages of mitoribosome assembly (Cheng2021A). Its activity is conserved across species, underscoring its fundamental role in mitochondrial biology (Cheng2021A).

## Structure
The MRM3 protein is a methyltransferase that belongs to the SpoU family, characterized by a classical C-terminal methyltransferase domain and a structured N-terminal domain (Cheng2021A). This protein is involved in the methylation of mitochondrial rRNA, specifically catalyzing the 2'-O-ribose methylation at the G1370 site on the A-loop of the 16S rRNA (Cheng2021A). The MRM3 protein forms a homodimer, a common feature among SpoU family methyltransferases, which is crucial for its function in stabilizing the structural arrangement of the mitoribosome (Cheng2021A). The dimerization of MRM3 is essential for its interaction with other assembly factors, such as the RecA2 domain of DDX28, indicating a coordinated role in the recruitment of these factors during the late stages of mitoribosome assembly (Cheng2021A). The mode of modification by MRM3 is conserved across species, with similar processes observed in other organisms like Trypanosoma brucei and bacteria (Cheng2021A). The structural positioning of MRM3 in relation to the rRNA and other assembly factors highlights its critical role in the mitoribosome assembly process (Cheng2021A).

## Function
MRM3 (mitochondrial rRNA methyltransferase 3) is a crucial enzyme involved in the methylation of mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA), specifically at the Gm1370 site within the 16S rRNA A-loop of the mitochondrial large subunit (mt-LSU). This modification is essential for the proper assembly and function of the mitoribosome, which is critical for mitochondrial translation and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) function in healthy human cells (JedynakSlyvka2021Human; Lopez2020Methylation).

MRM3 operates by associating with the mt-LSU, as demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and sucrose gradient sedimentation analyses. The methylation of G1370 by MRM3 is believed to occur during the late stages of mitoribosome assembly, and its absence leads to reduced methylation, affecting mitochondrial translation and OxPhos function. This results in the accumulation of pre-ribosomal particles, indicating a disruption in mitoribosome assembly (Lopez2020Methylation).

MRM3 also plays a role in coordinating rRNA transcription and mitoribosome assembly, interacting with both the mt-LSU and non-ribosomal proteins. This suggests that MRM3 is involved in the broader process of mitochondrial RNA processing and modifications, which are vital for maintaining mitochondrial function (JedynakSlyvka2021Human).

## Interactions
MRM3, a mitochondrial rRNA methyltransferase, is involved in the methylation of G1370 in the mitochondrial large subunit (mt-LSU) of ribosomal RNA. This modification is crucial for mitochondrial translation and oxidative phosphorylation function. MRM3 associates with the mt-LSU, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and sucrose gradient sedimentation analyses, indicating a physical interaction with the ribosomal subunit (Lopez2020Methylation). The enzyme is also suggested to interact with non-ribosomal proteins, which may play a role in coordinating rRNA transcription and mitoribosome assembly (JedynakSlyvka2021Human).

MRM3's role in the assembly and function of the mitoribosome is highlighted by its association with the mt-LSU, suggesting that RNA methylation occurs directly at the mitoribosome, likely during late-stage assembly (Lopez2021Human). The downregulation of MRM3 results in the accumulation of pre-ribosomal particles, indicating that its interaction with the mt-LSU is essential for proper ribosome assembly (Lopez2020Methylation). While specific protein interactions involving MRM3 are not detailed, its association with the mt-LSU and potential interactions with other mitochondrial proteins underscore its importance in mitoribosome biogenesis and function.
