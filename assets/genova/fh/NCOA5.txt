# NCOA5

## Overview
NCOA5, or nuclear receptor coactivator 5, is a gene located on chromosome 20q13.1 that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of gene expression. The protein, also named nuclear receptor coactivator 5, functions as both a co-activator and co-repressor, interacting with various nuclear receptors, including estrogen receptors and orphan nuclear receptors. It plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation, glucose homeostasis, and cholesterol metabolism. NCOA5 is characterized by structural motifs that facilitate its interaction with nuclear receptors and transcription factors, influencing processes such as insulin signaling and immune responses. Clinically, alterations in NCOA5 expression or function have been linked to diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type 2 diabetes, hepatocellular carcinoma, and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Gao2013NCOA5; CHEN2022Coregulator; Rustemoglu2023Could).

## Structure
NCOA5, also known as nuclear receptor coactivator 5, is a protein encoded by the NCOA5 gene located on chromosome 20q13.1. The protein consists of 579 amino acids and is characterized by several distinct structural features. Near the C-terminal, NCOA5 contains overlapping LxxLL and ΦxxΦΦ motifs, which serve as co-activator and co-repressor motifs, respectively. These motifs form a bifunctional interaction determinant (BID) that is recognized by estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) and orphan nuclear receptors REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ (CHEN2022Coregulator).

At the N-terminal, NCOA5 has an arginine and aspartic acid-rich region (RD-rich region) that exhibits transcriptional inhibitory activity. It also contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) that binds to RNA and single-stranded DNA, playing a role in immune responses (CHEN2022Coregulator). The protein is involved in transcriptional regulation by interacting with nuclear receptors for steroids, such as α and β estrogen receptors, independently of the steroid-binding activation function-2 domain of the ERs (Koptan2021Analysis).

NCOA5 has two protein-coding transcripts, resulting in isoforms of 579 and 104 amino acids, with the first isoform localized in the nucleus (Koptan2021Analysis). The protein's structure and motifs enable it to function as both a co-activator and co-repressor in gene regulation.

## Function
NCOA5 (nuclear receptor coactivator 5) is a multifunctional protein that acts as both a co-activator and co-repressor of gene expression, influencing various molecular processes in healthy human cells. It interacts with nuclear receptors such as estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), orphan nuclear receptors (REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ), and the liver X receptor (LXR), modulating transcriptional activity through its LxxLL co-activator motif and ΦxxΦΦ co-repressor motif (CHEN2022Coregulator). NCOA5 is involved in the regulation of genes like interleukin 6 (IL-6), c-myc, and RORA, and it plays a role in RNA modification and transcriptional activity by interacting with transcription factors such as ZAP3 and TBX18 (CHEN2022Coregulator).

In cellular biology, NCOA5 is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis and regulating insulin signaling, as evidenced by its role in suppressing IL-6 expression, which is linked to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance (Gao2013NCOA5). It also influences cholesterol efflux in macrophages by acting as a corepressor for LXR, thereby inhibiting Abca1 expression (CHEN2022Coregulator). NCOA5 is active primarily in the nucleus, where it modulates the transcriptional activity of hormone receptors and other transcription factors, contributing to organismal homeostasis and development (CHEN2022Coregulator).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NCOA5 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In multiple sclerosis (MS), the rs2903908 polymorphism of NCOA5 is associated with increased susceptibility, with the CC genotype being more frequent in MS patients compared to healthy controls. This suggests a genetic predisposition linked to the C allele, which may recessively predispose individuals to MS (Rustemoglu2023Could).

NCOA5 haploinsufficiency is linked to the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In mice, a single functional copy of the NCOA5 gene leads to glucose intolerance and spontaneous HCC development, partly due to increased IL-6 expression. This suggests that NCOA5 acts as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor, with its deficiency increasing susceptibility to these conditions (Gao2013NCOA5).

In breast cancer, NCOA5 expression is significantly increased, promoting tumor progression through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Knockdown of NCOA5 in breast cancer cell lines results in decreased cell viability and migration, indicating its role as an oncogene in this context (Tan2021Knockdown). NCOA5 is also implicated in epithelial ovarian cancer, where higher expression correlates with poorer prognosis and advanced disease stage (Song2023Expression).

## Interactions
NCOA5 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene expression regulation. It interacts with estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ, as well as orphan nuclear receptors REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ, through its LxxLL co-activator motif and ΦxxΦΦ co-repressor motif. These interactions are crucial for its function as a co-regulator, particularly in the presence of estradiol (E2) (CHEN2022Coregulator).

NCOA5 also interacts with the liver X receptor (LXR), where it acts as a corepressor, inhibiting the expression of the Abca1 gene and affecting cholesterol efflux in macrophages (Khorasanizadeh2016Visualizing). In breast cancer, NCOA5 forms a complex with TPX2, influencing cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. This interaction is confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Wang2023Role).

Additionally, NCOA5 binds to the T-box of transcription factor TBX18, affecting transcriptional activity and promoting nephropathies development (CHEN2022Coregulator). It also interacts with transcription factor ZAP3 and protein phosphatase 1, suggesting a role in RNA modification (CHEN2022Coregulator). These interactions underscore NCOA5's multifaceted role in cellular processes and disease states.
