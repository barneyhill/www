# TBC1D24

## Overview
TBC1D24 is a gene that encodes the TBC1 domain family member 24 protein, which is a critical regulator of neuronal development and function. This protein is categorized as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and is involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics, playing a significant role in maintaining synaptic structures essential for cognitive processes such as learning and memory (Lin2020The). TBC1D24 interacts with small GTPases like ARF6 and Rab35, influencing dendritic spine morphogenesis and axonal outgrowth (Balestrini2016TBC1D24; Lin2020The). Mutations in the TBC1D24 gene are linked to various neurological disorders, including epilepsy and hearing loss, highlighting its importance in neuronal health and disease (Tona2019The; Zhang2019Infantile).

## Structure


## Function
The TBC1D24 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in neuronal development and function, particularly in the regulation of synaptic vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics. It is involved in maintaining excitatory synapses and dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons, which are essential for learning and memory (Lin2020The). TBC1D24 is expressed at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites, with a significant presence in the postsynaptic density, and is upregulated during the maturation of hippocampal neurons (Lin2020The).

The protein interacts with ARF6, a small GTPase, to regulate dendritic spine morphogenesis and synaptic maintenance by inhibiting ARF6 activity, which is crucial for the stability of dendritic spines (Lin2020The). TBC1D24 also plays a role in axonal outgrowth and membrane trafficking at the growth cone, influencing axon polarization and specification through its effect on ARF6 activation (Aprile2019TBC1D24).

In addition to its role in synaptic function, TBC1D24 is involved in protecting neurons from oxidative stress, which is vital for neuronal survival and differentiation (Finelli2018The). The gene's activity is crucial for normal presynaptic function, as it is involved in the exo-endocytotic cycle of synaptic vesicles, ensuring proper synaptic vesicle recycling (Finelli2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBC1D24 gene are associated with a variety of neurological disorders, primarily characterized by different forms of epilepsy and hearing loss. These include familial infantile myoclonic epilepsy (FIME), progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME), and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE16) (Tona2019The; Zhang2019Infantile). TBC1D24 mutations are also linked to DOORS syndrome, which is characterized by deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, intellectual disability, and seizures (Tona2019The; Balestrini2016TBC1D24). 

The gene is implicated in both autosomal dominant and recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, with specific mutations such as c.533C>T; p.Ser178Leu causing autosomal-dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (Azaiez2014TBC1D24Mutation). TBC1D24 mutations can lead to drug-resistant epilepsy, with common clinical features including multifocal myoclonus, epilepsia partialis continua, and fever-induced seizures (Zhang2019Infantile). 

The phenotypic spectrum of TBC1D24-related disorders is broad, ranging from isolated deafness to severe developmental delays and early death (Balestrini2016TBC1D24). The gene's mutations are distributed across the protein, affecting different interactions or alternative transcripts, contributing to the diverse phenotypes observed (Tona2019The).

## Interactions
The TBC1D24 protein interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in neuronal function and development. It is known to interact with ARF6, a small GTPase involved in membrane trafficking and neuronal development. This interaction is GDP-dependent and occurs at the plasma membrane, where TBC1D24 colocalizes with ARF6. Mutations in TBC1D24, such as D147H, can impair this interaction, affecting neuronal development and contributing to conditions like familial infantile myoclonic epilepsy (Falace2010TBC1D24).

TBC1D24 also interacts with ephrinB2, a transmembrane ligand, in neural crest cells. This interaction is mediated by the scaffold protein Dishevelled (Dsh) and is crucial for regulating contact inhibition of locomotion in these cells. The interaction involves the PDZ-binding motif of ephrinB2 and the F region within the TBC domain of TBC1D24, affecting the localization and function of both proteins (Yoon2018TBC1d24ephrinB2).

Additionally, TBC1D24 is involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and interacts with Rab35, another small GTPase. This interaction is important for synaptic function and neuronal development, with mutations in TBC1D24 affecting its binding to Rab35 and impairing neuronal processes (Balestrini2016TBC1D24).
