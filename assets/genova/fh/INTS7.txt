# INTS7

## Overview
The INTS7 gene encodes the integrator complex subunit 7 protein, which is a critical component of the integrator complex involved in RNA processing and transcription regulation. This protein plays a significant role in the processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) transcribed by RNA polymerase II, which is essential for RNA splicing and the stability of snRNAs (Xu2024Comprehensive). As part of the integrator complex, integrator complex subunit 7 is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and RNA polymerase II transcription termination (Li2022Correlation). The protein is associated with the nuclear envelope and contributes to the structural integrity of nuclear features such as Cajal bodies and histone locus bodies, which are crucial for snRNA biogenesis and histone mRNA production (Albrecht2018Integrator). The INTS7 gene has been implicated in several cancers, where its altered expression and mutation patterns are associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression (Li2022Correlation; Xu2024Comprehensive).

## Function
INTS7, a component of the integrator complex, plays a crucial role in RNA processing and transcription regulation in healthy human cells. It is involved in the processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) transcribed by RNA polymerase II, which is essential for RNA splicing and ensuring the stability and functionality of snRNAs (Xu2024Comprehensive). The integrator complex, including INTS7, is active in the nucleus and influences various cellular processes, such as gene expression regulation and RNA polymerase II transcription termination (Li2022Correlation).

INTS7 is associated with the nuclear envelope and is involved in non-coding RNA transcription, snRNA metabolic processes, and snRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II (Li2022Correlation). It also plays a role in biological regulation, metabolic processes, response to stimuli, cell proliferation, and growth (Xu2024Comprehensive). The integrator complex, with INTS7 as a part, is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of nuclear features like Cajal bodies and histone locus bodies, which are important for snRNA biogenesis and histone mRNA production (Albrecht2018Integrator). These activities highlight the importance of INTS7 in maintaining cellular function and integrity.

## Clinical Significance
The INTS7 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and mutation patterns. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, INTS7 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression correlates with poor prognosis, including higher TNM stages and worse overall survival rates. Silencing INTS7 in LUAD cell lines has been shown to reduce cell viability and invasion, suggesting its role in promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration while inhibiting apoptosis (Li2022Correlation).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), INTS7 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. Its expression is negatively correlated with immune infiltration, indicating a suppressive tumor immune microenvironment. INTS7 is also involved in DNA damage repair, which may contribute to cancer progression (Xu2024Comprehensive).

INTS7 mutations have been observed in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), where they are associated with hypermutation events. These mutations suggest a potential role for INTS7 as a driver gene in endometrial carcinoma, although its exact contribution to tumorigenesis remains to be fully elucidated (Federico2017PanCancer).

## Interactions
INTS7 is a component of the Integrator complex, which is involved in the processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and is associated with RNA polymerase II. Within the Integrator complex, INTS7 has been shown to interact directly with INTS2, as evidenced by chemical crosslinking studies and co-purification experiments using an affinity tag on INTS7 (Fianu2024Reconstitution). This interaction suggests a structural role for INTS7 within the complex.

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), INTS7 is part of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network that includes 10 co-expression genes. Functional enrichment analyses indicate that INTS7 is involved in non-coding RNA transcription, snRNA metabolic processes, and snRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II, processes associated with the nuclear envelope (Li2022Correlation). However, specific physical interactions of INTS7 with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed.

INTS7 also plays a role in UsnRNA processing, as its knockdown results in increased misprocessing of U1 snRNA, indicating its involvement in the cleavage process (Sabath2020INTS10–INTS13–INTS14). Despite these functional insights, detailed physical interactions of INTS7 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely unexplored.
