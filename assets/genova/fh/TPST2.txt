# TPST2

## Overview
Tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase 2 (TPST2) is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through the sulfation of tyrosine residues. This enzymatic process is crucial for various biological functions, including protein-protein interactions, immune response modulation, and receptor function. The TPST2 protein operates primarily in the trans-Golgi network, where it transfers sulfonate groups from 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to tyrosine residues, forming tyrosine O-sulfate esters. The enzyme's activity is essential for processes such as inflammation, haemostasis, and thyroid function. Structurally, TPST2 forms a homodimer, which is vital for its catalytic activity and substrate binding. Mutations in the TPST2 gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as hypothyroidism and growth retardation, underscoring its significance in normal physiological development and function (Teramoto2013Crystal; Westmuckett2013Salivary; Sasaki2007A).

## Structure
The human tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase 2 (TPST2) is a type II transmembrane protein involved in the sulfation of tyrosine residues in proteins. The primary structure of TPST2 includes a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a large C-terminal luminal domain, which contains the active site responsible for binding the substrate and the cofactor, 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) (Teramoto2013Crystal).

The secondary structure of TPST2 features a single alpha/beta motif with a five-stranded parallel beta-sheet flanked by alpha helices. Key structural motifs include the 5'-phosphosulfate-binding (5'-PSB) and 3'-phosphate-binding (3'-PB) motifs, which are conserved among sulfotransferase family members (Teramoto2013Crystal).

In terms of tertiary structure, TPST2 forms a homodimer mediated by three consecutive alpha-helices, which is crucial for forming the acceptor-substrate binding sites. The dimerization results in two active sites that bind two substrate peptides (Teramoto2013Crystal).

The quaternary structure of TPST2 involves dimerization, which, while not essential for catalysis, plays a significant role in substrate binding. The enzyme's substrate-binding site is a deep narrow cleft formed by the dimer interface (Teramoto2013Crystal). The dimeric form of TPST2 is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and is essential for its catalytic activity (Singh2016Dimerization).

## Function
Tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase 2 (TPST2) is an enzyme that catalyzes the sulfation of tyrosine residues in proteins, a critical post-translational modification. This process occurs in the trans-Golgi network, where TPST2 transfers a sulfonate group from 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues, forming a tyrosine O-sulfate ester (Teramoto2013Crystal; Danan2010Catalytic). This modification is essential for extracellular protein-protein interactions, influencing processes such as inflammation, haemostasis, and viral infection (Teramoto2013Crystal).

TPST2 is a type II transmembrane Golgi-associated enzyme that forms a homodimer, which is crucial for its function as it creates the substrate-binding sites (Teramoto2013Crystal). The enzyme's activity is influenced by Mn2+ ions and operates through an SN2-like inline displacement mechanism (Teramoto2013Crystal). TPST2 specifically recognizes acceptor tyrosine residues on substrate proteins through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, requiring the acceptor tyrosine to be in a flexible region to fit into the enzyme's active site (Teramoto2013Crystal).

The sulfation of proteins by TPST2 affects various biological processes, including the modulation of protein half-life in circulation and inflammatory leukocyte adhesion. It is also crucial for the function of certain receptors, such as the thyrotropin receptor, which is essential for proper thyroid function (Teramoto2013Crystal; Sasaki2007A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TPST2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in tyrosine sulfation, which is crucial for normal thyroid function and development. A notable mutation in TPST2 leads to dwarfism and hypothyroidism, as observed in the growth-retarded (grt) mouse model. This mutation results in a loss of enzymatic activity, affecting the sulfation of the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which is essential for proper thyroid signaling and function (Sasaki2007A). The mutation causes elevated TSH levels and reduced T3 and T4 levels, leading to thyroid hypogenesis and associated growth retardation (Sasaki2007A).

In mice, TPST2 deficiency also results in salivary gland hypofunction due to primary hypothyroidism. Tpst2-/- mice exhibit smaller salivary glands and reduced salivary flow, which can be ameliorated by thyroid hormone replacement, indicating a direct link between TPST2 mutations and thyroid-related dysfunctions (Westmuckett2013Salivary). Additionally, TPST2 mutations have been implicated in early postnatal pulmonary failure and cardiopulmonary insufficiency in mice, further highlighting its critical role in developmental processes (Westmuckett2008Early).

## Interactions
Tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase 2 (TPST2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in catalyzing the sulfation of tyrosine residues. TPST2 forms a homodimer, which is essential for its catalytic activity. This dimerization is facilitated by interactions mediated through three consecutive alpha-helices, which are crucial for forming the acceptor-substrate binding sites (Teramoto2013Crystal).

TPST2 interacts with its substrate peptides in a specific manner. For instance, the phenolic hydroxyl group of the tyrosine acceptor in the substrate forms hydrogen bonds with the residue E99, and the aromatic ring interacts hydrophobically with P77. These interactions are critical for substrate recognition and binding (Teramoto2013Crystal).

In the context of cancer immunity, TPST2 interacts with the interferon gamma receptor 1 (IFNGR1), where it mediates the tyrosine sulfation of IFNGR1 at the Y397 residue. This interaction modulates IFNγ signaling, affecting antigen presentation and immune response in tumor cells. Knockdown of TPST2 enhances IFNγ signaling by reducing the sulfotyrosine levels of IFNGR1, thereby increasing the expression of IFNγ-responsive genes (Oh2024Genomewide).
