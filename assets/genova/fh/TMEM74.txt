# TMEM74

## Overview
TMEM74 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 74, which is characterized by its involvement in critical cellular processes such as autophagy and neuronal excitability. As a transmembrane protein, TMEM74 is integral to the regulation of autophagy, a cellular mechanism for degrading and recycling cellular components, particularly under stress conditions like starvation. It achieves this by interacting with key autophagy-related proteins, thereby influencing pathways that maintain cellular energy homeostasis. In the nervous system, TMEM74 modulates neuronal excitability through its interaction with hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 1 (HCN1) channels, particularly in the basolateral amygdala, which is associated with anxiety-like behaviors. The gene's expression levels have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer and anxiety disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Yu2008TMEM74; Shao2019Functional; Sun2017TMEM74).

## Structure
TMEM74 is a protein encoded by the TMEM74 gene, characterized by its two transmembrane domains, TM1 and TM2. The TM1 domain, spanning amino acids 178–198, is crucial for the protein's localization to the cell membrane and its interaction with HCN1 channels, which is important for regulating neuronal excitability and anxiety-like behaviors (Shao2019Functional). The TM2 domain, spanning amino acids 232–252, is also part of the protein's structure, but its deletion does not affect the interaction with HCN1, indicating a lesser role in this specific function (Shao2019Functional).

TMEM74 is involved in promoting autophagy in tumor cells through interactions with autophagy-related proteins such as ATG16L1 and ATG9A. These interactions are facilitated by the protein's transmembrane domains, which are essential for its autophagic activity (Sun2017TMEM74). The protein's C-terminal region is involved in its association with ATG16L1, influencing the formation of the ATG5-ATG12/ATG16L1 complex, crucial for autophagy (Sun2017TMEM74). The specific details of TMEM74's secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as any post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
TMEM74 is a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of autophagy, a critical cellular process for degrading and recycling cellular components. It localizes to lysosomes and autophagosomes, where it plays a role in promoting autophagic activity, particularly under conditions of cellular stress such as starvation. Overexpression of TMEM74 in HeLa cells has been shown to induce autophagic vacuolization and increase levels of LC3-II, a marker of autophagic activity, suggesting its role in enhancing the degradation of cytoplasmic contents to provide essential nutrients and energy (Yu2008TMEM74).

TMEM74 interacts with autophagy-related proteins such as ATG16L1 and ATG9A, and its overexpression activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is known to regulate cell survival and autophagy. This interaction supports cell survival by maintaining energy homeostasis, particularly under metabolic stress conditions (Sun2017TMEM74).

In the brain, TMEM74 is involved in modulating neuronal excitability through its interaction with hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 1 (HCN1) channels in the basolateral amygdala. This interaction is crucial for maintaining normal neuronal function and is associated with anxiety-like behaviors when TMEM74 expression is altered (Shao2019Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TMEM74 gene have been linked to various diseases, particularly cancer and anxiety disorders. In cancer, TMEM74 is associated with tumor cell survival through its role in inducing autophagy. High expression levels of TMEM74 correlate with reduced relapse-free survival in certain subtypes of breast cancer, such as the basal-like 1 Pietenpol subtype, and in grades 1 and 2 breast cancer. Similarly, elevated TMEM74 expression is linked to decreased first progression survival in diffuse, intestinal, and mixed types of gastric cancer, as well as stage 3 gastric cancer. These findings suggest that TMEM74 expression is closely tied to tumor progression and may serve as a target for cancer therapy or as a prognostic factor (Sun2017TMEM74).

In the context of anxiety disorders, TMEM74 is highly expressed in the brain and is associated with anxiety-like behaviors. Decreased expression of TMEM74 is observed in the serum of patients with anxiety and in the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus of mice under chronic stress. Genetic deletion or knockdown of TMEM74 in these neurons leads to anxiety-like behaviors, linked to altered neuronal excitability. Overexpression of TMEM74 can restore normal function and reduce anxiety-like behaviors, indicating its potential as a target for anxiety disorder treatments (Shao2019Functional).

## Interactions
TMEM74, a transmembrane protein, is involved in several interactions with other proteins that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with autophagy-related proteins such as ATG16L1 and ATG9A, facilitating the formation of the ATG5-ATG12/ATG16L1 complex, which is essential for autophagy. TMEM74 associates with ATG16L1 via its WD domain and with ATG9A through its N-terminal region, influencing the interaction between ATG9A and WIPI1, which is important for ATG9A trafficking (Sun2017TMEM74). These interactions promote autophagic flux and are independent of the BECN1/PI3KC3 complex and ULK1, acting downstream of these pathways (Sun2017TMEM74).

TMEM74 also interacts with HCN1 channels, particularly in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons, where it regulates the I_h current. This interaction is crucial for maintaining neuronal excitability and is mediated by the TM1 domain of TMEM74. The absence of TMEM74 leads to decreased HCN1 surface expression and impaired I_h currents, which can be restored by reexpressing TMEM74 (Shao2019Functional). These interactions highlight TMEM74's role in both autophagy and neuronal function, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and anxiety disorders.
