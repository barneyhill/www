# PLIN4

## Overview
PLIN4, or perilipin 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the perilipin family, which is integral to lipid metabolism and storage. The perilipin 4 protein is primarily associated with lipid droplets (LDs), cellular organelles that store neutral lipids, and plays a crucial role in regulating lipid turnover and energy homeostasis. The protein is characterized by a giant amphipathic helix (AH) that facilitates its binding to LDs, contributing to the stabilization and dynamics of these organelles. PLIN4 is predominantly expressed in oxidative slow-twitch muscle fibers, where it influences lipid droplet size and number, particularly in response to physical activity (Pourteymour2015Perilipin). The gene's expression is modulated by exercise and is implicated in various physiological and pathological conditions, including obesity, muscle disorders, and cancer (Maggi2023PLIN4related; Richardson2011The; Sirois2019A).

## Structure
The PLIN4 protein is characterized by a giant amphipathic helix (AH) that is significantly longer than other known AHs involved in organelle targeting. This helix consists of 29 tandem 33-mer repeats, forming a 3-11 helix structure similar to those found in apolipoproteins and α-synuclein (Čopič2018A). The AH is intrinsically unfolded in solution but adopts a helical structure upon contact with lipid droplets (LDs) or membranes (Čopič2018A). The primary structure of PLIN4 includes a highly repetitive sequence, with 11-mer repeat sequences that are crucial for its localization to LDs (Čopič2018A).

The secondary structure of PLIN4 is suggested to form an α-helix upon interaction with neutral lipids, which increases its resistance to proteolysis (Čopič2018A). The tertiary structure is not explicitly detailed, but the protein's ability to form a super long helix in the presence of liposomes supports a model of low-affinity interactions over an extended surface, stabilizing the bound AH (Čopič2018A). The quaternary structure is not described in the available context.

PLIN4's AH is characterized by a unique amino acid composition, with a low presence of aromatic residues and a high enrichment of threonine, glycine, and valine, contributing to its low hydrophobicity (Čopič2018A). The protein's interaction with LDs is enhanced under conditions of phospholipid depletion, suggesting a role in stabilizing LDs by substituting for phospholipids (Čopič2018A).

## Function
PLIN4 (perilipin 4) is a protein that plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and storage within human cells. It is primarily associated with lipid droplets, which are cellular organelles involved in the storage of neutral lipids. In skeletal muscle, PLIN4 is predominantly located near the sarcolemma, the plasma membrane of muscle cells, and is more highly expressed in oxidative slow-twitch muscle fibers compared to fast-twitch fibers (Pourteymour2015Perilipin). This localization suggests a role in the regulation of lipid droplet dynamics, particularly in the subsarcolemmal region of muscle fibers (Pourteymour2015Perilipin).

PLIN4 is involved in the regulation of lipid turnover, influencing the size and number of lipid droplets in response to physical activity. Its expression is modulated by exercise, with a decrease observed following long-term training, which correlates with a reduction in lipid droplet size in the subsarcolemmal region (Pourteymour2015Perilipin). The protein is also implicated in phospholipid biosynthesis, as its expression correlates with genes involved in this process, such as CPT1B and MLYCD (Pourteymour2015Perilipin). These functions highlight PLIN4's role in maintaining energy homeostasis and muscle adaptation to exercise.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PLIN4 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In obesity-related phenotypes, the PLIN4 variant rs8887 is significant due to its creation of a novel miR-522 seed site, which is predicted to reduce PLIN4 protein levels by 20%. This variant interacts with dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), particularly n3, influencing anthropometric traits and potentially modulating obesity through PPAR-mediated pathways (Richardson2011The).

PLIN4 is also implicated in a rare autophagic vacuolar myopathy, as seen in an Italian family with a large expansion in the PLIN4 gene. This expansion leads to perilipin 4 accumulation in muscle fibers, activating the aggrephagy pathway and causing muscle weakness, particularly in the lower limbs (Maggi2023PLIN4related).

In the context of cancer, PLIN4 is identified as a marker and potential therapeutic target in chemoresistant triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). High PLIN4 expression is associated with the DOXO-R phenotype, characterized by metabolic reprogramming and lipid droplet stabilization, which are crucial for the survival of chemoresistant cells (Sirois2019A).

Additionally, PLIN4 loss-of-function variants are associated with altered body fat distribution and metabolic health, potentially increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes (Koprulu2021Identification).

## Interactions
PLIN4, a member of the perilipin family, is primarily associated with lipid droplets (LDs) and plays a role in lipid metabolism. While specific protein-protein interactions involving PLIN4 are not extensively detailed, some insights can be drawn from its structural and functional characteristics. PLIN4 is known for its amphipathic helix (AH), which facilitates its binding to LDs. This binding is influenced by the polar residues and multimeric assembly of PLIN4, suggesting a network-like organization on the LD surface, akin to apolipoproteins in lipoprotein particles (GiménezAndrés2020Exceptional).

PLIN4's interaction with lipid droplets is characterized by its ability to form a homogeneous coat on LDs, which is highly reversible and adapted for stabilizing LDs, especially under conditions of limited phospholipids (Čopič2018A). The protein's low hydrophobicity allows for reversible interactions with LDs while minimizing binding to other cellular membranes (Čopič2018A).

Although PLIN4's interactions with other proteins such as ATGL or ABHD5 have not been directly investigated, it is suggested that PLIN4 may substitute the phospholipid coating of LDs, indicating a potential role in modulating lipid droplet surface properties (Hofer2020The). The specific interactions of PLIN4 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain an area for further research.
