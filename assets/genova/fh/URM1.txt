# URM1

## Overview
URM1, or ubiquitin related modifier 1, is a gene that encodes a ubiquitin-like protein involved in various cellular processes, including post-translational modifications and stress response mechanisms. The URM1 protein is characterized by a β-grasp fold, a structural motif common among ubiquitin-like proteins, which facilitates its role in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling pathways (Xu2006Solution). Functionally, URM1 is integral to tRNA thiolation, a process essential for accurate protein synthesis, and it plays a significant role in cellular responses to oxidative stress by modifying proteins such as 2-Cys peroxiredoxin Ahp1 (Zhang2021The; Van2011Role). URM1's interactions with various proteins, including tumor suppressors and oncoproteins, underscore its involvement in cancer progression and stress-related cellular functions (ElHajjar2023UbiquitinRelated; Hleihel2018The). Its clinical significance is highlighted by its potential role in modulating cancer cell behavior and its protective function against oxidative stress, suggesting that URM1 may be a critical factor in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing disease progression (ElHajjar2023UbiquitinRelated; Van2011Role).

## Structure
The URM1 protein, a ubiquitin-related modifier, exhibits a structure characterized by a β-grasp fold, which is a common feature among ubiquitin-like proteins. This fold includes a five-strand β-sheet and four α-helices, with the β-sheet arranged in a manner similar to ubiquitin. The α-helices support the curved β-sheet, forming a hydrophobic core crucial for maintaining the protein's compact structure (Xu2006Solution). The C-terminal region of URM1 is flexible and extends as a tail, which is a notable structural feature (Xu2006Solution).

URM1 shares structural similarities with the MoaD-related protein from Thermus thermophilus, with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 2.3 Å, indicating a close resemblance (Xu2006Solution). The protein's surface features a hydrophobic patch formed by conserved residues such as Ile-66, Leu-68, and Leu-76, which are likely involved in protein-protein interactions (Xu2006Solution). The electrostatic surface of URM1 is dominated by negative potential, suggesting a unique recognition mechanism distinct from ubiquitination (Xu2006Solution). These structural characteristics align URM1 more closely with the MoaD-related fold within the ubiquitin superfamily (Xu2006Solution).

## Function
URM1 (ubiquitin related modifier 1) is a ubiquitin-like protein that plays a significant role in post-translational modification processes in human cells. It functions primarily as a sulfur carrier involved in tRNA thiolation, which is crucial for the modification of uridine at the wobble position of tRNA, thereby facilitating accurate translation and protein synthesis (Zhang2021The; Van2011Role). URM1 is activated by the E1-like enzyme Uba4, which thiocarboxylates URM1, enabling it to modify target proteins through a process known as urmylation (Zhang2021The; Van2011Role).

In addition to its role in tRNA thiolation, URM1 is involved in cellular stress responses, particularly oxidative stress. It conjugates to proteins such as the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin Ahp1, which is involved in detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining redox homeostasis (Zhang2021The; Van2011Role). URM1's activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of oxidative stress tolerance and apoptosis, and is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in liver cancer (Zhang2021The). The protein's dual role in protein modification and tRNA thiolation underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and stress response mechanisms (Zhang2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the URM1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In breast cancer, URM1 plays a significant role in modulating the tumor suppressor protein connexin 43 (Cx43). Downregulation of URM1 in breast cancer cells is associated with decreased levels of Cx43, leading to increased expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. This suggests that loss of URM1 promotes EMT and cancer progression, while its upregulation can reverse these effects, indicating a protective role against cancer progression (ElHajjar2023UbiquitinRelated).

URM1 is also involved in cellular stress responses, particularly under oxidative stress conditions. It functions as a noncanonical lysine-directed protein modifier, and its conjugation to target proteins is enhanced by oxidative stress. This process, known as urmylation, is crucial for cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress, and disruptions in this pathway may contribute to stress-related cellular dysfunctions (Van2011Role).

While specific diseases directly linked to URM1 mutations are not detailed in the provided context, its role in stress response and cancer suggests potential implications in related pathologies.

## Interactions
URM1 (ubiquitin related modifier 1) is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its role as a protein modifier. It interacts with the tumor suppressor protein connexin 43 (Cx43) in breast cancer cell lines, where it modulates Cx43 through post-translational modifications such as URMylation and SUMOylation. This interaction affects Cx43's localization and function, influencing cancer cell behavior (ElHajjar2023UbiquitinRelated).

URM1 also interacts with the HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax, modifying it through urmylation. This modification alters Tax's subcellular localization, shifting it to the cytoplasm and enhancing its ability to activate NF-κB signaling pathways (Hleihel2018The).

In Drosophila melanogaster, URM1 interacts with multiple proteins involved in intracellular signaling pathways, including Jafrac1, Ciao1, and MsrA/Eip71CD. These interactions are crucial for processes such as oxidative stress response and chromatin remodeling (Khoshnood2017A).

URM1's interaction with Uba4 is essential for its role in tRNA thiolation, where it acts as a sulfur donor. This interaction is critical for the formation of thiocarboxylated URM1, which is necessary for tRNA modification (Zhang2021The).
