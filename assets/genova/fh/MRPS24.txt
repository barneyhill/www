# MRPS24

## Overview
MRPS24 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S24, a crucial component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to the process of mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins necessary for mitochondrial function and energy production (Pagmantidis2008Supplementation). As a part of the ribosomal machinery, MRPS24 is involved in the assembly and stability of the mitochondrial ribosome, interacting with other ribosomal proteins and factors to ensure efficient protein synthesis (He2012Human). The evolutionary conservation of MRPS24, with homology to bacterial ribosomal proteins, underscores its fundamental role in cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis (Smits2007Reconstructing). Additionally, MRPS24 expression is modulated in response to cellular conditions, such as selenium supplementation and cancer-related stress, highlighting its potential involvement in adaptive cellular responses and disease processes (Mercier2012Caveolin1).

## Function
MRPS24 encodes a protein that is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a critical role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which is essential for mitochondrial function and energy production (Pagmantidis2008Supplementation). The expression of MRPS24 is upregulated in response to selenium supplementation, indicating its involvement in enhancing the protein biosynthesis capacity of cells (Pagmantidis2008Supplementation). 

In the context of cancer, MRPS24 expression is significantly increased in the tumor stroma of breast cancer patients, suggesting a role in the stress response to catabolic processes like autophagy and mitophagy. This upregulation is associated with mTOR/S6-kinase signaling, which is linked to cancer progression and clinical outcomes such as tumor recurrence and metastasis (Mercier2012Caveolin1). 

Overall, MRPS24 is integral to mitochondrial function, impacting cellular respiration and metabolism. Its activity is crucial for maintaining the efficiency of mitochondrial protein synthesis, which is vital for the energy demands of cells and the overall metabolic health of the organism.

## Interactions
MRPS24 is a component of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit (28S) and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It is part of the mRNA channel in the 28S subunit, specifically constituting the entry region along with MRPS5 and MRPS39 (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). This positioning suggests that MRPS24 may interact transiently with mitochondrial mRNA during translation, facilitating the entry of mRNA into the ribosome for protein synthesis.

MRPS24 has been identified as interacting with the human gene C4orf14, which is involved in the biogenesis of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit. C4orf14 specifically interacts with the 28S mitochondrial ribosomal subunit, and MRPS24 was one of the proteins identified as significantly associated with C4orf14 through mass spectrometry analysis (He2012Human). The isotope ratios for MRPS24 in these experiments indicate a strong association, suggesting that MRPS24 may play a role in the assembly or stability of the mitochondrial ribosome.

The evolutionary analysis of MRPS24 suggests a distant homology with the bacterial RPS3 ribosomal protein family, indicating a potential functional similarity in ribosome assembly or function (Smits2007Reconstructing). This evolutionary link highlights the conserved nature of MRPS24's role in ribosomal function across different species.
