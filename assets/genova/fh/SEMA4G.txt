# SEMA4G

## Overview
SEMA4G is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 4G, which is part of the semaphorin family known for their roles in axon guidance and cell migration. Semaphorin 4G is a transmembrane protein that primarily interacts with the Plexin-B2 receptor, playing a significant role in neural development, particularly in the cerebellum. It is expressed by Purkinje cells and is involved in the migration of granule cell precursors, contributing to cerebellar morphogenesis (Maier2011Semaphorin). While the deletion of SEMA4G alone does not result in an overt phenotype, it can exacerbate cerebellar defects when combined with mutations in SEMA4C, indicating a redundant or compensatory function (Maier2011Semaphorin). Beyond its developmental roles, SEMA4G has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, schizophrenia, and diabetes mellitus, although its precise physiological and pathological roles in humans remain to be fully elucidated (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins; Nojima2022Class).

## Function
The function of the SEMA4G gene in healthy human cells is not well understood. However, studies in mouse models provide some insights into its potential roles. SEMA4G acts as a ligand for the Plexin-B2 receptor, which is involved in cerebellar development. It is expressed by Purkinje cells and may promote the migration of granule cell precursors (GCPs) in the cerebellum, suggesting a role in neural development (Maier2011Semaphorin). Although SEMA4G deletion alone does not result in an overt phenotype in mice, it enhances the cerebellar defects observed in Sema4C mutants, indicating a redundant role with Sema4C (Maier2011Semaphorin).

SEMA4G is also mentioned as a component of disease signatures, including cancers, schizophrenia, and diabetes mellitus, but its specific physiological roles in humans remain unclear (Nojima2022Class). In terms of molecular processes, semaphorins, including SEMA4G, are involved in cell migration, axon guidance, and dendritic branching, which are crucial for proper neural connectivity and plasticity (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins). Despite these findings, the precise functions of SEMA4G in healthy human cells require further investigation.

## Clinical Significance
SEMA4G has been implicated in various diseases and conditions, although its specific clinical significance is not fully understood. In cerebellar development, SEMA4G acts as a ligand for Plexin-B2, and mutations in SEMA4G can lead to cerebellar defects, particularly when combined with mutations in SEMA4C. This suggests a potential interaction between these semaphorins in cerebellar morphogenesis (Nojima2022Class; Maier2011Semaphorin). 

In the context of cancer, SEMA4G has been identified as part of genetic signatures associated with cancers, including thyroid carcinoma. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), SEMA4G rs4919510, has been studied for its association with thyroid carcinoma susceptibility. While this variant does not significantly affect overall thyroid carcinoma risk, it appears to have a protective effect in individuals younger than 44 years and non-drinkers (Shen2023Variants).

SEMA4G is also mentioned in the context of other diseases such as schizophrenia and diabetes mellitus, indicating its potential involvement in these conditions, although specific clinical details are not provided (Nojima2022Class).

## Interactions
SEMA4G, or semaphorin 4G, is known to interact with Plexin-B2, serving as a ligand for this receptor. This interaction is particularly significant in the context of cerebellar development, where SEMA4G, along with SEMA4C, promotes the migration of cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs) in a Plexin-B2-dependent manner (Maier2011Semaphorin). SEMA4G is expressed by Purkinje cells and is thought to influence GCP migration through its localization on Purkinje cell dendritic arbors (Maier2011Semaphorin).

The interaction between SEMA4G and Plexin-B2 has been demonstrated in vitro, where SEMA4G binds specifically to Plexin-B2 but not to other plexins such as Plexin-B1 or Plexin-B3 (Maier2011Semaphorin). This specificity suggests a unique role for SEMA4G in the signaling pathways mediated by Plexin-B2. The deletion of SEMA4G alone does not result in an overt phenotype, but its combined deletion with SEMA4C enhances cerebellar defects, indicating a compensatory interaction between these semaphorins (Nojima2022Class; Maier2011Semaphorin). These findings highlight the importance of SEMA4G in the semaphorin-plexin signaling network, particularly in neural development.
