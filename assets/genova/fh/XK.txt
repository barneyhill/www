# XK

## Overview
The XK gene encodes the X-linked Kx blood group antigen, a polytopic integral membrane protein that plays a significant role in the structural and functional integrity of red blood cells. This protein is characterized by its transmembrane nature, spanning the membrane ten times, and is involved in critical cellular processes such as lipid scrambling and antigen presentation. The XK protein forms a complex with the Kell blood group antigen, which is essential for the proper expression of Kell antigens and the presence of the Kx antigen on red blood cells. Additionally, XK interacts with the VPS13A protein, facilitating lipid transport between organelles and contributing to cellular homeostasis. Mutations in the XK gene are linked to McLeod syndrome, a rare X-linked disorder that manifests with neurological, muscular, and hematological abnormalities (Ho1994Isolation; Russo1998Association; Park2020XK).

## Structure
The XK protein is a membrane protein encoded by the XK gene, characterized by its structural features typical of membrane transport proteins. It consists of 444 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 50.9 kDa (Ho1994Isolation; Lee2000The). The protein spans the membrane ten times, with both the N and C termini located intracellularly (Lee2000The). The transmembrane segments are hydrophobic and contain charged residues, which may form salt bridges or hydrophilic pores, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Ho1994Isolation; Lee2000The).

The XK protein has a large intracellular C-terminal domain composed of 71 amino acids and a short N-terminal intracellular segment (Lee2000The). It contains numerous potential phosphorylation sites, particularly in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, and is phosphorylated by casein kinase II and protein kinase C (Lee2000The). The protein forms a disulfide-bonded complex with the Kell protein, involving a single extracellular cysteine residue in XK and cysteine 72 in Kell (Russo1998Association). This interaction is crucial for the structural and functional association between the XK and Kell proteins (Russo1998Association).

## Function
The XK gene encodes a polytopic integral membrane protein that is primarily located in the plasma membrane of red blood cells. It forms a complex with the Kell blood group antigen protein, playing a crucial role in maintaining red cell membrane integrity and function (Russo1998Association). The XK protein is involved in lipid scrambling, a process that flips phospholipids between the leaflets of a lipid bilayer, which is essential for maintaining membrane asymmetry and facilitating cellular processes (Park2020XK). This activity is particularly important in the context of immune cell function, where XK's scramblase activity is necessary for the extracellular exposure of phosphatidylserine in response to ATP (Park2022Interaction).

XK interacts with the VPS13A protein, forming a complex that is crucial for lipid transport between organelles and the proper localization of VPS13A within the cell (Park2020XK). This interaction is essential for the long-term survival of striatal neurons and normal red blood cell morphology, linking XK to neurodegenerative disorders when mutated (Park2020XK). The XK protein's role as a transporter and its involvement in antigen presentation suggest its function extends beyond red blood cells to other tissues where it is expressed (Russo1998Association).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the XK gene are primarily associated with McLeod syndrome, a rare X-linked multisystem disorder. This condition is characterized by neurological impairments, muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, and hematological abnormalities, including acanthocytic red blood cells and weakened Kell antigens (Ho1994Isolation; Danek2001McLeod). The absence of the Kx antigen, a prominent biochemical defect in McLeod syndrome, results from XK gene mutations, leading to a reduction in Kell antigens (Ho1994Isolation; Rampoldi2002Clinical).

Clinical manifestations of McLeod syndrome are heterogeneous, with psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairments being common initial symptoms. Some patients also experience chorea, seizures, and elevated serum creatine kinase levels (Danek2001McLeod; Jung2001Mcleod). The XK protein's role in neuronal degeneration is supported by its homology with the CED-8 protein in C. elegans, which controls programmed cell death (Jung2001Mcleod).

Mutations in the XK gene include deletions, insertions, nonsense mutations, and splicing mutations, generally leading to a loss of XK function (Danek2001McLeod; Rampoldi2002Clinical). The clinical features of McLeod syndrome are variable, making genotype-phenotype correlation challenging (Jung2001Mcleod).

## Interactions
The XK protein is known for its interactions with the Kell protein and VPS13A. On the surface of red blood cells, XK forms a complex with the Kell protein through a disulfide bond between XK cysteine 347 and Kell cysteine 72. This interaction is crucial for the proper expression of Kell antigens and the presence of the Kx antigen on red blood cells. In McLeod phenotype red cells, which lack XK, there is a notable absence of Kx antigen and a reduction in Kell antigens, highlighting the importance of this interaction (Russo1998Association; Lee2000The).

XK also interacts with VPS13A, a protein involved in lipid transport. This interaction is mediated by the second intracellular loop of XK, which contains a conserved sequence critical for binding to the VPS13A PH domain. Mutations in this loop can disrupt the binding and co-localization with VPS13A, as demonstrated in cellular studies (Park2022Interaction). The interaction between XK and VPS13A is essential for preventing VPS13A-related diseases, as the loss of functional VPS13A-XK complexes is implicated in disorders such as Chorea Acanthocytosis and McLeod Syndrome (Park2020XK; Park2022Interaction).
