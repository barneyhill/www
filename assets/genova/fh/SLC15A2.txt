# SLC15A2

## Overview
The SLC15A2 gene encodes the protein Peptide transporter 2 (PepT2), which is a member of the solute carrier family 15 and the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS). PepT2 functions as a proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter, primarily facilitating the uptake of di- and tripeptides in renal and intestinal epithelial cells. This transmembrane protein plays a significant role in nutrient absorption and the pharmacokinetics of peptide-based drugs, such as beta-lactam antibiotics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The gene is predominantly expressed in the kidney, where it contributes to the reabsorption of dietary peptides and drug compounds. Variations in SLC15A2 can influence drug disposition and response, underscoring its importance in personalized medicine and its potential as a prognostic biomarker in certain cancers (Brecht2020Uptake; Cheong2011Screening; Huang2021SLC15A4).

## Structure
The SLC15A2 gene encodes the protein Peptide transporter 2 (PepT2), which is a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) and the Solute Carrier Family 15 (SLC15). PepT2 is composed of 729 amino acids and features a core transporter unit with twelve transmembrane helices (TMs), organized into two six-helix bundles, characteristic of the MFS fold (Killer2021Structural). These bundles are connected by a long cytoplasmic linker known as the 'bundle bridge,' which is amphipathic and associated with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (Killer2021Structural).

PepT2 also contains an extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain located between TM9 and TM10, which may serve as an interaction platform for proteases, although it is not essential for substrate transport (Killer2021Structural). The transport mechanism of PepT2 follows the alternating access model, involving conformational transitions between outward open, occluded, and inward open states (Killer2021Structural; Lichtinger2024The). The protein's structure is crucial for its function in transporting di- and tripeptides across epithelial membranes, utilizing the inward-directed electrochemical proton gradient (Killer2021Structural).

## Function
The SLC15A2 gene encodes a proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter, primarily involved in the uptake of di- and tripeptides in renal and intestinal epithelial cells. This transporter plays a crucial role in nutrient absorption and the delivery of peptide-based drugs. SLC15A2 is expressed predominantly in the kidney, specifically in the S3 segment, where it facilitates the reabsorption of dietary digestion products and peptido-mimetic drugs (Brecht2020Uptake). The transporter recognizes a wide spectrum of pharmacologically active compounds, including beta-lactam antibiotics and inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (Cheong2011Screening).

Genetic variations in SLC15A2, such as F350L, S409P, and K509R, have been shown to affect the Km values for glycyl-sarcosine, indicating differences in transport efficiency among individuals. These variations can influence drug disposition and pharmacological responses, highlighting the importance of SLC15A2 in personalized medicine (Cheong2011Screening). The transporter is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family, which is essential for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis by importing nutrients for cellular metabolism and exporting waste products and toxic compounds (Cheong2011Screening).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC15A2 gene have been associated with various clinical implications, particularly in drug response and cancer prognosis. Variants in SLC15A2, such as rs1143671 and rs1143672, have been identified as significant predictors of warfarin maintenance dose variability in the Chinese population. These genetic variations may affect the transport function of the encoded protein, potentially altering the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin, leading to a requirement for lower doses in individuals with these variants (Cai2017Identification).

In the context of cancer, SLC15A2 expression levels have been studied in various cancers, including lung cancer. The gene generally shows decreased expression in multiple cancer types, with a notable low expression level in lung cancer tissues. Despite this, higher expression of SLC15A2 has been associated with better survival rates in non-small cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Huang2021SLC15A4). However, the exact diseases or conditions directly linked to mutations in SLC15A2 remain unclear, as the gene's role is primarily highlighted in drug transport and cancer prognosis (Brecht2020Uptake; Cheong2011Screening).
