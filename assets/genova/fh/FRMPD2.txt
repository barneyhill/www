# FRMPD2

## Overview
FRMPD2 is a gene that encodes the protein FERM and PDZ domain containing 2, which is a scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in epithelial and neuronal cells. The protein is characterized by its modular structure, including a FERM domain and multiple PDZ domains, which facilitate its role in cell polarity, synaptic transmission, and cell-cell junction integrity. In epithelial cells, FRMPD2 is crucial for the basolateral targeting of membrane proteins, interacting with phosphatidylinositols and catenin family members to maintain cell architecture and polarity (Stenzel2009PDZdomaindirected). In the nervous system, it plays a significant role in synaptic function by anchoring NMDA receptor subunits, thereby influencing synaptic connectivity and excitatory transmission (Lu2018FRMPD2:). Alterations in the FRMPD2 gene have been linked to neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in neurodevelopment and immune response regulation (Kabi2012FRMBP2; Soto2024Gene).

## Structure
The FRMPD2 protein is characterized by a modular structure comprising an N-terminal KIND domain, a central FERM domain, and three C-terminal PDZ domains. The FERM domain is crucial for membrane localization, binding specifically to phosphatidylinositols such as PtdIns(3,4)P2, which is enriched at the basolateral domain of epithelial cells (Stenzel2009PDZdomaindirected). The PDZ2 domain is essential for basolateral targeting and interacts with members of the catenin family, implicating a cadherin-dependent localization mechanism (Stenzel2009PDZdomaindirected). 

In neuronal cells, the PDZ2 domain of FRMPD2 anchors the GluN2A subunit of NMDA receptors to synapses, playing a role in synaptic excitatory transmission (Lu2018FRMPD2:). The FERM domain also interacts with actin filaments, influencing dendritic spine morphology and synaptic connectivity (Lu2018FRMPD2:). 

The protein is approximately 140 kDa in size, and no additional coding regions or splice variant isoforms have been identified (Stenzel2009PDZdomaindirected). The FRMPD2 protein does not contain a phosphatase domain, which is present in some non-placental mammals, indicating a loss during eutherian evolution (Bhattacharyya2021Genomewide).

## Function
FRMPD2 is a multi-PDZ domain protein that plays a crucial role in the polarized localization of peripheral membrane proteins in epithelial cells. It is involved in basolateral targeting, which is essential for maintaining cell polarity and tight junction integrity. The protein localizes to the basolateral membrane in an E-cadherin-dependent manner, accumulating at E-cadherin-positive cell-cell contacts, suggesting its involvement in cell junctions (Stenzel2009PDZdomaindirected). The FERM domain of FRMPD2 binds to phosphatidylinositols, specifically PtdIns(3,4)P2, which is important for epithelial cell polarization (Stenzel2009PDZdomaindirected).

FRMPD2 interacts with members of the catenin family, such as p0071 and ARVCF, through its PDZ2 domain, which is crucial for its basolateral localization (Stenzel2009PDZdomaindirected). This interaction is important for the protein's recruitment to cell-cell contact sites and is necessary for the maintenance of epithelial cell architecture (Stenzel2009PDZdomaindirected). In addition to its role in epithelial cells, FRMPD2 is involved in NOD2 signaling in polarized intestinal epithelial cells, where it helps localize NOD2 to the basolateral membranes, crucial for immune responses (Kabi2012FRMBP2; Boyle2014Insights).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FRMPD2 gene have been associated with various neurological and developmental conditions. The gene encodes a scaffold protein involved in cell-cell junctions and polarization, playing a crucial role in neurodevelopment and synaptic signaling. In zebrafish models, the loss of Frmpd2 function has been linked to microcephaly and enhanced excitatory synaptic signaling, suggesting that disruptions in FRMPD2 can lead to significant developmental abnormalities (Soto2024Gene).

The FRMPD2 gene is also implicated in intellectual disability, autism, and epilepsy in children, particularly when recurrent deletions and duplications occur in the chromosome region 10q11.21q11.23, affecting both FRMPD2 and its paralog FRMPD2B. These genetic alterations may contribute to the upregulation of glutamate signaling and increased synaptic plasticity, which are fundamental to learning and memory but can also lead to neurodevelopmental disorders when dysregulated (Soto2024Gene).

Additionally, FRMPD2 has been identified as a modulator of NOD2 signaling, which is crucial for immune responses. Its role in directing NOD2 to the basolateral membrane in polarized epithelial cells is essential for maintaining gut homeostasis and may have implications in inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease (Kabi2012FRMBP2).

## Interactions
FRMPD2 is a scaffold protein that participates in various protein-protein interactions, primarily through its PDZ and FERM domains. The PDZ2 domain of FRMPD2 specifically interacts with the GluN2A subunit of NMDA receptors, enhancing postsynaptic efficacy of GluN2A-mediated currents in synaptic excitatory transmission. This interaction is crucial for anchoring GluN2A at synapses and influencing synaptic transmission (Lu2018FRMPD2:).

In epithelial cells, FRMPD2 interacts with members of the catenin family, including δ-catenin, ARVCF, and p0071, through its PDZ2 domain. These interactions are essential for the basolateral localization of FRMPD2 and are dependent on the extreme C-terminus of the catenins (Stenzel2009PDZdomaindirected). The FERM domain of FRMPD2 binds to phosphatidylinositols, contributing to its membrane localization and interaction with E-cadherin, which is crucial for its recruitment to cell-cell junctions (Stenzel2009PDZdomaindirected).

FRMPD2 also interacts with actin filaments through its FERM domain, influencing dendritic spine morphology and synaptic strength, which may affect epilepsy susceptibility (Lu2018FRMPD2:). These interactions highlight FRMPD2's role in both neuronal and epithelial cell functions.
