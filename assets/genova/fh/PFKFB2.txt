# PFKFB2

## Overview
PFKFB2 is a gene that encodes the bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 2, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of glycolysis. This enzyme is categorized as both a kinase and a phosphatase due to its dual functional domains, which are responsible for the synthesis and degradation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-BP), a key regulator of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) activity. PFKFB2 is predominantly expressed in tissues with high energy demands, such as the heart and brain, where it modulates glycolytic flux in response to various physiological and environmental stimuli, including hypoxia and hormonal signals (Houddane2017Role; Minchenko2003Hypoxic). The enzyme's activity is finely tuned through phosphorylation by several kinases, which can alter its balance between kinase and phosphatase functions, thereby impacting cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis (Kotowski2021Role). PFKFB2's involvement in metabolic regulation has also been linked to various pathological conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Sha2021Shikonin; Camargo2019PFKFB2).

## Structure
The PFKFB2 protein is a bifunctional enzyme with distinct kinase and phosphatase domains, playing a crucial role in regulating glycolysis through the synthesis and degradation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. The primary structure of PFKFB2 consists of a single polypeptide chain, with the human orthologue revealing residues 31-450 and the bovine orthologue showing residues 28-450, though some N- and C-terminal residues are disordered (Crochet2016Crystal). 

The secondary structure includes typical alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming a head-to-head homodimer arrangement in its quaternary structure (Crochet2016Crystal). Each monomer is divided into four regions: the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (2-Kase) domain, the fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (2-Pase) domain, and two regulatory domains (Crochet2016Crystal). The catalytic domains are highly conserved across different tissue isoforms, with sequence identity ranging from 76-83% (Crochet2016Crystal).

Citrate acts as an inhibitor by binding to the fructose-6-phosphate pocket of the 2-Kase domain, influencing ATP binding and altering the binding mode of ATP analogues (Crochet2016Crystal). The presence of phosphorylated histidine suggests a stable phosphor-histidine state, indicating a common post-translational modification (Crochet2016Crystal).

## Function
The PFKFB2 gene encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in regulating glycolysis in healthy human cells by controlling the levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-BP), a potent activator of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) (Houddane2017Role). This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular energy metabolism, particularly in tissues such as the heart and brain, where PFKFB2 is predominantly expressed (Minchenko2003Hypoxic). 

In the heart, PFKFB2 is activated by phosphorylation through various kinases, including protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), which enhances its activity and promotes glycolysis by increasing Fru-2,6-BP levels (Houddane2017Role). This process is essential for meeting the energy demands of cardiac cells, especially under conditions of increased workload or stress (Houddane2017Role). 

PFKFB2 also responds to hypoxic conditions, where its expression is modulated to adapt to reduced oxygen availability, although this response varies across different tissues (Minchenko2003Hypoxic). The enzyme's dual kinase and phosphatase activities allow it to balance the synthesis and degradation of Fru-2,6-BP, thus finely tuning glycolytic flux in response to cellular and environmental cues (Houddane2017Role).

## Clinical Significance
PFKFB2 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in regulating glycolysis. In well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas (WDTC), hypomethylation of the PFKFB2 promoter is associated with a higher risk of recurrence and poor prognosis. This hypomethylation serves as an independent marker for relapse risk, with a hazard ratio of 3.2, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker in thyroid cancer (Camargo2019PFKFB2).

In lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PFKFB2 expression is upregulated, contributing to increased cell proliferation, migration, and the Warburg effect, which is characterized by enhanced glycolysis. Shikonin, a compound with anti-cancer properties, has been shown to downregulate PFKFB2 expression, leading to reduced glycolysis and cancer cell proliferation, suggesting PFKFB2 as a potential therapeutic target (Sha2021Shikonin).

In renal fibrosis, mutations at the regulatory phosphorylation sites of PFKFB2 have been studied. These mutations result in reduced glycolysis and are associated with increased renal fibrosis in certain models. However, the anti-fibrotic effects of metformin are not affected by these mutations, indicating that PFKFB2's role in glycolysis regulation may not be critical for metformin's action in reducing fibrosis (Lee2020Mutation; Harley2023Mutation).

## Interactions
PFKFB2 interacts with various proteins that modulate its activity, influencing glycolytic flux and cellular metabolism. It can be phosphorylated by several protein kinases, including 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDPK-1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK-1), and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) (Kotowski2021Role). These phosphorylation events can alter the enzyme's activity, affecting the balance between its kinase and phosphatase functions.

In the heart, insulin activates PFKFB2 through a pathway involving phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and PKBα, leading to increased glycolysis. This activation is mediated by the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to phosphorylated Ser483 in response to insulin or IGF-1 (Houddane2017Role). Adrenaline also activates PFKFB2 in the heart by phosphorylating Ser466 and Ser483 via PKA (Houddane2017Role).

Citrate, a TCA cycle intermediate, binds to the fructose-6-phosphate pocket of the 2-Kase domain of PFKFB2, inhibiting ATP binding and thus affecting its kinase activity. This binding is competitive for fructose-6-phosphate and noncompetitive for ATP, suggesting a unique inhibition mechanism (Crochet2016Crystal).
