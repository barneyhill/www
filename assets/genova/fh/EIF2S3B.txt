# EIF2S3B

## Overview
The EIF2S3B gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit gamma B, a crucial component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the initiation of protein synthesis, particularly in the context of spermatogenesis. EIF2S3B is a retrogene derived from a retrotransposition event, resulting in an intronless copy of the EIF2S3X gene located on human chromosome 12. It compensates for the absence of EIF2S3Y on the Y chromosome and is specifically expressed in the male testis during puberty. The eIF2 complex, which includes the EIF2S3B subunit, is essential for forming the 43S pre-initiation complex, a critical step in protein synthesis that supports cellular growth and proliferation (Rohozinski2020Does).

## Function
The EIF2S3B gene encodes a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which is crucial for the initiation of protein synthesis in human cells. This gene is a retrogene that originated from a retrotransposition event, creating an intronless copy of EIF2S3X on human chromosome 12. EIF2S3B functionally substitutes for the loss of EIF2S3Y on the Y chromosome in humans and is specifically expressed in the male testis during puberty. It plays a vital role in the initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis, a process that requires high rates of protein synthesis (Rohozinski2020Does).

The eIF2 complex, which includes the EIF2S3B subunit, is essential for the initiation of protein synthesis. It forms a ternary complex with GTP and initiator Met-tRNAi, which binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit. This binding is a rate-limiting step in protein synthesis, as it facilitates the formation of the 43S pre-initiation complex. The cleavage of GTP precedes the formation of the 80S ribosome, which translates mRNA into proteins. This process is critical for cellular growth and proliferation, particularly in the context of spermatogenesis (Rohozinski2020Does).
