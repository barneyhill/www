# USP15

## Overview
USP15 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 15, a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in the regulation of protein ubiquitination, a critical post-translational modification that controls protein stability, localization, and activity. As a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family, USP15 plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and immune responses. The protein is characterized by a unique structural configuration, including a misaligned catalytic triad, which distinguishes it from other USPs (Ward2018The). USP15 is implicated in several signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, Wnt/β-catenin, and TGF-β/SMAD, where it modulates the stability and activity of key signaling components (Das2021The). Clinically, alterations in USP15 expression and function have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Das2022USP15; Jiang2020Clinicopathological).

## Structure
USP15 is a deubiquitinating enzyme characterized by a ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The structure of USP15 includes a catalytic core domain with a canonical USP fold comprising finger, palm, and thumb regions. The catalytic triad of USP15 is misaligned, with the catalytic cysteine (Cys 269) approximately 10 Å away from the catalytic histidine (His 862), resulting in an inactive conformation (Ward2018The). This misalignment is unique among USPs and is shared only with USP7 (Ward2018The).

USP15 also contains N-terminal domains, including the DUSP and UBL domains, which are aligned in tandem and connected by a β-hairpin structure. These domains are involved in protein interactions and substrate specificity (Harper2011Structure). The UBL domain, although related to ubiquitin, has distinct surface characteristics and does not mimic ubiquitin (Harper2011Structure).

The protein is monomeric in solution and exhibits a flexible switching loop, contributing to an open ubiquitin-binding channel (Ward2018The; Harper2011Structure). USP15 can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function and interactions.

## Function
USP15 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 15) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a significant role in various cellular processes by regulating protein stability, localization, and activity through the removal of ubiquitin from target proteins. In healthy human cells, USP15 is involved in several critical signaling pathways, including NF-κB, Wnt/β-catenin, and TGF-β/SMAD signaling. In the NF-κB pathway, USP15 can both potentiate and suppress activation by stabilizing TAK1-binding proteins and the transcription factor NF-κB p65, which influences cell proliferation and apoptosis (Das2021The). In the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, USP15 negatively regulates signaling by stabilizing the β-catenin destruction complex, preventing abnormal β-catenin accumulation (Das2021The).

USP15 also plays a role in the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway by deubiquitinating and stabilizing components like the type I BMP receptor ALK3, enhancing BMP signaling (Das2021The). It is involved in the regulation of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway, where it stabilizes the Keap1-Cul3 E3 ligase complex, leading to increased degradation of Nrf2 and reduced antioxidant response (Villeneuve2013USP15). USP15 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and immune responses (Das2021The; Teyra2019Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the USP15 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), high USP15 expression is associated with shorter cancer-specific survival, suggesting its role in promoting oncogenesis through the TGF-β signaling pathway (Jiang2020Clinicopathological). In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), USP15 is overexpressed in over 10% of cases, correlating with poorer disease-specific survival. It facilitates cancer cell proliferation by regulating the alternative splicing of the SRSF1 gene (Das2022USP15).

USP15 also plays a significant role in gastric cancer, where its high expression is linked to malignant progression and poor overall survival. Knockdown of USP15 in gastric cancer cells reduces proliferation and enhances apoptosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Huangfu2024The). In ovarian cancer, USP15 regulates the levels of the p53-R175H mutant protein, maintaining the oncogenic potential of these cells (Padmanabhan2018USP15-dependent).

In leukemia, USP15 affects apoptosis and drug resistance by modulating caspase-6 levels and the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway, impacting the progression and treatment response of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Zangooie2024Ubiquitinspecific). These findings highlight USP15's complex role in cancer, acting as both an oncogene and tumor suppressor depending on the context.

## Interactions
USP15 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in multiple cellular processes. It is involved in the regulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway by interacting with SMAD proteins and the TGF-β receptor, influencing processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis (Das2021The). USP15 also forms a complex with SMAD7 and SMURF2, counteracting SMURF2's inhibitory effects by deubiquitinating SMURF2 and its substrate TbR-I, leading to TbR-I stabilization (Teyra2019Structural).

In the context of cancer, USP15 interacts with several cancer-associated proteins, including the human papilloma virus E6 oncoprotein and the adenomatosis polyposis coli tumor suppressor (Teyra2019Structural). It also plays a role in the immune system by affecting leukocyte activity (Teyra2019Structural).

USP15 is known to antagonize Parkin-mediated mitochondrial ubiquitination and mitophagy, although it does not directly deubiquitinate Parkin or affect its translocation to mitochondria. Instead, USP15 reduces the clustering of ubiquitin on mitochondria, opposing Parkin-mediated ubiquitination (Cornelissen2014The). This interaction suggests a regulatory role in mitochondrial quality control and potential implications in Parkinson's disease (Cornelissen2014The).
