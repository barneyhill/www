# PRSS53

## Overview
PRSS53 is a gene that encodes the protein serine protease 53, which is categorized as a serine protease. This protein is primarily involved in the development and shaping of hair follicles, particularly influencing the keratinization and cornification processes within the inner root sheath of hair follicles. The gene's expression is crucial during the stages of hair fiber maturation, contributing to the regulation of hair growth and structure. PRSS53 is also implicated in broader biological processes, including skeletal development and neurological conditions, highlighting its multifaceted role in human physiology. Variations in the PRSS53 gene, such as the single nucleotide polymorphism rs11150606, have been associated with changes in hair shape and potential links to diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, underscoring its clinical significance (Deng2019A; Adhikari2016A; Li2022Integration).

## Function
PRSS53, or serine protease 53, is a gene encoding a protein that plays a significant role in hair follicle development and hair shape. It is highly expressed in the inner root sheath (IRS) of hair follicles, particularly during the stages of hair fiber keratinization and cornification, which are crucial for hair shaping (Adhikari2016A). The protein is involved in the processing and secretion of enzymes, with a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11150606, resulting in a Q30R substitution that affects these processes. This substitution introduces a subtilisin/kexin-like proprotein convertase site, potentially altering enzyme processing and secretion (Adhikari2016A).

PRSS53 is also implicated in the cornification and hardening stages of the hair fiber, suggesting its involvement in the maturation of the hair follicle sheath (Adhikari2016A). The protein's activity is associated with the regulation of hair growth and cycling, as proteases and protease inhibitors are essential for these processes (Adhikari2016A). The gene's expression pattern and functional role in hair fiber differentiation highlight its importance in maintaining hair shape and structure in humans.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PRSS53 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In hair development, PRSS53 is associated with hair shape, particularly influencing hair curliness. A specific SNP, rs11150606, which results in the R30Q substitution, has been linked to scalp hair shape and may affect enzyme processing, potentially altering hair fiber keratinization and inner root sheath cornification (Adhikari2016A).

In terms of skeletal development, studies using CRISPR/Cas9-generated Prss53 knockout rabbits have shown that the loss of PRSS53 leads to curved hair and skeletal dysplasia, with severe malformations and disrupted calcium metabolism. This suggests a crucial role for PRSS53 in maintaining normal hair and skeletal morphology (Deng2019A).

PRSS53 has also been implicated in neurological conditions. It is associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), with studies indicating that its overexpression might increase PD risk. Altered expression of PRSS53 has been observed in PD models, suggesting its involvement in α-Syn-induced neurodegeneration (Li2022Integration). Additionally, PRSS53 has been identified as a gene associated with PD risk in genome-wide association studies (Infante2016Comparative). The gene has also been linked to Alzheimer's disease through protein-disease association studies (Belbasis2024A).

## Interactions
PRSS53, or serine protease 53, is involved in various biological processes, particularly in hair follicle development and hair shape regulation. The protein is expressed in the inner root sheath (IRS) and pre-cortex of hair follicles, where it plays a role in hair fiber keratinization and cornification. This expression pattern suggests that PRSS53 may interact with other proteins involved in hair shaping, such as TCHH, which is known to be involved in hair structure (Adhikari2016A).

Bioinformatic analysis indicates that the R30Q substitution in PRSS53 could introduce a subtilisin/kexin-like proprotein convertase site, potentially affecting enzyme processing and interactions (Adhikari2016A). The Q30R variant of PRSS53 shows altered processing and secretion, accumulating in the endoplasmic reticulum-transGolgi network, which may influence its interactions with other cellular components (Adhikari2016A).

While specific direct protein interactions of PRSS53 are not detailed, its similarity to kallikreins, a family of serine protease endopeptidases, implies that it might lyse substrates in cornified tissues, suggesting potential interactions with proteins involved in epidermal keratinization and hair growth regulation (Adhikari2016A).
