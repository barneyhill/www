# CSTB

## Overview
The CSTB gene encodes cystatin B, a small globular protein that functions as a cysteine protease inhibitor. Cystatin B is primarily involved in regulating intracellular proteolytic activity by inhibiting thiol proteases such as cathepsins, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against lysosomal protease leakage (Singh2024The). The protein is characterized by a distinctive structural configuration, including a five-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and a central alpha-helix, which are crucial for its inhibitory function (Stubbs1990The). Cystatin B is expressed in various tissues, with significant roles in neural development, synaptic plasticity, and protection against oxidative stress (Singh2024The; Penna2019Cystatin). Mutations in the CSTB gene are linked to Unverricht-Lundborg disease, a form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy, highlighting the clinical significance of this gene in neurological disorders (Minassian2023CSTB).

## Structure
Cystatin B (CSTB) is a small globular protein characterized by a five-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet wrapped around a central five-turn alpha-helix, with an additional carboxy-terminal strand (Žerovnik2022Human; Stubbs1990The). The primary structure of CSTB includes a unique free cysteine residue at position 3, which is crucial for its inhibitory function against cysteine proteinases (Pol2001Role). The secondary structure features a type II turn and a five-residue open beta-hairpin loop, contributing to its stability and function (Stubbs1990The).

The tertiary structure of CSTB involves a tightly packed interface when in complex with cysteine proteinases like papain, where a significant portion of the surface area becomes buried, enhancing its inhibitory capacity (Stubbs1990The). CSTB can exist in monomeric and oligomeric forms, with the monomeric structure being determined in complex with papain. The tetrameric form involves domain-swapping, which is a feature of its oligomerization (Žerovnik2022Human).

CSTB's structure is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and a few hydrogen bonds, with solvent molecules playing a role in mediating polar interactions (Stubbs1990The). These structural features are essential for its function as a cysteine protease inhibitor.

## Function
Cystatin B (CSTB) is a cysteine protease inhibitor that plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by inhibiting intracellular thiol proteases, such as cathepsins L, H, and B, as well as papain. This inhibition is crucial for regulating cellular proteostasis and protecting against proteases that may leak from lysosomes (Singh2024The). CSTB is widely expressed in various tissues, including neural cells, where it is involved in guiding development and differentiation. It interacts with several cytoplasmic proteins involved in cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation, suggesting its role in brain development (Singh2024The).

CSTB also plays a protective role against oxidative stress by regulating mitochondrial function. Under oxidative stress, CSTB expression is upregulated, which is essential for preventing cellular damage and cell death. In CSTB-deficient models, increased oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced levels of antioxidant enzymes, resulting in oxidative stress-induced cell death (Singh2024The). Additionally, CSTB is involved in synaptic plasticity, contributing to the brain's ability to store new information and adapt to environmental changes (Penna2019Cystatin). CSTB's oligomeric forms may have additional roles, such as interacting with cytoskeletal proteins and binding amyloid proteins, indicating a chaperone-like function (Žerovnik2022Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CSTB gene are primarily associated with Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD), the most common form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as myoclonus, seizures, ataxia, psychiatric disorders, dementia, and a shortened lifespan. The primary genetic cause is an unstable dodecamer repeat expansion in the promoter region of CSTB, which leads to reduced expression of the cystatin B protein, a cysteine protease inhibitor. This expansion accounts for 90% of EPM1 cases worldwide and 99% of Finnish cases (Minassian2023CSTB; Singh2024The).

Patients with ULD typically retain only about 10% of normal cystatin B activity, and the severity of the disease correlates with the level of CSTB protein expression. A complete lack of CSTB protein results in a different phenotype, neonatal developmental encephalopathy, indicating a spectrum of disease severity based on CSTB expression levels (Minassian2023CSTB). The CSTB deficiency is linked to increased proteolytic activity, particularly involving cathepsins, and is associated with neuronal protection from apoptosis and oxidative stress (Körber2016Gene-Expression).

Alterations in CSTB expression are also associated with changes in synaptic function and immune responses, contributing to the hyperexcitable phenotype observed in CSTB-deficient models (Joensuu2014Gene; Körber2016Gene-Expression).

## Interactions
Cystatin B (CSTB) is known to interact with a variety of proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. In the brain, CSTB interacts with cytoplasmic proteins such as β-spectrin, neurofilament light chain (NF-L), and receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK-1), which are involved in cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation (Singh2024The). CSTB also interacts with histones, including H2A.Z, H2B, and H3, influencing transcriptional changes and cell cycle progression (Žerovnik2022Human; Singh2024The).

In the context of HIV-1-infected macrophages, CSTB interacts with proteins like major vault protein (MVP) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), which are involved in regulating STAT-1 phosphorylation and HIV-1 replication (RiveraRivera2011Inhibition). CSTB also inhibits the interferon (IFN) response by affecting the nuclear translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1 (RiveraRivera2011Inhibition).

CSTB forms oligomers through domain-swapping, which may have functional roles such as chaperone and redox-sensitive functions, or toxic roles like membrane perforation (Žerovnik2022Human). These interactions highlight CSTB's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential impact on neurological disorders and immune responses.
