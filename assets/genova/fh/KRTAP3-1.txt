# KRTAP3-1

## Overview
KRTAP3-1 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 3-1, a member of the high sulfur keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) family. These proteins are integral to the structural integrity of hair, contributing to its mechanical strength and resilience by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments. The keratin-associated protein 3-1 is characterized by a high content of proline and serine/threonine, with a relatively lower cysteine content compared to other KAP families. This protein is primarily expressed in the hair follicle, where it plays a crucial role in determining hair texture and quality by facilitating the formation of a hard and compact hair fiber through cross-linking with keratin filaments. The KAP3 family, to which KRTAP3-1 belongs, is orthologous to the sheep B3B family, indicating a conserved function across species (Rogers2006Human).

## Function
KRTAP3-1 encodes keratin-associated protein 3-1, which is part of the high sulfur keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) family. These proteins are small, with a size of approximately 10.3-10.5 kDa, and are characterized by a high content of proline and serine/threonine, although they have a lower cysteine content compared to other KAP families (Rogers2006Human). KRTAP3-1 is primarily involved in the structural integrity of hair, interacting with keratin intermediate filaments to contribute to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers (Rogers2006Human). 

The KAP3 family, which includes KRTAP3-1, is orthologous to the sheep B3B family, indicating a conserved function across species (Rogers2006Human). KRTAP3-1 is expressed in the hair follicle, where it plays a role in hair texture and quality by participating in the formation of a hard and compact hair fiber through cross-linking with keratin filaments (Rogers2006Human). Although specific functions of KRTAP3-1 in healthy human cells are not detailed, its classification as a keratin-associated protein suggests its involvement in maintaining the structural properties of hair (Rogers2006Human).
