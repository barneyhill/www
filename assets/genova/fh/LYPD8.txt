# LYPD8

## Overview
LYPD8 is a gene that encodes the protein LY6/PLAUR domain containing 8, which is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein involved in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. This protein plays a pivotal role in the gut by inhibiting the motility of flagellated bacteria, thereby preventing their invasion into the colonic epithelial layer and maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier. LYPD8 is predominantly expressed in colonic enterocytes and is crucial for segregating commensal bacteria from the colonic epithelia, thus preventing bacterial colonization and inflammation. The protein functions by binding to bacterial proteins such as intimin, inhibiting the attachment of pathogenic bacteria like Citrobacter rodentium to intestinal epithelial cells, and preventing the formation of attaching and effacing lesions. This action is essential for preventing excessive bacterial colonization and maintaining a healthy intestinal environment (Okumura2020Lypd8; Hsu2021Alleviation).

## Function
The LYPD8 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining gut homeostasis by inhibiting the motility of flagellated bacteria, thereby preventing their invasion into the colonic epithelial layer. This function is essential for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier and preventing inflammation in healthy human cells (Okumura2020Lypd8; Hsu2021Alleviation). LYPD8 is highly expressed on colonic enterocytes and is involved in segregating commensal bacteria from the colonic epithelia, which helps to prevent bacterial colonization and subsequent inflammation (Okumura2020Lypd8). 

The protein is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that is shed into the intestinal lumen, where it binds to bacterial proteins such as intimin, thereby inhibiting the attachment of pathogenic bacteria like Citrobacter rodentium to the intestinal epithelial cells (Okumura2020Lypd8). This action prevents the formation of attaching and effacing lesions, which are critical for bacterial colonization and infection (Okumura2020Lypd8). The presence of LYPD8 is crucial for preventing excessive bacterial colonization and maintaining a healthy intestinal environment (Hsu2021Alleviation).

## Clinical Significance
LYPD8 plays a critical role in maintaining the intestinal barrier by inhibiting the attachment of pathogenic bacteria to colonic epithelia. Alterations in LYPD8 expression or function can lead to increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, particularly those caused by attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens like Citrobacter rodentium and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) (Okumura2020Lypd8). In mice lacking LYPD8, there is a marked increase in the colonization of C. rodentium, resulting in severe colitis characterized by Th17-mediated and neutrophil-mediated inflammation (Okumura2020Lypd8). This suggests that LYPD8 deficiency compromises the mucosal barrier, leading to enhanced inflammatory responses and increased risk of colitis (Okumura2020Lypd8).

The absence of LYPD8 also results in a compromised mucosal barrier, which increases susceptibility to bacterial infections and may contribute to conditions such as ulcerative colitis (Okumura2020Lypd8). The study highlights the potential of LYPD8 as a target for non-antibiotic therapies for infections like EPEC and EHEC, which can lead to severe conditions such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (Okumura2020Lypd8).

## Interactions
LYPD8 is known to interact with intimin, a protein on the surface of the pathogenic bacterium Citrobacter rodentium. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting the attachment of the bacteria to colonic epithelia. LYPD8 binds to the C-type lectin (CTL) and Ig-like domains of intimin, thereby interfering with the intimin-Tir interaction, which is essential for the formation of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions on host cells (Okumura2020Lypd8). This binding is mediated by both glycan-lectin and protein-protein interactions, as confirmed through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance analysis (Okumura2020Lypd8).

LYPD8 does not bind to the type III secretion system (T3SS) of C. rodentium, despite its structural similarity to flagella, nor does it bind to the flagellin protein encoded by lafA, indicating that its inhibitory function is not related to flagella-mediated motility (Okumura2020Lypd8). In addition to its role in inhibiting pathogenic bacteria, LYPD8 also binds to flagellated commensal bacteria such as Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli, suppressing their motility by binding to their flagella (Okumura2020Lypd8; Song2023Intestinal).
