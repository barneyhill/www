# BDNF

## Overview
The BDNF gene encodes the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein that belongs to the neurotrophin family, which is crucial for the development, maintenance, and plasticity of neurons in the central nervous system. BDNF is synthesized as a precursor protein, proBDNF, which is subsequently cleaved to form the mature BDNF (mBDNF). This mature protein primarily functions by binding to the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor, initiating several intracellular signaling pathways that promote neuronal survival, growth, and differentiation (Bathina2015Brainderived; Silakarma2019The). BDNF is widely expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the hippocampus and cortex, and plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Bathina2015Brainderived). Alterations in BDNF expression and function have been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining healthy brain function (Nagahara2011Potential; Szarowicz2022New).

## Structure
The BDNF protein is initially synthesized as a precursor, preproBDNF, which consists of 247 amino acids. This precursor undergoes cleavage to form proBDNF, which can be further processed into mature BDNF (mBDNF) (Notaras2018BrainDerived; Begni2016Cellular). The primary structure of BDNF includes a signal peptide, a low complexity region, and a nerve growth factor (NGF) family domain, which comprises most of the mBDNF sequence (Notaras2018BrainDerived). 

The secondary structure of BDNF features two pairs of antiparallel β-strands and cysteine residues forming a cystine knot motif, a characteristic shared with other neurotrophins (Begni2016Cellular). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a stable three-dimensional shape, crucial for its biological function.

BDNF can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure. Post-translational modifications include a conserved N-glycosylation site at residue 121 and putative N-myristoylation sites, which are believed to stabilize the BDNF prodomain during intracellular processing and trafficking (Notaras2018BrainDerived). The presence of phosphorylation sites within the mBDNF sequence is also noted, which may influence its activity (Notaras2018BrainDerived).

## Function
The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the survival, growth, and differentiation of neurons in the central nervous system. BDNF is involved in synaptic plasticity, which is essential for learning and memory. It facilitates synaptic transmission by enhancing excitatory synapses and modulating neurotransmitter systems, including dopaminergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic pathways (Bathina2015Brainderived; Silakarma2019The). BDNF is synthesized as a precursor, proBDNF, which is processed into its mature form, mBDNF. This mature form interacts with the TrkB receptor, activating signaling pathways such as MAPK, PI3K, and PLC, which are critical for neuronal survival and differentiation (Bathina2015Brainderived; Silakarma2019The).

BDNF is widely expressed in the brain, particularly in regions like the hippocampus and cortex, and is also found in peripheral tissues such as the heart and lungs (Bathina2015Brainderived). It plays a significant role in long-term potentiation (LTP), a process vital for memory formation, by facilitating pre-synaptic vesicle cycling and NMDA receptor trafficking (Silakarma2019The). BDNF's activity is crucial for maintaining healthy brain function and is linked to cognitive processes, with its levels influencing memory performance and hippocampal volume (Silakarma2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BDNF gene are linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders. The Val66Met polymorphism, a common single-nucleotide polymorphism in the BDNF gene, results in a substitution of valine to methionine at codon 66. This variant is associated with decreased activity-dependent release of BDNF, impacting memory, cognition, anxiety, and depression. It is linked to disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and multiple sclerosis (Szarowicz2022New). The Val66Met polymorphism is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, affecting hippocampal and cortical volume, synaptic connections, and dendritic complexity (Shen2018BDNF; Szarowicz2022New).

Alterations in BDNF expression levels are associated with psychiatric disorders, including depression and schizophrenia. Reduced BDNF levels are observed in the hippocampus of depressed patients, which can be reversed by antidepressant treatments (Nagahara2011Potential). In schizophrenia, the Val66Met polymorphism is linked to reduced BDNF mRNA and protein levels, affecting GABAergic interneuron functioning (Boulle2011Epigenetic). Environmental factors, such as stress and early life trauma, can cause long-lasting epigenetic changes at the BDNF gene, contributing to psychiatric disorders (Boulle2011Epigenetic; Mitchelmore2014Brain).

## Interactions
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence neuronal function and survival. BDNF primarily interacts with the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor, initiating signaling pathways such as RAS/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and PLC/PKC, which are essential for neuronal growth, differentiation, and survival (Sandhya2013A). BDNF also binds to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) with low affinity, which can modulate its signaling effects (Sandhya2013A).

In the context of Huntington's disease, BDNF mRNA interacts with the huntingtin (Htt) protein. This interaction is crucial for the axonal transport of BDNF mRNA, which is necessary for neuronal survival. Htt acts as a scaffold in the transport process, and BDNF mRNA co-localizes with Htt in neuronal granules, suggesting a role in mRNA processing and transport (Ma2010Localization).

BDNF signaling is also modulated by glucocorticoids, which can suppress the interaction between Src homology-2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (Shp2) and TrkB, leading to the inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for the BDNF-dependent upregulation of synaptic proteins (Kumamaru2011Glucocorticoid).
