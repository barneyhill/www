# SERF1B

## Overview
The SERF1B gene encodes the small EDRK-rich factor 1B protein, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its rich composition of glutamic acid (E), aspartic acid (D), arginine (R), and lysine (K) residues, which suggests a role in protein-protein interactions and possibly in the regulation of protein folding or stability. Although the precise biological functions of SERF1B are not fully elucidated, it is believed to participate in pathways related to cellular stress responses and may have implications in neurodegenerative diseases. The study of SERF1B and its encoded protein is ongoing, with research focusing on its potential interactions and regulatory mechanisms within the cell (Qiu2020aarFDC).
