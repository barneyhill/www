# SCLT1

## Overview
SCLT1, or sodium channel and clathrin linker 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the process of ciliogenesis, specifically in the assembly and maintenance of distal appendages (DAPs) of centrioles. The SCLT1 protein is categorized as a structural component of the centriolar distal appendage, playing a pivotal role in anchoring cilia to the plasma membrane and facilitating the recruitment of other essential proteins for cilia formation and function (Morisada2020Bardet–Biedl; Lee2022Tissuespecific). This protein is crucial for the proper functioning of cilia, which are vital for cellular signaling and movement, particularly in tissues such as the retina and kidney (Katagiri2018Compound). Mutations in the SCLT1 gene are linked to several ciliopathies, including Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Senior-Løken syndrome, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal ciliary function and its involvement in various genetic disorders (Katagiri2018Compound; Horiuchi2020BardetBiedl).

## Function
The SCLT1 gene encodes a protein that is integral to ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, by participating in the assembly and maintenance of the distal appendages (DAPs) of centrioles. These appendages are crucial for anchoring cilia to the plasma membrane, facilitating the proper formation and function of cilia, which are essential for cellular signaling and movement (Morisada2020Bardet–Biedl; Lee2022Tissuespecific). In healthy human cells, the SCLT1 protein localizes to the distal appendages of the basal body, playing a critical role in the initiation of ciliogenesis by recruiting other DAP proteins such as CEP164 and FBF1 to the centriole (Katagiri2018Compound; Lee2022Tissuespecific).

SCLT1 is also involved in the docking of ciliary vesicles to the centriole, a necessary step for the recruitment of tau-tubulin kinase-2 (TTBK2), which is essential for cilia growth (Lee2022Tissuespecific). The protein's function is particularly important in tissues such as the retina and kidney, where it supports the formation and maintenance of cilia, contributing to processes like photoreceptor function and renal tubular cell operation (Katagiri2018Compound). Disruption of SCLT1 function can lead to ciliopathies, highlighting its critical role in maintaining normal ciliary function (Reiter2017Genes).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCLT1 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, including Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), Senior-Løken syndrome (SLS), and Oro-Facio-Digital syndrome type IX. BBS is characterized by symptoms such as renal dysfunction, retinitis pigmentosa, obesity, and intellectual disability. In some cases, mutations in SCLT1 lead to exon skipping, contributing to hepatic fibrosis and microvesicular steatohepatitis, which are rare manifestations of BBS (Horiuchi2020BardetBiedl). SLS is linked to severe retinal degeneration and juvenile-onset nephronophthisis, with compound heterozygous splice site variants in SCLT1 identified as a cause (Katagiri2018Compound). Oro-Facio-Digital syndrome type IX is associated with severe midline defects and early mortality, often resulting from homozygous SCLT1 variants leading to protein truncation (Adly2013Ciliary; Maddirevula2019Autozygome).

SCLT1 mutations can also result in disrupted cilia assembly, leading to conditions like polydactyly and renal cyst formation. In mice, SCLT1 deficiency promotes ERK signaling and activates the STAT3 and TGF-β/SMAD pathways, contributing to cystic kidney disease (Mansour2021The). These findings underscore the critical role of SCLT1 in maintaining normal ciliary function and its involvement in various genetic disorders.

## Interactions
The SCLT1 protein is involved in the hierarchical assembly of distal appendage proteins (DAPs) during ciliogenesis. It is recruited to the mother centriole following CEP83 and CEP89, and it subsequently recruits CEP164 and FBF1 to form the DAPs. In the absence of SCLT1, the centriolar localization of CEP164 and FBF1 is significantly disrupted, although CEP83 and CEP89 remain present, indicating that SCLT1 is crucial for the recruitment of certain DAP proteins (Lee2022Tissuespecific). SCLT1 also plays a role in the docking of ciliary vesicles to the centriole, a critical step in ciliogenesis, and is involved in the recruitment of TTBK2 to the centriole, which is necessary for the removal of CP110, a negative regulator of ciliogenesis (Lee2022Tissuespecific).

SCLT1 is a component of the centriolar distal appendage structure, which is crucial for anchoring cilia to the membrane. It is part of a complex with several proteins, including ANKRD26, CEP83, CEP89, CEP164, FBF1, LRRC45, and PIDD1, which are recruited to the centriole in a hierarchical manner to assemble the DAPs essential for basal body docking (Lee2022Tissuespecific).
