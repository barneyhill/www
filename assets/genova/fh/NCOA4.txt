# NCOA4

## Overview
NCOA4, or nuclear receptor coactivator 4, is a gene located on chromosome 10q11.2 in humans, encoding a protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular iron homeostasis and various cellular processes. The protein, also known as androgen receptor-associated protein 70 (ARA70), is categorized as a coactivator due to its involvement in modulating the activity of nuclear receptors. NCOA4 is integral to the process of ferritinophagy, a selective autophagy mechanism that regulates intracellular iron levels by mediating the degradation of ferritin, thereby releasing iron for essential cellular functions (Mancias2015Ferritinophagy; SantanaCodina2018The). Beyond its role in iron metabolism, NCOA4 is implicated in microtubule nucleation, cytokinesis, and DNA protection from replicative stress, highlighting its multifaceted contributions to cellular physiology (Le2024The). Alterations in NCOA4 expression and function have been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring its clinical significance (Bellelli2014NCOA4; Quiles2019NCOA4Mediated).

## Structure
The NCOA4 protein, also known as androgen receptor-associated protein 70 (ARA70), is encoded by the NCOA4 gene located on chromosome 10q11.2 in humans. It consists of ten exons and encodes a protein of 614 amino acids. NCOA4 contains a putative coiled-coil domain at the N-terminus, which facilitates protein-protein interactions (Kollara2012Expression). The protein includes two evolutionarily conserved regions known as ARA70 family domains I and II (Kollara2012Expression).

NCOA4 has two nuclear receptor interaction motifs: an LXXLL motif located in the N-terminal region and an FXXLF motif, which are crucial for interactions with various nuclear receptors, including androgen and progesterone receptors (Kollara2012Expression). The FXXLF motif is essential for interactions with androgen and progesterone receptors, while the LXXLL motif interacts with vitamin D, thyroid hormone, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (Kollara2012Expression).

The protein also plays a role in ferritinophagy, a selective autophagy process, through its interaction with GATE16. The NCOA4 fragment comprising residues 383-522 is sufficient for this function and contains two short linear interaction motifs necessary for binding to GATE16 (Lee2024NCOA4). This fragment is expressed as a dimer stabilized by disulfide bonds, with a molecular weight of approximately 40 kDa (Gryzik2017Expression).

## Function
NCOA4 (nuclear receptor coactivator 4) is a critical protein involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis in healthy human cells. It functions primarily as a selective cargo receptor for ferritinophagy, the autophagic degradation of ferritin, which is essential for maintaining intracellular iron levels. NCOA4 binds to ferritin, facilitating its delivery to autophagosomes and subsequent degradation in lysosomes, thereby releasing iron for cellular processes (Srivastava2020Thermodynamic; SantanaCodina2018The). This process is crucial for erythropoiesis, as it provides iron necessary for hemoglobin synthesis and red blood cell production (SantanaCodina2018The).

NCOA4 also acts as an intracellular iron sensor, responding to changes in iron concentration to maintain homeostasis. Under iron-replete conditions, NCOA4 is targeted for degradation by the proteasome, mediated by HERC2, reducing ferritinophagy and stabilizing ferritin. Conversely, in iron-depleted conditions, NCOA4 is stabilized, promoting ferritin degradation and iron release (Le2024The; SantanaCodina2018The). Beyond its role in iron metabolism, NCOA4 is involved in microtubule nucleation and cytokinesis, contributing to cell division, and is implicated in protecting DNA from replicative stress by coordinating intracellular iron bioavailability and DNA metabolism (Le2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the NCOA4 gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In cancer, NCOA4 is implicated in tumorigenesis, with its expression levels affecting cancer cell survival and proliferation. Chromosomal rearrangements involving NCOA4 have been observed in thyroid and lung cancers, while downregulation is noted in prostate and invasive ductal breast carcinoma. These alterations may affect the MCM2-7 complex, potentially sensitizing cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents, suggesting a synthetic lethal interaction with DNA damage and replication stress-inducing agents (Bellelli2014NCOA4; SantanaCodina2018The).

In the context of iron metabolism, NCOA4 plays a crucial role in ferritinophagy, and its dysfunction can lead to iron-related disorders. NCOA4 deficiency results in impaired ferritinophagy, leading to ferritin accumulation and iron overload, which can cause conditions like anemia and liver damage (Bellelli2016NCOA4; SantanaCodina2018The). In neurodegenerative diseases, defective NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy is linked to increased iron levels and neuronal cell death, suggesting its involvement in diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (Quiles2019NCOA4Mediated).

NCOA4 is also involved in ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death, which is being explored for cancer therapies. Enhancing NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy can induce ferroptosis in tumor cells, offering potential treatment strategies (SantanaCodina2021The; Le2024The).

## Interactions
NCOA4 (nuclear receptor coactivator 4) is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate iron metabolism and cellular processes. It directly interacts with the ferritin heavy chain (FTH1) to facilitate ferritinophagy, a process essential for maintaining iron homeostasis by delivering ferritin to autophagosomes for degradation (Mancias2015Ferritinophagy). This interaction is mediated by specific amino acids within NCOA4, notably I489 and W497, which are crucial for binding to FTH1 (Mancias2015Ferritinophagy).

NCOA4 also interacts with the LC3/GABARAP family member GATE16 through two short linear interaction motifs, 413 FAECV 417 and 485 SFQVI 489. These motifs are necessary for the lysosomal degradation of ferritin, and their interaction is regulated by iron levels (Lee2024NCOA4).

Additionally, NCOA4 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC2, which regulates its stability through the ubiquitin-proteasome system in an iron-dependent manner. This interaction modulates NCOA4 levels, influencing ferritinophagy flux under varying iron conditions (Mancias2015Ferritinophagy).

NCOA4 also forms a complex with STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes), which affects its nuclear localization and function as a transcription factor coactivator. This interaction is significant in the context of sepsis, where it exacerbates ferroptosis and inflammatory responses in macrophages (Wu2022The).
