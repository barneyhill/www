# NT5DC1

## Overview
NT5DC1 is a gene that encodes the protein 5'-nucleotidase domain containing 1, which is part of the nucleotidase enzyme family. This protein is involved in nucleotide metabolism, playing a role in the hydrolysis of nucleotides to nucleosides. The NT5DC1 gene has garnered attention due to its potential involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder (BPD). Genetic studies have suggested that variations in NT5DC1 may contribute to the shared genetic architecture of these conditions, highlighting its significance in cognitive function and behavior (Singgih2021Investigating; van2017Genetic).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
NT5DC1 has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder (BPD). Genetic studies have identified NT5DC1 as a gene of interest due to its potential involvement in the shared genetic architecture of these conditions. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis found a significant genetic correlation between ADHD and BPD, with NT5DC1 being one of the genes modulated by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with these disorders (van2017Genetic).

Research using Drosophila models has further suggested that NT5DC1 may play a role in cognitive function and behaviors relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders. Knockdown of the Drosophila orthologue of NT5DC1 resulted in severe habituation deficits, indicating its potential involvement in cognitive processes (Singgih2021Investigating).

In the context of adult ADHD, exome chip analyses have identified NT5DC1 as one of the significant loci associated with the condition. The gene showed the most significant association using the VT method, suggesting its role in the genetic architecture of ADHD (Zayats2016Exome). These findings highlight NT5DC1 as a gene of interest in understanding the genetic basis of neuropsychiatric disorders.
