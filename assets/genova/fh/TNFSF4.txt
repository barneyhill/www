# TNFSF4

## Overview
TNFSF4, also known as OX40 ligand, is a gene that encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, specifically a transmembrane protein involved in immune system regulation. The protein encoded by TNFSF4 is primarily expressed on activated antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, B cells, and macrophages, and plays a critical role in the activation and survival of T-cells through its interaction with the OX40 receptor on T-cells (Yashiro2016Critical; Ria2011A). This interaction is essential for T-cell proliferation, survival, and cytokine production, which are vital for effective immune responses and the regulation of inflammation and autoimmunity (Yashiro2016Critical). TNFSF4 is implicated in various immune-related conditions, including autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular health, highlighting its significance in maintaining immune homeostasis and influencing disease susceptibility (Mälarstig2008Genetic; Ria2011A).

## Function
The TNFSF4 gene, also known as OX40 ligand, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily and plays a significant role in the immune system. It is primarily expressed on activated antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, B cells, and macrophages, and interacts with the OX40 receptor on T-cells. This interaction is crucial for the activation and survival of T-cells, particularly CD4+ T-cells, at sites of inflammation (Yashiro2016Critical; Ria2011A). TNFSF4 promotes T-cell proliferation, survival, and cytokine production, which are essential for effective immune responses and the regulation of inflammation and autoimmunity (Yashiro2016Critical).

In healthy cells, TNFSF4 is involved in maintaining immune homeostasis and regulating inflammatory responses. It provides a costimulatory signal to T-cells, enhancing their proliferation and cytokine production, which is vital for immune regulation and tolerance (Mälarstig2008Genetic). The TNFSF4/TNFRSF4 interaction influences atherosclerosis susceptibility, as evidenced by studies showing that gene targeting of Tnfsf4 in mice results in smaller atherosclerotic lesions and altered cholesterol levels (Ria2011A). These functions highlight the gene's role in immune regulation and cardiovascular health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the TNFSF4 gene have been associated with several autoimmune diseases. TNFSF4, also known as OX40 ligand, is implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where interactions with other genes in the NF-kB pathway, such as BLK and TNFAIP3, increase susceptibility to the disease (Zhou2011Gene–gene). In systemic sclerosis (SSc), TNFSF4 polymorphisms, particularly rs2205960, are linked to increased disease risk, especially in patients positive for anticentromere antibodies (ACA+) (COUSTET2012Independent). 

The gene is also associated with autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs), including Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Specific TNFSF4 polymorphisms, such as rs3850641, have been found to influence susceptibility to these conditions, potentially affecting T-cell activation and immune regulation (Song2016TNFSF4). 

In Asian populations, TNFSF4 polymorphisms like rs2205960 and rs844648 are linked to an increased risk of various autoimmune diseases, including primary Sjögren's syndrome and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (Yang2020Associations). These genetic variations may alter TNFSF4 expression, impacting immune responses and contributing to disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
TNFSF4, also known as OX40 ligand (OX40L), interacts primarily with its receptor TNFRSF4 (OX40) on T lymphocytes. This interaction is crucial for T cell activation, proliferation, and survival, playing a significant role in immune responses such as anti-tumor immunity and autoimmunity (Fu2021Association; Manku2013TransAncestral). The OX40-OX40L interaction enhances Th1-mediated immune responses and supports the generation and maintenance of Th2 responses while antagonizing Treg generation and Treg-mediated suppression (Fu2021Association).

TNFSF4 also interacts with the NF-kB p65 protein (RELA), with the DNA sequence including the SNP rs2205960 binding to NF-kB p65 with high confidence. Altering the allele from T to G at this site decreases the binding affinity for NF-kB p65 by over 10% (Manku2013TransAncestral). This interaction is confirmed by genome-wide ChIP-seq experiments, which show NF-kB binding at rs2205960, with differences in signal intensity between heterozygous and homozygous cell lines (Manku2013TransAncestral).

In cancer, TNFSF4 is involved in interactions with immune cells, particularly in facilitating the adhesion of activated T cells to target cells, and is associated with immune cell infiltration in various cancers (Luo2023Multiomics; Li2021The).
