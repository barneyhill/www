# TAAR8

## Overview
TAAR8, or trace amine-associated receptor 8, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the detection of trace amines, which are endogenous compounds structurally similar to classical biogenic amines. The TAAR8 protein is expressed in a variety of human tissues, including the olfactory epithelium, amygdala, and several peripheral organs, suggesting its potential role in diverse physiological processes (Berry2017Pharmacology). As a chemosensory receptor, TAAR8 is implicated in olfactory functions and may influence mood, cognition, and behavior through its interactions with neurotransmitter systems (Li2016Odor). Despite its widespread expression, the specific functions and mechanisms of TAAR8 remain largely undefined, necessitating further research to elucidate its role in human health and disease (Vaganova2023Trace).

## Structure


## Function
TAAR8 (trace amine-associated receptor 8) is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in the detection of trace amines, which are endogenous compounds structurally similar to classical biogenic amines. In humans, TAAR8 is expressed in various tissues, including the olfactory epithelium, amygdala, astroglia, leukocytes, stomach, intestines, heart, testes, lungs, spleen, kidney, and muscle (Berry2017Pharmacology). The receptor is associated with G protein signaling pathways, specifically G olf and G i, although its specific function in these tissues remains largely unknown (Berry2017Pharmacology).

TAAR8 is believed to play a role in olfaction, as it is expressed in the main olfactory epithelium and functions as a chemosensory receptor (Li2016Odor). The receptor's expression in the olfactory system suggests it may be involved in detecting chemical stimuli, potentially influencing mood, cognition, and behavior through modulation of neurotransmitter systems (Li2016Odor; Berry2017Pharmacology).

Despite these insights, the precise molecular processes and organismal outcomes associated with TAAR8 in healthy human cells are not well-defined, and further research is needed to elucidate its role (Vaganova2023Trace; Berry2017Pharmacology).

## Clinical Significance
TAAR8, a trace amine-associated receptor, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In melanoma, TAAR8 expression is significantly downregulated compared to benign nevi, suggesting a potential role in tumor pathogenesis. The study indicates that TAAR8, along with other TAARs, may serve as a therapeutic target in melanoma, similar to dopamine receptors, which have shown antineoplastic effects (Vaganova2022Deregulation). 

In breast cancer, TAAR8 expression varies across different tumor subtypes, with higher levels observed in circulating tumor cells compared to metastatic tumors. This suggests a role in tumor heterogeneity and progression. TAAR8 is co-expressed with genes involved in neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, indicating its involvement in complex signaling pathways that may influence cancer development (Vaganova2023The).

Beyond cancer, TAAR8 is also expressed in immune system cells, suggesting a potential regulatory role in immune functions. This expression pattern indicates that TAAR8 might be involved in the pathogenesis of immune responses, although further research is needed to fully understand its implications in immune-related disorders (Moiseenko2024Trace).

## Interactions
TAAR8, a member of the trace amine-associated receptor family, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that interacts with various biogenic amines, including putrescine and cadaverine. These interactions are facilitated by conserved aspartate residues within the receptor's binding pocket, specifically Asp 3.32 and Asp 5.43, which are crucial for stabilizing ligand binding through ionic interactions (Izquierdo2018Identifying). 

TAAR8 is suggested to couple with Gαi proteins, which can lead to a reduction in cAMP levels in heterologous cells, indicating its role in inhibitory signaling pathways (Xu2019TAAR). This coupling suggests that TAAR8 may participate in modulating neurotransmitter release and other physiological processes through its interactions with G proteins. 

The receptor's expression is generally low and sporadic in the human and murine hippocampus, which poses challenges for detecting its interactions in these tissues (Katolikova2022Expression). Despite the limited experimental data on TAAR8's specific protein interactions, its structural features and conserved residues imply a significant role in recognizing and binding diamines, contributing to its function as a chemosensory receptor (Izquierdo2018Identifying).
