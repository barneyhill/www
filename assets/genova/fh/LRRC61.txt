# LRRC61

## Overview
The LRRC61 gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat-containing 61 protein, which is part of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein family. These proteins are characterized by their involvement in protein-protein interactions and are often implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune response. The LRRC61 protein is particularly noted for its role in cellular signaling pathways and has been studied in the context of cancer biology, where it is associated with prognostic outcomes in certain cancers such as glioblastoma multiforme and triple-negative breast cancer (Wang2023An; Liu2020Prognostic). Additionally, LRRC61 has been linked to epigenetic modifications in keloids and genetic variations affecting ovarian follicle number and menopause, underscoring its diverse biological significance (Jones2016Biological; SchuhHuerta2012Genetic).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The LRRC61 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its altered expression and genetic variations. In cancer research, LRRC61 has been identified as a prognostic gene, particularly in glioblastoma multiforme, where its expression is associated with poorer survival outcomes (Liu2020Prognostic). It is also involved in constructing a risk score model for triple-negative breast cancer, where its expression levels correlate with copy number variations and act as a risk factor in multiple cancers (Wang2023An).

In the context of keloids, a type of fibroproliferative tumor, LRRC61 is one of the top hypermethylated genes identified in genome-wide DNA methylation studies. This hypermethylation suggests a role in the pathogenesis of keloids, potentially through epigenetic mechanisms affecting gene regulation (Jones2016Biological).

Additionally, genetic studies have linked LRRC61 to ovarian follicle number and menopause, with specific SNPs near the gene associated with variations in antral follicle count in certain populations (SchuhHuerta2012Genetic). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in diverse biological processes and its potential impact on various health conditions.
