# RIPK2

## Overview
RIPK2, or receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 2, is a gene that encodes a protein kinase involved in critical immune signaling pathways. The protein product of RIPK2 plays a pivotal role in the activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor essential for immune and inflammatory responses. As a serine/threonine kinase, RIPK2 is integral to the signaling cascades initiated by Nod1 and Nod2 receptors, which detect bacterial components and trigger immune responses. The protein's structure includes a kinase domain that forms an antiparallel dimer, essential for its function in NOD signaling and interaction with other proteins such as XIAP, which facilitates downstream ubiquitination processes (Cuny2021RIPK; Lethier2023Structure). RIPK2's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which are crucial for its role in immune regulation and its involvement in various diseases, including inflammatory disorders and cancers (Pham2023Recent; Pellegrini2017Structures).

## Structure
RIPK2, also known as receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 2, is a protein kinase involved in immune signaling pathways. The molecular structure of RIPK2 includes a kinase domain that is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This domain forms an antiparallel dimer, which is essential for its function in NOD signaling (Lethier2023Structure). The kinase domain interacts with the XIAP BIR2 domain, which binds across the RIPK2 dimer interface, engaging both monomers with different loops (Lethier2023Structure).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are critical for its activation. Phosphorylation occurs at specific serine residues within the activation segment, including Ser174, Ser176, and Ser178 (Pellegrini2017Structures). These modifications are associated with the transition from an inactive to an active state, characterized by structural changes such as the inward displacement of Helix αC and the formation of a stable dimer (Pellegrini2017Structures).

RIPK2 also interacts with the XIAP BIR2 domain, which is important for downstream ubiquitination processes. This interaction is facilitated by specific residues, such as N137 and N133, which are critical for binding (Lethier2023Structure). The phosphorylation state of RIPK2 is not necessary for NF-κB activation, as both wild-type and mutant forms can trigger signaling (Lethier2023Structure).

## Function
RIPK2, or receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 2, is a crucial component in the immune signaling pathways of healthy human cells. It primarily functions in the activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor essential for immune and inflammatory responses. This activation is mediated through interactions with Nod1 and Nod2 receptors, which detect bacterial peptidoglycan motifs from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Upon recognition, these receptors undergo conformational changes and oligomerization, recruiting RIPK2 through CARD-CARD interactions, leading to the formation of filamentous structures critical for signaling (Madrigal2012PathogenMediated; Cuny2021RIPK).

RIPK2 is also involved in the regulation of cell survival and death mechanisms, although it is not directly implicated in cell death regulation. It is cleaved by caspase-1, suggesting a regulatory role by caspases (Cuny2021RIPK). The kinase activity of RIPK2, including its autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues such as Tyr474, is essential for effective NOD2 signaling and subsequent NF-κB-mediated cytokine responses (TignoAranjuez2010Inhibition). RIPK2's activity is tightly regulated through ubiquitination, primarily mediated by XIAP, which is crucial for its role in NF-κB activation (Heim2020A; Cuny2021RIPK).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RIPK2 gene are implicated in various inflammatory diseases and cancers. In inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, RIPK2 is overexpressed in inflamed tissues, and its knockdown has been shown to reduce disease severity in colitis models (Pham2023Recent). In multiple sclerosis, RIPK2 deficiency leads to reduced T cell and dendritic cell activation, decreasing inflammation and disease progression (Pham2023Recent). A rare missense variant in RIPK2 is linked to early-onset osteoarthritis, increasing kinase activity (Pham2023Recent). In Behcet's disease, a missense variant in RIPK2 is a susceptibility locus, upregulating proinflammatory genes (Pham2023Recent).

In cancer, RIPK2 is generally overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, with significant expression differences noted in cancers such as bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, and colon adenocarcinoma (Zhang2022A). High RIPK2 expression is associated with poorer overall survival in several cancers, including cervical squamous cell carcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (Zhang2022A). RIPK2 is also linked to immune therapy resistance, particularly through cytotoxic T lymphocyte dysfunction, contributing to poor efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapies (Song2022Pancancer).

## Interactions
RIPK2 (receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 2) is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in immune signaling pathways. One of the primary interactions is with the BIR2 domain of the E3 ligase XIAP (X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis). This interaction occurs across the RIPK2 kinase dimer interface and is essential for the ubiquitination process that leads to NF-κB activation. The binding of XIAP BIR2 to RIPK2 does not require RIPK2's kinase activity or phosphorylation, highlighting its role as a scaffold protein in signaling pathways (Lethier2023Structure).

RIPK2 also interacts with proteins such as Erlin-1 and Erlin-2, which are involved in the ER-associated degradation pathway. These interactions suggest a role in regulating inflammatory signaling, particularly in response to ER stress induced by bacterial infections (Ellwanger2019XIAP). Additionally, RIPK2 is known to interact with 14-3-3 proteins, which are important regulators of immune responses (Ellwanger2019XIAP).

In the context of prostate cancer, RIPK2 interacts with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) to regulate the stability and activity of c-Myc, a key driver of metastasis. This interaction is crucial for the progression of prostate cancer, making RIPK2 a potential therapeutic target (Yan2022Receptorinteracting).
