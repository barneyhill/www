# IDH3A

## Overview
The IDH3A gene encodes the alpha subunit of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD(+)) 3 enzyme, a key component of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which is essential for cellular energy production. This gene is located in the mitochondria and is part of a heterotetrameric enzyme complex that includes two alpha, one beta, and one gamma subunit. The protein encoded by IDH3A is a dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, facilitating the production of NADH. This NADH is crucial for ATP generation via the electron transport chain, underscoring the enzyme's role in energy metabolism (Findlay2018Mouse; Bergaggio2019WildType). IDH3A is particularly important in tissues with high energy demands, such as the nervous system and retina, and is involved in maintaining redox balance by contributing to antioxidant defenses (Findlay2018Mouse; Bergaggio2019WildType). Mutations in IDH3A have been linked to various inherited retinal diseases and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Pierrache2017WholeExome; Solomou2023Mutant).

## Function
The IDH3A gene encodes the alpha subunit of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 (IDH3) enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, a central metabolic pathway for energy production in cells. IDH3 is a heterotetrameric enzyme composed of two alpha, one beta, and one gamma subunit, and it is located in the mitochondria. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, a reaction that is essential for the production of NADH. This NADH is then used in the electron transport chain to generate ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell (Findlay2018Mouse; Bergaggio2019WildType).

In healthy human cells, IDH3A is vital for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as the nervous system and retina. The enzyme's activity ensures efficient energy production, supporting cellular processes that require high energy input (Findlay2018Mouse). The IDH3A subunit is also involved in regulating redox status by contributing to the pool of reduced glutathione, thioredoxin, and catalase tetramers, which are necessary to counteract reactive oxygen species (Bergaggio2019WildType).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IDH3A gene are associated with several inherited retinal diseases, most notably retinitis pigmentosa (RP). RP is characterized by the progressive degeneration of photoreceptor cells, leading to symptoms such as night blindness and decreased visual acuity. Specific variants in IDH3A, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, have been identified as causes of autosomal recessive RP, sometimes accompanied by macular pseudocoloboma (Pierrache2017WholeExome). The severity of the disease phenotype can vary depending on the specific mutations present, with some variants also linked to severe infantile encephalopathy (Pierrache2017WholeExome; Solomou2023Mutant).

In addition to retinal diseases, IDH3A mutations have been implicated in neurological defects from birth, as seen with the homozygous missense mutation p.Pro304His, which causes severe encephalopathy and retinal degeneration (Solomou2023Mutant; Mahmoud2019In). Alterations in IDH3A expression levels have also been associated with various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, lung, and breast cancers, where overexpression correlates with poor prognosis (Solomou2023Mutant). These findings highlight the clinical significance of IDH3A in both inherited retinal diseases and cancer.

## Interactions
IDH3A, a subunit of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 enzyme, is involved in several interactions within cellular processes. In glioblastoma, IDH3A is part of a multienzyme complex that includes cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT), thymidylate synthase (TYMS), and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). This complex is crucial for one-carbon metabolism and DNA replication, particularly during the S phase of the cell cycle. IDH3A interacts with cSHMT, which is a rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo thymidylate synthesis pathway, and this interaction is significant for maintaining nucleotide biosynthesis and DNA methylation (May2019IDH3α).

The interaction between IDH3A and cSHMT has been validated through immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) studies and confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitations followed by Western blot analysis. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy has shown colocalization of IDH3A and cSHMT in the cytosol and at the nuclear envelope in S phase-arrested cells, suggesting a role in DNA replication processes (May2019IDH3α). This interaction is proposed to be more about the scaffold function of cSHMT rather than its enzymatic activity, as demonstrated in experiments with neuroblastoma cells expressing a dominant-negative cSHMT (May2019IDH3α).
