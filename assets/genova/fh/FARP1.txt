# FARP1

## Overview
FARP1, or FERM, ARH/RhoGEF and pleckstrin domain protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multi-domain protein involved in various cellular processes, including neuronal development and endothelial barrier integrity. The protein encoded by FARP1 is characterized by its FERM, RhoGEF, and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, which facilitate its role as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho GTPases, particularly Cdc42. This protein is crucial for cellular signaling pathways that regulate dendritic growth, synapse formation, and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. FARP1's interactions with cell surface proteins and its involvement in signaling pathways underscore its significance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, such as cancer and neurological disorders (Hirano2020FARP1; AmadoAzevedo2017A; Kuo2018Structural).

## Structure
FARP1 is a multi-domain protein involved in neuronal development, characterized by its FERM, RhoGEF, and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. The FERM domain of FARP1 is crucial for membrane localization and protein interactions, adopting a three-leaved clover fold typical of FERM domains. This domain consists of three subdomains: F1, F2, and F3. The F1 subdomain has a ubiquitin-like fold, the F2 subdomain is composed entirely of α-helices, and the F3 subdomain forms a β sandwich capped by a C-terminal α-helix (Kuo2018Structural). A conserved positively charged surface patch, including the KRKR motif, is essential for binding to phospholipids, facilitating membrane localization (Kuo2018Structural).

FARP1 also contains a Dbl-homology (DH) domain and two PH domains, which are features of Dbl-family GEFs for RhoGTPases (Kuo2018Structural). The DH-PH tandem is involved in guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity, influencing Rho family GTPases. The protein's structure suggests an autoinhibited conformation, indicating that FARP1 may regulate RhoGTPases indirectly (Kuo2018Structural).

FARP1 exhibits several splice variants, with molecular weights ranging from 51 to 420 kDa, and novel isoforms have been identified, suggesting non-canonical translation events (Prabakaran2014Quantitative).

## Function
FARP1 (FERM, ARH/RhoGEF and pleckstrin domain protein 1) functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) primarily for the Rho GTPase Cdc42, playing a crucial role in maintaining endothelial barrier integrity. It activates Cdc42, which is essential for stabilizing the endothelial barrier by signaling to its effectors, such as PAK7, and is balanced by the Cdc42GAP SYDE1, which inactivates Cdc42 to allow for junctional dynamics (AmadoAzevedo2017A). FARP1 is also involved in neuronal development, where it interacts with cell surface proteins like class A Plexins and SynCAM 1, promoting dendritic growth and regulating synapse formation (Kuo2018Structural). The FERM domain of FARP1 is critical for its membrane localization, binding to specific phospholipids, and facilitating interactions with cell surface proteins, which is important for its role in cellular signaling (Kuo2018Structural). In the context of kidney function, FARP1 is expressed in podocytes and is important for maintaining their function, as evidenced by its role in preventing proteinuria in zebrafish models (Rinschen2018A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FARP1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders. In advanced gastric cancer, high expression of FARP1 is associated with poor prognosis, lymphatic invasion, and metastasis. FARP1 promotes cancer cell motility and invasion through the activation of CDC42, interacting with integrin αvβ5. This integrin αvβ5-FARP1-CDC42 axis is crucial for cancer cell migration, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Hirano2020FARP1).

In the context of neurological disorders, a deletion in the FARP1 gene has been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A study involving a family with two children diagnosed with ASD found that the child with a 65 Kb deletion in the FARP1 gene did not respond to the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) treatment, unlike the sibling without the deletion. This suggests that FARP1 plays a role in synapse function and neuronal plasticity, impacting treatment outcomes in ASD (Cucinotta2020FARP‐1).

In pheochromocytoma, a type of neuroendocrine tumor, reduced expression of FARP1 correlates with decreased activity of Rho GTPases, such as Cdc42 and Rac1, which are involved in tumor progression (Croisé2016Cdc42).

## Interactions
FARP1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in neuronal development and cancer progression. In neurons, FARP1 interacts with the PlexinA family, specifically PlexinA1 and PlexinA4, and the coreceptor neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of dendritic complexity and spine number, acting downstream of Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) signaling (Cheadle2014ActivityDependent). FARP1 is recruited to dendrites by the Nrp-1/PlexinA1 complex, where it promotes dendritic branching and synapse formation (Cucinotta2020FARP‐1).

FARP1 also interacts with the intracellular GTPase Rac1, promoting actin assembly and dendritic growth (Cucinotta2020FARP‐1). In the context of cancer, FARP1 interacts with integrin β5, facilitating cell motility and invasion through the activation of CDC42, a small GTPase. This interaction is part of the integrin αvβ5-FARP1-CDC42 signaling axis, which is implicated in gastric cancer progression (Hou2021Roles; Hirano2020FARP1).

The FERM domain of FARP1 is involved in membrane localization and mediates interactions with cell surface proteins, such as PlexinA1 and SynCAM 1, influencing synapse number and dendritic spine morphology (Kuo2018Structural). These interactions highlight FARP1's role in both neuronal plasticity and cancer cell dynamics.
