# ZNF273

## Overview
ZNF273 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 273, a member of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which enable it to bind DNA and play a role in transcription regulation. Unlike many other KRAB domain-containing proteins, which typically function as transcriptional repressors, zinc finger protein 273 has been implicated in transcription activation through its interaction with the transcriptional activator TP53BP1 (Schmitges2016Multiparameter). Additionally, ZNF273 is involved in binding to endogenous retroelements (EREs), displaying a unique DNA-binding motif that distinguishes it from its paralog ZNF680 (Schmitges2016Multiparameter). The protein's diverse interactions and binding capabilities suggest a complex role in gene regulation, although the full extent of its functions and interactions remains to be fully elucidated.

## Function


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF273 is a C2H2 zinc finger protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a role in transcription regulation. It is known to interact with the transcriptional activator TP53BP1, suggesting a potential role in transcription activation, which is atypical for KRAB domain-containing proteins that are generally associated with transcriptional repression (Schmitges2016Multiparameter). 

ZNF273, along with its paralog ZNF680, binds to endogenous retroelements (EREs), although they exhibit different DNA-binding motifs due to variations in recognition residues. This indicates a significant diversity in the DNA-binding capabilities of ZNF273, contributing to its functional versatility (Schmitges2016Multiparameter). 

The interactions of ZNF273 with other proteins and nucleic acids are complex and not fully understood, as the stoichiometry, directness, or dependency among its binding partners have not been completely elucidated. This highlights the need for further research to fully comprehend the roles of these interactions in transcription regulation (Schmitges2016Multiparameter).
