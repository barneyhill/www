# DHRS13

## Overview
The DHRS13 gene encodes the protein dehydrogenase/reductase 13, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This family of proteins is involved in the metabolism of a wide range of substrates, including steroids, retinoids, and xenobiotics, through their enzymatic activity. Dehydrogenase/reductase 13 is characterized by its ability to catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions, playing a crucial role in cellular metabolic processes. The gene is expressed in various tissues, suggesting its involvement in diverse physiological functions. Although the specific biological roles of DHRS13 are still being elucidated, its expression patterns and enzymatic activity indicate potential implications in metabolic regulation and disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
