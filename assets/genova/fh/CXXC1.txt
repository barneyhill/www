# CXXC1

## Overview
CXXC1 is a gene that encodes the CXXC finger protein 1 (CFP1), a critical epigenetic regulator involved in DNA methylation and histone modification. CFP1 is characterized by its CXXC domain, which specifically binds to non-methylated CpG DNA, playing a pivotal role in the recruitment of chromatin-modifying complexes to CpG islands. This protein is a component of the SET1/COMPASS complex, essential for histone H3K4 methylation, a marker associated with active transcription. The CXXC1 gene is crucial for maintaining normal cytosine methylation patterns, which are vital for embryogenesis, cellular differentiation, and genomic stability. Alterations in CXXC1 expression or function have significant clinical implications, including impacts on immune responses, hematopoiesis, and male reproductive health (Liu2020Structural; Lin2019Epigenetic; Lee2005CpGbinding).

## Structure
The CXXC1 protein, also known as CFP1, is characterized by a central CXXC domain, which is a small module containing 50-70 residues. This domain includes two conserved CXXCXXC motifs that coordinate a zinc ion through four cysteine residues, forming two C4-type zinc fingers. The CXXC domain specifically binds to non-methylated CpG DNA, with its binding disrupted by mutation or methylation of the CpG motif (Liu2020Structural). The structure of the CXXC domain is crucial for its function in DNA binding and is involved in the recruitment of the SETD1A complex to specific genomic sites (Liu2020Structural).

The N-terminal PHD domain of CFP1 binds specifically to histone H3K4me1/me2/me3 marks, which are associated with the regulation of lineage commitment in embryonic stem cells. The C-terminal coiled-coil domain is required for targeting CFP1 to nuclear speckles and associates with nuclear matrices (Liu2020Structural). The CXXC domain's preference for non-methylated CpGpG containing DNA sequences is due to specific structural features, including base-specific hydrogen bonding interactions and steric clashes with methylated cytosine (Liu2020Structural).

## Function
CXXC1, also known as CXXC finger protein 1, is a critical epigenetic regulator involved in DNA methylation and histone modification processes in healthy human cells. It binds to unmethylated CpG motifs in DNA and is a component of the Set1 histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase complex, which is analogous to the yeast Set1/COMPASS complex. This complex is responsible for the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a marker associated with active transcription (Lee2005CpGbinding).

CXXC1 plays a vital role in maintaining normal cytosine methylation patterns, which are essential for embryogenesis and cellular differentiation. Its absence leads to decreased global cytosine methylation and altered histone modification patterns, such as increased H3K4 methylation and decreased H3K9 methylation, affecting chromatin structure and gene expression (Butler2009DNA; Lee2005CpGbinding).

In the nucleus, CXXC1 localizes to euchromatin regions, where it influences transcriptional regulation by recruiting chromatin-modifying complexes to CpG islands. This activity is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular differentiation, highlighting its importance in normal cell proliferation and development (Lee2005CpGbinding; Young2007CXXC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CXXC1 gene, which encodes the CXXC finger protein 1 (Cfp1), have significant clinical implications. CXXC1 is crucial for the differentiation of T helper 17 (T H 17) cells, which are involved in immune responses. Deficiency in CXXC1 impairs T H 17 cell differentiation, leading to a switch towards regulatory T (T reg) cells. This switch affects the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway, which is essential for T H 17 cell function, and has been linked to autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (Lin2019Epigenetic).

In hematopoiesis, CXXC1 is vital for maintaining hematopoietic homeostasis. Its deletion in mice results in hematopoietic failure, characterized by increased apoptosis in bone marrow cells and a loss of lineage-restricted progenitors. This leads to severe hematopoietic conditions and death, highlighting its essential role in blood cell differentiation and survival (Chun2014The).

CXXC1 also plays a role in male reproductive health. Loss of Cfp1 disrupts meiotic gene expression, leading to spermatogenetic arrest and male infertility. This is due to aberrant expression of genes essential for meiosis, affecting spermatogenesis and resulting in reproductive defects (Ki2022Epigenetic).

## Interactions
CXXC1, also known as CXXC finger protein 1 (CFP1), is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is a component of the SET1/COMPASS complex, which is essential for histone H3K4 methylation. CXXC1 interacts with the COMPASS complex through a monovalent zinc finger (ZnF) that binds to the subunit RbBP5, a crucial interaction for the methyltransferase activity of COMPASS (Yang2019A).

CXXC1 binds to non-methylated CpG islands via its CXXC domain, which forms base-specific hydrogen bonds with CpGpG DNA sequences. This interaction is stabilized by residues such as I199, R200, and Q201, which are crucial for recognizing the CpG motif (Liu2020Structural; Xu2011The). The CXXC domain's preference for non-methylated CpG motifs is distinct from other domains that bind methylated DNA (Xu2011The).

CXXC1 also interacts with the PRDM9 protein during meiosis, facilitated by the KRAB domain of PRDM9. This interaction is important for the localization of double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Imai2017The). Additionally, CXXC1 interacts with IHO1, a component of the meiotic DSB machinery, suggesting a role in loop/axis interactions during meiosis (Imai2017The).
