# DOCK9

## Overview
DOCK9 is a gene that encodes the protein dedicator of cytokinesis 9, a member of the DOCK family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). This protein is primarily involved in the activation of small Rho GTPases, specifically CDC42 and RAC1, which are critical for various cellular processes including cytoskeletal reorganization, cell migration, and intracellular signaling. As a GEF, dedicator of cytokinesis 9 facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on these GTPases, thereby regulating their activity. The protein is characterized by its DHR-1 and DHR-2 domains, which are essential for its function in membrane localization and GTPase activation, respectively. DOCK9 is expressed in multiple tissues, with its isoforms showing differential expression patterns, suggesting tissue-specific roles. It plays a significant role in vascular development and is involved in pathways such as TGF-β signaling, influencing cell motility and morphology. Mutations in the DOCK9 gene have been linked to certain diseases, including keratoconus, and alterations in its expression are associated with cancer progression (Dai2020Exosomal; Benson2021The; Czugala2011Novel).

## Structure
DOCK9, a member of the DOCK family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, features a distinct molecular structure characterized by specific domains essential for its function. The protein contains a DHR-1 (DOCK homology region 1) domain, which is involved in binding phosphoinositides, facilitating membrane localization through interaction with phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) (Benson2021The). The DHR-2 domain is crucial for its role as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, specifically activating the small Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP (Benson2021The; KukimotoNiino2021Structural).

The DHR-2 domain of DOCK9 exhibits a three-lobed structure, with lobe A mediating homodimerization and lobes B and C serving as binding sites for Cdc42. Lobe B consists of two beta-sheets and a major helix, while lobe C is a four-helix bundle containing a nucleotide sensor critical for GEF activity (KukimotoNiino2021Structural). The structural flexibility of DOCK9 allows it to recognize specific amino acids in its substrates, such as phenylalanine at position 56 in Cdc42, which is key for substrate specificity (KukimotoNiino2021Structural).

DOCK9 also exists in multiple isoforms, with DOCK9.1 and DOCK9.2 showing different expression patterns across tissues, indicating potential functional diversity (Parrado2020Expression).

## Function
DOCK9, also known as ZIZIMIN1, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that primarily activates the small GTPases CDC42 and RAC1, which are crucial for various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal reorganization, cell migration, and intracellular signaling (Kang2019Dissociation; Benson2021The). In healthy human cells, DOCK9 is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, influencing cell shape and motility. It plays a significant role in the formation of filopodia and membrane ruffles, which are essential for cell movement and morphology (Benson2021The).

DOCK9 is expressed in various tissues, including the lungs, placenta, uterus, and thyroid gland, with its isoforms showing differential expression patterns that suggest tissue-specific roles (Parrado2020Expression). In endothelial cells, DOCK9 contributes to vessel lumen morphogenesis by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton and influencing the development of lateral and tip filopodia (Benson2021The). It also interacts with SMAD2 and SMAD3 in response to TGF-β1, indicating a role in TGF-β-mediated regulation of cell motility (Benson2021The).

The protein's activity is facilitated by its DHR1 and DHR2 domains, with the latter being essential for CDC42 activation by promoting GDP dissociation and GTP binding (Kang2019Dissociation). This activation is critical for downstream signaling pathways that regulate cell polarity and migration (Kang2019Dissociation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DOCK9 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of keratoconus, a non-inflammatory corneal disorder. A specific mutation, c.2262A>C (Gln754His), was identified in an Ecuadorian family and showed complete segregation with the keratoconus phenotype. This mutation is located in the DHR1 domain of the DOCK9 protein, which is involved in phospholipid binding and protein-protein interactions. While the SIFT tool predicted this mutation to be tolerated, PolyPhen analysis suggested it might be damaging, indicating a potential role in disease development (Czugala2011Novel). The mutation was not observed in a control group, suggesting it may be a disease-causing mutation specific to certain populations (Skorodumova2019Search).

Alterations in DOCK9 expression have also been associated with other conditions. For instance, the long non-coding RNA DOCK9-AS2, related to DOCK9, is upregulated in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). It is involved in activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which enhances cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and stemness. This suggests that DOCK9-AS2 plays a significant role in the progression of PTC (Dai2020Exosomal).

## Interactions
DOCK9, a member of the DOCK-D subfamily, functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPases RAC1 and CDC42. It plays a significant role in vascular development by interacting with various proteins. DOCK9 is involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway, where it interacts with SMAD2 and SMAD3 in response to TGF-β1 stimulation, which is crucial for regulating cell motility (Benson2021The). It also associates with VEGF, promoting its interaction with DOCK4 to influence cellular actin dynamics, which is essential for the development of lateral and tip filopodia in endothelial cells (Benson2021The).

In the context of GDP dissociation from Cdc42, DOCK9 facilitates this process by disrupting hydrogen bonds and π-π interactions between Cdc42 and GDP, particularly in Mg-free systems. This interaction alters the orientation of Cdc42 side chains, leading to the loss of hydrogen bonds with GDP and the disruption of a π-π interaction between Phe28 of Cdc42 and GDP (Kang2019Dissociation). The presence of Mg2+ ions affects the orientation of Thr17, altering its hydrogen bonding with GDP, although DOCK9 still disrupts the π-π interaction due to changes in Phe28 orientation (Kang2019Dissociation).
