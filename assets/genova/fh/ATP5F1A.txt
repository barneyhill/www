# ATP5F1A

## Overview
ATP5F1A is a gene that encodes the ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha, a crucial component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, also known as complex V. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular energy production by facilitating the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during oxidative phosphorylation. As a part of the F1 domain of ATP synthase, the alpha subunit is involved in the catalytic conversion of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate into ATP, utilizing the proton gradient generated by the electron transport chain. The ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha is categorized as a structural protein within the enzyme complex, contributing to the formation of the α3β3 hexamer, which is essential for the enzyme's function. Beyond its structural role, ATP5F1A is implicated in broader regulatory networks, interacting with proteins such as Aurora kinase A, which influences cellular energy metabolism and cell cycle progression (Lines2021A; Sharma2023Auroraa).

## Structure
ATP5F1A, also known as ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha, is a critical component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, which is essential for ATP production during oxidative phosphorylation. The primary structure of ATP5F1A consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein's backbone. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of ATP5F1A results in a compact, globular shape, allowing it to interact effectively with other subunits within the ATP synthase complex. In terms of quaternary structure, ATP5F1A assembles with other subunits to form the functional ATP synthase complex, specifically interacting with the β subunit to form an α3β3 hexamer, which is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity (Tauchmannová2024Variability).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, potentially influencing the protein's activity and interactions. Although the context does not provide specific details on splice variant isoforms, such variants could affect the protein's function and regulation. The interaction between ATP5F1A and other subunits, such as ATP5F1B, is vital for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the ATP synthase complex (Sharma2023Auroraa).

## Function
The ATP5F1A gene encodes the alpha subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase, also known as complex V, which is a critical enzyme in cellular energy production. This enzyme is located in the inner membrane of mitochondria and plays a vital role in synthesizing ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell. ATP synthase facilitates the conversion of ADP and inorganic phosphate into ATP by utilizing the proton gradient generated by the electron transport chain (Lines2021A).

In healthy human cells, ATP synthase is responsible for more than 90% of cellular ATP synthesis, which is essential for maintaining cellular bioenergetics. The enzyme operates as a rotary ATPase, with its F1 domain catalyzing ATP synthesis and its FO domain functioning as a proton channel. The rotation of the central shaft within the enzyme is crucial for its function, as it links the F1 and FO sections, allowing for the conversion of energy from the proton gradient into chemical energy stored in ATP (Gu2019CryoEM).

The proper function of ATP5F1A is essential for energy metabolism, supporting various cellular functions and contributing to the overall energy homeostasis of the organism (Lines2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP5F1A gene, which encodes the α-subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase, are associated with a range of clinical phenotypes, from mild to severe mitochondrial disorders. A notable de novo heterozygous mutation, c.206G>A [p.(Arg207His)], has been linked to severe lactic acidosis and multiorgan failure in neonates. Despite the initial severity, affected infants often show significant clinical improvement during infancy, suggesting a potential spontaneous recovery mechanism (Lines2021A; Zeviani2021A).

Other heterozygous variants, such as c.545G>A (p.Arg182Gln) and c.1037C>T (p.Ser346Phe), are associated with milder conditions like psychomotor delay, dystonia, and intellectual disability. In contrast, severe phenotypes, often lethal, are linked to homozygous variants like c.962A>G (p.Tyr321Cys) and compound heterozygous variants such as c.985C>T + c.-49 + 418C>T, which can result in microcephaly, pulmonary hypertension, and neonatal encephalopathy (Tauchmannová2024Variability).

The c.620G>A variant, while initially causing significant symptoms, is considered mild due to symptom remission and normal development observed in patients by late infancy, indicating potential metabolic adaptation (Tauchmannová2024Variability).

## Interactions
ATP5F1A, also known as ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha, is a key component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, which plays a crucial role in ATP production during oxidative phosphorylation. This protein is involved in several interactions that are essential for its function and regulation.

ATP5F1A interacts with other subunits within the ATP synthase complex, such as ATP5F1B, to form the functional enzyme complex V of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This interaction is critical for maintaining the structural integrity and activity of the ATP synthase complex (Lines2021A).

Recent studies have highlighted the interaction between ATP5F1A and Aurora kinase A (AURKA), a protein involved in cell cycle regulation. AURKA is shown to be in physical proximity to ATP5F1A, suggesting a specific protein-protein interaction. This interaction is important for regulating energy metabolism and cell cycle progression, particularly in breast cancer cells. The downregulation of AURKA or ATP5F1A leads to cell cycle arrest and decreased ATP production, indicating that these proteins may form a regulatory nexus affecting cellular metabolism (Sharma2023Auroraa).

These interactions suggest that ATP5F1A not only plays a structural role within the ATP synthase complex but also participates in broader regulatory networks that influence cellular energy metabolism and proliferation.
