# NPAP1

## Overview
The NPAP1 gene encodes the nuclear pore associated protein 1, which is a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in human cells. This protein is characterized by its intrinsic disorder and lack of transmembrane domains, distinguishing it from other nucleoporins like POM121. NPAP1 is primarily expressed in the brain and testis, suggesting a role in neurological and reproductive functions. It localizes to the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC and is implicated in maintaining nuclear envelope integrity, although it does not significantly affect global mRNA export or transcriptional regulation. The gene is located in the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) region on chromosome 15 and may be involved in neurodevelopmental disorders such as PWS and potentially Angelman syndrome. The evolutionary history of NPAP1 indicates its origin from the vertebrate nucleoporin gene POM121 through retrotransposition and duplication, highlighting its evolutionary significance (Neumann2014The; Neumann2012The).

## Structure
The NPAP1 protein is a 1156 amino acid protein with six nuclear localization sequences, indicating its role in nuclear transport (Neumann2012The). It shows significant sequence similarity to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein POM121, although it lacks a transmembrane domain, which is typical of POM121 (Neumann2012The). NPAP1 is predicted to have a high probability of intrinsic disorder over extended regions, which is a characteristic of many nucleoporins, despite not containing FXFG repeats typical of these proteins (Neumann2012The).

The protein is associated with the nuclear pore complex, specifically at the nucleoplasmic face, suggesting it may extend into the nucleoplasm (Neumann2012The). NPAP1's localization to the nuclear envelope and its colocalization with nuclear lamins and NPCs have been confirmed through super-resolution microscopy (Neumann2012The). High levels of NPAP1 expression can lead to nuclear envelope malformations, similar to those observed in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, indicating its impact on nuclear morphology (Neumann2012The). The evolutionary history of NPAP1 suggests it originated from the vertebrate nucleoporin gene POM121 through retrotransposition and duplication (Neumann2014The).

## Function
The NPAP1 gene encodes a protein associated with the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which is crucial for regulating the transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This protein is primarily expressed in the brain and testis, suggesting a role in neurological and reproductive processes (Neumann2012The; Costa2019GenotypePhenotype). NPAP1 localizes to the nuclear envelope and is found at the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC, indicating a potential role in NPC assembly or function (Neumann2012The). Although NPAP1 lacks the FXFG repeat motifs typical of nucleoporins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, it is intrinsically disordered and may have a function unrelated to the selective permeability barrier (Neumann2012The).

High levels of NPAP1 expression can lead to nuclear envelope malformations, similar to those seen in certain genetic disorders, suggesting that NPAP1 may influence nuclear envelope integrity (Neumann2012The). Despite its association with the NPC, NPAP1 does not significantly affect global mRNA export or transcriptional regulation, indicating that its role may be more structural or related to specific cellular contexts (Neumann2012The). The gene has undergone positive Darwinian selection in primates, highlighting its evolutionary significance (Neumann2012The).

## Clinical Significance
The NPAP1 gene, located in the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) region on chromosome 15, is associated with the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome and potentially Angelman syndrome. Although the precise role of NPAP1 in these conditions is not fully understood, its expression in the fetal brain, particularly in regions like the hypothalamus, suggests a potential involvement in the endocrine features of PWS (Costa2019GenotypePhenotype). The absence of an NPAP1 orthologue in mice complicates the study of its role in PWS, as mouse models do not fully replicate the human phenotype (Neumann2012The).

NPAP1's association with the NPC suggests it may impact nuclear envelope integrity, as high levels of NPAP1 expression can lead to nuclear envelope malformations similar to those seen in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (Neumann2012The). Despite its localization at the nuclear envelope, overexpression of NPAP1 does not significantly affect global mRNA export or transcriptional regulation, indicating that its role in disease may be more related to structural integrity rather than direct transcriptional control (Neumann2012The). Further research is needed to clarify NPAP1's contribution to the clinical manifestations of PWS and related disorders.

## Interactions
NPAP1, also known as nuclear pore associated protein 1, is associated with the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in human cells. It localizes to the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC and is present in nucleoporin-enriched fractions, indicating a close association with the NPC (Neumann2012The). Despite being intrinsically disordered, NPAP1 can accomplish specific binding and may acquire structure upon interaction with other proteins (Neumann2012The). 

The protein shows significant similarity to the NPC protein POM121 and is suggested to be functionally related to the human NPC due to its similarity to nucleoporins like NUP153 and NUP214 (Neumann2012The). NPAP1 colocalizes with nuclear envelope components and nuclear lamins, suggesting its involvement in nuclear envelope structure and function (Neumann2012The). 

While NPAP1's precise function remains unclear, it is suggested to be part of the NPC or its associated molecular networks, potentially playing a role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope (Neumann2012The). However, overexpression of NPAP1 does not significantly affect global mRNA export or change mRNA expression profiles in HEK293 cells, except for a 10-fold increase in NPAP1 transcript itself (Neumann2012The).
