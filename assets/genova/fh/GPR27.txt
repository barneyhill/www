# GPR27

## Overview
GPR27 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 27, a member of the GPCR family, which plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. This receptor is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion and lipid metabolism. GPR27 influences insulin transcription and secretion in pancreatic beta cells and is implicated in maintaining glucose homeostasis and metabolic flexibility. The receptor's signaling pathways include the recruitment of β-arrestin 2, suggesting its involvement in G protein-independent signaling pathways. Alterations in the GPR27 gene have been associated with several diseases, including Parkinson's disease and gastric cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Dupuis2017Activation; Nath2019Genetic; Ku2012An; Oh2023Wholegenome; Pan2023Prognostic).

## Function
GPR27, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, is involved in several molecular processes within human cells. It is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and is implicated in insulin secretion. In pancreatic beta cells, GPR27 acts as a positive regulator of the insulin promoter, influencing both insulin transcription and secretion. Knockdown studies in MIN6 cells have shown that reducing GPR27 expression leads to decreased activity of the insulin promoter and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Ku2012An).

GPR27 is also associated with the regulation of lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. In zebrafish models, deletion of GPR27 results in altered acylcarnitine metabolism and insulin resistance, suggesting its role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and metabolic flexibility (Nath2019Genetic).

The receptor's signaling pathways are not fully understood, but it has been shown to recruit β-arrestin 2, indicating potential involvement in G protein-independent signaling pathways (Dupuis2017Activation). This recruitment suggests that GPR27 may play a role in β-arrestin-mediated pathways, which could be significant for its function in metabolism and insulin regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GPR27 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Parkinson's disease (PD), small genomic deletions in the GPR27 gene are associated with an increased risk of developing the condition. These deletions are linked to upregulated SNCA expression and a downregulated dopamine neurotransmitter release cycle, both of which are involved in PD pathogenesis (Oh2023Wholegenome). The study suggests that GPR27 copy number loss may contribute to PD development by affecting brain-specific gene expression and signaling pathways (Oh2023Wholegenome).

In gastric cancer (GC), GPR27 mRNA is downregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal gastric mucosa. Lower expression levels of GPR27 are associated with longer overall survival and disease-free survival in GC patients, indicating that high GPR27 levels may be a risk factor for poor prognosis (Pan2023Prognostic). The study also found that GPR27 mutations, specifically missense mutations, occur in 4% of GC patients and are linked to worse survival outcomes (Pan2023Prognostic).

In spinal cord injury (SCI), GPR27 is identified as a candidate marker with high diagnostic value, showing higher expression levels in SCI tissues compared to healthy controls (Zhang2023Comprehensive).
