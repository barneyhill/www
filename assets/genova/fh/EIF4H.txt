# EIF4H

## Overview
EIF4H is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4H, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the initiation of protein synthesis. The EIF4H protein is categorized as a translation initiation factor and functions primarily by enhancing the helicase activity of eIF4A, a crucial component in the unwinding of secondary structures in the 5' untranslated regions of mRNAs. This activity is essential for the efficient scanning of the 40S ribosomal subunit towards the initiation codon, thereby facilitating translation initiation (Fiume2013Eukaryotic; Gingras1999eIF4). EIF4H is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in global protein synthesis, impacting cellular processes such as growth and proliferation. The gene's expression is regulated by the NF-kB signaling pathway, linking it to various cellular responses, including inflammation and survival (Fiume2013Eukaryotic). Additionally, EIF4H can partially substitute for eIF4B, another translation initiation factor, underscoring its significant role in ribosome-mRNA interactions (Gingras1999eIF4).

## Function
EIF4H is a regulatory subunit of the RNA helicase eIF4A, playing a crucial role in the initiation of protein synthesis in human cells. It enhances the helicase activity of eIF4A, which is essential for unwinding secondary structures in the 5' untranslated region of mRNAs. This unwinding facilitates the scanning process of the 40S ribosomal subunit towards the initiation codon, thereby promoting efficient translation initiation (Fiume2013Eukaryotic; Gingras1999eIF4).

EIF4H is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to global protein synthesis, impacting cell growth and proliferation. The transcription of EIF4H is regulated by the p65 subunit of the NF-kB transcription factor, which enhances its expression. This regulation links EIF4H to the NF-kB signaling pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation, survival, and inflammatory responses (Fiume2013Eukaryotic).

In translation assays, EIF4H can partially substitute for eIF4B, another protein involved in translation initiation, indicating its significant role in facilitating ribosome binding to mRNA (Gingras1999eIF4). Overall, EIF4H is essential for efficient protein synthesis and is a key player in the regulation of translation initiation in human cells.

## Clinical Significance
EIF4H (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4H) is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or interactions. In the context of C9orf72-associated Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), EIF4H is significantly downregulated in patients with the G4C2 expansion mutation. This downregulation is observed in both patient-derived fibroblast cell lines and post-mortem cerebellar tissue, suggesting a role in the disease mechanism by affecting translation initiation and the production of toxic dipeptides associated with the G4C2 repeat (Goodman2019eIF4B).

In gliomas, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), high EIF4H expression is associated with reduced overall survival, indicating its potential role in tumor progression. EIF4H expression is significantly increased in glioma tissues compared to non-neoplastic brain tissue, and its interaction with eIF4A1 is considered a potential therapeutic target (Krassnig2021A).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), EIF4H is involved in cancer progression through alternative splicing regulated by RNA binding motif protein 10 (RBM10). The inclusion of EIF4H exon 5, enhanced by RBM10 loss, promotes LUAD cell proliferation and survival, making it a potential therapeutic target for RBM10-deficient LUADs (Zhang2020RNA).

## Interactions
EIF4H interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor 4AI (eIF4AI) to form stable complexes that enhance RNA binding and helicase activity. These interactions are facilitated by the presence of AMPPNP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, which stabilizes the eIF4AI-RNA complex (Rozovsky2008Interactions). EIF4H shares a common binding site on eIF4AI with another accessory factor, eIF4B, making their interactions mutually exclusive (Rozovsky2008Interactions). The eIF4AI:eIF4H complex shows a preference for binding longer RNA sequences, approximately 33 nucleotides, compared to eIF4AI alone, which binds preferentially to 17-nucleotide sequences (Rozovsky2008Interactions).

EIF4H contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and enhances the helicase activity of eIF4A by at least fourfold, facilitating the conversion of double-stranded RNA to single-stranded RNA in an ATP-dependent manner (GaliciaVázquez2009Highthroughput). High-throughput assays have been developed to study eIF4H-RNA interactions, using fluorescence polarization to measure binding (GaliciaVázquez2009Highthroughput). These interactions are crucial for the cap-dependent cross-linking to mRNA, suggesting a role in mRNA template seeding before ribosome recruitment (GaliciaVázquez2009Highthroughput).
