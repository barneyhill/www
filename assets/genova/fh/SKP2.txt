# SKP2

## Overview
The SKP2 gene encodes the S-phase kinase-associated protein 2, an F-box protein that is a pivotal component of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation by targeting specific proteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, thereby facilitating cell cycle progression. SKP2 is primarily involved in the degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27^Kip1, which is essential for the transition from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle. The protein is characterized by several structural domains, including an F-box domain and leucine-rich repeats, which are critical for its interactions and function. SKP2's activity is tightly regulated and involves interactions with other proteins such as Cks1, enhancing its substrate recognition capabilities. Dysregulation of SKP2 expression and function is associated with various cancers, making it a significant focus of clinical research and a potential therapeutic target (Asmamaw2020Skp2; Neudorf2022Reduced; Hershko2008Oncogenic).

## Structure
The SKP2 protein, also known as S-phase kinase-associated protein 2, is a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex. It is a 45 kDa oncoprotein composed of 424 amino acids and is primarily localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Asmamaw2020Skp2). The molecular structure of SKP2 includes several distinct domains: an N-terminal F-box domain, a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a destruction box (D-box) that regulates its stability, and a C-terminal region with leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) (Asmamaw2020Skp2).

The F-box domain, spanning residues TRP97 to THR139, contains three helices and a loop, and is crucial for binding with the SKP1 protein (Hosen2019Identification). The LRR domain, consisting of 10 consecutive repeats, is involved in substrate recognition and interaction with other proteins, such as Cks1 and p27 Kip1 (Asmamaw2020Skp2; Hao2005Structural). The C-terminal LRRs stabilize the interaction of SKP2 with SKP1 by folding back near the F-box (Asmamaw2020Skp2).

SKP2 also has a splice variant, Skp2B or FBXL2, which lacks exon 10 and includes exon 11, resulting in differences in substrate specificity (Asmamaw2020Skp2). The protein is involved in post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are critical for its function in cell cycle regulation (Hao2005Structural).

## Function
The SKP2 gene encodes an F-box protein that is a critical component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation by targeting specific proteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In healthy human cells, SKP2 is primarily involved in the degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27^Kip1. This degradation is essential for the transition from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle, as it allows for the activation of cyclin-A-dependent kinases, promoting cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation (Sutterlüty1999p45SKP2; Yokoi2002A; Cai2020The).

SKP2 functions as a substrate-recognition subunit within the SCF complex, facilitating the polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of its targets. This process is tightly regulated, requiring the phosphorylation of p27^Kip1 at threonine 187 for SKP2 recognition (Sutterlüty1999p45SKP2; Cai2020The). SKP2 is also involved in the ubiquitination of other proteins, such as cyclin E in its free form, and FOXO1, a transcription factor involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (Yokoi2002A; Cai2020The).

SKP2 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it forms complexes with other proteins, such as cyclin A and CUL-1, to execute its functions in cell cycle regulation (Sutterlüty1999p45SKP2; Lisztwan1998Association). The regulation of p27^Kip1 by SKP2 is crucial for maintaining proper cell cycle control, and its dysregulation is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer (Yokoi2002A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in SKP2 expression and function have significant clinical implications in various cancers. Overexpression of SKP2 is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior in several cancers, including breast, lung, prostate, and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, high SKP2 levels correlate with ER-negative tumors and poor survival outcomes (Hershko2008Oncogenic). In prostate cancer, elevated SKP2 expression is linked to high PSA levels and advanced clinical stages (Hershko2008Oncogenic). Similarly, in lung cancer, SKP2 overexpression is prevalent in males and smokers, serving as an independent prognostic factor (Hershko2008Oncogenic).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), reduced SKP2 expression is associated with chromosomal instability (CIN), which can drive early disease development. SKP2 loss leads to increased anchorage-independent growth and is linked to worse progression-free survival in CRC patients (Neudorf2022Reduced). In hematological malignancies, SKP2 is implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle and hematopoietic stem cell functions. Its high expression is linked to neoplastic transformation, while its depletion enhances stem cell quiescence (William2024SKping).

SKP2's role in cancer is complex, acting as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor depending on the context, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Neudorf2022Reduced).

## Interactions
SKP2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2) is a key component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a crucial role in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. SKP2 interacts with SKP1 and CUL1 to form a complex that is essential for its function as an E3 ligase. This complex specifically targets cell cycle regulators such as p27^Kip1, facilitating their degradation and promoting cell cycle progression (Yu1998Human).

SKP2 also interacts with Cks1, which enhances its ability to recognize phosphorylated substrates. Cks1 acts as an allosteric effector, increasing the binding affinity of SKP2 for phosphorylated p27, a process crucial for the ubiquitination of p27 (XU2003Proteinprotein). This interaction is specific to the phosphorylated form of p27, highlighting the regulatory role of Cks1 in SKP2-mediated ubiquitination (XU2003Proteinprotein).

In addition to its role in protein degradation, SKP2 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of Akt kinase activity through ubiquitination, which is linked to cell proliferation and survival (Asmamaw2020Skp2). SKP2's interactions and regulatory mechanisms underscore its significance in cell cycle control and cancer progression.
