# ACADSB

## Overview
The ACADSB gene encodes the enzyme short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD), which is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) family. This enzyme is integral to the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, where it catalyzes the dehydrogenation of short and branched-chain acyl-CoA derivatives, playing a pivotal role in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids such as isoleucine, leucine, and valine (Alfardan2010Characterization). The ACADSB protein is characterized by an alpha-beta fold and typically forms homotetramers, a structural configuration essential for its enzymatic function. This enzyme is crucial for energy production, particularly in tissues with high energy demands, and its deficiency can lead to metabolic disorders, although many individuals with such deficiencies remain asymptomatic (Kamide2007Association; Jiang2021Transcriptomic).

## Structure
The ACADSB protein is characterized by an alpha-beta fold, a structural motif commonly found in dehydrogenases. This fold is integral to its function in the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, where it catalyzes the dehydrogenation of acyl-CoA derivatives. The protein can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity or stability. In terms of quaternary structure, ACADSB typically forms homotetramers, a configuration that is essential for its enzymatic function. The ability to form such multimeric structures is a common feature among enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, allowing for cooperative interactions between subunits. The specific arrangement of these subunits and the presence of the alpha-beta fold contribute to the protein's overall stability and functionality within the mitochondrial matrix.

## Function
The ACADSB gene encodes the short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD) enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway. This enzyme is involved in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, such as isoleucine, leucine, and valine, by catalyzing the dehydrogenation of 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, a short/branched-chain acyl-CoA derivative (Alfardan2010Characterization). SBCAD is a homotetrameric enzyme, meaning it is composed of four identical subunits, and is part of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) family, which are responsible for the β-oxidation of fatty acids and amino acids (Alfardan2010Characterization).

In healthy human cells, the ACADSB enzyme facilitates energy production from fatty acids, which is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis, particularly in tissues with high energy demands like muscle and liver (Jiang2021Transcriptomic). The enzyme's activity is crucial during periods of increased energy requirements, such as illness, fasting, or physiological stress, as it helps meet physiological energy needs by contributing to the breakdown of fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids (Kamide2007Association). Deficiencies in SBCAD can lead to metabolic disorders, although many individuals with such deficiencies remain asymptomatic, suggesting a complex relationship between enzyme activity and clinical outcomes (Alfardan2010Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACADSB gene are associated with short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SBCADD), a metabolic disorder that affects the degradation of L-isoleucine. This condition is characterized by elevated levels of 2-methylbutyryl carnitine (C5) in the blood and 2-methylbutyrylglycine (2MBG) in the urine (Rossi2022Longterm; Lin2019Biochemical). While many individuals with SBCADD remain asymptomatic, some may experience symptoms such as developmental delays, seizures, hypotonia, and failure to thrive (Porta2019Clinical; Kanavin20072methylbutyrylCoA). The condition is often detected through newborn screening, which identifies elevated C5-carnitine levels (Matern2003Prospective).

The clinical presentation of SBCADD can vary significantly, with some patients developing severe neurological symptoms, while others remain unaffected (Alfardan2010Characterization; Kanavin20072methylbutyrylCoA). Certain mutations, such as the c.1165A>G mutation, are more prevalent in specific populations, like the Hmong, and are often associated with asymptomatic cases (Matern2003Prospective; Porta2019Clinical). Management of SBCADD typically involves dietary modifications and L-carnitine supplementation to prevent metabolic decompensation (Rossi2022Longterm; Porta2019Clinical).
