# LRRC36

## Overview
LRRC36 is a gene that encodes the protein leucine rich repeat containing 36, which is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the LRRC36 protein may play a role in cellular signaling or structural organization. While the specific biological functions of LRRC36 remain to be fully elucidated, its expression has been linked to various health conditions, including colorectal cancer and premature ovarian insufficiency. The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential significance in disease mechanisms and patient outcomes (RojasMartinez2020A; Zheng2014Gene; DiBattista2023Premature). Further research is necessary to clarify the precise roles and regulatory mechanisms of LRRC36 in human health and disease.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The LRRC36 gene has been implicated in several health conditions through its altered expression and potential involvement in disease mechanisms. In colorectal cancer (CRC), LRRC36 has been identified as a gene associated with CRC risk in Mexican mestizos. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) found several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the LRRC36 gene that are linked to an increased risk of CRC, suggesting its potential role in tumorigenesis (RojasMartinez2020A). Additionally, LRRC36 is negatively correlated with patient survival in colorectal cancer, particularly in the context of drug resistance. This correlation suggests that alterations in LRRC36 expression may contribute to poorer outcomes in CRC patients (Zheng2014Gene).

In the context of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), LRRC36 showed decreased expression, although these changes were not statistically significant. The study suggests that chromatin state changes and topologically associating domain (TAD) disruptions may influence gene regulation, potentially affecting LRRC36 expression (DiBattista2023Premature). These findings indicate that LRRC36 may play a role in various diseases, although further research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance.
