# NADK2

## Overview
NADK2 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme NAD kinase 2, which is a crucial component in cellular metabolism. This enzyme belongs to the kinase family and is responsible for the phosphorylation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to form nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) within the mitochondria. The production of NADP is vital for maintaining the redox balance and supporting various metabolic processes, as there is no mitochondrial transporter for NADP, making NADK2 the sole source of mitochondrial NADP (Houten2014Mitochondrial). The enzyme plays a significant role in the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is linked to several mitochondrial diseases when deficient (MURATA2021Polyphosphatedependent). Mutations in the NADK2 gene can lead to metabolic and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and overall cellular health (Houten2014Mitochondrial).

## Function
NADK2, also known as mitochondrial NAD kinase, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the phosphorylation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to produce nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) within mitochondria. This process is essential for the biosynthesis of NADP, as there is no mitochondrial NADP transporter, making NADK2 the sole source of mitochondrial NADP (Houten2014Mitochondrial). NADP and its reduced form, NADPH, are crucial for maintaining the redox balance in cells, supporting various metabolic processes, including the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids and lysine (Zhang2015MNADK).

NADK2 is involved in the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is vital for cellular health and is linked to various mitochondrial diseases (MURATA2021Polyphosphatedependent). The enzyme's activity is not dependent on calmodulin, distinguishing it from other NAD kinases (MURATA2021Polyphosphatedependent). NADK2 deficiency can lead to reduced mitochondrial NADPH levels, impairing the function of NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases like dienoyl-CoA reductase (DECR) and aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase (AASS), resulting in metabolic issues such as hyperlysinemia and decreased mitochondrial function (Houten2014Mitochondrial). The enzyme's function is critical in maintaining the balance between NAD, NADP, and their reduced forms, which is essential for cellular metabolism and energy regulation (MURATA2021Polyphosphatedependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NADK2 gene are linked to a range of metabolic and neurological disorders. NADK2 encodes a mitochondrial NAD kinase essential for the biosynthesis of NADP, a cofactor crucial for various metabolic processes. Mutations in this gene can lead to mitochondrial NADPH deficiency, resulting in conditions such as dienoyl-CoA reductase (DECR) deficiency and hyperlysinemia. These conditions are characterized by impaired mitochondrial function, leading to symptoms like metabolic acidosis, severe encephalopathy, developmental delays, and lactic acidosis (Houten2014Mitochondrial).

In humans, recessive mutations in NADK2 have been associated with a syndromic neurological mitochondrial disease. This disease is marked by metabolic changes, including hyperlysinemia and DECR deficiency, and manifests as severe neuromuscular disease, encephalopathy, dystonia, spastic quadriplegia, and epilepsy. The severity of symptoms can vary, with some patients experiencing milder symptoms such as decreased visual acuity and peripheral neuropathy (Murray2021Mouse).

Mouse models with NADK2 mutations exhibit similar neuromuscular and neurodegenerative phenotypes, including muscle atrophy, denervation, and cerebellar Purkinje cell degeneration. These models help elucidate the pathophysiology of NADK2 deficiency and its impact on metabolic pathways, particularly those involving lysine degradation and fatty acid oxidation (Murray2021Mouse).
