# HIGD1B

## Overview
HIGD1B is a gene that encodes the HIG1 hypoxia inducible domain family member 1B protein, which is an integral membrane protein primarily localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane. This protein is characterized by its structural features, including two transmembrane helices and an amphiphilic N-terminal helix, which are crucial for its function in cellular responses to hypoxic conditions (Klammt2012Facile). HIGD1B plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism, particularly under low oxygen conditions, thereby supporting cell survival and adaptation during hypoxic stress. The protein's involvement in these processes is essential for cellular homeostasis and viability, especially in tissues that frequently experience fluctuating oxygen levels. HIGD1B's expression and function have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, where it may act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the context (Wang2024HIGD1B; Zhou2021Identification; JIANG2010Analysis).

## Structure
The HIGD1B protein is a human integral membrane protein with a structure characterized by two transmembrane helices. These helices are loosely packed, with interhelical distances exceeding 8 Å, and relatively few interhelical van der Waals contacts are localized near the ends of the helices (Klammt2012Facile). The first transmembrane helix is preceded by an amphiphilic N-terminal helix, which is likely situated at the micelle-water interface (Klammt2012Facile). 

HIGD1B is monomeric when solubilized in detergents such as LMPG, DDM, and DM, as indicated by similar elution volumes across these detergents (Klammt2012Facile). The protein's structure was determined using NMR spectroscopy, employing techniques like transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) to facilitate resonance assignment and derive distance constraints (Klammt2012Facile).

The study of HIGD1B's structure provides insights into its potential functional roles, particularly in response to hypoxic conditions, although its biological functions are not fully defined (Klammt2012Facile). The structural analysis techniques used in the study could aid in understanding the protein's role in cellular processes.

## Function
HIGD1B, a member of the HIG1 hypoxia inducible domain family, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the cellular response to hypoxia. This protein is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it is integral to maintaining mitochondrial function under low oxygen conditions. In healthy human cells, HIGD1B is involved in critical processes such as cellular energy metabolism and the regulation of apoptosis. By supporting mitochondrial function, HIGD1B contributes to cell survival and adaptation during periods of hypoxic stress. The protein's activity in the mitochondria is essential for ensuring that cells can efficiently manage energy production and prevent cell death when oxygen levels are insufficient. This function is particularly important in tissues that frequently experience fluctuating oxygen levels, as it helps maintain cellular homeostasis and viability. Through its role in these molecular processes, HIGD1B supports the organismal outcome of enhanced cellular resilience in hypoxic environments, which is vital for overall health and function.

## Clinical Significance
The HIGD1B gene is implicated in several diseases, primarily through alterations in its expression levels. In gastric cancer, HIGD1B is significantly upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis, including shorter overall survival and progression-free survival. Its high expression is associated with advanced tumor grades and stages, and it is linked to pathways such as Hedgehog, TGF-b, MAPK, and Wnt, which are involved in tumor progression. HIGD1B also influences the tumor microenvironment, promoting immune escape and reducing the efficacy of immunotherapy (Wang2024HIGD1B).

In growth-hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas, HIGD1B is notably overexpressed, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis. The gene's expression is significantly higher in these adenomas compared to healthy tissues, indicating its potential involvement in tumor progression and angiogenesis (JIANG2010Analysis; Jiang2011Analysis).

In lung adenocarcinoma, HIGD1B shows lower expression levels compared to normal tissues, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role. Low expression is associated with a higher risk of malignancy, indicating a complex role in cancer biology that may vary depending on the cancer type (Zhou2021Identification).
