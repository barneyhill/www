# CDRT4

## Overview
The CDRT4 gene encodes the protein known as CMT1A duplicated region transcript 4, which is involved in various cellular processes. While the specific functions of the CDRT4-encoded protein are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in the pathogenesis of certain diseases, particularly through genetic alterations. The gene is located within a region that is often duplicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, suggesting a potential role in the disease's development (Weterman2009Copy). Additionally, CDRT4 has been linked to cancer, with evidence of its involvement in gene fusions and expression changes in adenoid cystic carcinoma and breast cancer (Yellapu2022Synergistic; Tang2023Transcriptomic). These associations underscore the importance of CDRT4 in both neuropathies and oncological research, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Clinical Significance
The CDRT4 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its involvement in genetic alterations and expression changes. In Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, a 186-kb duplication near the PMP22 gene, which includes CDRT4, has been identified in patients but not in control groups, suggesting its potential role in the disease's pathogenesis. This duplication may affect the expression of PMP22, contributing to the CMT phenotype (Weterman2009Copy).

In cancer research, CDRT4 has been associated with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) through the discovery of a TVP23C-CDRT4 gene fusion. This fusion was found in a subset of ACC samples and is thought to promote malignancy development, indicating its potential as a target for personalized treatment (Tang2023Transcriptomic). Additionally, CDRT4 expression is upregulated in breast cancer cells, and its expression is altered in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) when treated with a combination of JQ1 and GSK2801, suggesting a role in cancer progression and treatment response (Yellapu2022Synergistic).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of CDRT4 in both neuropathies and cancer, although further research is needed to fully understand its role and therapeutic potential.
