# FLCN

## Overview
The FLCN gene encodes the protein folliculin, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. Folliculin functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RagC and RagD GTPases, playing a pivotal role in nutrient sensing and cellular metabolism (Tsun2013The). The protein is characterized by a DENN domain and a longin-like domain, which are involved in guanine nucleotide exchange and membrane trafficking (de2020Nutrient; Laviolette2017Negative). Folliculin interacts with folliculin-interacting proteins FNIP1 and FNIP2, forming a complex that modulates mTORC1 activity and lysosomal positioning (Clausen2020Folliculin; de2020Nutrient). Mutations in the FLCN gene are associated with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, a disorder characterized by skin lesions, lung cysts, and an increased risk of renal tumors (Schmidt2018FLCN; Menko2009BirtHoggDubé). As a tumor suppressor, FLCN's role in cellular homeostasis and its implications in disease underscore its significance in human health (Schmidt2018FLCN; Benhammou2011Identification).

## Structure
The FLCN (folliculin) protein is a 64 kDa protein encoded by the FLCN gene, associated with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. It consists of 579 amino acids and is expressed in both the cytosol and nucleus (Clausen2020Folliculin; Nickerson2002Mutations). The protein contains a DENN domain, which is involved in guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity for Rab GTPases, and a longin-like domain at the N-terminal end (de2020Nutrient; Laviolette2017Negative). These domains are implicated in the regulation of small GTPases and membrane trafficking (de2020Nutrient).

FLCN forms a complex with FNIP1 and FNIP2, which are larger proteins containing similar domains. This complex regulates mTORC1 signaling and lysosome positioning by interacting with Rag and Rab GTPases (Clausen2020Folliculin; de2020Nutrient). The C-terminal region of FLCN has an αβ architecture similar to DENN family proteins, and it acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RagC (de2020Nutrient). FLCN is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which influences its interactions and stability (Baba2006Folliculin). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in cellular processes such as nutrient signaling and protein quality control (Clausen2020Folliculin).

## Function
The FLCN (folliculin) gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in several cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. FLCN acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the RagC and RagD GTPases, which are essential for signaling amino acid levels to mTORC1, a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism (Tsun2013The). This interaction is crucial for the proper activation and localization of mTORC1 to lysosomal membranes, where it becomes activated in response to nutrient availability (Tsun2013The).

FLCN also interacts with folliculin-interacting proteins FNIP1 and FNIP2, forming a complex that is necessary for the regulation of mTORC1 activity. This complex modulates the nucleotide state of Rag GTPases, facilitating the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosome under nutrient-rich conditions (de2020Nutrient). Additionally, FLCN is involved in energy sensing through its interaction with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), suggesting a role in coordinating cellular metabolism (Baba2006Folliculin).

In human embryonic stem cells, FLCN is crucial for the transition from naïve to primed pluripotency, regulating the localization of the transcription factor TFE3 and influencing Wnt signaling pathways (Mathieu2019Folliculin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FLCN gene are primarily associated with Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skin fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and an increased risk of renal tumors, particularly chromophobe renal carcinoma and hybrid oncocytic tumors (Schmidt2018FLCN; Menko2009BirtHoggDubé). Over 150 unique mutations in the FLCN gene have been identified, with frameshift, nonsense, or splice site mutations being the most common, leading to truncated and inactivated folliculin protein (Schmidt2018FLCN). The c.1285dupC mutation in exon 11 is frequently observed, indicating a mutational hotspot (Schmidt2018FLCN).

FLCN mutations are linked to a significantly increased risk of developing kidney neoplasia and spontaneous pneumothorax, with a 16% lifetime risk of renal cancer and a 29% risk of pneumothorax by age 70 for mutation carriers (Houweling2011Renal). The gene functions as a tumor suppressor, and somatic 'second hit' mutations in FLCN are common in BHD-associated renal tumors, supporting the Knudson 'two-hit' hypothesis (Schmidt2018FLCN; Benhammou2011Identification). Alterations in FLCN expression or function can disrupt cellular processes, contributing to tumorigenesis and other pathological conditions (Schmidt2021BirtHoggDubé).

## Interactions
The FLCN (folliculin) protein is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. FLCN binds with folliculin-interacting proteins FNIP1 and FNIP2, which act as co-chaperones to facilitate FLCN folding and protect it from proteasomal degradation (Clausen2020Folliculin). These interactions are crucial for the protein quality control system. FLCN also interacts with the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), serving as a regulator of the mTOR signaling pathway (Baba2006Folliculin).

FLCN forms complexes with FNIP1 and FNIP2, which are involved in nutrient signaling and lysosome positioning. These complexes interact with Rag and Rab GTPases, influencing mTORC1 signaling and lysosomal function (de2020Nutrient). FLCN acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RagC and Rab7A, facilitating endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation of EGFR (Laviolette2017Negative).

Additionally, FLCN interacts with p0071 (plakophilin-4), co-localizing at cell junctions and the midbody during cytokinesis. This interaction is linked to the regulation of RhoA signaling, affecting cytokinesis and cell polarity (Nahorski2012Folliculin). These interactions underscore FLCN's role in various cellular processes, including mTOR signaling, cell division, and energy sensing.
