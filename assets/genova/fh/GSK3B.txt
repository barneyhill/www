# GSK3B

## Overview
GSK3B, or glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein involved in a wide array of cellular processes. The protein, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, plays a pivotal role in regulating glycogen metabolism, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. It is a key component in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to its degradation and thus influencing cell fate and proliferation (Jope2004The; Sutherland2011What). GSK3B is also integral to neuronal functions, including neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, and is regulated by pathways such as PI3K/Akt and Wnt (SalcedoTello2011GSK3). The gene's alternative splicing results in variants like GSK3β2, which have distinct roles, particularly in the brain (Beurel2015Glycogen). Dysregulation of GSK3B is implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and pathology (McCubrey2016Roles; Grimes2001The).

## Structure
The molecular structure of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B) is characterized by its kinase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The primary structure of GSK3B consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein chain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of GSK3B is a three-dimensional conformation stabilized by interactions such as hydrogen bonds and disulfide bridges, although specific details on these interactions are not provided in the context.

GSK3B is known to undergo various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at serine-9, which inhibits its activity by blocking the binding of primed substrates (Beurel2015Glycogen). Other modifications include phosphorylation at Tyr216, cleavage, acetylation, mono-ADP-ribosylation, and citrullination, which may influence its substrate selection and activity (Beurel2015Glycogen).

Alternative splicing of the GSK3B gene can result in variants with altered functions, such as GSK3β2, which is abundant in the brain and involved in axon growth (Beurel2015Glycogen). These splice variants may lead to isoforms with different regulatory properties or functions.

## Function
Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. GSK3B is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences neuronal development and energy homeostasis (McCubrey2014GSK3; SalcedoTello2011GSK3).

In the Wnt signaling pathway, GSK3B phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to its degradation. This regulation is crucial for controlling cell fate and proliferation. When Wnt signaling is active, GSK3B is inhibited, allowing β-catenin to accumulate and promote the expression of target genes (Jope2004The; Sutherland2011What). GSK3B also interacts with transcription factors such as NF-κB, influencing cell survival and apoptosis (Hoeflich2000Requirement).

GSK3B is involved in neuronal functions, including neurogenesis, axon growth, and synaptic plasticity. It is more abundant in the adult hippocampus and is regulated by pathways such as PI3K/Akt and Wnt, which are essential for neuronal differentiation and survival (SalcedoTello2011GSK3).

## Clinical Significance
GSK3B (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta) is implicated in a variety of diseases due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. Dysregulation of GSK3B is associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, where it contributes to the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein and the production of amyloid-beta, both of which are key features of the disease pathology (Jope2004The; Grimes2001The). In psychiatric conditions like bipolar disorder, alterations in GSK3B expression and activity have been observed, with mood stabilizers and antidepressants potentially restoring its normal function (Beurel2015Glycogen; Grimes2001The).

In cancer, GSK3B plays a dual role, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context. It is involved in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival. Dysregulation of this pathway can lead to cancer progression, with GSK3B overexpression linked to poor prognosis in certain cancers like triple-negative breast cancer (Vijay2019GSK3β; TejedaMuñoz2015Glycogen). Additionally, GSK3B is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell regulation, influencing cancer invasiveness and metastasis (McCubrey2016Roles).

## Interactions
Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B) is involved in various protein interactions that play critical roles in cellular signaling pathways. In the context of Wnt signaling, GSK3B forms complexes with β-catenin (CTNNB1) and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), which are not observed with its isoform GSK3A. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of β-catenin, highlighting GSK3B's nonredundant function in Wnt signaling (Varjosalo2013The).

GSK3B also interacts with ULK1, a key protein in autophagy induction. It phosphorylates ULK1 at serine residues S405 and S415, which is essential for ULK1 activation and autophagy induction, particularly under conditions of insulin deprivation (Ryu2021GSK3B). This interaction is specific to ULK1, as GSK3B does not coimmunoprecipitate with ULK2, indicating a selective regulatory mechanism (Ryu2021GSK3B).

In colorectal cancer, GSK3B phosphorylates TRAF6 at Thr266, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. This process inhibits the selective autophagic degradation of CTNNB1, linking GSK3B activity to cancer metastasis regulation (Wu2019TRAF6). These interactions underscore GSK3B's role in diverse cellular processes, including signaling, autophagy, and cancer progression.
