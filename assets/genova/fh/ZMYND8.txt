# ZMYND8

## Overview
ZMYND8 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger MYND-type containing 8 protein, which is a multifunctional transcription factor involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by its complex structure, including domains such as PHD, BROMO, and PWWP, which facilitate interactions with histone modifications and other proteins (Li2016ZMYND8; Yao2017The). ZMYND8 plays a critical role in transcriptional activation by recruiting the P-TEFb complex to transcription start sites and is involved in the DNA damage response by promoting homologous recombination (Gong2015Screen; Ghosh2018Positive). Clinically, alterations in ZMYND8 expression are associated with various cancers, including breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis (Dou2021ZMYND8; Chen2021Regulation). The protein's interactions with chromatin and transcriptional machinery underscore its significance in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression.

## Structure
ZMYND8 is a protein characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains crucial for its function. The protein contains a PHD-BROMO-PWWP (PBP) tandem, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins, such as Drebrin, and for recognizing specific histone modifications (Li2016ZMYND8; Yao2017The). The PHD domain is involved in binding to histone marks like H3K4me0, while the BROMO domain interacts with acetylated lysines, such as H3K14ac (Li2016ZMYND8). The PWWP domain is known for its role in chromatin binding and regulation (Yao2017The).

The tertiary structure of ZMYND8 includes a groove formed by the BROMO, zinc-finger, and PWWP domains, which facilitates specific protein-protein interactions (Yao2017The). The protein also contains a MYND domain, which is a zinc-finger motif involved in protein-protein interactions (Yao2017The). ZMYND8 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which influence its function in transcriptional regulation and DNA damage response. Splice variant isoforms of ZMYND8 may exist, contributing to its diverse functional roles (Li2016ZMYND8). The interaction with Drebrin suggests a cytoplasmic sequestering mechanism, affecting the protein's localization and function (Yao2017The).

## Function
ZMYND8 is a multifunctional transcription factor involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation in healthy human cells. It interacts with chromatin remodeling complexes and histone demethylase/deacetylase enzymes, indicating its role in chromatin template-dependent processes such as transcription and DNA repair (Adhikary2016Selective). ZMYND8 is known to interact with core histones H3 and H4, with a preference for modified histones, particularly H3.1 and H4K16Ac, through its chromatin-binding modules (Adhikary2016Selective).

ZMYND8 plays a critical role in regulating transcription by recruiting the P-TEFb complex to the transcription start site of target genes, facilitating the release of paused RNA polymerase II into productive elongation (Ghosh2018Positive). This recruitment is essential for transcriptional activation and is particularly important for processes such as retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation (Ghosh2018Positive). ZMYND8 also interacts with RNA polymerase II phosphorylated at Ser-5, suggesting its involvement in transcription initiation (Adhikary2016Selective).

In addition to its role in transcription, ZMYND8 is involved in the DNA damage response, where it recruits the chromatin remodeler CHD4 to sites of DNA damage, promoting homologous recombination and maintaining genomic stability (Gong2015Screen). This function is crucial for repairing DNA lesions and ensuring cellular homeostasis (Gong2018Double).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ZMYND8 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, ZMYND8 is involved in promoting angiogenesis and metastasis through interactions with hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and BRD4, enhancing the transcription of HIF target genes (Chen2018ZMYND8). High expression levels of ZMYND8 are associated with poor survival outcomes in breast, colorectal, cervical, and prostate cancers, and it is particularly noted for its role in promoting metastasis in breast cancer (Chen2021Regulation).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ZMYND8 is crucial for sustaining leukemia cell proliferation by regulating the transcription of IRF8 and MYC. Its depletion leads to reduced expression of these genes, suppressing leukemia growth (Cao2021ZMYND8regulated). ZMYND8's interaction with BRD4 is essential for its function in AML, and targeting this interaction could be a therapeutic strategy (Cao2021ZMYND8regulated).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZMYND8 is up-regulated and associated with larger tumor size and advanced disease stages. Its overexpression enhances glycolysis, promoting tumor growth and metastasis (Dou2021ZMYND8). In bladder cancer, ZMYND8 acts as an oncogene, promoting tumor progression and stemness, particularly when the tumor suppressor FBXW7 is down-regulated (Qiu2021Aberrant).

## Interactions
ZMYND8 is a protein that engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin dynamics. It exists in both monomeric and dimeric forms, with each form associating with different complexes. The dimeric form of ZMYND8 preferentially associates with the P-TEFb complex, which is involved in transcriptional activation. This interaction is mediated through the coiled-coil domain of ZMYND8, facilitating the recruitment of the P-TEFb complex to target genes (Ghosh2018Positive). In contrast, the monomeric form of ZMYND8 associates with the CHD4 subunit of the NuRD complex, which is involved in transcriptional repression (Ghosh2018Positive).

ZMYND8 also contains a PHD/BRD/PWWP triple reader cassette that allows it to engage with histone modifications and DNA. It interacts with histone marks such as H3K14ac, which enhances its binding to chromatin (Savitsky2016Multivalent). The protein is recruited to DNA-damaged sites through interactions with histone H4 and the NuRD component CHD4 (Savitsky2016Multivalent). Additionally, ZMYND8 interacts with JARID1D, a corepressor, to mediate gene repression, particularly at metastasis-linked genes (Li2016ZMYND8). These interactions highlight ZMYND8's role as a versatile regulator of gene expression, capable of both activating and repressing transcription depending on its interacting partners.
