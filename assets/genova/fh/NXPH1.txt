# NXPH1

## Overview
NXPH1 is a gene that encodes the protein neurexophilin 1, a secreted glycoprotein involved in synaptic function. Neurexophilin 1 interacts primarily with α-neurexins, which are presynaptic cell adhesion molecules essential for synapse formation and maintenance. This interaction is crucial for modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity, particularly at inhibitory synapses where it influences the activity of GABA receptors (Born2014Modulation; Missler1998Neurexophilin). The protein is characterized by a unique structural architecture, including interleaved beta-strands and beta-sandwiches, which facilitate its binding to neurexins (Wilson2019Structures). Neurexophilin 1 also plays roles beyond the nervous system, such as in hematopoiesis, where it inhibits the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (Kinzfogl2011Neurexophilin). Alterations in NXPH1 expression have been linked to various clinical conditions, including neuroblastoma and neuroinflammatory diseases, highlighting its significance in both neural and non-neural contexts (FanloEscudero2021Neural; Wang2020miR1945p).

## Structure
Neurexophilin 1 (NXPH1) is a secreted glycoprotein that interacts with neurexins, playing a significant role in synaptic function. The primary structure of NXPH1 includes a signal peptide, a pro-domain, a polybasic cleavage site, and a mature fragment (Wilson2019Structures). The mature form of NXPH1 does not consist of two independently folded domains as previously thought, but rather forms a unique architecture with interleaved beta-strands from its N- and C-terminal regions (Wilson2019Structures).

The secondary structure of NXPH1 is characterized by beta-sandwiches that form an extended fold when complexed with neurexin domains (Wilson2019Structures). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation, which is crucial for the stability of its complex with neurexins (Reissner2014Dystroglycan). Glycosylation patterns include complex-type glycans and high mannose-type oligosaccharides (Reissner2014Dystroglycan).

NXPH1 forms a quaternary structure by binding to the LNS2 domain of neurexins through a unique binding interface characterized by anti-parallel beta-strand interactions and specific hydrophobic and polar interactions (Wilson2019Structures). This interaction is regulated by alternative splicing, which can modulate the binding affinity (Wilson2019Structures). The presence of splice variant isoforms, such as the SS2A insert, enhances the binding affinity by adding stabilizing hydrophobic interactions (Wilson2019Structures).

## Function
Neurexophilin 1 (NXPH1) is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a significant role in synaptic function by interacting with neurexins, which are cell adhesion molecules crucial for synapse formation and maintenance. NXPH1 binds specifically to α-neurexins, forming a tight complex that influences synaptic transmission and plasticity (Missler1998Neurexophilin). This interaction is particularly important at inhibitory synapses, where NXPH1 is localized and modulates the activity of GABA receptors, contributing to the diversity of inhibitory synaptic properties (Born2014Modulation; Reissner2014Dystroglycan).

NXPH1's binding to neurexins is not regulated by alternative splicing, which distinguishes it from other neurexin interactions and highlights its specific role in certain GABAergic interneurons (Born2014Modulation). The protein's presence at presynaptic terminals suggests it may influence synaptic stabilization and plasticity, particularly in the thalamic reticular nucleus (Born2014Modulation). NXPH1 also plays a role in hematopoiesis by inhibiting the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells through its interaction with NRXN1α, a receptor expressed in primitive hematopoietic populations (Kinzfogl2011Neurexophilin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NXPH1 gene have been associated with several health conditions. In the context of neuroblastoma, a pediatric cancer, NXPH1 expression is linked to favorable patient prognosis. High levels of NXPH1 are associated with low-risk neuroblastomas, which exhibit reduced disease progression and metastasis. The NXPH1/α-NRXN signaling pathway is implicated in promoting tumor growth while inhibiting metastasis, suggesting a dual role in neuroblastoma pathogenesis (FanloEscudero2021Neural).

NXPH1 is also involved in hematopoiesis, where it acts as a potent inhibitor of hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation. This inhibition is mediated through its interaction with Neurexin I α (NRXN1α) and Dystroglycan (DAG1). High concentrations of NXPH1 in human cord blood plasma have been linked to myelo- and lymphosuppression, although it does not affect the long-term repopulating activity of hematopoietic stem cells (Kinzfogl2011Neurexophilin).

In the nervous system, NXPH1 is implicated in neuroinflammatory conditions. The miR-194-5p/NXPH1 axis plays a significant role in modulating astrocyte activation and inflammation. Alterations in this pathway could have implications for neurodegenerative diseases and conditions involving astrocyte dysfunction (Wang2020miR1945p).

## Interactions
Neurexophilin 1 (NXPH1) is known for its interactions with α-neurexins (α-Nrxn), which are presynaptic cell adhesion molecules. NXPH1 binds specifically to the LNS2 domain of α-neurexin, forming a complex that is crucial for synaptic function. This interaction is characterized by a unique binding interface, where the β-sandwiches of NXPH1 and the LNS2 domain form an extended fold. The binding is regulated by alternative splicing at splice site #2 (SS2), which enhances the binding affinity of NXPH1 for α-neurexin (Wilson2019Structures).

NXPH1 competes with other ligands such as dystroglycan (DAG) and neuroligin (Nlgn) for binding to α-neurexin. Although NXPH1 and DAG bind to the same LNS domain, they occupy different epitopes, suggesting a competitive interaction that may influence synaptic organization (Reissner2014Dystroglycan). NXPH1's binding to α-neurexin is independent of calcium and splice sites, and it prevents the simultaneous binding of α-dystroglycan to the LNS2 domain, likely due to steric hindrance (Reissner2014Dystroglycan).

NXPH1 also interacts with GABA receptors, modulating synaptic function at inhibitory synapses. It influences synaptic plasticity by interacting with presynaptic GABA B receptors and postsynaptic GABA A receptors, affecting synaptic responses and receptor composition (Born2014Modulation).
