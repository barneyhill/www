# NUP62CL

## Overview
NUP62CL is a gene that encodes the protein nucleoporin 62 C-terminal like, which is part of the nucleoporin family. These proteins are integral components of the nuclear pore complex, which regulates the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. NUP62CL is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and immune response modulation. Its expression and methylation status have been linked to several diseases, such as skin cutaneous melanoma and multiple sclerosis, highlighting its potential role in disease progression and as a prognostic marker (Sun2021Integrative; Khan2020Role; Cardamone2018Not).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
NUP62CL has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), NUP62CL is identified as a driven gene with significant prognostic value. The gene exhibits hypermethylation, which negatively correlates with its mRNA expression, suggesting that methylation sites may play a crucial role in regulating its expression and potentially impacting melanoma progression (Sun2021Integrative).

In the context of cell differentiation, NUP62CL is upregulated during osteogenic induction in mesenchymal stem cells, indicating its role in osteogenesis. This upregulation suggests that NUP62CL may be involved in the differentiation processes that are critical for bone formation (Khan2020Role).

Additionally, NUP62CL expression is affected in multiple sclerosis (MS), where it is downregulated following MALAT1 knockdown in T cells. This suggests a potential link between NUP62CL expression and immune system-related pathways in MS, although the specific mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Cardamone2018Not).

Overall, while NUP62CL's precise role in disease pathogenesis is still under investigation, its altered expression and methylation patterns are associated with significant clinical implications in cancer and cell differentiation.
