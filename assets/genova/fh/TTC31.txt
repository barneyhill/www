# TTC31

## Overview
TTC31, or tetratricopeptide repeat domain 31, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly those related to chromosome stability and cell division. The protein encoded by TTC31 is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are known for their role in facilitating protein-protein interactions. These domains, along with intrinsically disordered regions, enable the protein to act as a hub in protein-protein interaction networks, assembling and regulating multiprotein complexes essential for cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways (Van2020Intrinsic). The structural features of TTC31, including coiled-coil regions and post-translational modification sites, contribute to its functional versatility and interaction potential. Studies have demonstrated that TTC31 is crucial for centrosome duplication and proper chromosome segregation during mitosis, with its depletion leading to defects in these processes (Vizeacoumar2013A).

## Structure
The human tetratricopeptide repeat protein 31 (TTC31) is a 519-residue-long protein characterized by the presence of a coiled-coil region and three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs). The coiled-coil region is located between residues 147-197, while the TPRs are found at residues 305-338, 339-372, and 373-406. These TPRs have average disorder scores of 0.17 ± 0.12, 0.15 ± 0.06, and 0.30 ± 0.11, respectively, indicating varying levels of intrinsic disorder (Van2020Intrinsic).

TTC31 also exhibits two long intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) spanning residues 82-310 and 399-519. These regions encompass the coiled-coil region and the C-terminal part of the last TPR, contributing to the protein's structural flexibility and interaction potential. The protein contains several post-translational modification sites and 12 molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are crucial for its role in protein-protein interactions (Van2020Intrinsic).

An alternatively spliced isoform of TTC31 exists, where the region 281-285 is altered from REERP to ATSPC, and the entire C-terminal half (residues 286-519) is missing. This results in a highly disordered isoform, further highlighting the protein's structural variability (Van2020Intrinsic).

## Function
TTC31, or tetratricopeptide repeat domain 31, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining chromosome stability and proper cell division. The protein is involved in centrosome duplication, a critical process for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. Knockdown studies in cancer cell lines, such as HCT116 and HeLa cells, have shown that depletion of TTC31 leads to the formation of additional centrosome structures and chromosome congression defects, indicating its essential role in regulating centrosome duplication and ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation (Vizeacoumar2013A).

TTC31 contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These domains contribute to the protein's role in assembling and regulating multiprotein complexes, which are vital for various cellular processes, including signaling pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Van2020Intrinsic). The protein's structure includes intrinsically disordered regions, which allow for binding promiscuity and interaction with multiple partners, further supporting its function as a hub in protein-protein interaction networks (Van2020Intrinsic).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TTC31, a human protein with tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, is involved in a complex network of protein-protein interactions. The protein is characterized by a coiled-coil region and three TPRs, with two long intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) that facilitate its interaction capabilities. The TTC31-centered protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, as analyzed by STRING, includes 69 proteins connected by 689 interactions. This network is notable for its high average node degree of 20 and an average local clustering coefficient of 0.813, indicating a dense interaction network. The PPI enrichment p-value is less than 10^-16, suggesting that the observed interactions are significantly more than what would be expected by chance (Van2020Intrinsic).

TTC31 also contains several post-translational modification (PTM) sites and 12 molecular recognition features (MoRFs) distributed across the protein, which are crucial for its interaction with other proteins. These features enable TTC31 to participate in both stable and transient interactions, influencing various cellular processes. The presence of these MoRFs and PTM sites highlights the protein's role as a hub in the PPI network, facilitating diverse molecular interactions (Van2020Intrinsic).
