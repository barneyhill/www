# BTBD9

## Overview
BTBD9 is a gene that encodes the BTB domain-containing 9 protein, which functions primarily as an adaptor protein within the cullin-3 (CRL3) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, oxidative stress regulation, and mitochondrial function. The BTBD9 protein contains a BTB/POZ domain and a BACK domain, which are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation and substrate orientation within ubiquitin-ligase complexes (DeAndrade2012Motor; DeAndrade2012Enhanced). It is expressed in the hippocampus and is implicated in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission, suggesting a role in learning and memory (DeAndrade2012Enhanced). Clinically, BTBD9 is associated with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Periodic Limb Movements during Sleep (PLMS), with genetic studies identifying it as a risk factor for these conditions (Freeman2013The; De2011BEHAVIORAL). The protein's involvement in the degradation of TNFAIP1 also highlights its potential implications in cancer biology, particularly in suppressing cancer cell migration (Li2020The).

## Structure
The BTBD9 protein contains two structurally conserved domains: a BTB/POZ domain near the N-terminus and a BACK domain. The BTB/POZ domain is associated with transcriptional regulation, cytoskeleton dynamics, ion conductance, and protein ubiquitination (DeAndrade2012Motor; DeAndrade2012Enhanced). The BACK domain is important for maintaining proper substrate orientation, primarily for E3 ubiquitin-ligase complexes (DeAndrade2012Enhanced). 

BTBD9 functions as an adaptor protein in the CRL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it interacts with TNFAIP1, targeting it for ubiquitination and degradation (Li2020The). This interaction suggests a role in determining the specificity of the CRL3 complex for its substrates (Li2020The). 

The protein is naturally expressed in the hippocampus, a region critical for learning and memory, and has been implicated in synaptic plasticity and transmission (DeAndrade2012Enhanced). Despite these functional insights, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of BTBD9 are not provided in the available literature (Li2020The; DeAndrade2012Enhanced).

## Function
The BTBD9 gene encodes a protein that functions as an adaptor for the cullin-3 class of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which are involved in protein degradation processes. This activity is crucial for regulating oxidative stress and maintaining mitochondrial function, particularly in response to environmental stressors like manganese exposure (Chen2022BTBD9). BTBD9 is implicated in the insulin growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway, where it negatively regulates AKT levels, leading to the upregulation of FOXO, a transcription factor involved in cellular stress responses and mitochondrial homeostasis (Chen2022BTBD9).

In cellular models, BTBD9 has been shown to protect against manganese-induced oxidative stress and neurotoxicity by modulating the DAF-16/FOXO signaling pathway, which is a key component of the IGF signaling pathway (Chen2022BTBD9). The protein's role in this pathway suggests it may help maintain neuronal integrity and cellular health under stress conditions (Chen2022BTBD9).

BTBD9 is also involved in the degradation of TNFAIP1, a protein associated with cancer cell migration. By promoting the degradation of TNFAIP1 through the CRL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, BTBD9 suppresses cancer cell migration, highlighting its role in cellular regulation and potential implications in cancer biology (Li2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BTBD9 gene are significantly associated with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Periodic Limb Movements during Sleep (PLMS). Genome-wide association studies have identified BTBD9 as a genetic risk factor for these conditions, with specific polymorphisms linked to increased susceptibility (Freeman2013The; De2011BEHAVIORAL). BTBD9 mutations can lead to RLS-like symptoms, including motor restlessness, sleep disturbances, and sensory alterations, as observed in animal models (Lyu2020The; DeAndrade2012Motor).

In Btbd9 knockout mice, these symptoms are accompanied by changes in iron homeostasis and dopamine pathways, which are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of RLS (Lyu2020Thea; DeAndrade2012Motor). The BTBD9 gene is also implicated in altered neural activity and cortical thickness, particularly in the somatosensory and motor cortices, which may underlie the sensory and motor symptoms observed in RLS (Lyu2020The).

The BTBD9 gene's role in these conditions is further supported by its involvement in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission, with studies indicating that BTBD9 mutations can lead to enhanced short-term plasticity at corticostriatal terminals (Lyu2020The). These findings suggest that BTBD9 plays a crucial role in the development and manifestation of RLS and related disorders.

## Interactions
BTBD9 is known to function as an adaptor protein within the CRL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it plays a crucial role in targeting TNFAIP1 for degradation. This interaction has been confirmed through immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis, demonstrating that BTBD9 physically interacts with TNFAIP1 to facilitate its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Li2020The). The CRL3 complex, which includes components such as Cul3 and ROC1, is responsible for mediating the ubiquitination process, with BTBD9 serving as a key adaptor that binds to TNFAIP1 (Li2020The). This interaction is significant in the context of cancer biology, as the degradation of TNFAIP1 by the CRL3BTBD9 complex is associated with the suppression of cancer cell migration, particularly in lung cancer (Li2020The).

While BTBD9's role in the CRL3 complex is well-documented, there is no specific information provided about its interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins outside of this complex in the context of the studies reviewed (Li2020The; Lyu2020BTBD9).
