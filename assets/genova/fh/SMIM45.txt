# SMIM45

## Overview
SMIM45 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 45, which is characterized by its role as an integral membrane protein. The gene contains two open reading frames (ORFs): a highly conserved 68 amino acid ORF and a human-specific 107 amino acid ORF. The 68 aa ORF is predicted to contain an alpha transmembrane domain, indicating its function as a transmembrane protein, and is involved in both protein function and gene regulation due to its overlap with a transcriptional silencer (Delihas2024Evolution). The 107 aa ORF, although not translated in somatic tissues, is hypothesized to play a role in embryonic development, with its evolutionary development marked by biased random mutations (Delihas2024Evolution). Further research is required to elucidate the complete functional and structural characteristics of the SMIM45 protein.

## Structure
The SMIM45 gene encodes a protein with two open reading frames (ORFs), a 68 amino acid (aa) ORF and a 107 aa ORF. The 68 aa ORF is highly conserved across species and is predicted to contain an alpha transmembrane domain, suggesting its role as an integral membrane protein (Delihas2024Evolution). This ORF is rich in guanine and overlaps with a transcriptional silencer, indicating a dual role in protein function and gene regulation (Delihas2024Evolution). The 107 aa ORF is human-specific and has not been translated into a protein product in somatic tissues, but it is predicted to have a function in embryonic tissues (Delihas2024Evolution). The evolutionary development of the 107 aa ORF involves biased random mutations, with significant changes occurring at the NH2 and COOH terminal ends and in the middle of the sequence (Delihas2024Evolution). The SMIM45 protein's molecular structure, particularly the 68 aa ORF, includes a predicted alpha transmembrane domain, but further characterization is needed to fully understand its tertiary and quaternary structures (Delihas2024Evolution).
