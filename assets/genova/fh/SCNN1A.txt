# SCNN1A

## Overview
The SCNN1A gene encodes the alpha subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), a critical transmembrane protein involved in sodium ion transport across epithelial cells. This channel is essential for maintaining sodium balance, fluid homeostasis, and blood pressure regulation in the body. The alpha subunit, along with beta and gamma subunits, forms a heterotrimeric channel that is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues such as the kidney, lung, and colon (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial; LemmensGruber2023The). The SCNN1A gene plays a pivotal role in the proteolytic activation of ENaC, which is regulated by hormones like aldosterone and post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation (LemmensGruber2023The; Hanukoglu2023Epithelial). Mutations in SCNN1A are linked to pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1, a disorder characterized by impaired sodium regulation, highlighting its clinical significance (Welzel2013Five; Huneif2022A).

## Structure
The SCNN1A gene encodes the alpha subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is a crucial component of sodium ion transport across epithelial cells. The protein is composed of 669 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 75,704 Da (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial). The primary structure includes conserved sequences essential for channel function, particularly in the transmembrane segments and the extracellular loop (Kellenberger2002Epithelial).

The secondary structure of the alpha subunit features two transmembrane domains, M1 and M2, which are connected by a large extracellular loop. This loop is unique to the ENaC/DEG family and contains cysteine-rich domains that form disulfide bonds, maintaining the protein's tertiary structure (LemmensGruber2023The; Kellenberger2002Epithelial). The NH2 and COOH termini are cytoplasmic (Canessa1994Membrane).

In terms of quaternary structure, the alpha subunit assembles with beta and gamma subunits to form a functional heteromultimeric channel. The stoichiometry is suggested to be 2:1:1, with the alpha subunit being more abundant in active channels (Kellenberger2002Epithelial). Glycosylation at asparagine residues is a common post-translational modification, crucial for proper folding and function (LemmensGruber2023The). Alternative splicing of SCNN1A contributes to phenotypic complexity (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial).

## Function
The SCNN1A gene encodes the alpha subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is essential for sodium ion transport across epithelial cells. ENaC is a heterotrimeric channel composed of α, β, and γ subunits, with the α subunit being crucial for the channel's proper assembly and function (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial; LemmensGruber2023The). This channel plays a vital role in maintaining sodium balance, fluid homeostasis, and blood pressure regulation in the body by facilitating sodium reabsorption in epithelial tissues such as the kidney, lung, and colon (Hanukoglu2016Epithelial; LemmensGruber2023The).

In healthy human cells, ENaC activity is regulated by various factors, including hormones like aldosterone, which increase its activity to promote sodium reabsorption (LemmensGruber2023The). The α subunit is involved in the proteolytic activation process necessary for ENaC function, with specific serine protease cleavage sites that, when cleaved, activate the channel (LemmensGruber2023The; Hanukoglu2023Epithelial). This regulation is crucial for maintaining electrolyte balance and normal blood pressure (LemmensGruber2023The). The channel's function is also modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which impact sodium absorption and channel regulation (LemmensGruber2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCNN1A gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), are associated with pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1), a rare genetic disorder characterized by aldosterone resistance. This condition leads to defective sodium regulation, resulting in symptoms such as dehydration, severe salt wasting, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis (Welzel2013Five; Huneif2022A). PHA1 can manifest in two forms: renal and systemic. The systemic form, which is autosomal-recessive, typically presents in the neonatal period with severe symptoms and is diagnosed by elevated plasma aldosterone levels and renin activity (Huneif2022A).

Specific mutations in SCNN1A, such as frameshift and splice site mutations, lead to truncated proteins that disrupt ENaC function, causing systemic PHA1 (Welzel2013Five; Wang2013Novel). These mutations result in a loss-of-function phenotype, leading to life-threatening salt loss and electrolyte imbalances (Welzel2013Five). The condition requires lifelong management to maintain sodium and potassium levels within normal ranges (Welzel2013Five).

Research has also explored potential therapeutic approaches, such as using solnatide to restore ENaC function in frameshift mutants associated with PHA1B (Willam2017TNF).

## Interactions
SCNN1A encodes the alpha subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is essential for sodium balance and fluid homeostasis. This protein forms a functional channel by interacting with the beta and gamma subunits of ENaC. These interactions are crucial for the channel's activity in epithelial tissues, where it regulates sodium reabsorption.

SCNN1A is also known to interact with regulatory proteins that modulate its activity. One significant interaction is with NEDD4L, a ubiquitin-protein ligase that regulates ENaC activity through ubiquitination. This interaction suggests that NEDD4L can modify the genetic effects of SCNN1A, potentially impacting conditions such as hypertension and kidney disease (Sun2010Identification).

The study by Sun and Kardia highlights the potential of combining protein-protein interaction (PPI) and copy number variation (CNV) data to identify genetic mechanisms underlying human diseases. It suggests that SCNN1A's interactions, particularly with NEDD4L, may have epistatic associations with hypertension, indicating a complex regulatory network that influences its function (Sun2010Identification). These interactions underscore the importance of SCNN1A in maintaining electrolyte balance and its role in disease pathogenesis.
