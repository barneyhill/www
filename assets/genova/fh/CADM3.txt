# CADM3

## Overview
The CADM3 gene encodes the cell adhesion molecule 3 (Necl-1), a transmembrane protein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in the nervous system, particularly in mediating axon-glia interactions essential for the structural organization of myelinated fibers in the peripheral nervous system (Chen2016Cadm3; Rebelo2021A). CADM3 is characterized by its three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate cell-cell adhesion through homophilic and heterophilic interactions, notably with CADM4 in Schwann cells (Hunter2011Localization; Rebelo2021A). Functionally, CADM3 is involved in cell signaling pathways, acting as a negative regulator of myelination by inhibiting the neuregulin-mediated activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (Chen2016Cadm3). Mutations in CADM3 have been linked to diseases such as breast cancer and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, underscoring its clinical significance in both oncological and neurological contexts (Ren2024Clinical; Rebelo2021A).

## Structure
The CADM3 protein, also known as Necl-1, is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is characterized by its structure, which includes three extracellular immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic region (Hunter2011Localization; Rebelo2021A). These Ig-like domains are crucial for cell-cell adhesion through homophilic and heterophilic interactions, particularly between CADM3 in axons and CADM4 in Schwann cells (Rebelo2021A). 

The primary structure of CADM3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific cysteine residues at positions 84-144, 186-243, and 288-333 forming disulphide bonds, which are conserved across the CADM family (Rebelo2021A). The secondary structure likely involves the folding of these Ig domains into beta-sheets and alpha-helices, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Rebelo2021A). 

The tertiary structure of CADM3 includes the overall 3D conformation of the protein, integrating the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions (Rebelo2021A). The quaternary structure involves interactions with CADM4 and potentially other proteins at the axon-glia interface, which are essential for proper axonal organization and myelination (Sukhanov2021Differential). CADM3 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may affect its molecular weight and function (Hunter2011Localization).

## Function
The CADM3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the cell adhesion molecule family, playing a critical role in the nervous system. In healthy human cells, CADM3 is primarily involved in mediating axon-glia interactions, which are essential for the structural organization of myelinated fibers in the peripheral nervous system. This protein is expressed on axons and interacts with CADM4, a protein expressed by myelinating Schwann cells, facilitating proper cell-cell adhesion and communication (Chen2016Cadm3; Rebelo2021A).

CADM3 is involved in cell signaling by inhibiting the neuregulin-mediated activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is crucial for Schwann cell proliferation and myelination (Chen2016Cadm3; Rebelo2021A). This regulatory function suggests that CADM3 may act as a negative regulator of myelination, as its absence in axons leads to increased myelinated segments formed by Schwann cells (Chen2016Cadm3).

The protein's extracellular domain contains immunoglobulin-like loops, which are important for maintaining its structure and function, allowing it to participate effectively in cell adhesion processes (Rebelo2021A). CADM3's correct folding and localization are critical for its function in maintaining proper cell-cell adhesion and signaling (Rebelo2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CADM3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, notably breast cancer and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. In breast cancer, CADM3 expression is significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. Higher levels of CADM3 are associated with a better prognosis, including longer overall survival, disease-free survival, and metastasis-free survival. CADM3 acts as an independent prognostic factor and is linked to reduced cell proliferation and migration, potentially through its involvement in the MAPK pathway and immune cell infiltration (Ren2024Clinical).

In Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a specific variant of CADM3, Tyr172Cys, has been identified in patients with marked upper limb involvement. This mutation disrupts normal axon-glia interactions, leading to abnormal axonal organization. The variant is associated with severe neuropathy, muscle weakness, and sensory deficits, particularly affecting the upper limbs. Functional studies suggest that the mutant CADM3 protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to reduced cell surface expression and interaction with CADM4, which is crucial for maintaining axonal architecture (Rebelo2021A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CADM3 in both oncological and neurological contexts.

## Interactions
CADM3, also known as Necl-1, is a cell adhesion molecule that participates in various protein interactions crucial for neuronal communication and axon-glia interactions. It primarily interacts with CADM4, a protein expressed by myelinating Schwann cells, facilitating the structural organization of myelinated fibers in the peripheral nervous system (Sukhanov2021Differential; Rebelo2021A). CADM3 forms both homophilic and heterophilic interactions, including cis dimers on the cell membrane, and its extracellular domain binds to CADM2 and CADM4, supporting axon-glia communication (Sukhanov2021Differential).

The Tyr172Cys mutation in CADM3 affects its disulfide bond conformation, potentially altering its interaction with CADM4. Despite this mutation, CADM3 can still bind to CADM4, although with reduced co-localization at cellular contact sites, which may compromise axon-glia interactions (Rebelo2021A). CADM3 also interacts with the PI3 kinase/Akt signaling pathway, inhibiting Schwann cell myelination by interfering with the activation of ErbB3, a receptor involved in this pathway (Chen2016Cadm3). Additionally, CADM3 interacts with multi-PDZ domain protein 1 (MUPP1), which may mediate interactions between CADM3 and cytoskeletal proteins (Jang2014CadmsSynCAMsNeclsTSLCs).
