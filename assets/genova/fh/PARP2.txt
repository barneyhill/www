# PARP2

## Overview
PARP2, or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 2, is a gene that encodes a nuclear enzyme involved in critical cellular processes, particularly DNA repair and genomic stability. The protein product of PARP2 is a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family, which is characterized by its role in catalyzing the addition of ADP-ribose polymers to target proteins, a post-translational modification essential for DNA repair mechanisms. Unlike its closely related counterpart PARP1, PARP2 lacks zinc finger domains and instead utilizes a WGR domain for DNA binding and damage detection, which is crucial for its function in the base excision repair (BER) pathway and other DNA repair processes (Obaji2018Structural; Schreiber2002Poly(ADPribose)). PARP2's activity is vital for maintaining genomic integrity, influencing gene expression, and modulating cellular responses to stress, making it a significant focus of research in cancer biology and other disease contexts (Szántó2012Poly(ADPribose); Szántó2024Specific page 9 of 10).

## Structure
PARP2, also known as ARTD2, is a protein involved in DNA repair processes, characterized by its distinct structural domains. The protein lacks the zinc finger domains found in PARP1, instead relying on a WGR domain for DNA binding and damage detection (Obaji2018Structural). The WGR domain is crucial for recognizing DNA breaks and is involved in specific interactions with DNA, including the 3' and 5' ends of DNA breaks (Obaji2018Structural). Key residues such as Y201, R153, and K130 are essential for stable DNA interaction and enzymatic activation (Obaji2018Structural).

The catalytic domain of PARP2 is responsible for ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification critical for its function in DNA repair (Oliver2004Crystal). The catalytic fragment of PARP2 consists of an alpha-helical N-terminal domain and a mixed alpha/beta C-terminal domain, with a catalytic glutamate residue (Glu534) playing a key role in its enzymatic activity (Oliver2004Crystal). The structure of PARP2 is similar to that of PARP1, with some differences in domain organization and specific structural features that may influence substrate specificity (Oliver2004Crystal).

## Function
PARP2 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 2) is a nuclear enzyme that plays a critical role in DNA repair and genomic stability. It is primarily involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, where it interacts with proteins such as XRCC1, DNA polymerase beta, and DNA ligase III to facilitate the repair of single-strand DNA breaks (Schreiber2002Poly(ADPribose) page 4 of 5; Kutuzov2013Interaction page 3 of 4). PARP2 also participates in double-strand break repair, particularly during the replicative phases of the cell cycle, in conjunction with H2AX, highlighting its unique role in maintaining genomic integrity during cell replication (Ghosh2016Common).

PARP2 is activated by DNA strand breaks and catalyzes the addition of ADP-ribose polymers to nuclear proteins, a process known as poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, which is crucial for DNA repair and chromatin remodeling (Kutuzov2013Interaction). It also interacts with telomeric proteins, such as TRF2, to maintain telomere integrity, although it does not significantly affect telomere length or telomerase activity (Dantzer2004Functional).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, PARP2 influences gene expression by modifying chromatin structure and interacting with transcription factors, affecting processes like inflammation and metabolism (Szántó2012Poly(ADPribose) page 3 of 5). Its activity is essential for preventing genomic alterations, cell death, and tumorigenesis (Szántó2012Poly(ADPribose) page 1 of 5).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the PARP2 gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, PARP2 deficiency has been linked to delayed tumor onset and reduced metastasis in mouse models, suggesting its role in modulating tumor progression and immune response (Szántó2024Specific). Genetic variations in PARP2, such as the SNP rs878156, have been associated with differential survival outcomes in breast cancer patients, indicating that PARP2 can influence chemotherapy effectiveness (Seibold2015A).

In prostate cancer, PARP2 inhibition has been shown to reduce the growth of androgen receptor-positive cells, with overexpression correlating with increased tumor aggressiveness (Szántó2024Specific). In hematological malignancies, PARP2 deficiency has a dual role, delaying B cell lymphoma progression while accelerating T cell lymphoma progression, highlighting its complex involvement in cancer biology (Szántó2024Specific).

PARP2 also plays a role in oxidative stress-related pathologies. Its interaction with NRF2, a key transcription factor in antioxidant defense, is crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance. Disruption of this interaction can lead to increased oxidative stress, contributing to diseases such as inflammation and cardiovascular disorders (Jankó2023PARP2). These findings underscore the potential of PARP2 as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker in various diseases.

## Interactions
PARP2 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 2) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in DNA repair and RNA metabolism. It interacts with proteins such as KU70, KU80, and Replication Factor A protein 1, which are crucial for DNA double-strand break repair via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (Isabelle2010Investigation). PARP2 also associates with components of the FMRP complex, involved in mRNA translation regulation, and participates in RNA splicing by interacting with proteins like DEAD box polypeptide 48 and ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX5 (Isabelle2010Investigation).

In the context of telomere maintenance, PARP2 binds with high affinity to telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2), influencing its DNA binding activity through poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (Dantzer2004Functional). This interaction is crucial for maintaining telomere integrity, as PARP2-deficient cells exhibit increased chromosomal breaks (Dantzer2004Functional).

PARP2 also interacts with DNA structures that mimic repair intermediates, showing a preference for flap-containing DNA and 5'-overhang DNA, which are important for its activation in poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis (Kutuzov2013Interaction). These interactions highlight PARP2's role in regulating base excision repair proteins and modulating the activity of other DNA repair proteins like DNA polymerase β and FEN1 (Kutuzov2013Interaction).
