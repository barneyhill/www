# THUMPD2

## Overview
THUMPD2 is a gene that encodes the THUMP domain containing 2 protein, a methyltransferase involved in RNA processing. The protein is characterized by its THUMP domain, which is a predicted RNA binding domain, and a Rossman-Fold methyltransferase domain, which together facilitate its role in catalyzing N2-methylation on U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) within the spliceosome (Yang2023THUMPD2; Hori2023Transfer). This methylation is crucial for the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, impacting the efficiency and fidelity of this process in human cells (Yang2023THUMPD2). THUMPD2 forms a complex with the protein TRMT112, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Yang2023THUMPD2). The gene's expression and function are significant across various biological contexts, and alterations in THUMPD2 have been linked to clinical conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and drug resistance in certain cancers (Hayashi2019THUMP; GuindoMartínez2020The).

## Structure
The THUMPD2 protein is characterized by its molecular structure, which includes a classical Rossman-Fold methyltransferase domain linked to a THUMP-containing domain. This structure is crucial for its function in catalyzing N2-methylation on the spliceosome catalytic center of U6 snRNA (Yang2023THUMPD2). The THUMP domain is a predicted RNA binding domain, commonly found in various tRNA modification enzymes, and is involved in capturing the 3'-end of RNA (Hori2023Transfer). 

THUMPD2 forms a stable binary complex with TRMT112, a conserved protein that regulates other methyltransferases. This interaction is essential for the protein's enzymatic activity, specifically in catalyzing m2G methylation on U6 snRNA at the G72 site, which is critical for pre-mRNA splicing (Yang2023THUMPD2). The structural model of the human THUMPD2-TRMT112 complex reveals that TRMT112 has a small single domain, contributing to the quaternary structure of the complex (Yang2023THUMPD2).

The THUMPD2 protein's role in RNA modification and splicing regulation is underscored by its interaction with specific sequence and structural elements of U6 snRNA, highlighting the importance of its molecular structure in its biological function (Yang2023THUMPD2).

## Function
THUMPD2 is a methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing by catalyzing N2-methylation at the G72 position on U6 snRNA, a component of the spliceosome's catalytic center. This modification is essential for the proper functioning of the spliceosome, enhancing the efficiency and fidelity of pre-mRNA splicing in human cells (Yang2023THUMPD2). THUMPD2 operates predominantly in the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the protein TRMT112, which is necessary for its methyltransferase activity (Yang2023THUMPD2).

The absence of THUMPD2 leads to significant changes in alternative splicing events, affecting numerous genes involved in various biological processes such as cell cycle regulation, cell signaling pathways, and neuronal development. This disruption results in decreased cell proliferation and altered cell cycle distribution (Yang2023THUMPD2). THUMPD2 also influences the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, which degrades transcripts with premature termination codons, further highlighting its role in maintaining normal gene expression and RNA processing (Yang2023THUMPD2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the THUMPD2 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. A rare indel variant, rs557998486, located near the THUMPD2 gene, is strongly associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This variant has a minor allele frequency of 0.009 and an odds ratio of 10.5, indicating a significant risk factor for AMD. It is also associated with eye surgery and elevated C-reactive protein levels, a biomarker for macular degeneration, under a recessive model in the UK Biobank (GuindoMartínez2020The). 

In the context of cancer, THUMPD2 has been identified as a potential player in drug resistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Studies have shown that downregulation of THUMPD2 is associated with increased resistance to chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. This suggests that THUMPD2 may contribute to multidrug resistance in ESCC, impacting treatment outcomes (Hayashi2019THUMP).

Research also indicates that THUMPD2 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing regulation. Knockout of THUMPD2 leads to significant changes in alternative splicing events, affecting genes involved in cell cycle regulation and neuronal development. These alterations can result in decreased cell proliferation and activation of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, which may have implications for various diseases (Yang2023THUMPD2).

## Interactions
THUMPD2 interacts with the auxiliary protein TRMT112 to form a stable binary complex, which is essential for its methylation activity. This interaction enables THUMPD2 to catalyze the N2-methylation of G72 on U6 snRNA, a modification crucial for the formation of the RNA splicing catalytic center. The interaction between THUMPD2 and TRMT112 was confirmed through immunoprecipitation assays and gel filtration analysis, demonstrating that THUMPD2 alone does not exhibit detectable methyltransferase activity without TRMT112 (Yang2023THUMPD2).

The THUMPD2-TRMT112 complex specifically recognizes the 65 'GCGCA' 68 motif of the U6 ISL-apical loop, which is essential for substrate recognition. This specificity is vital for the methylation of G72, which enhances pre-mRNA splicing activity in human cells. The loss of this modification due to THUMPD2 knockout results in decreased splicing activity and triggers the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, affecting cell proliferation (Yang2023THUMPD2).

THUMPD2 is widely expressed in various human cell lines and mouse tissues, indicating its importance across different biological contexts. Its interaction with TRMT112 highlights its role in RNA processing and modification functions (Yang2023THUMPD2).
