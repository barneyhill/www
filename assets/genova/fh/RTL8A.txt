# RTL8A

## Overview
RTL8A is a human gene that encodes the retrotransposon Gag-like 8A protein, which is involved in the regulation of retrotransposon activity within the genome. Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that can influence genomic stability and gene expression. The RTL8A protein, categorized as a retrotransposon Gag-like protein, plays a crucial role in modulating these elements, particularly through its interaction with the PEG10 protein, a retroelement-derived gene. This interaction is significant for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is implicated in various neurodevelopmental processes. The protein is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain, where it is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of neurons, suggesting its involvement in nuclear protein quality control and neurodevelopmental regulation (Campodonico2023The; Fujioka2023Targeting).

## Function
The RTL8A gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes related to retrotransposon activity. Retrotransposons are genetic elements that can replicate and insert themselves into new locations within the genome, similar to retroviruses. The RTL8A protein is involved in regulating these elements, which can impact genomic stability and gene expression (Fujioka2023Targeting).

In healthy human cells, RTL8A is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, where it is believed to have a regulatory role. The protein is typically active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of neurons, suggesting its involvement in nuclear protein quality control, which is crucial for maintaining normal neuronal function (Fujioka2023Targeting). This regulation is important for neurodevelopmental processes and may influence behaviors related to social interaction and emotional responses (Fujioka2023Targeting).

RTL8A also interacts with the PEG10 protein, a retroelement-derived gene that forms virus-like particles (VLPs). RTL8A antagonizes PEG10 by inhibiting the formation or release of these VLPs, potentially by incorporating into the particles and decreasing their abundance. This interaction suggests a role for RTL8A in modulating retroelement activity and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Campodonico2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RTL8A gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders. In particular, RTL8A, along with its homologs RTL8B and RTL8C, is associated with Angelman Syndrome (AS) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In AS, RTL8A-C proteins accumulate in neurons, suggesting they are targets of the UBE3A gene, mutations of which cause AS (KanekoIshino2023RetrovirusDerived). Conversely, in ALS, RTL8A levels decrease, while PEG10 levels increase, indicating a potential protective role of RTL8A against proteasome-dependent degradation (Fujioka2024Targeting).

RTL8A is also linked to Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), as phenotypes observed in RTL8A/8B double knockout mice, such as reduced social interaction and late-onset obesity, resemble symptoms seen in PWS patients (Fujioka2023Targeting). The reduction in GABRB2 expression associated with RTL8A/8B knockout may contribute to these neuropsychiatric defects, as GABRB2 downregulation is linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders (Fujioka2024Targeting).

The interaction between RTL8A and PEG10 also suggests a role in controlling PEG10-mediated virus-like particles, which may be relevant in neurological diseases where PEG10 levels are dysregulated (Campodonico2023The). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of RTL8A in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions.

## Interactions
RTL8A, a human gene encoding a retrotransposon Gag-like protein, is known to interact specifically with the PEG10 protein. This interaction occurs through the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the PEG10 capsid, which is both necessary and sufficient for binding with RTL8A. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed this specific interaction, as RTL8A co-immunoprecipitates with PEG10 but not with control proteins (Campodonico2023The). The interaction is further supported by Alphafold multimer modeling, which predicts close contact between RTL8A and the NTD of PEG10, involving specific alpha-helices in both proteins (Campodonico2023The).

RTL8A is incorporated into PEG10-derived virus-like particles (VLPs), where it acts as an inhibitor, decreasing the release efficiency of these particles. This suggests that RTL8A may modulate the function or assembly of PEG10 VLPs, potentially by mimicking PEG10's N-terminus and incorporating into the growing capsid, thereby restricting VLP abundance (Campodonico2023The). The interaction between RTL8A and PEG10 is significant in understanding the regulation of PEG10 VLP production and may have implications for PEG10's biological roles and potential therapeutic applications (Campodonico2023The).
