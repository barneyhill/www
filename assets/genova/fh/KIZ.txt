# KIZ

## Overview
The KIZ gene encodes the kizuna centrosomal protein, a crucial component involved in maintaining spindle pole integrity during mitosis and regulating inflammatory responses. As a substrate for the kinase Plk1, the protein is essential for preventing fragmentation of the pericentriolar material, thereby ensuring proper chromosome segregation and genomic stability (Thomas2014Kizuna; Fry2006Sealed). Additionally, kizuna centrosomal protein acts as a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway, modulating immune responses by interacting with TRAF2 and TRAF6 (Sun2022KIZGM114). Beyond its roles in cell division and immune regulation, the protein is significant in retinal physiology, particularly in rod photoreceptors, with mutations in KIZ linked to autosomal-recessive rod-cone dystrophy (El2014WholeExome). These multifaceted functions underscore the gene's importance in cellular homeostasis and human health.

## Function
The KIZ gene encodes the kizuna centrosomal protein, which plays a critical role in maintaining spindle pole integrity during mitosis. KIZ is a substrate for the kinase Plk1, and its phosphorylation at Thr-379 is essential for preventing fragmentation of the pericentriolar material (PCM) and ensuring organized spindle formation. This process is crucial for proper chromosome segregation and genomic stability, preventing conditions such as aneuploidy (Thomas2014Kizuna; Fry2006Sealed).

KIZ is also involved in regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, acting as a negative regulator. It interacts with TRAF2 and TRAF6, key adaptor proteins in the NF-κB pathway, to modulate inflammatory responses. By antagonizing the association of these TRAF proteins with their upstream adaptors, KIZ reduces NF-κB activation, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammatory responses (Sun2022KIZGM114).

In addition to its role in cell division and immune regulation, KIZ is implicated in retinal physiology. It is expressed in the retina and is associated with ciliary function, particularly in rod photoreceptors. Mutations in KIZ have been linked to autosomal-recessive rod-cone dystrophy, highlighting its importance in retinal health (El2014WholeExome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KIZ gene are associated with several inherited retinal diseases, particularly autosomal recessive rod-cone dystrophy (RCD), also known as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). This condition is characterized by progressive vision loss due to the degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors. Specific mutations, such as c.226C>T (p.Arg76*), have been identified in various populations, including Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jewish individuals, suggesting a potential founder effect (El2014WholeExome; El2017Further). These mutations lead to a truncated, non-functional protein, resulting in symptoms like night blindness and peripheral visual field changes (Lin2020Progressive; Zhao2019Retinal).

The KIZ gene mutations can also affect exon splicing, introducing premature termination codons and causing frameshift mutations, which contribute to the disease phenotype (Sundaresan2024Genetic). The clinical presentation of KIZ-related retinal dystrophies varies, with some patients experiencing mild retinal abnormalities and others facing early-onset severe RP (Sundaresan2024Genetic). The gene's expression is particularly significant in the retina, and its mutations are linked to a pattern of rod dysfunction exceeding cone dysfunction, as observed in electroretinography tests (El2014WholeExome; Sundaresan2024Genetic).

## Interactions
KIZ (kizuna centrosomal protein) is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. It interacts with TRAF6 and TRAF2, key components in the NF-κB signaling pathway. KIZ acts as a negative modulator by binding to the TRAF domains of these proteins, thereby antagonizing their association with upstream adaptors such as IRAK1 and TRADD. This interaction reduces NF-κB activation induced by IL-1β, LPS, and TNFα, helping to maintain inflammatory homeostasis (Sun2022KIZGM114).

In the context of mitosis, KIZ interacts with CDC25B phosphatase. This interaction is particularly significant during mitosis, where KIZ is phosphorylated by CDK1/Cyclin B and Plk1, and CDC25B regulates this phosphorylation. The balance between Plk1 kinase and CDC25B phosphatase activities is crucial for the stabilization of the pericentriolar material (PCM) and proper spindle formation. KIZ phosphorylation at Thr379 by Plk1 is essential for maintaining spindle pole integrity, and untimed dephosphorylation by CDC25B can lead to PCM fragmentation and mitotic defects (Fry2006Sealed; Thomas2014Kizuna).

These interactions highlight KIZ's role in both inflammatory signaling and mitotic progression, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and division.
