# MRPS28

## Overview
MRPS28 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S28, a vital component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production (Gopisetty2016Mammalian; Mekala2021MiR). As a structural protein, MRPS28 is integral to the assembly and stability of the mitochondrial ribosome, contributing to cellular energy metabolism and overall mitochondrial function (VilaSanjurjo2023Structural). The protein's interactions with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and its involvement in pathways beyond traditional mitochondrial translation underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Revathi2021Expression). Mutations in MRPS28 have been associated with mitochondrial diseases, highlighting its critical role in mitochondrial integrity and function (Pulman2018Mutations).

## Function
MRPS28 encodes a protein that is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This protein is involved in the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a critical process for ATP production in cells (Gopisetty2016Mammalian; Mekala2021MiR). MRPS28 is active within the mitochondria, contributing to cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular function (Mekala2021MiR).

The protein encoded by MRPS28, also known as bS1m, is essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, particularly under conditions of metabolic stress. It is involved in mitochondrial translation, biogenesis, and respiration, confirming its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function (Mekala2021MiR). MRPS28 interacts with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, such as MRPS2 and MRPS21, to form a stable association with the ribosome, facilitating the translation process (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).

MRPS28's role in mitochondrial function is underscored by its involvement in the assembly and structural integrity of the mitochondrial ribosome, which is crucial for the proper synthesis of proteins necessary for cellular energy production (VilaSanjurjo2023Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MRPS28 gene have been linked to mitochondrial diseases characterized by impaired mitoribosomal biogenesis and function. A notable case involves a patient with intrauterine growth retardation, craniofacial dysmorphism, and multisystemic involvement, including sensorineural deafness and severe psychomotor developmental delay. This patient was found to have a homozygous missense variant in MRPS28, specifically c.356A>G, p.(Lys119Arg), which destabilizes the bS1m protein, impairing mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit assembly and mitochondrial translation (Pulman2018Mutations).

The mutations in MRPS28 lead to decreased abundance of 12S rRNA and impaired assembly of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit, resulting in inhibited mitochondrial translation and affecting the biogenesis of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, IV, and V. This results in a dramatic deficiency in complex IV and decreased mitochondrial respiration rates (Pulman2018Mutations). Expression of wild-type MRPS28 in patient fibroblasts has been shown to restore mitochondrial translation and OXPHOS biogenesis, confirming the pathogenic nature of the MRPS28 mutations (Pulman2018Mutations). These findings highlight the critical role of MRPS28 in maintaining mitochondrial function and its association with mitochondrial dysfunction when mutated.

## Interactions
MRPS28, a component of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit, engages in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in mitochondrial translation. It has been shown to interact with the tumor suppressor protein p53, suggesting a potential role in p53-related cellular pathways, which may include cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Revathi2021Expression). This interaction was confirmed through GST pull-down assays, indicating that MRPS28, along with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins such as MRPS5, MRPS18B, MRPS22, MRPS27, and MRPS38, may participate in pathways beyond traditional mitochondrial translation roles (Revathi2021Expression).

In addition to its interaction with p53, MRPS28 is involved in the assembly of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (mtSSU). It interacts extensively with other mitoribosomal proteins, such as uS2m and bS21m, forming part of the mRNA exit channel on the mtSSU. Although MRPS28 lacks identifiable mRNA binding domains, it contributes positively charged residues that may facilitate mRNA interactions (Pulman2018Mutations). These interactions are essential for the proper assembly and function of the mitoribosome, highlighting MRPS28's critical role in mitochondrial protein synthesis and cellular energy production (Pulman2018Mutations).
