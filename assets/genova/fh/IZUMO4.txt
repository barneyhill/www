# IZUMO4

## Overview
IZUMO4 is a gene that encodes the protein IZUMO family member 4, which is part of the IZUMO family of proteins known for their roles in reproductive processes. Unlike other members of the IZUMO family, IZUMO4 is unique in that it lacks a transmembrane domain, suggesting it is a secreted protein rather than a membrane-bound one (Ellerman2009Izumo; Vance2022SPACA6). The protein is characterized by a conserved N-terminal 'Izumo domain' and is predicted to form a four-helix bundle (4HB) domain, although it does not possess the immunoglobulin-like domain found in IZUMO1 (Vance2022SPACA6a; Vance2022SPACA6). IZUMO4 is expressed in various tissues, including the testis, and is hypothesized to have functions beyond sperm-egg fusion, potentially playing roles in spermatogenesis or earlier stages of fertilization (Ellerman2009Izumo). Further research is required to fully understand the specific functions and interactions of IZUMO4 within reproductive biology.

## Structure
IZUMO4 is a member of the IZUMO family of proteins, which are involved in reproductive processes. Unlike other IZUMO proteins, IZUMO4 lacks a transmembrane domain and is predicted to be a secreted protein (Ellerman2009Izumo; Vance2022SPACA6). The protein is characterized by a conserved N-terminal domain known as the 'Izumo domain,' which is involved in forming homo-dimers (Ellerman2009Izumo). IZUMO4 is predicted to fold into a four-helix bundle (4HB) domain, similar to other IZUMO family members, although it lacks the immunoglobulin-like domain present in IZUMO1 (Vance2022SPACA6a; Vance2022SPACA6).

The protein contains a pattern of eight conserved cysteines, which are likely involved in forming disulfide bonds, contributing to its structural stability (Ellerman2009Izumo). IZUMO4 is also predicted to be N-glycosylated, although specific post-translational modifications or splice variants have not been detailed (Ellerman2009Izumo). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the testis, and is thought to have functions outside of sperm-egg fusion, potentially in spermatogenesis or earlier fertilization steps (Ellerman2009Izumo).

## Function


## Interactions
IZUMO4, a member of the IZUMO protein family, is distinct from other family members due to its lack of a transmembrane domain and its expression in a variety of tissues beyond the testis. This suggests that IZUMO4 may not play a central role in sperm-egg fusion, unlike IZUMO1, which is essential for this process (Ellerman2009Izumo). IZUMO4 has been detected in monomeric forms and as part of a complex with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 90 kDa, although the specific nature and functional significance of these complexes remain unclear (Ellerman2009Izumo).

The protein is predicted to have a 4HB domain similar to other IZUMO family members, but it lacks the Ig-like domain found in IZUMO1. Despite these structural similarities, the functions of IZUMO4 in gamete fusion are not well established, and specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed (Vance2022SPACA6a). The absence of a transmembrane domain and its presence in somatic tissues suggest that IZUMO4 may have roles outside of sperm-egg fusion, potentially in spermatogenesis or earlier fertilization steps (Ellerman2009Izumo). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise interactions and functions of IZUMO4.
