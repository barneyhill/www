# OFD1

## Overview
The OFD1 gene encodes the OFD1 centriole and centriolar satellite protein, which is integral to the organization and function of cellular structures such as centrosomes and cilia. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains and a LisH motif, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and oligomerization, crucial for its role in cellular processes (Ferrante2003Characterization; Giorgio2007Functional). OFD1 is involved in the regulation of centriole length and structure, playing a pivotal role in cell cycle progression and ciliogenesis by stabilizing centriolar microtubules (Singla2010Ofd1). Mutations in the OFD1 gene are linked to several ciliopathies, most notably oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1, which is characterized by craniofacial and limb anomalies (Ferrante2001Identification; Macca2009The). The protein's interactions with various cellular components, including those involved in chromatin remodeling and translation regulation, underscore its multifaceted role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Giorgio2007Functional; Iaconis2017The).

## Structure
The OFD1 protein is characterized by its structural features, including coiled-coil (CC) domains and a LisH motif. The human OFD1 protein consists of 1011 amino acids and contains five predicted CC domains that span nearly the entire length of the molecule, facilitating protein-protein interactions and oligomerization (Ferrante2003Characterization; Giorgio2007Functional). The LisH motif, located in the N-terminal region, is involved in self-association and potentially in binding to microtubules and other proteins (Ferrante2003Characterization).

The OFD1 protein can self-associate through its CC-rich region, particularly involving the fourth CC domain, which is crucial for homotypic interactions (Giorgio2007Functional). The protein also interacts with other proteins, such as RuvBl1, through its CC domains, indicating its role in forming multiprotein complexes (Giorgio2007Functional).

OFD1 has multiple splice variants, including a full-length form and an alternative splice variant lacking exon 10, which results in a protein missing 40 amino acids (Coene2009OFD1). These variants contribute to the functional diversity of the protein. The OFD1 protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions (Chevrier2015OFIPKIAA0753).

## Function
The OFD1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the organization of microtubules and the progression of the cell cycle. In healthy human cells, OFD1 is localized to centrosomes, mitotic spindle poles, and basal bodies of primary cilia, indicating its involvement in microtubule organization and cell cycle regulation (Alfieri2020The). The protein is essential for maintaining proper centrosome function, as it ensures the correct length and structure of centrioles, which are critical for cell division and ciliogenesis (Singla2010Ofd1).

OFD1 interacts with components of the translation machinery, modulating the translation of specific mRNA targets, particularly in the kidney. It cooperates with the mRNA binding protein Bicc1 to control protein synthesis at the centrosome, suggesting a specialized role for the centrosome in translation regulation (Iaconis2017The). The OFD1 protein is also involved in the regulation of centriole length and structure, binding to the distal ends of centriolar microtubules to stabilize them at the proper length during their maturation phase (Singla2010Ofd1).

Mutations in the OFD1 gene can lead to defects in centriole length and disrupt normal ciliogenesis, highlighting its role in maintaining centriole structure and function in healthy human cells (Singla2010Ofd1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OFD1 gene are primarily associated with oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1 (OFD1), an X-linked dominant disorder characterized by malformations of the face, oral cavity, and digits. This condition is male-lethal in utero and exhibits a high degree of phenotypic variability in females, potentially due to X inactivation (Ferrante2001Identification; Macca2009The). Common clinical features include facial asymmetry, cleft palate, oral frenula, and digital anomalies such as syndactyly and brachydactyly. Central nervous system abnormalities and polycystic kidney disease are also frequently observed (Ferrante2001Identification; Gurrieri2007Oral–facial–digital).

The OFD1 gene is also implicated in other ciliopathies, such as Joubert syndrome, which is characterized by mid-hindbrain malformations and developmental delays. Mutations in OFD1 can disrupt ciliary protein interactions, affecting ciliary localization and function (Coene2009OFD1). The gene's mutations are often frameshift, nonsense, or splice-site mutations, leading to a loss-of-function mechanism (Prattichizzo2008Mutational). The phenotypic variability in OFD1-related disorders is influenced by the degree of somatic mosaicism and the specific mutations present, with certain mutations linked to specific clinical features such as renal cystic disease (Prattichizzo2008Mutational; Papuc2023Autistic).

## Interactions
The OFD1 protein is involved in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in cellular processes. OFD1 interacts with RuvBl1, a member of the AAA+ family of ATPases, which is part of the TIP60 chromatin-remodeling complex. This interaction suggests a role for OFD1 in chromatin remodeling (Giorgio2007Functional). OFD1 also interacts with lebercilin, a protein encoded by the LCA5 gene, through its coiled-coil domains, which is crucial for ciliary function (Coene2009OFD1).

OFD1 forms a complex with OFIP and FOR20 at pericentriolar satellites and centrosomes, which is essential for protein stability and localization. This complex is disrupted in certain mutations associated with oral-facial-digital syndrome (Chevrier2015OFIPKIAA0753). Additionally, OFD1 interacts with components of the TRAPPIII complex, specifically TRAPPC8 and TRAPPC12, which are involved in ciliogenesis (Zhang2020Distinct).

OFD1 is also linked to the translation machinery, interacting with components such as eIF3B, eIF3G, eIF4E, and eIF4G. These interactions suggest that OFD1 may regulate the formation of the pre-initiation complex and modulate translation (Iaconis2017The).
