# CCNG2

## Overview
Cyclin G2 (CCNG2) is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin G2, an atypical member of the cyclin family known for its role as a cell cycle inhibitor rather than a promoter. Unlike traditional cyclins that facilitate cell cycle progression, cyclin G2 is involved in halting the cell cycle, particularly in response to DNA damage and growth-inhibitory signals. It achieves this by interacting with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) at the centrosomes, thereby influencing microtubule stability and enforcing a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest (MartínezGac2004Control; Arachchige2006Cyclin). Cyclin G2 is primarily localized at the mother centriole of the centrosome, where it contributes to microtubule bundling and resistance to depolymerization, playing a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and cellular quiescence (Arachchige2006Cyclin). The expression of CCNG2 is regulated by the PI3K pathway, which modulates its levels through the inhibition of FoxO transcription factors, highlighting its importance in cellular responses to stress and its potential implications in cancer and other diseases (MartínezGac2004Control).

## Function
Cyclin G2 (CCNG2) is an unconventional cyclin that functions primarily as a cell cycle inhibitor in healthy human cells. Unlike classical cyclins that promote cell cycle progression, cyclin G2 is involved in cell cycle arrest, particularly in response to DNA damage and growth inhibitory signals (MartínezGac2004Control; Arachchige2006Cyclin). It associates with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) at the centrosomes, influencing microtubule stability and inducing a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest (Arachchige2006Cyclin).

Cyclin G2 is primarily located at the mother centriole of the centrosome, where it plays a role in microtubule bundling and resistance to depolymerization, contributing to the regulation of centrosomal functions and cytokinesis (Arachchige2006Cyclin). It is involved in the DNA damage response, where it is required for a potent G2/M checkpoint arrest, particularly in response to genotoxic stress (Zimmermann2012Elevated). Cyclin G2's expression is regulated by the PI3K pathway, which modulates its levels through the inhibition of FoxO transcription factors (MartínezGac2004Control).

Overall, cyclin G2 acts as a negative regulator of cell proliferation, maintaining cellular quiescence and contributing to genomic stability by enforcing cell cycle checkpoints and modulating microtubule dynamics.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCNG2 gene have been implicated in various cancers and other conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), microRNA-1246 negatively regulates CCNG2 expression, leading to increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This downregulation of CCNG2 is associated with the malignant progression of CRC, suggesting that the miR-1246/CCNG2 axis could be a potential target for treatment (WANG2015MicroRNA1246).

In prostate cancer, CCNG2 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression linked to cellular senescence and tumor suppression. Low levels of CCNG2 are associated with reduced survival rates, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Heidari2024The).

CCNG2 also plays a significant role in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), where its low expression correlates with advanced clinical stages and poor prognosis. Overexpression of CCNG2 inhibits OSCC growth and metastasis by interacting with IGFBP3 and regulating the FAK-SRC-STAT signaling pathway (Wang2020Cyclin).

In preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related condition, CCNG2 is upregulated and associated with impaired trophoblast cell function, affecting placental development. This upregulation is linked to the suppression of the Wnt/PCP-JNK signaling pathway, contributing to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (Sun2020Cyclin).

## Interactions
Cyclin G2 (CCNG2) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function and stability. It is physically associated with ubiquitin, Skp1, and Skp2 proteins, which are part of the SCF E3 ligase complex. This complex plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of cyclin G2, with Skp2 acting as a significant regulator by targeting cyclin G2 for degradation (Xu2008Cyclin). Cyclin G2 also interacts with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is involved in regulating microtubule stability and cell cycle arrest (Xu2008Cyclin).

In the context of Wnt signaling, cyclin G2 interacts with Dapper1 (Dpr1), a Dvl binding antagonist protein. This interaction reduces the phosphorylation of Dpr1, thereby inhibiting Wnt signaling and modulating tubulointerstitial fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy (Zhao2020Cyclin). Cyclin G2 also influences the stability of Dvl2 by promoting its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, with RNF123 identified as a mediator in this process (Sun2020Cyclin). These interactions highlight cyclin G2's role in regulating cell proliferation and signaling pathways.
