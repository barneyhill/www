# HAS1

## Overview
The HAS1 gene encodes the enzyme hyaluronan synthase 1, which is a member of the hyaluronan synthase family responsible for the synthesis of hyaluronan, a critical component of the extracellular matrix. Hyaluronan synthase 1 is categorized as a synthase enzyme and is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and Golgi apparatus, with some presence on the plasma membrane (Siiskonen2015Hyaluronan). Although it is less active than its isoenzymes HAS2 and HAS3, HAS1 plays a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in response to injury and inflammation, by contributing to the formation of a hyaluronan coat on the cell surface (Rilla2013Hyaluronan; Siiskonen2014Hyaluronan). The enzyme's activity is modulated by interactions with other proteins, such as the CD44 receptor, which facilitates the organization of hyaluronan into a matrix that is crucial for recruiting leukocytes during inflammatory responses (Siiskonen2015Hyaluronan). The gene's expression and the resulting enzyme activity have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, underscoring its clinical significance (Siiskonen2015Hyaluronan; Nguyen2017Human).

## Function
Hyaluronan synthase 1 (HAS1) is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of hyaluronan, a key component of the extracellular matrix. In healthy human cells, HAS1 is less active compared to its isoenzymes HAS2 and HAS3, requiring higher concentrations of substrates, particularly UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), for its activity (Rilla2013Hyaluronan; Siiskonen2014Hyaluronan). Despite its lower activity, HAS1 plays a crucial role in forming a cell surface hyaluronan coat, which is important for cellular responses to injury and inflammation (Siiskonen2014Hyaluronan).

HAS1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and Golgi apparatus, with a small portion found on the plasma membrane, where it synthesizes hyaluronan (Siiskonen2015Hyaluronan). The enzyme's activity is influenced by interactions with the CD44 receptor, which helps organize hyaluronan into a matrix that can recruit leukocytes during inflammation (Siiskonen2015Hyaluronan). Although HAS1 is not essential for embryogenesis, it contributes to maintaining tissue homeostasis and is upregulated in response to inflammatory conditions (Siiskonen2015Hyaluronan). The hyaluronan produced by HAS1 has a broad size distribution, which is important for its biological functions, such as cell growth and tissue architecture (Itano1999Three).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HAS1 gene are associated with various cancers and inflammatory conditions. In cancer, HAS1 overexpression is linked to malignant transformation through mechanisms such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), micronucleation, and centrosome abnormalities. These changes contribute to genomic instability and intratumor heterogeneity, promoting cancer initiation and progression. HAS1 is implicated in several cancers, including breast cancer, multiple myeloma, colon cancer, and bladder cancer, where its overexpression correlates with poor prognosis, shorter overall survival, and higher relapse rates (Siiskonen2015Hyaluronan; Nguyen2017Human).

In multiple myeloma and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, HAS1 and its splice variants are overexpressed in malignant cells, contributing to disease progression and drug resistance. The presence of HAS1 variants is associated with shorter survival in multiple myeloma patients (Adamia2005Hyaluronan). HAS1 expression is also upregulated in inflammatory conditions like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, often in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TGF-β, which activate transcription factors like NF-κB (Siiskonen2015Hyaluronan). These findings highlight the clinical significance of HAS1 in both cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
HAS1 (hyaluronan synthase 1) is involved in several interactions with other proteins that are crucial for its function and role in cellular processes. HAS1-synthesized cytoplasmic hyaluronic acid (HA) interacts with the hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (RHAMM), which is important for mitotic spindle formation and stability. This interaction is significant during the mitosis and G1/S phases of the cell cycle, suggesting that cytoplasmic HA may interfere with spindle formation (Nguyen2017Human). RHAMM also interacts with BRCA1, a gene associated with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility, which is involved in spindle formation. The association of BRCA1 with RHAMM isoforms indicates a direct interaction, as BRCA1 lacks an HA-binding domain (Nguyen2017Human).

HAS1 overexpression leads to increased cytoplasmic HA, which is linked to cancer phenotypes such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), micronucleation, and centrosome abnormalities. These interactions are not observed with HAS2 or HAS3 overexpression, highlighting a unique role for HAS1 (Nguyen2017Human). Additionally, HAS1 interacts with the CD44 receptor, which retains the hyaluronan coat on the cell surface, as demonstrated by the reduction of the coat when treated with hyaluronan hexasaccharide or anti-CD44 antibody (Siiskonen2014Hyaluronan).
