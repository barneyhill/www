# TENT4B

## Overview
TENT4B, also known as terminal nucleotidyltransferase 4B, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA. The protein, categorized as a terminal nucleotidyltransferase, plays a pivotal role in RNA stability and degradation by participating in RNA surveillance and decay processes. It is a component of the TRAMP-like complex, which is crucial for recruiting the nuclear exosome to facilitate RNA processing and turnover. TENT4B is particularly noted for its involvement in mixed tailing, a process that incorporates guanosine residues into poly(A) tails, thereby enhancing mRNA stability and protecting it from rapid degradation. This function is significant in various cellular processes, including the regulation of mRNA related to carbohydrate metabolism and tumor suppression. Additionally, TENT4B's interactions with other proteins and its role in viral RNA stabilization underscore its importance in both cellular and viral RNA metabolism (Warkocki2018Terminal; Lim2018Mixed; Liudkovska2020Functions).

## Function
TENT4B, also known as PAPD5, is a terminal nucleotidyltransferase involved in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA, playing a crucial role in RNA stability and degradation in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus and nucleolus, where it forms part of a TRAMP-like complex with ZCCHC7 and SKIV2L2, contributing to RNA surveillance and decay by recruiting the nuclear exosome (Warkocki2018Terminal; Liudkovska2020Functions). TENT4B is involved in mixed tailing, incorporating guanosine residues into poly(A) tails, which protects mRNA from rapid deadenylation by the CCR4-NOT complex, thereby enhancing mRNA stability (Warkocki2018Terminal; Lim2018Mixed).

TENT4B also plays a role in the adenylation of aberrant precursor rRNA fragments, leading to their degradation, and in the maturation of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) by adding oligo(A) tails (Warkocki2018Terminal; Liudkovska2020Functions). It influences the stability of specific mRNAs, such as TP53, and is involved in the regulation of mRNAs related to carbohydrate metabolism, impacting their stability and translation (Warkocki2018Terminal). Through these activities, TENT4B contributes to RNA metabolism, quality control, and potentially tumor suppression (Liudkovska2020Functions).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TENT4B gene, also known as terminal nucleotidyltransferase 4B, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mutations in the SF3B1 gene, which affect alternative splicing events, have been shown to impact the expression of TENT4B. This dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of CLL by affecting the expression of genes related to the non-canonical BAF chromatin remodeling complex (Hägerstrand2024The).

TENT4B is also involved in the stabilization of viral RNA, playing a role in the replication and stability of hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA. The interaction between TENT4B and the host factor ZCCHC14 is crucial for HBV mRNA stabilization, and inhibitors targeting TENT4B, such as RG7834, have been shown to destabilize HBV RNA, suggesting potential therapeutic applications in HBV infections (Hyrina2019A).

Additionally, TENT4B's role in mRNA stability through mixed tailing processes has been linked to its involvement in viral infections, where it is hijacked by viruses like hepatitis A and B to stabilize their RNA, highlighting its significance in viral pathogenesis (Wen2023The).

## Interactions
TENT4B, also known as terminal nucleotidyltransferase 4B, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and stability. It is a component of the human TRAMP complex, which includes ZCCHC7 (hAIR2) and SKIV2L2 (hMTR4), and is involved in the turnover of pre-rRNA fragments in HeLa cells (Warkocki2018Terminal). TENT4B interacts with ZCCHC14 to stabilize viral RNA, such as that from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), through mixed tailing of their poly(A) tails (Liudkovska2020Functions). 

TENT4B also forms a complex with ZCCHC14 and TENT4A, which is crucial for the replication of hepatitis A virus (HAV) RNA, enhancing its replication by forming a protein bridge that circularizes the RNA (Wen2023The). In the context of HBV, TENT4B, along with ZCCHC14, is involved in the regulation of RNA tail length, affecting RNA accumulation and stability (Hyrina2019A). 

Additionally, TENT4B interacts with PARN and CPEB, which are crucial for its role in RNA stability and degradation (Liudkovska2020Functions). These interactions highlight TENT4B's involvement in complex regulatory networks that influence RNA metabolism.
