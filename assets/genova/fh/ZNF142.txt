# ZNF142

## Overview
ZNF142 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 142, a transcription factor characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains are crucial for the protein's ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression, influencing various cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Antonescu2023AMPActivated; Khan2019Recessive). The ZNF142 protein is predominantly active in the nucleus but has also been observed at the cell surface, suggesting potential roles in protein-protein interactions (Antonescu2023AMPActivated). Mutations in the ZNF142 gene are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and childhood apraxia of speech, highlighting its significance in brain development and function (Khan2019Recessive; Hildebrand2020Severe).

## Function
ZNF142 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor, characterized by its C2 zinc finger domains, which are typically involved in DNA binding. These domains suggest that ZNF142 plays a role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Xu2017Genomic; Antonescu2023AMPActivated). 

In healthy human cells, ZNF142 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it modulates the transcriptional landscape of the cell. However, studies have also identified ZNF142 at the cell surface under basal conditions, indicating that it may have additional roles outside the nucleus, potentially involving protein-protein interactions mediated by its zinc finger domains (Antonescu2023AMPActivated). 

ZNF142's involvement in apoptosis is highlighted in the context of prostate epithelial cell apoptosis following castration, where its expression is linked to macrophage polarization and oxidative stress, suggesting a role in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway (Barbosa2019Castration‐induced). Despite these insights, the precise molecular functions and mechanisms of ZNF142 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF142 gene are associated with a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, speech impairment, seizures, and dystonia. This disorder is linked to recessive variants in ZNF142, including nonsense and frameshift mutations that lead to nonsense-mediated decay, as well as ultrarare missense variants in conserved regions (Khan2019Recessive). The gene is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum, and its mutations have been identified in several families with affected individuals displaying a range of symptoms, including developmental delays and movement disorders (Khan2019Recessive).

ZNF142 has also been implicated in childhood apraxia of speech (CAS), a severe speech disorder. Compound heterozygous mutations in ZNF142 have been identified in patients with CAS, suggesting a role in transcriptional dysregulation related to speech development (Hildebrand2020Severe). The gene's involvement in CAS highlights its broader impact on neurodevelopmental disorders, with mutations potentially affecting transcriptional regulation in the developing brain (Morgan2024Genetic).
