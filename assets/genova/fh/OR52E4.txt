# OR52E4

## Overview
OR52E4 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily E member 4, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as a transmembrane receptor involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a critical role in the sensory perception of smell. The OR52E4 gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where its protein product binds specific odorants, initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to olfactory perception. As part of a network cluster enriched in the plasma membrane and sensory perception of smell, OR52E4 is integral to olfactory transduction processes, underscoring its importance in the olfactory system (YUAN2015A).

## Function
OR52E4 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the sensory perception of smell. This gene is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that result in olfactory perception (YUAN2015A). The protein encoded by OR52E4 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (YUAN2015A).

In healthy human cells, OR52E4 is part of a network cluster significantly enriched in the plasma membrane and sensory perception of smell, indicating its involvement in olfactory transduction processes (YUAN2015A). The olfactory transduction subpathway is the most significantly enriched KEGG subpathway for this cluster, supporting the role of OR52E4 in olfactory functions (YUAN2015A). Although specific details on the function of OR52E4 in healthy human cells are not provided, its inclusion in a cluster enriched for olfactory receptor activity suggests a primary role in sensory perception related to smell (YUAN2015A).
