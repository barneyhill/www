# MTA3

## Overview
MTA3 (metastasis associated 1 family member 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation as part of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. The MTA3 protein plays a significant role in cellular differentiation and development by influencing gene expression through chromatin structure modification (Kumar2016Structure). It is expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, although it lacks a predicted nuclear localization signal, which suggests that its functions may vary depending on its subcellular localization (You2021Inhibition). MTA3 is particularly important in maintaining the undifferentiated state of human embryonic stem cells and in regulating trophoblast differentiation (You2021Inhibition; Horii2015MTA3). Additionally, MTA3 has been implicated in various cancers, acting as a tumor suppressor in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and playing a role in breast cancer progression and B cell lymphomas (Jaye2007The; Du2019MTA3; Fujita2003MTA3).

## Function
MTA3 (metastasis associated 1 family member 3) is a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, which plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. In healthy human cells, MTA3 is involved in regulating gene expression by modifying chromatin structure, thereby influencing cellular differentiation and development (Kumar2016Structure). MTA3 is expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm, although it lacks a predicted nuclear localization signal, suggesting its functions may vary based on its subcellular localization (You2021Inhibition).

MTA3 is implicated in maintaining the undifferentiated state of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) by preventing their spontaneous differentiation into specific lineages. Knockdown of MTA3 in hESCs leads to a decrease in pluripotency markers and an increase in differentiation markers, indicating its role in balancing self-renewal and differentiation (You2021Inhibition). In the context of trophoblast differentiation, MTA3 is expressed in cytotrophoblast cells and is associated with maintaining their undifferentiated state. Its expression decreases as these cells differentiate, suggesting a role in regulating trophoblast differentiation (Horii2015MTA3). MTA3's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in cell cycle regulation and developmental pathways.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MTA3 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), MTA3 acts as a tumor suppressor by repressing cancer stemness and metastasis through the SOX2OT/SOX2 axis. Low levels of MTA3 correlate with increased expression of SOX2OT and SOX2, leading to enhanced cancer stemness and poorer patient prognosis. This suggests that MTA3, along with SOX2 and SOX2OT, could serve as diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets in ESCC (Du2019MTA3).

In breast cancer, MTA3 is involved in an estrogen-dependent pathway that regulates growth and differentiation. Its expression is linked to the repression of the transcriptional repressor Snail, which is crucial for maintaining epithelial architecture. Dysregulation of MTA3 can lead to invasive growth and progression of breast cancer, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive cell lines (Fujita2003MTA3).

In B cell lymphomas, MTA3 is associated with a proliferative phenotype and is selectively expressed in germinal center B cells and certain lymphomas. Its expression is linked to the repression of BCL6 target genes, which may contribute to the growth capacity and clinical aggressiveness of these lymphomas (Jaye2007The).

## Interactions
MTA3 is a component of the Mi-2/nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, where it interacts with several key proteins. It has been shown to physically interact with CHD4 and HDAC1, which are major subunits of the NuRD complex, indicating its role as a component of this complex in vivo (Kwintkiewicz2012MetastasisAssociated). MTA3 also interacts with RAD21, a core cohesin complex protein, suggesting a potential role in cohesin loading onto chromosomes (Kwintkiewicz2012MetastasisAssociated).

In breast epithelial cells, MTA3 is part of an estrogen-dependent pathway and is associated with the Mi-2/NuRD complex, which includes proteins such as Mi-2, MBD3, and HDAC1 (Fujita2003MTA3). MTA3 also interacts with the transcriptional repressor Snail, repressing its expression and thereby promoting the expression of E-cadherin, which maintains a differentiated epithelial phenotype (Zhang2010The).

MTA3 has been identified as a histone H3 binding protein within the NURD complex, showing a strong association with the H3 tail peptide, similar to other MTA family proteins (Wu2013The). This interaction is resistant to washing with SDS after UV treatment, indicating a robust binding (Wu2013The).
