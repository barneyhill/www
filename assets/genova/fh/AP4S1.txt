# AP4S1

## Overview
The AP4S1 gene encodes the sigma 1 subunit of the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4), which is a critical component in the cellular machinery responsible for intracellular protein trafficking. The AP-4 complex, which includes other subunits such as AP4B1, AP4E1, and AP4M1, plays a pivotal role in the sorting and transport of membrane proteins from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper neuronal function (Behne2020Adaptor; Hardies2014Recessive). The protein encoded by AP4S1 is integral to the stability and assembly of the AP-4 complex, and its loss of function can lead to significant disruptions in neuronal processes, including the trafficking of autophagy-related proteins like ATG9A (D’Amore2020Loss). Mutations in AP4S1 are linked to AP-4 deficiency syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by neurological symptoms such as spastic paraplegia and intellectual disabilities (Vill2017A; Hardies2014Recessive).

## Function
The AP4S1 gene encodes the sigma subunit of the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4), which is crucial for intracellular protein trafficking. In healthy human cells, the AP-4 complex is involved in the sorting and transport of membrane proteins from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper neuronal function (Behne2020Adaptor; Hardies2014Recessive). The AP-4 complex operates independently of clathrin and is responsible for the specific expression and localization of receptors such as the δ2 glutamate receptor and the AMPA receptor to the dendritic domain, which is vital for synaptic transmission (Hardies2014Recessive).

The AP4S1 subunit is integral to the stability and assembly of the AP-4 complex. Loss of function in AP4S1 leads to destabilization of the entire complex, affecting the recruitment of accessory proteins necessary for proper neuronal function (D’Amore2020Loss; Hardies2014Recessive). The AP-4 complex also plays a role in the trafficking of the autophagy protein ATG9A, which is crucial for autophagic vesicle formation and axonal function (Behne2020Adaptor). This highlights the importance of AP4S1 in maintaining normal cellular and neuronal processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AP4S1 gene are associated with AP-4 deficiency syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a combination of neurological symptoms. This syndrome is marked by mild fever-sensitive seizures, developmental delay, and spastic paraplegia. Patients often exhibit severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, and facial dysmorphy. Brain MRI findings typically show white matter loss, dilated ventricles, or thinning of the corpus callosum (Vill2017A; Hardies2014Recessive).

The condition is caused by recessive loss-of-function mutations in the AP4S1 gene, which lead to a destabilization of the AP-4 complex, affecting its assembly and function. This disruption in the AP-4 complex is linked to defects in endosomal trafficking, which may contribute to the neurological symptoms observed in patients (Hardies2014Recessive).

Clinical manifestations of AP-4 deficiency syndrome include progressive spastic paraplegia, intellectual disabilities, and joint hypermobility. Seizures are common, with onset typically in the first year of life, and are often mild and fever-sensitive (McCullough2019Utilizing; Hardies2014Recessive). The syndrome is also associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia type 52 (SPG52), which shares similar clinical features (D’Amore2020Loss).

## Interactions
AP4S1 is a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4), which is involved in vesicular trafficking within the endocytic pathway. It interacts with other subunits of the AP-4 complex, including AP4B1, AP4E1, and AP4M1, to form a heterotetrameric complex essential for the proper sorting and trafficking of cargo proteins (Davies2017AP4; Hardies2014Recessive). The loss of AP4S1 destabilizes the entire AP-4 complex, leading to a reduction in the levels of all other AP-4 subunits and impairing the assembly of the complex (Hardies2014Recessive).

The AP-4 complex is involved in the spatial control of autophagy, particularly in the peripheral delivery of ATG9A, a protein crucial for autophagy. AP4S1, as part of the AP-4 complex, is implicated in the trafficking of ATG9A, and its deficiency results in the mislocalization of ATG9A, which accumulates at the trans-Golgi network (Davies2017AP4; Behne2020Adaptor). The AP-4 complex also interacts with accessory proteins such as tepsin, which binds to the appendage domain of the β4 subunit, and this interaction is disrupted in the absence of AP4S1 (Hardies2014Recessive).
