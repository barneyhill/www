# CARNS1

## Overview
The CARNS1 gene encodes the enzyme carnosine synthase 1, which is a member of the ATP-grasp family of enzymes. This enzyme is pivotal in the biosynthesis of carnosine, a dipeptide composed of β-alanine and L-histidine, and is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the brain and skeletal muscle (Caruso2019Pivotal). Carnosine synthase 1 plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including acting as a proton buffer in the central nervous system and contributing to intracellular buffering capacity in skeletal muscle (Caruso2019Pivotal; WangEckhardt2020Carnosine). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against oxidative stress, with significant implications for conditions such as multiple sclerosis and cardiac dysfunction (Caruso2022Unveiling; Spaas2023Carnosine).

## Function
The CARNS1 gene encodes the enzyme carnosine synthase 1, which is responsible for the synthesis of carnosine, a histidine-containing dipeptide, in various tissues including the brain and skeletal muscle. Carnosine is synthesized from its precursors β-alanine and L-histidine, and this process is dependent on the activity of CARNS1, which belongs to the ATP-grasp family of enzymes (Caruso2019Pivotal). In the central nervous system, CARNS1 is particularly expressed in oligodendrocytes, where it plays a role in myelination and axonal support, potentially acting as a proton buffer to support lactate export from oligodendrocytes to axons (Caruso2019Pivotal).

In skeletal muscle, carnosine contributes to intracellular buffering capacity and may facilitate calcium supply, improving excitation-contraction coupling (WangEckhardt2020Carnosine). The enzyme's activity is influenced by the availability of its substrates, β-alanine and GABA, which affects the levels of carnosine and homocarnosine (Van2023Extensive). Carnosine also acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative stress and contributing to cellular homeostasis (Caruso2022Unveiling). The enzyme's preference for β-alanine over GABA as a substrate may influence the distribution of carnosine and homocarnosine in different tissues (Van2023Extensive).

## Clinical Significance
The CARNS1 gene, encoding carnosine synthase 1, has significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of multiple sclerosis (MS) and cardiac function. In MS, a reduction in CARNS1 expression is observed in demyelinated lesions, which is associated with increased neuroinflammation and exacerbated clinical symptoms. This reduction is linked to the loss of oligodendrocytes, crucial for myelin production in the central nervous system (CNS). The deficiency in CARNS1 leads to impaired quenching of acrolein, a toxic and pro-inflammatory compound, suggesting a protective role of CARNS1 against neuroinflammation (Spaas2023Carnosine).

In cardiac function, CARNS1 deficiency results in significant cardiac dysfunction, including impaired systolic and diastolic function. Knockout rat models lacking CARNS1 exhibit abnormalities in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, likely due to impaired calcium handling. These findings indicate that CARNS1 is crucial for normal cardiac function, and its absence can lead to significant cardiac issues (Gonçalves2021Histidine).

Overall, alterations in CARNS1 expression or function can have profound effects on both neuroinflammatory and cardiac conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in these areas.
