# SLC39A2

## Overview
SLC39A2 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 39 member 2 (ZIP2), which is a crucial component of the zinc transporter family. ZIP2 is a transmembrane protein involved in the transport of zinc and other divalent metal ions across cell membranes, playing a significant role in maintaining zinc homeostasis within human cells (Gyimesi2019Unraveling; Franz2014Development). The protein is characterized by eight transmembrane domains and a highly conserved histidine-rich loop, which is essential for zinc binding and transport (Becares2021Overproduction; Franz2014Development). ZIP2 is predominantly located on the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the uptake of zinc from the extracellular environment into the cytoplasm, thereby influencing various cellular functions such as DNA synthesis, metabolism, and intracellular signaling (Franz2014Development). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are implicated in several physiological processes and pathological conditions, including prostate cancer, cystic fibrosis, and immune responses, underscoring its importance in cellular and organismal physiology (Kamei2018Zinc; Tao2013Upregulation; Franz2014Development).

## Structure
The SLC39A2 protein, also known as ZIP2, is a member of the solute carrier family 39, which is involved in the transport of zinc and other divalent metal ions across cell membranes. The protein is predicted to consist of eight transmembrane domains (TMDs), with both the N- and C-termini facing the noncytosolic space (Becares2021Overproduction). A highly conserved histidine-rich loop is located between TMDs IV and V, which is thought to be involved in zinc binding prior to transport (Franz2014Development).

The tertiary structure of SLC39A2 is modeled based on the structure of a prokaryotic homolog, bbZIP, from Bordetella bronchiseptica, which suggests a central helical core formed by TMs 2, 4, 5, and 7, with a binuclear metal binding center (Gyimesi2019Unraveling; Becares2021Overproduction). The remaining TMs (1, 3, 6, and 8) are more peripheral (Becares2021Overproduction). The protein is suggested to have a dimeric arrangement, with specific residues potentially forming a dimer interface (Gyimesi2019Unraveling).

Key residues such as E179, H175, H202, and E276 are directly involved in coordinating the substrate metal ion, contributing to the protein's function in metal ion transport (Gyimesi2019Unraveling). The presence of a positive charge near the second metal ion binding site, particularly K203, is crucial for transport (Gyimesi2019Unraveling). The protein's activity is modulated by pH and voltage, with specific residues affecting pH sensitivity and substrate selectivity (Gyimesi2019Unraveling).

## Function
The SLC39A2 gene encodes the hZIP2 protein, a zinc transporter that plays a crucial role in maintaining zinc homeostasis in human cells. hZIP2 is primarily located on the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the uptake of zinc from the extracellular environment into the cytoplasm, thereby increasing cytoplasmic zinc levels (Gyimesi2019Unraveling; Franz2014Development). Zinc is essential for various cellular functions, including DNA and protein synthesis, metabolism, and intracellular signaling (Franz2014Development).

In healthy prostate epithelial cells, hZIP2 is highly expressed and is involved in zinc reabsorption from prostatic fluid. This process is important for promoting citrate accumulation and secretion into prostatic fluid, as well as for mitochondrial apoptogenesis (Franz2014Development). The protein's activity is pH-dependent, with increased transport rates observed at lower pH levels, which suggests a role in adapting to varying physiological conditions (Franz2014Development).

hZIP2 is also implicated in the differentiation of keratinocytes in the skin, where its expression is upregulated during this process. Knockdown of hZIP2 inhibits keratinocyte differentiation, affecting the formation of a three-dimensional cultured epidermis (Gyimesi2019Unraveling). These functions highlight the importance of SLC39A2 in zinc transport and its broader implications in cellular and organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC39A2 gene, which encodes the zinc transporter ZIP2, have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In cystic fibrosis (CF), a splice variant of SLC39A2 known as ΔC-ZIP2 is associated with zinc deficiency and increased MUC5AC hypersecretion in airway epithelial cells. This variant lacks zinc-importing activity and does not localize to the plasma membrane, contributing to the pathogenesis of CF by modulating βENaC expression and exacerbating mucus overproduction (Kamei2018Zinc).

In pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), SLC39A2 expression is significantly upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting a role in the immune response. This upregulation is linked to changes in immune markers, potentially influencing infection control by promoting adaptive T cell responses (Tao2013Upregulation).

In prostate cancer, the expression of SLC39A2 is decreased, correlating with lower zinc levels in cancer cells. This reduction in zinc levels creates conditions that favor cell proliferation, indicating a potential role for SLC39A2 in cancer progression (Franz2014Development).

SLC39A2 also plays a role in ischemia/reperfusion injury in mouse hearts, where its expression affects cardiac tissue recovery, highlighting its involvement in related pathophysiological conditions (Du2019The).

## Interactions
SLC39A2, also known as ZIP2, is involved in zinc transport and interacts with various proteins and ions. It shares physical interactions with other members of the SLC39 family, such as SLC39A1 and SLC39A9, as identified through protein-protein interaction analyses using platforms like STRING and GeneMANIA (Qu2021PanCancer). These interactions suggest a role in zinc ion transport and cellular zinc ion homeostasis.

The protein's function is influenced by specific amino acid residues that are crucial for substrate binding and pH sensitivity. Key residues such as E179, H175, H202, and E276 are directly involved in binding divalent metal ions, while others like H63, E67, and F269 are important for pH sensitivity and transport activity (Gyimesi2019Unraveling). Mutations in these residues can affect the transport process, indicating their role in the protein's interaction with ions and possibly other proteins.

SLC39A2 also plays a role in immune signaling pathways, interacting with transcription factors such as IRF7. Knockdown of SLC39A2 increases IRF7 expression, suggesting a regulatory circuit between these proteins, although IRF7 knockdown does not directly affect hypertrophy-related gene expression (Fang2021Slc39a2Mediated). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving SLC39A2 in cellular processes.
