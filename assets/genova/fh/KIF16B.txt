# KIF16B

## Overview
KIF16B is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 16B, a motor protein involved in intracellular transport processes. This protein is a member of the kinesin superfamily, characterized by its ability to move along microtubules in an ATP-dependent manner. Kinesin family member 16B is particularly notable for its role in the trafficking of early endosomes, which are essential for endocytosis and the recycling of membrane receptors and other cargo. The protein contains a unique PX domain that binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P), facilitating its attachment to endosomal membranes and enabling its transport function. KIF16B's activity is regulated through interactions with small GTPases and its transition from a monomer to a dimer state, which is necessary for effective cargo transport. The gene and its encoded protein are implicated in various cellular functions across different tissues and have been associated with clinical conditions such as intellectual disability and cancer (Blatner2007The; Alsahli2018KIF16B; Li2020PX).

## Structure
KIF16B is a kinesin motor protein characterized by a conserved catalytic core at the N terminus, known as the head region, which is responsible for microtubule binding and ATP-dependent movement (Li2020PX). This head region is followed by a short neck region, forming the motor domain, which is conserved across the kinesin family (Li2020PX). The protein is 1318 amino acids long with a predicted molecular weight of 152 kDa (Li2020PX).

The stalk or tail region of KIF16B is highly divergent and contains three coiled-coil (CC) motifs, which are crucial for dimerization and cargo interaction (Li2020PX). A unique feature of KIF16B is the PX domain located in the tail region, which binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P), allowing it to target early endosomes and drive them toward the plus end of microtubules (Blatner2007The; Li2020PX). The PX domain is approximately 130 amino acids long and consists of three beta-sheets followed by three alpha-helices, forming a helical subdomain with a basic PI-binding pocket (Li2020PX).

The PX domain's structure includes a unique hydrophobic stalk formed by residues L1248 and F1249, which enhances membrane binding and contributes to the slow membrane dissociation kinetics of KIF16B-PX (Blatner2007The). These structural features are crucial for KIF16B's function in endosomal anchoring and intracellular transport (Blatner2007The).

## Function
KIF16B is a kinesin motor protein that plays a crucial role in intracellular transport, particularly in the trafficking of early endosomes along microtubules towards the cell periphery. This process is essential for endocytosis, where membrane receptors, ligands, nutrients, and fluids are internalized into endosomal vesicles and either delivered to different intracellular compartments or recycled back to the plasma membrane (Li2020PX). KIF16B is characterized by a PX domain that binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P) on endosomal membranes, facilitating its attachment and movement along microtubules (Blatner2007The).

The protein's function is regulated by its transition from a monomer to a dimer state, which is triggered by cargo binding. This dimerization is necessary for its processive motion, allowing effective cargo transport (Li2020PX). KIF16B is involved in the recycling of cargo molecules such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), preventing their degradation and facilitating their transport to the plasma membrane (Li2020PX).

KIF16B also interacts with small GTPases like Rab5 and Rab14, which are involved in membrane fusion and organelle movement, further highlighting its role in vesicle trafficking and receptor recycling (Li2020PX). This protein is active in various human tissues, including the brain, heart, liver, and kidney, indicating its broad role in cellular functions across different organs (Hoepfner2005Modulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KIF16B gene have been linked to a novel autosomal-recessive intellectual disability syndrome. This condition was identified in two siblings from a consanguineous Saudi family, who exhibited symptoms such as microcephaly, brain atrophy, thinning of the corpus callosum, and seizures. The specific mutation, c.3611T > G, affects the PX domain of the KIF16B protein, impairing its PIP3 binding and membrane attachment functions, which are crucial for its role in endosome transport and receptor recycling (Alsahli2018KIF16B).

Alterations in KIF16B expression levels have also been associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) survival. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), higher KIF16B expression correlates with better survival, whereas in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), it is linked to worse outcomes. The KIF16B rs1555195T allele, associated with lower mRNA expression, has been suggested to decrease the risk of death in NSCLC patients, indicating a potential protective effect (Yang2019Novel).

KIF16B is also implicated in early embryonic development, where its deficiency can lead to developmental arrest at the blastocyst stage, affecting the differentiation of the inner cell mass and the formation of the epiblast epithelium (Ueno2011KIF16B/Rab14).

## Interactions
KIF16B, a kinesin motor protein, engages in several critical interactions with other proteins that facilitate its role in intracellular transport. It interacts with phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P) on endosomal membranes through its PX domain, which is essential for targeting early endosomes and driving them towards the microtubule plus end (Li2020PX). This interaction is crucial for endosomal trafficking processes such as fusion, sorting, and recycling (Li2020PX).

KIF16B also interacts with small GTPases known as Rabs, which are pivotal in coordinating membrane fusion and organelle movement. Rab5 indirectly interacts with KIF16B through PI(3)P, facilitating cargo movement from early endosomes to the plasma membrane, while Rab14 is involved in transporting FGFR2-containing vesicles, with its interaction regulated by nucleotide status (Li2020PX).

In neurons, KIF16B is involved in the transport of early endosomes in somatodendritic regions, and its activity is regulated by a novel 'stalk inhibition' mechanism. This involves the second and third coiled-coil domains of KIF16B's stalk region binding to the motor domain in an ATP-dependent manner, inhibiting its activity and ensuring proper localization (Farkhondeh2015Characterizing). These interactions are crucial for the correct trafficking and surface expression of receptors like GluR1 and p75 NTR in neurons (Farkhondeh2015Characterizing).
