# NR1D1

## Overview
NR1D1, also known as Rev-erbα, is a gene that encodes the nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1, a transcriptional repressor involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms and metabolic processes. This nuclear receptor plays a pivotal role in linking the circadian clock to various metabolic pathways, including lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. The protein encoded by NR1D1 is characterized by its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences, thereby modulating the transcription of target genes. It functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting co-repressors and influencing histone deacetylation. NR1D1 is also implicated in immune regulation and has been associated with several clinical conditions, including metabolic disorders and cancer, highlighting its significance in maintaining physiological homeostasis (Kim2023NR1D1; Everett2014Nuclear; Yin2007Reverbα).

## Structure
NR1D1, also known as Rev-erbα, is a nuclear receptor with a modular structure typical of nuclear hormone receptors. It comprises several key domains: a variable amino N-terminal activation function 1 (AF-1), a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) with two zinc finger motifs, a hinge region, and a ligand-binding domain (LBD) (Unknownauthors2024TheroleofNr1d1intumor). The DBD is responsible for targeting the receptor to specific DNA sequences, such as the RORE/RevRE and RevDR2, and facilitates dimerization (Unknownauthors2024TheroleofNr1d1intumor). The LBD, which lacks the AF-2 region, promotes ligand-dependent interactions with transcription co-activators or co-inhibitors, allowing the receptor to function as a constitutive transcription inhibitor (Unknownauthors2024TheroleofNr1d1intumor).

NR1D1 can form homodimers or function as a monomer, binding to specific DNA sequences to inhibit transcription (Unknownauthors2024TheroleofNr1d1intumor). The protein's structure is further characterized by its involvement in circadian rhythm regulation, where it acts as a main inhibitor of Bmal1 transcription by competing with RORα for binding to the RORE/RevRE site in the Bmal1 promoter (Unknownauthors2024TheroleofNr1d1intumor). The protein's activity and stability are influenced by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination.

## Function
NR1D1, also known as Rev-erbα, is a nuclear receptor that functions as a transcriptional repressor, playing a crucial role in linking circadian rhythms to metabolic pathways. It is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and the circadian clock. NR1D1 acts by binding to DNA at specific sites known as ROREs and recruiting co-repressors such as Nuclear Corepressor 1 (NCoR) and HDAC3, leading to histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression (Everett2014Nuclear; Yin2007Reverbα).

In metabolic tissues like the liver, NR1D1 regulates gluconeogenesis by repressing the expression of gluconeogenic enzymes such as G6Pase and PEPCK, thereby influencing glucose output and energy metabolism (Yin2007Reverbα). In skeletal muscle, it modulates mitochondrial content and activity, impacting energy expenditure through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway (Everett2014Nuclear).

NR1D1 also plays a role in the immune system by repressing pro-inflammatory signals in macrophages and mediating the circadian gating of the LPS-induced endotoxic response, linking the circadian clock to immune function (Everett2014Nuclear). Its activity is modulated by heme, which stabilizes its interaction with co-repressors, highlighting its role as a heme sensor in oxidative metabolism and circadian rhythmicity (Yin2007Reverbα).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NR1D1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), mutations such as c.1499G > A (p.R500H) in the NR1D1 gene have been identified in patients, potentially contributing to typical ASD features like difficulties in communication and eye contact. These mutations are thought to disrupt protein function, affecting neuronal migration and synaptic network formation during brain development (Goto2017Role).

In lung cancer, NR1D1 acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Deficiency in NR1D1 leads to increased activation of this inflammasome, promoting lung tumor development and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which are processes associated with cancer progression and metastasis (Kim2023NR1D1).

NR1D1 also plays a role in metabolic disorders. Deletion of exons 3 and 4 in the mouse Nr1d1 gene exacerbates high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis, indicating its involvement in lipid metabolism and liver health. This deletion results in increased liver injury markers and worsened hepatic steatosis, suggesting that NR1D1 is crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Na2016Deletion).

## Interactions
NR1D1, also known as Rev-erbα, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its regulatory functions. It interacts with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), inhibiting its catalytic activity and thereby affecting the base excision repair (BER) pathway. This interaction is enhanced under oxidative stress conditions, such as treatment with H2O2, leading to increased oxidative DNA damage (Ka2017NR1D1).

NR1D1 also interacts with apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) to regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis. ApoA-IV binds to NR1D1, reducing the expression of gluconeogenic genes like PEPCK and Glc-6-Pase. This interaction is crucial for the suppression of gluconeogenic gene transcription and is confirmed through various assays, including coimmunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (Li2014Apolipoprotein).

In the context of circadian rhythm regulation, NR1D1 interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the Clock complex. GR suppresses NR1D1 gene expression by forming a complex with Clock proteins, which binds to E-boxes in the NR1D1 promoter region (Murayama2019Glucocorticoid). These interactions highlight NR1D1's role in various physiological processes, including DNA repair, metabolism, and circadian rhythm regulation.
