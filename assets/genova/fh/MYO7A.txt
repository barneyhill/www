# MYO7A

## Overview
The MYO7A gene encodes the unconventional myosin motor protein, myosin VIIA, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in sensory cells of the inner ear and retina. Myosin VIIA is characterized by its complex structure, including a motor domain, a neck region with calmodulin-binding IQ motifs, and a tail region with MyTH4, FERM, and SH3 domains, which facilitate its role in intracellular transport and cellular organization (Wu2011Structure; Sergeev2021Homology). This protein is crucial for the proper functioning of stereocilia in cochlear hair cells, essential for hearing and balance, and for the transport and localization of melanosomes in retinal pigmented epithelial cells, contributing to visual processes (Sato2017Human; Williams2011The). Mutations in the MYO7A gene are linked to several auditory and visual disorders, including Usher syndrome type 1B and non-syndromic hearing loss, highlighting its clinical significance (Jaijo2006Mutation; Watanabe2024The).

## Structure
The MYO7A protein, encoded by the MYO7A gene, is a motor protein with a complex molecular structure. It consists of several distinct domains, including a motor domain, a neck region with five calmodulin-binding IQ motifs, and a tail region containing MyTH4, FERM, and SH3 domains (Wu2011Structure; Sergeev2021Homology). The motor domain is crucial for its function in cellular transport and sensory perception, while the IQ motifs and the single alpha helix (SAH) in the neck region form a lever arm that is modulated by calcium ions and calmodulin binding, affecting the protein's rigidity and function (Li2017Ca).

The MyTH4 and FERM domains in the tail region form a supramodule that interacts with the protein Sans, playing a critical role in the formation of stereocilia, which are essential for hearing (Wu2011Structure). The MyTH4 domain is characterized by a 10-helix bundle architecture, while the FERM domain has a cloverleaf configuration composed of F1, F2, and F3 lobes (Wu2011Structure).

MYO7A is known to form a dimer, which is important for its function as a cargo transporter or mechanical tether (Li2017Ca; Sergeev2021Homology). The protein's structure is further influenced by genetic mutations, which can lead to conditions such as Usher syndrome type 1B, characterized by hearing and vision loss (Sergeev2021Homology).

## Function
MYO7A (myosin VIIA) is an unconventional myosin motor protein that plays a critical role in intracellular transport and cellular organization, particularly in sensory cells of the inner ear and retina. In the retina, MYO7A is involved in the transport and localization of melanosomes within retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells. It facilitates the apical localization of RPE melanosomes and assists in the removal of phagosomes for delivery to lysosomes, contributing to the normal functioning of the visual retinoid cycle (Williams2011The; Gibbs2004Role). MYO7A also acts as a selective barrier in photoreceptor cells, preventing abnormal opsin accumulation (Williams2011The).

In the inner ear, MYO7A is essential for the organization and function of stereocilia in cochlear hair cells, which are crucial for hearing and balance. It tethers USH1 proteins with actin and transports them along actin bundles, maintaining the tension of tip-links in stereocilia (Sato2017Human). MYO7A's motor activity is characterized by slow, processive movement on actin filaments, which is vital for its role in transporting proteins and maintaining cellular structures (Sato2017Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYO7A gene are associated with several auditory and visual conditions. MYO7A mutations are a primary cause of Usher syndrome type 1B (USH1B), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss, retinitis pigmentosa, and vestibular dysfunction (Jaijo2006Mutation; Watanabe2024The). Usher syndrome type 1B accounts for a significant proportion of Usher syndrome cases, with MYO7A mutations responsible for 24% to 59% of these cases (Jaijo2006Mutation). 

MYO7A mutations also lead to non-syndromic hearing loss, including autosomal dominant (DFNA11) and autosomal recessive (DFNB2) forms. DFNA11 is typically associated with delayed-onset, progressive high-frequency hearing loss, while DFNB2 often presents with congenital or early-onset hearing loss (Riazuddin2008Mutation; Watanabe2024The). 

In addition to auditory impairments, MYO7A mutations are linked to retinal dystrophies, such as rod-cone dystrophy, which is characterized by progressive visual impairment and retinal degeneration (Khateb2020PHENOTYPIC). The gene's role in retinal health is underscored by its involvement in photoreceptor function, with mutations leading to structural and functional disruptions in the retina (Jacobson2011Retinal).

## Interactions
MYO7A (myosin VIIA) is involved in several critical protein interactions that are essential for its function in cellular processes. It forms a tripartite complex with harmonin and SANS, which is crucial for linking cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton in structures like stereocilia and microvilli. This complex is important for mechanotransduction, a process vital for hearing and balance (Yu2017Myosin). The MF2 domain of MYO7A is particularly important for its interaction with harmonin, and mutations in this domain can disrupt these interactions, leading to conditions such as Usher syndrome (Yu2017Myosin).

MYO7A also interacts with the binding protein M7BP, which regulates its dimerization and actin bundle assembly. M7BP binds to the C-terminal tail of MYO7A, enhancing its ATPase activity and facilitating its motility along actin filaments (Liu2021A). In the context of stereocilia, MYO7A is part of complexes that include PDZD7, which is enriched in stereocilia membranes and may play a role in protein transport and anchoring (Morgan2016PDZD7-MYO7A). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of MYO7A in cellular dynamics and sensory functions.
