# RBM24

## Overview
RBM24 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 24, a highly conserved RNA-binding protein involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. This protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including alternative splicing, mRNA stability, and cytoplasmic polyadenylation, which are essential for embryonic development and cellular homeostasis (Grifone2020RNABinding). As a key regulator in muscle development, RBM24 influences the splicing of genes critical for sarcomere structure, thereby impacting muscle contraction and cardiac function (Grifone2020RNABinding). The protein's dynamic subcellular localization, transitioning from the cytoplasm in myoblasts to the nucleus in myofibers, underscores its distinct regulatory roles during muscle cell differentiation (Grifone2020RNABinding). Additionally, RBM24's interactions with various mRNA transcripts and its involvement in viral replication highlight its multifaceted role in maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal development (Yao2019RNABinding; Xu2014RNABinding).

## Structure


## Function
RBM24 is a highly conserved RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, particularly during embryonic development and cellular homeostasis. It is involved in various molecular processes, including alternative splicing, mRNA stability, and cytoplasmic polyadenylation, which are essential for proper cell differentiation and tissue formation (Grifone2020RNABinding).

In muscle development, RBM24 functions as a major splicing factor, influencing the splicing of genes related to sarcomere structure, which is critical for muscle contraction and cardiac function (Grifone2020RNABinding). It is also involved in the regulation of protein synthesis in adult tissues, maintaining cellular homeostasis through interactions with microRNAs and other RNA-binding proteins (Grifone2020RNABinding).

RBM24 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, with its subcellular localization changing during muscle cell differentiation. It is cytoplasmic in myoblasts and nuclear in myofibers, indicating distinct regulatory roles at different stages of differentiation (Grifone2020RNABinding). The protein's interaction with the 3' untranslated region of mRNAs, such as p63, highlights its role in mRNA stability and expression regulation (Xu2014RNABinding). These functions underscore RBM24's importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
RBM24 is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in post-transcriptional regulation. In cancer, RBM24 can act as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the context. It is downregulated in colorectal cancer, where it stabilizes PTEN mRNA to inhibit tumor growth, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Shi2022RBM24). Conversely, in bladder cancer, RBM24 is upregulated, promoting cancer progression by stabilizing RUNX1T1 mRNA (Shi2022RBM24). Its expression is also linked to poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer and certain subtypes of gastric cancer (Shi2022RBM24).

RBM24 is crucial for muscle and heart development. Its loss leads to cardiogenic defects, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, due to disrupted muscle-specific splicing (Grifone2020RNABinding; Shi2022RBM24). In skeletal muscle, RBM24 is involved in myogenic differentiation, and its deficiency can impair muscle development (Grifone2020RNABinding).

RBM24 also plays a role in viral replication, acting as a host factor for hepatitis B and C viruses. Both overexpression and knockdown of RBM24 can prevent hepatitis B virus replication, indicating its potential as a target for antiviral strategies (Shi2022RBM24).

## Interactions
RBM24 is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in post-transcriptional regulation. It interacts with the RNA-binding protein Rbm20 to regulate cardiac muscle functionality by binding to the same intronic region to promote splicing of specific splice variants, which are crucial for preventing hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes (Grifone2020RNABinding). RBM24 also interacts with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, specifically associating with the 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR regions of the viral genome, inhibiting the assembly of the 80S ribosome on the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and impairing HCV IRES-mediated translation (Cao2018RNA).

In the context of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication, RBM24 interacts with the reverse transcriptase domain of HBV polymerase, facilitating the interaction between the polymerase and the epsilon element of pregenomic RNA, which is crucial for pgRNA packaging (Yao2019RNABinding). RBM24 also binds to various mRNA transcripts, including those involved in cardiac and muscular functions, as demonstrated by its binding to mRNAs such as Chrm2, Dicer1, and Igf1R in HL-1 and H9C2 cell lines (Lin2018Global). These interactions highlight RBM24's multifaceted role in regulating gene expression and cellular differentiation.
