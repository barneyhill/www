# TRAM1

## Overview
TRAM1, or translocation associated membrane protein 1, is a gene that encodes an integral membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The TRAM1 protein is characterized by its involvement in the translocation of nascent polypeptides across the ER membrane, functioning in conjunction with the Sec61 complex and other associated proteins. It is part of the TRAM/LAG1/CLN8 homology (TLC) domain family, which is known for its potential interactions with lipids such as ceramides and sphingolipids. These interactions are crucial for modulating the phospholipid bilayer, thereby facilitating the lateral exit of signal peptides and transmembrane helices during protein translocation (Klein2020TRAM1). TRAM1's role extends beyond protein translocation, as it is implicated in various cellular processes, including viral infectivity and inflammatory pathways, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in conditions such as intervertebral disc degeneration and infertility (Yammine2021Deciphering; Xiao2020Interaction; Zhang2024Selfpowered).

## Structure
The TRAM1 protein, also known as the translocating chain-associated membrane protein, is an integral membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. It features eight transmembrane domains and is part of a protein family characterized by the TRAM/LAG1/CLN8 homology (TLC) domain, which is postulated to bind ceramide or related sphingolipids (Klein2020TRAM1). The TLC domain is significant for its potential interaction with lipids, which may influence the phospholipid bilayer near the Sec61-channel, facilitating the lateral exit of signal peptides and transmembrane helices (Klein2020TRAM1).

TRAM1 is involved in the transport of polypeptides into the ER and is part of a complex that includes the Sec61 complex, TRAP, and OST. Despite its association with these complexes, TRAM1 is more loosely associated with ribosomes compared to other components (Klein2020TRAM1). The protein does not act as a receptor for signal peptides or transmembrane helices on the ER membrane's cytosolic face and does not affect the open probability of the Sec61 channel (Klein2020TRAM1).

Post-translational modifications of TRAM1 include phosphorylation, which could regulate its role in ER protein import (Klein2020TRAM1). The molecular structure of TRAM1 is not directly detailed in the available context, but its interaction with lipids and its role in modulating the phospholipid bilayer are highlighted (Klein2020TRAM1).

## Function
TRAM1, or translocating chain-associated membrane protein 1, is involved in the transport of nascent polypeptides into or through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in mammalian cells. It is associated with the Sec61-channel, a critical component of the ER membrane that facilitates the transport of polypeptides with amino-terminal signal peptides (SP) or SP-equivalent transmembrane helices (TMH) (Klein2020TRAM1). TRAM1 is proposed to support the transport of a subset of these precursors by modulating the phospholipid bilayer near the lateral gate of the Sec61-channel, which may facilitate the lateral exit of SP and TMH from the channel (Klein2020TRAM1).

TRAM1 does not act as a receptor for SP or TMH on the cytosolic face of the ER membrane and does not affect the open probability of the Sec61-channel. Instead, it may influence bilayer thickness or phospholipid packing, potentially due to its TLC domain's ability to interact with ceramides, sphingolipids, or phospholipids (Klein2020TRAM1). This modulation is particularly important for precursors with short N-regions in their SP, allowing regulated access of precursor polypeptides to the ER (Klein2020TRAM1). TRAM1's activity is crucial for the efficient insertion of these precursor proteins into the lateral gate of the Sec61-channel (Klein2020TRAM1).

## Clinical Significance
TRAM1 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in relation to intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). Alterations in TRAM1 expression or its interaction with TREX1 can lead to the activation of the cGAS-STING inflammatory pathway, contributing to cellular senescence and the progression of IVDD. Overexpression of TRAM1 in senescent nucleus pulposus (NP) cells has been shown to inhibit inflammatory responses and alleviate cell senescence, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for IVDD (Zhang2024Selfpowered).

In the context of infertility, TRAM1 is considered a candidate gene for contributing to spermatogenesis disorders. Its high expression in the testis suggests a role in testicular function, and alterations in its expression or interaction could potentially impact fertility (Yammine2021Deciphering).

TRAM1 has also been studied in relation to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), where a specific element within its 3′ UTR inhibits NMD, potentially affecting mRNA stability. This mechanism may have implications for diseases where NMD plays a role, although specific conditions linked to TRAM1 mutations or expression changes in this context are not detailed (Toma2015Identification).

## Interactions
TRAM1 (translocation associated membrane protein 1) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in the translocation of nascent polypeptides across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. TRAM1 is closely associated with the Sec61 complex, TRAP complex, and oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) in the ER membrane, as demonstrated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments and cryoelectron tomography (CET) reconstructions (Klein2020TRAM1). It does not act as a receptor for signal peptides or transmembrane helices but supports ER protein import by modulating the phospholipid bilayer near the lateral gate of the Sec61-channel (Klein2020TRAM1).

TRAM1 also interacts with the σC protein of the novel duck reovirus (NDRV). This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and GST pull-down assays, indicating that TRAM1 may influence the infectivity of the virus (Xiao2020Interaction). Additionally, TRAM1 is involved in neuropathic pain pathways, interacting with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the p-NF-κB pathway, suggesting its role in inflammation and pain signaling (Yin2018Translocation). These interactions highlight TRAM1's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
