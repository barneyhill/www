# PVALEF

## Overview
The PVALEF gene encodes the protein parvalbumin like EF-hand containing, which is a member of the EF-hand protein family. This family is characterized by a helix-loop-helix structural domain capable of binding calcium ions, which is crucial for various cellular processes. The parvalbumin like EF-hand containing protein is involved in calcium signaling pathways, playing a significant role in muscle relaxation and neuronal excitability. Its function is essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis within cells, and it is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes. The protein's structure and interactions suggest it may have specialized roles in specific tissues, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its functions and potential clinical significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
