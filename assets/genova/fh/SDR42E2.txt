# SDR42E2

## Overview
The SDR42E2 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, specifically known as short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 42E, member 2. This protein is characterized by a conserved NAD(P)(H) binding domain and a Rossmann fold, which are typical features of nucleotide-binding proteins, facilitating its role in catalysis and coenzyme binding (Persson2009The; Gabrielli2022Gene). The gene exhibits a complex splicing pattern, suggesting the existence of multiple isoforms, which may contribute to its diverse functional roles (Gabrielli2022Gene). While the precise biological functions of SDR42E2 are not fully elucidated, it has been implicated in various cellular processes and environmental stress responses, as well as being identified as a candidate gene in cancer studies, although its role in oncogenesis remains to be fully understood (Althubaiti2021DeepMOCCA:; Vasamsetti2023Transcriptome).

## Structure
The SDR42E2 protein is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, characterized by a conserved NAD(P)(H) binding domain and a common α/β folding pattern known as the Rossmann fold, which is typical of nucleotide-binding proteins (Persson2009The). This fold is central to the protein's tertiary structure, providing a stable framework for the binding of coenzymes. The SDR42E2 protein exhibits a high degree of sequence similarity with its family members, particularly in regions involved in catalysis and coenzyme binding (Gabrielli2022Gene).

The gene encoding SDR42E2 has a complex splicing pattern, with ten splicing sites, which is unique among its family members and suggests the presence of multiple isoforms (Gabrielli2022Gene). These splicing sites are conserved across several invertebrate orthologs, indicating an evolutionary link and potential functional significance (Gabrielli2022Gene). The SDR42E2 protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions (Gabrielli2022Gene).

The SDR42E2 gene structure and splicing patterns are identical to those of its vertebrate orthologs, but only the human SDR42E2 variant shares orthologous splicing sites with invertebrate SDR variants, highlighting its evolutionary significance (Gabrielli2022Gene).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the SDR42E2 gene is not fully understood, but it has been identified as a candidate gene in various studies. In the context of breast adenocarcinoma (BRCA), the DeepMOCCA model has ranked SDR42E2 as a top candidate gene in multiple patients, although it is not currently listed as a driver or prognostic gene in major cancer databases like COSMIC or IntOGen (Althubaiti2021DeepMOCCA:). Its role in cancer is not well established, but its epigenetic control has been noted in colorectal cancer, suggesting potential implications in cancer biology (Althubaiti2021DeepMOCCA:).

In a study involving zebrafish embryos treated with thiram, SDR42E2 was among the top upregulated genes, indicating its involvement in the molecular response to environmental stressors. This suggests that alterations in SDR42E2 expression could be linked to disruptions in metabolic and reproductive signaling pathways (Vasamsetti2023Transcriptome). However, the specific mechanisms by which SDR42E2 contributes to these conditions remain unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate its clinical significance.
