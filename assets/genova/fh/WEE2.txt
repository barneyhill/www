# WEE2

## Overview
WEE2 is a gene that encodes the WEE2 oocyte meiosis inhibiting kinase, a member of the WEE kinase family, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of oocyte meiosis. This kinase is specifically expressed in oocytes and is crucial for maintaining meiotic arrest by phosphorylating and inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), thereby preventing premature meiotic progression. The WEE2 protein is characterized by a conserved protein kinase domain essential for its function in cell cycle regulation, particularly in maintaining the germinal vesicle stage and facilitating the exit from metaphase II during meiosis (Zhou2019Novel; Dai2019New). Mutations in the WEE2 gene can lead to fertilization failure and female infertility due to impaired oocyte maturation and pronuclei formation, highlighting its clinical significance (Sang2018Homozygous; Wang2021Clinical).

## Structure
The WEE2 protein, also known as WEE2 oocyte meiosis inhibiting kinase, is a member of the WEE kinase family and plays a crucial role in regulating oocyte meiosis. The primary structure of WEE2 includes a conserved protein kinase domain, which is essential for its function in phosphorylating and inhibiting Cdc2 (CDK1) during meiosis (Zhou2019Novel; Dai2019New). This domain is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle by maintaining meiotic arrest at the germinal vesicle stage and facilitating exit from metaphase II (Liu2021A).

The secondary structure of WEE2 includes alpha helices, as indicated by the presence of a highly conserved α-helix where specific mutations can disrupt its configuration (Yang2019Homozygous). The tertiary structure of WEE2 is characterized by a 'closed' conformation of the P-loop, which is distinct from the 'open' conformation observed in WEE1, another member of the WEE kinase family (Hanna2020Development).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are critical for WEE2's activity, as it phosphorylates Cdc2 to inhibit its function, thereby regulating the maturation-promoting factor (MPF) (Dai2019New). The protein's structure and function are further influenced by specific mutations, which can lead to fertilization failure due to altered kinase activity (Zhou2019Novel).

## Function
The WEE2 gene encodes an oocyte-specific kinase that plays a critical role in regulating meiotic arrest in oocytes. In healthy human cells, WEE2 is involved in maintaining meiotic arrest by inhibiting the maturation-promoting factor (MPF) through the inactivation of Cdc2, a cyclin-dependent kinase. This process is essential for the proper progression of meiosis, which includes two divisions to create haploid gametes. During the germinal vesicle (GV) stage, WEE2 helps maintain the oocytes in a quiescent state until they are stimulated to resume meiosis I. After the completion of meiosis I, oocytes enter meiosis II and arrest at metaphase II until fertilization occurs. WEE2 is also essential for the exit from metaphase II, and its downregulation can lead to high MPF activity, resulting in failure of MII exit and fertilization failure (Sang2018Homozygous).

Mutations in WEE2 can lead to fertilization failure due to impaired protein function, as these mutations result in reduced serine phosphorylation of WEE2, which is necessary for egg activation and successful fertilization. The phosphorylation of Cdc2 by WEE2 is crucial for pronuclei formation, highlighting its role in regulating phosphorylation events critical for egg activation and fertilization (Sang2018Homozygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WEE2 gene are associated with fertilization failure and female infertility. These mutations can be homozygous or compound heterozygous and often result in impaired oocyte maturation and pronuclei formation, crucial steps for successful fertilization. Specific mutations, such as p.Asp234His, p.His337Tyrfs*24, and p.Glu75Valfs*6, lead to reduced serine phosphorylation of WEE2, which is essential for egg activation (Sang2018Homozygous). Other mutations, like c.625G > T and c.759-2A > G, result in protein truncation and splicing defects, respectively, contributing to fertilization failure (Wang2021Clinical).

The WEE2 gene plays a critical role in regulating meiotic arrest and metaphase II exit by phosphorylating and inhibiting Cdc2. Mutations in WEE2 disrupt these processes, leading to high maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activity and failure of metaphase II exit, which prevents pronuclear formation (Yang2019Homozygous). These genetic alterations are often inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and have been identified in patients from consanguineous families (Tian2020Novel).

Research has shown that injecting WEE2 cRNA into oocytes can rescue the fertilization phenotype, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for individuals affected by these mutations (Sang2018Homozygous).

## Interactions
WEE2, an oocyte-specific kinase, plays a crucial role in regulating meiosis by interacting with cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). It phosphorylates CDK1, which inactivates the CDK1/cyclin B complex, thereby maintaining meiotic arrest in oocytes (Hanna2020Development; Hanna2019Identification). This interaction is essential for preventing premature meiotic resumption before ovulation and facilitating the exit from metaphase II arrest at fertilization (Hanna2019Identification).

At fertilization, WEE2 is phosphorylated by calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) in response to sperm-induced calcium oscillations. This phosphorylation leads to decreased maturation promoting factor (MPF) activity, initiating pronucleus formation and mitotic embryonic cleavage (Hanna2019Identification). The interaction with CaMKII highlights WEE2's role in responding to fertilization signals.

WEE2's regulatory function is further supported by its interaction with the M-phase promoting factor (MPF), which consists of CDC2 and cyclin B. High intraoocyte cAMP levels maintain MPF inactivity, and WEE2 is involved in this regulatory process by inhibiting MPF activation (Hanna2010WEE2). These interactions underscore WEE2's critical role in controlling the timing of meiotic progression in oocytes.
