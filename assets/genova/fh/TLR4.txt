# TLR4

## Overview
The TLR4 gene encodes the toll-like receptor 4, a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the innate immune system by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiating immune responses. TLR4 is primarily expressed in immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, as well as in non-immune cells like endothelial and epithelial cells. The protein is characterized by an extracellular domain with leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that facilitate ligand binding, and an intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain crucial for signal transduction. Upon activation, TLR4 triggers signaling pathways that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons, essential for combating infections and maintaining immune homeostasis. Variations in the TLR4 gene have been linked to susceptibility to various diseases, including chronic infections, cardiovascular diseases, and inflammatory conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Ciesielska2020TLR4; Stierschneider2023Shedding).

## Structure
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a type I transmembrane protein involved in the innate immune response. Its extracellular domain (ECD) is composed of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) modules, which form a horseshoe-like shape. These LRRs are capped by cysteine-rich regions at the N- and C-terminal ends, contributing to the stability of the structure (Jin2008Structures; Manavalan2011Similar). The ECD of TLR4 interacts with the co-receptor MD-2 to form a stable 1:1 heterodimer, which is crucial for ligand binding and subsequent receptor activation (Manavalan2011Similar).

The intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain of TLR4 is essential for signal transduction. It consists of a central five-stranded parallel beta sheet surrounded by alpha helices, with the BB loop playing a critical role in dimerization and adaptor protein recruitment (Jin2008Structures; Manavalan2011Similar). The TIR domain forms a homodimer, providing a scaffold for the recruitment of adaptor proteins such as MyD88, Mal, TRIF, and TRAM, which activate downstream signaling pathways (Núñez2007A).

TLR4 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which are important for its function and localization. The receptor's structure and interactions are influenced by specific polymorphisms, such as the P681H polymorphism in the BB loop, which can affect signaling (Manavalan2011Similar).

## Function
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a critical component of the innate immune system, primarily involved in recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria. In healthy human cells, TLR4 is expressed in various immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, as well as in non-immune cells like endothelial and epithelial cells (Ciesielska2020TLR4; Stierschneider2023Shedding).

Upon activation by LPS, TLR4 initiates two main signaling pathways: the MyD88-dependent pathway and the TRIF-dependent pathway. The MyD88-dependent pathway is activated at the plasma membrane and leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) (Ciesielska2020TLR4; Stierschneider2023Shedding). The TRIF-dependent pathway is initiated after TLR4 internalization into endosomes and results in the production of type I interferons and other interferon-regulated genes (Ciesielska2020TLR4; Stierschneider2023Shedding).

TLR4's role in immune signaling is crucial for mounting an effective immune response, maintaining immune homeostasis, and preventing excessive inflammation, which can lead to conditions such as sepsis and chronic inflammatory diseases (Ciesielska2020TLR4; Stierschneider2023Shedding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the TLR4 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In the context of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TLR4 gene, such as rs10116253, rs5030728, and rs4986790, are linked to increased susceptibility to chronic HCV infection and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients. These polymorphisms may influence the risk of HCC and suggest that TLR4 could be a therapeutic target for preventing this cancer (Neamatallah2019Impact).

In cardiovascular diseases, TLR4 variants like Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile have been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI), particularly in male patients. These variants may alter the innate immune response, affecting susceptibility to MI and the progression of atherosclerosis (EDFELDT2004Association).

TLR4 mutations also play a role in inflammatory bowel diseases. The Thr399Ile mutation has been linked to ulcerative colitis, suggesting a novel association with impaired innate immunity in the pathogenesis of this condition (Török2004Polymorphisms).

In sepsis and pneumonia, TLR4 polymorphisms, especially when combined with TIRAP/Mal variants, are associated with an increased risk of severe infections and altered cytokine release, potentially affecting the immune response to bacterial infections (Kumpf2010Influence).

## Interactions
TLR4 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a pivotal role in immune signaling. It forms a complex with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and co-receptors such as MD-2 and CD14, which is essential for initiating the MyD88-dependent and TRIF/IRF3 signaling pathways, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferons (Rallabhandi2006Analysis; 2021). The interaction with MD-2 is particularly crucial for TLR4-mediated responses to LPS, as MD-2 acts as a chaperone for TLR4 surface expression (Rallabhandi2006Analysis).

TLR4 also interacts with endogenous molecules like high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), which binds to TLR4 and influences the immune response during anticancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This interaction is critical for the cross-presentation of antigens from dying tumor cells by dendritic cells, facilitating the priming of tumor-specific T lymphocytes (Apetoh2007The).

Additionally, TLR4 can be activated by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which binds directly to TLR4, inducing the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL1B and IL6. This interaction is TLR4-dependent and involves co-receptors MD2 and CD14 (Zhao2021SARSCoV2).
