# PSG9

## Overview
Pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein 9 (PSG9) is a gene that encodes a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family, specifically within the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) subgroup. The protein product of PSG9 is primarily expressed by the syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta and is secreted into the maternal bloodstream, particularly during the later stages of pregnancy. PSG9 plays a crucial role in modulating the maternal immune system to promote tolerance towards the fetus, primarily through its interactions with the transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) pathway. This protein is involved in the activation of latent TGF-β1, which is essential for the differentiation of regulatory T-cells, thereby contributing to immune homeostasis during pregnancy (Jones2016PSG9). Beyond its role in pregnancy, PSG9 has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in colorectal and breast cancers, where it influences tumor growth and metastasis through the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway (Salahshor2005Differential; Liu2020Pregnancy‐specific). Additionally, PSG9's altered expression has been associated with pregnancy-related disorders such as preeclampsia, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various clinical contexts (Salahshor2005Differential; Qin2023PregnancySpecific).

## Structure
The PSG9 protein is part of the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins family and is secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta. It is encoded by a cDNA that includes the leader peptide and four domains: N, A1, A2, and B2 (Jones2016PSG9). The protein shares significant sequence homology with PSG1, particularly in the N and B2 domains, which are crucial for its function in inducing the secretion and activation of latent TGF-β1 (Jones2016PSG9). The PSG9 protein is produced as a recombinant protein fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1, which includes the hinge region, CH2, and CH3 domains, resulting in a molecular mass of approximately 80 kDa when separated on SDS-PAGE (Jones2016PSG9).

The molecular structure of PSG9 includes potential N-glycosylation sites and a disulfide bond in the B2 domain, which may contribute to its stability and function (Jones2016PSG9). The N-domain of PSG9 is particularly important for its activity, as it induces the secretion of latent TGF-β1 from macrophages (Jones2016PSG9). The protein's structure and post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are essential for its role in immune regulation during pregnancy.

## Function
PSG9, a member of the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein family, plays a significant role in immune modulation during pregnancy. It is primarily expressed by the syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta and is abundant in maternal blood during the third trimester. PSG9 is involved in maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the fetus by modulating immune responses. It achieves this by binding to the latency-associated peptide (LAP) and the small latent complex (SLC) of TGF-β1, activating latent TGF-β1 in a dose-dependent manner. This activation is crucial for the differentiation of regulatory T-cells, which are essential for immune tolerance (Jones2016PSG9).

PSG9 promotes the conversion of naïve CD4+ T-cells into Foxp3-expressing regulatory T-cells through a TGF-β1-dependent mechanism. This process is inhibited by a TGF-β receptor I inhibitor, highlighting the specificity of PSG9's action. PSG9 also suppresses IL-2 transcription in T-cells, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IFNγ, while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-9. These activities suggest PSG9's role in modulating immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis in healthy human cells (Jones2016PSG9).

## Clinical Significance
PSG9, a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family, has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In colorectal cancer, PSG9 is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its role in early carcinogenesis and its potential as a biomarker for colorectal cancer detection (Salahshor2005Differential). The gene's expression is particularly elevated in adenomas from familial adenomatous polyposis cases, indicating its involvement in the early stages of colorectal cancer development (Salahshor2005Differential).

In breast cancer, PSG9 is upregulated in tumor tissues and is associated with poor prognosis. It acts as a transcriptional target of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, promoting tumor growth and metastasis through mechanisms such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Liu2020Pregnancy‐specific).

PSG9 is also linked to preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related disorder. Studies have shown decreased PSG9 levels in the serum of preeclampsia patients, suggesting a potential role in the pathophysiology of the condition (Qin2023PregnancySpecific). These findings highlight PSG9's clinical significance in both cancer and pregnancy-related disorders.

## Interactions
Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 9 (PSG9) is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cancer progression and immune regulation. PSG9 interacts with the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, a critical pathway in breast cancer progression. It stabilizes Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 proteins by preventing their proteasomal degradation, thereby enhancing their stability and promoting tumor growth and metastasis (Liu2020Pregnancy‐specific). PSG9 also interacts directly with Smad2/3/4, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, and decreases the poly-ubiquitination of these proteins (Liu2020Pregnancy‐specific).

In the context of immune regulation, PSG9 binds to the latency-associated peptide (LAP) and the small latent complex (SLC) of TGF-β1, activating latent TGF-β1. This interaction is crucial for the differentiation of regulatory T-cells, as PSG9 promotes the conversion of naïve CD4+ T-cells into FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells through a TGF-β1-dependent pathway (Jones2016PSG9). PSG9's interaction with TGF-β1 also influences cytokine secretion, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-9 (Jones2016PSG9). These interactions highlight PSG9's role in modulating immune responses and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer and immune-related conditions.
