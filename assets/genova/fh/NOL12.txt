# NOL12

## Overview
NOL12 is a gene that encodes the nucleolar protein 12, a multifunctional protein primarily involved in RNA and DNA metabolism. This protein plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the processing of pre-rRNA within the nucleolus, and is essential for maintaining cellular growth and genome integrity. Nucleolar protein 12 is categorized as an endonuclease and is implicated in the DNA damage response and repair pathways, contributing to genome stability. It also plays a role in nucleolar homeostasis, with its repression leading to nucleolar stress and activation of the p53 signaling pathway, which can result in cellular senescence. The diverse functions and interactions of nucleolar protein 12 underscore its importance in cellular processes and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Scott2017Nol12; Pinho2019NOL12; Scott2016Nol12).

## Function
NOL12 is a multifunctional endonuclease involved in RNA and DNA metabolism, playing a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis and cell growth. It is primarily localized in the nucleolus, where it is essential for the processing of pre-rRNA, specifically required for cleavage at site 2 within the Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1). This processing is vital for the separation of small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) pre-rRNAs, and its absence leads to rerouting of processing events through site E (Scott2016Nol12).

NOL12 also plays a significant role in maintaining genome integrity. It is associated with DNA damage response and repair pathways, co-localizing with proteins involved in these processes, such as Dhx9 and SFPQ. This suggests its involvement in managing genome instability and participating in ATR-mediated DNA repair pathways (Scott2017Nol12).

In addition to its roles in ribosome biogenesis and DNA repair, NOL12 is implicated in nucleolar homeostasis. Its repression leads to nucleolar stress, characterized by increased nucleolar size and altered protein levels, which can activate the p53 signaling pathway and lead to cellular senescence (Pinho2019NOL12).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NOL12 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions, primarily due to its role in maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis. Depletion of NOL12 leads to increased oxidative stress and DNA damage, activating the ATR-Chk1/Chk2 DNA damage response pathway and resulting in apoptosis. This suggests that NOL12 is crucial in preventing oxidative DNA damage, and its dysfunction could contribute to diseases related to DNA damage and repair mechanisms, such as neurodegenerative disorders (Scott2016Nol12).

NOL12 repression is associated with nucleolar stress and cellular senescence, particularly in the context of aging. In untransformed cells, NOL12 knockdown induces p53-dependent cellular senescence, while in cancer cells, it can lead to apoptosis. This differential response highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Pinho2019NOL12). The gene's role in nucleolar homeostasis and its impact on cellular aging processes suggest that alterations in NOL12 expression could serve as a biomarker for aging and age-related diseases (Pinho2019NOL12).

In the retina, NOL12 protects against UV-induced damage by inhibiting ATR overactivation, which is linked to apoptosis. Its degradation by UV exposure may contribute to retinal damage, indicating its importance in ocular health (Liu2024Protein).

## Interactions
NOL12 is a multifunctional protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA and DNA metabolism. It is involved in ribosome biogenesis, where it interacts with numerous ribosome maturation factors, including those for the large ribosomal subunit (LSU) maturation and components of 90S pre-ribosomes (Scott2017Nol12; Scott2016Nol12). NOL12's interactions with these factors are partly RNA-dependent, particularly its recruitment to 90S pre-ribosomes, while its association with LSU maturation factors is more stable and less RNA-dependent (Scott2016Nol12).

NOL12 also interacts with proteins involved in genome maintenance and DNA damage response pathways. It associates with chromatin-associated factors such as SFPQ, NONO, and the RNA/DNA DEAD-box helicase Dhx9, which are implicated in preventing genome instability (Scott2017Nol12). Under DNA stress conditions, NOL12 localizes to sites of replication stress and DNA damage, suggesting its role in maintaining genome integrity (Scott2017Nol12).

In addition to its role in ribosome biogenesis and genome maintenance, NOL12 is involved in mRNA metabolism, as indicated by its presence in GW/P-bodies and its interactions with mRNA processing factors (Scott2017Nol12). These diverse interactions highlight NOL12's critical role in cellular processes related to RNA and DNA metabolism.
