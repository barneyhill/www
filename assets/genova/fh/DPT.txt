# DPT

## Overview
The DPT gene encodes dermatopontin, a non-collagenous extracellular matrix protein that plays a crucial role in cell-matrix interactions and tissue integrity. Dermatopontin is involved in various biological processes, including cell adhesion, extracellular matrix assembly, and collagen fibrillogenesis, which are essential for maintaining the structural framework of tissues (Catalán2022Dermatopontin; Liu2020Dermatopontin). The protein interacts with key components such as collagen, decorin, and fibronectin, contributing to skin integrity, wound healing, and angiogenesis (Catalán2022Dermatopontin). Additionally, dermatopontin modulates signaling pathways, including the Hippo pathway, by interacting with proteins like YAP, thereby influencing cellular processes and potentially suppressing tumor progression (Ye2023DNMT3adermatopontin). Mutations in the DPT gene have been associated with Meniere's disease, highlighting its clinical significance in auditory health (Oh2020Rare; MartínSierra2016Variable).

## Structure
Dermatopontin (DPT) is a non-collagenous extracellular matrix protein characterized by its involvement in cell-matrix interactions. The primary structure of DPT consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional properties (Seetaraman2020Cloning). The secondary structure of DPT includes beta-sheets, which contribute to its stability and functionality (Seetaraman2020Cloning). The tertiary structure of DPT is stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining its three-dimensional conformation and multifunctionality (Seetaraman2020Cloning). These disulfide bonds are formed by the conserved cysteine residues present in the protein (Komatsu2014Identification).

DPT functions as a monomer and does not exhibit a quaternary structure (Seetaraman2020Cloning). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can influence its activity and interactions within the extracellular matrix (Seetaraman2020Cloning). The presence of specific domains or prominent folds in DPT is not detailed in the available context, nor are any splice variant isoforms mentioned. The molecular weight of the His-tagged recombinant DPT protein is approximately 26 kDa (Seetaraman2020Cloning).

## Function
Dermatopontin (DPT) is a protein encoded by the DPT gene, playing a significant role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of healthy human cells. It is involved in cell adhesion and ECM assembly, interacting with various proteins to enhance biological activities and regulate the cell cycle and differentiation (Sun2024Identification). DPT contributes to ECM remodeling, influencing the expression of critical ECM-related factors, and is implicated in collagen fibrillogenesis and ECM dynamics (Catalán2022Dermatopontin). It interacts with collagen and decorin, suggesting its role in maintaining tissue structure and integrity (Catalán2022Dermatopontin).

DPT is active in the dermis, where it contributes to skin integrity and wound healing by facilitating tissue repair and modulating ECM remodeling (Catalán2022Dermatopontin). It also plays a role in angiogenesis, which is crucial for tissue repair processes (Catalán2022Dermatopontin). The protein's interaction with fibronectin and its ability to enhance collagen fibrillogenesis highlight its importance in maintaining the structural framework of tissues (Liu2020Dermatopontin). These functions underscore DPT's critical role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of tissues in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DPT gene, which encodes the extracellular matrix protein dermatopontin, have been implicated in Meniere's disease (MD), a disorder affecting the inner ear characterized by vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. Specifically, the missense variant c.544C>T (p.Arg182Cys) in the DPT gene is predicted to cause significant structural changes in the protein, potentially affecting its function and contributing to the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant familial Meniere's disease (AD-FMD) (MartínSierra2016Variable). This variant may lead to the disappearance of some steric bonds, which could be relevant to the disease's development (MartínSierra2016Variable).

In addition to familial cases, rare variants in the DPT gene have been identified in sporadic cases of Meniere's disease. For instance, a missense variant (p.Leu6Phe) was found in a patient, suggesting a potential role in the formation or maintenance of inner ear structures (Oh2020Rare). Although the pathogenicity of these variants requires further confirmation through functional studies, they highlight the genetic complexity and potential involvement of DPT in Meniere's disease (Oh2020Rare).

## Interactions
Dermatopontin (DPT) is an extracellular matrix protein that engages in various interactions with other proteins, influencing cellular processes and tissue dynamics. DPT directly interacts with the Yes-associated protein (YAP), a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway. This interaction promotes YAP phosphorylation at Ser127, retaining it in the cytoplasm and preventing its nuclear translocation, which in turn suppresses malignant phenotypes in breast cancer cells (Ye2023DNMT3adermatopontin). DPT binds specifically to the 292-488 amino acid region of YAP, a critical interaction for its tumor-suppressive role (Ye2023DNMT3adermatopontin).

DPT also interacts with integrin proteins, such as integrin α3β1, which affects cell adhesion and migration, particularly in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (Liu2020Dermatopontin). Additionally, DPT modulates the activity of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) by enhancing its biological activity, and it interacts with decorin, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan, to influence collagen fibrillogenesis (Unamuno2020Dermatopontin). These interactions highlight DPT's role in extracellular matrix remodeling and its potential impact on cancer progression and tissue repair.
