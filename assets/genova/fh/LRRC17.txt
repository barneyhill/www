# LRRC17

## Overview
LRRC17 is a gene that encodes the protein leucine rich repeat containing 17, which is a secretory protein involved in various biological processes, including bone metabolism and immune response regulation. The protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to its structural flexibility (Matsushima2009Analyses). Functionally, LRRC17 plays a critical role in maintaining bone homeostasis by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, thereby preventing excessive bone degradation (Song2021LRRC17). It is also implicated in the regulation of osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, influencing pathways such as Wnt signaling (Song2021LRRC17). Beyond bone metabolism, LRRC17 is involved in cancer biology, where its expression levels are associated with cancer progression and patient prognosis, particularly in ovarian and colorectal cancers (Ahmad2023Identification). The gene's clinical significance is further underscored by its potential as a prognostic marker in diseases like osteoarthritis and sarcoma (Wen2022Novel; Muller2023Proteomic).

## Structure
The LRRC17 protein is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and typically form a horseshoe-shaped structure. The protein contains ten LRRs and is predicted to be highly flexible (Matsushima2009Analyses). A notable feature of LRRC17 is the presence of a super motif, approximately 150 residues long, represented by the structure LRRNT-(LRR)5-LRRCT. This super motif is repeated twice within the protein, forming a superrepeat (Matsushima2009Analyses).

The protein also includes non-LRR intervening regions (IRs), which are thought to have evolved through the duplication of super motifs containing non-LRR regions. These IRs are often located near the center of the LRR region and contribute to the protein's structural diversity (Matsushima2009Analyses). The flexibility of LRRC17 is similar to that observed in other proteins with serine-rich regions, suggesting a potential for intrinsic disorder in these areas (Matsushima2009Analyses).

LRRC17 is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrate species, with significant sequence identity between human LRRC17 and its zebrafish paralog, indicating a conserved structural and functional role (OH2020LRRC17Is).

## Function
LRRC17 is a gene that encodes a secretory protein involved in bone metabolism and immune response regulation. In healthy human cells, LRRC17 plays a crucial role in maintaining bone homeostasis by inhibiting receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation, which prevents excessive bone degradation (OH2020LRRC17Is; Song2021LRRC17). The protein is active in the extracellular matrix and cell membrane regions, influencing cell-cell interactions and signaling processes (OH2020LRRC17Is).

LRRC17 is involved in the regulation of osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). Overexpression of LRRC17 promotes osteogenesis and inhibits adipogenesis, which is associated with increased expressions of Wnt3a and β-catenin, and decreased expressions of Wnt5a and RANKL. Conversely, knockout of LRRC17 leads to reduced osteogenic and increased adipogenic markers (Song2021LRRC17). These activities suggest that LRRC17 modulates bone metabolism through the Wnt signaling pathways, contributing to the balance of bone formation and resorption (Song2021LRRC17).

In addition to its role in bone metabolism, LRRC17 may also protect cells from apoptosis, potentially through mechanisms similar to other leucine-rich repeat family proteins (OH2020LRRC17Is).

## Clinical Significance
The LRRC17 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In ovarian cancer, particularly serous ovarian cancer (SOC), overexpression of LRRC17 is associated with poor overall survival and resistance to platinum-paclitaxel chemotherapy. This overexpression is believed to inhibit chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, making it a significant prognostic factor in SOC (Amniouel2024Evaluating). 

In osteoarthritis (OA), LRRC17 is found to be downregulated in the synovial fluid of female patients. This downregulation may reflect a shared pathway with osteoporosis, as LRRC17 is known to prevent the activation of RANK-L-dependent osteoclasts, which are involved in bone resorption. Postmenopausal women with lower levels of LRRC17 have a higher risk of osteoporotic fractures, suggesting its role in bone metabolism and potential involvement in OA pathophysiology (Muller2023Proteomic).

LRRC17 is also part of a gene signature associated with sarcoma prognosis. Higher expression levels of LRRC17 in sarcoma patients are linked to a higher risk score, which correlates with lower survival rates. This suggests that LRRC17 may influence sarcoma progression and patient outcomes (Wen2022Novel).

## Interactions
LRRC17 (leucine rich repeat containing 17) is known to interact with receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), a protein involved in bone metabolism. This interaction plays a role in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation and activity, acting as a negative regulator for osteoporosis (Ahmad2023Identification). In the context of cancer, particularly ovarian cancer, LRRC17 has been implicated in cancer progression through its interaction with RANKL, where its upregulation is associated with lower survival rates in patients (Ahmad2023Identification).

In colorectal cancer, LRRC17 is identified as a marker for fibroblast activation, with significant expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The study suggests that LRRC17 may contribute to tumor biology by mediating cancer invasion and metastasis, potentially through interactions that increase extracellular matrix deposition and stiffness (Ahmad2023Identification). The exact mechanisms and interactions of LRRC17 in the tumor microenvironment remain to be fully elucidated, but its role in fibroblast activation and cancer progression highlights its potential as a therapeutic target (Ahmad2023Identification).
