# SMIM35

## Overview
SMIM35 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 35, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is characterized by its relatively small size, being less than 100 amino acids in length, and is involved in various cellular processes. Although the specific functions of SMIM35 are not fully understood, it has been implicated in significant biological pathways, including those related to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, particularly in the context of Huntington's disease (Sneha2023Investigating). Additionally, SMIM35 is considered a 'pathway-orphan' gene in kidney health research, indicating its potential involvement in kidney disease and development despite lacking predefined pathway annotations (Acoba2024Kidney). Further research is necessary to elucidate the precise roles and mechanisms of SMIM35 in these and other physiological contexts.

## Clinical Significance
SMIM35 has been identified as a gene of interest in the context of Huntington's disease (HD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In HD, SMIM35 is one of the novel genes involved in pathways such as Wnt signaling and the MAPK cascade, which are crucial for cell differentiation processes. The upregulation of SMIM35 in HD samples suggests its involvement in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, indicating that it could be a potential candidate for further research in understanding its role in HD pathogenesis (Sneha2023Investigating).

In the context of kidney health, SMIM35 is classified as a 'pathway-orphan' gene, which means it lacks predefined pathway annotations. It is one of the eleven kidney-expressed pathway-orphan proteins that are less than 100 amino acids long. These proteins, including SMIM35, are generally shorter and lighter than other proteins but may still play significant roles in biological processes. The study suggests that these genes and proteins warrant further investigation to understand their potential roles in kidney disease and development (Acoba2024Kidney).

Overall, the altered expression of SMIM35 in these conditions highlights its potential significance in disease mechanisms, although its exact role remains to be fully elucidated.
