# ATG3

## Overview
The ATG3 gene encodes the autophagy-related 3 protein, a pivotal component in the autophagy pathway, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and the degradation of cytoplasmic components. As an E2-like enzyme, the ATG3 protein facilitates the conjugation of LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a critical step in autophagosome formation and maturation. Structurally, ATG3 is characterized by a unique hammer-like shape and contains a conserved catalytic cysteine crucial for its enzymatic activity. It interacts with several autophagy-related proteins, including ATG7 and ATG8, to mediate the lipidation process necessary for autophagosome membrane expansion. Beyond its role in autophagy, ATG3 is involved in mitochondrial homeostasis and has been implicated in various physiological processes, including DNA damage response and apoptosis prevention. The gene's expression and function are linked to several diseases, such as cancer and ischemia-reperfusion injury, highlighting its clinical significance (Ye2023Multifaceted; Yamada2007The; Fang2021Binding).

## Structure
The ATG3 protein is involved in autophagy and functions as an E2-like enzyme, facilitating the conjugation of LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Its molecular structure is characterized by a unique hammer-like shape, consisting of a head and a handle. The head features a central six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices, forming a globular fold, while the handle comprises a long α-helix and a partially disordered loop (Yamada2007The; Fang2021Binding).

ATG3's primary structure includes a conserved catalytic cysteine, Cys-234, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This cysteine is located at the carboxyl terminus of strand 6, similar to the catalytic cysteine in other E2 enzymes (Yamada2007The). The protein also contains two unique inserted regions: the handle region (HR) and a long inserted region between strands 2 and 3, which is highly acidic and flexible (Yamada2007The).

In terms of tertiary structure, ATG3 shares an α/β-fold similar to canonical E2 enzymes, despite having little sequence homology with them (Yamada2007The). The protein's quaternary structure involves interactions with other autophagy-related proteins, such as ATG7 and ATG8, which are essential for its function in autophagy (Yamada2007The). ATG3's interactions with membranes are facilitated by its N-terminal amphipathic helix and C-terminal regions, which are crucial for its role in LC3-PE conjugation (Ye2023Multifaceted).

## Function
The ATG3 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the autophagy process, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis in healthy human cells. ATG3 functions as an E2 ubiquitin-like conjugating enzyme in the ATG8 conjugation system, facilitating the lipidation of LC3, a key step in autophagosome formation. This process is vital for the elongation of the phagophore, a precursor to the autophagosome, which sequesters cytoplasmic components, organelles, and proteins for degradation (Fang2021Binding).

ATG3 interacts with other proteins such as ATG7, ATG8, and ATG12, contributing to autophagosome formation. It forms a unique E1-E2 complex with ATG7, facilitating the transfer of ATG8 from ATG7 to ATG3, which is essential for autophagosome formation (Fang2021Binding). The ATG12-ATG5 complex interacts with ATG3, promoting the translocation of ATG8 to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a critical step in autophagosome membrane expansion and maturation (Li2019Regulation).

Beyond its role in autophagy, ATG3 is involved in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and has autophagy-independent functions, such as involvement in DNA damage-induced mitosis (Fang2021Binding). Its activity is crucial for preventing apoptosis and maintaining stem cell functions, highlighting its importance in various physiological processes (Fang2021Binding).

## Clinical Significance
The ATG3 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in autophagy. In cancer, alterations in ATG3 expression are observed across multiple types, including colon cancer, leukemia, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hepatic cellular cancer (HCC), gastric cancer, and prostate cancer. In colon cancer, ATG3 knockdown suppresses cell proliferation and invasion, while in leukemia, low ATG3 expression is linked to disease maintenance, and its overexpression can enhance treatment sensitivity. In NSCLC and HCC, high ATG3 expression is associated with drug resistance and increased autophagic flux, promoting cell survival and drug resistance (Fang2021Binding).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ATG3 is crucial for autophagy, and its loss leads to metabolic rewiring, allowing cells to survive despite impaired autophagy. This includes increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, with cells becoming more sensitive to oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors (Baker2021Metabolic).

ATG3 also plays a role in ischemia-reperfusion injury, where its expression can worsen myocardial injury but protect against injury in fatty livers by enhancing autophagy and reducing cell death (Fang2021Binding). Additionally, ATG3 is involved in immune responses, as seen in the Japanese flounder, where its interaction with pol-miR-155 during Edwardsiella tarda infection suppresses autophagy, facilitating pathogen replication (Zhang2023Japanese).

## Interactions
ATG3 is a crucial E2-like enzyme in the autophagy pathway, interacting with several proteins to facilitate the lipidation of ATG8 family proteins. One significant interaction is with ATG7, an E1 enzyme, which is essential for the transfer of ATG8 to ATG3. This interaction involves the N-terminal domain (NTD) of ATG7 binding to a flexible region (FR) within ATG3, with key residues such as Met139, Leu135, and Ile141 playing a critical role in this binding. Mutations in these residues can impair the transfer of ATG8 and disrupt autophagy (Taherbhoy2011Atg8).

ATG3 also interacts with GABARAP, a member of the ATG8 family, through a novel non-covalent interaction on the 'backside' of ATG3. This interaction is crucial for the lipidation process and is distinct from canonical ubiquitin-like protein E2 conjugates. Mutations at specific residues on the ATG3 backside, such as Thr52 and Thr197, can disrupt GABARAP binding and lipidation, highlighting the importance of this interaction (Ohashi2024Structural).

Additionally, ATG3 interacts with membranes through multiple regions, including an N-terminal amphipathic helix and C-terminal regions, which are essential for its function in conjugating LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (Ye2023Multifaceted).
