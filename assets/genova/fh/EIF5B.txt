# EIF5B

## Overview
EIF5B is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5B (eIF5B), a GTPase that plays a crucial role in the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The eIF5B protein is involved in the final stages of translation initiation, facilitating the joining of the small (40S) and large (60S) ribosomal subunits to form the 80S initiation complex, which is essential for mRNA translation into proteins (Chukka2021Established; Lapointe2021eIF5B). Structurally, eIF5B is characterized by a chalice-like shape with several domains, including a GTP-binding domain that is critical for its function in ribosomal subunit joining (DEVER2001Universal). The protein's activity is regulated by GTP hydrolysis, which is necessary for its release from the ribosome and the progression of the translation process (Chukka2021Established). EIF5B is also implicated in non-canonical translation initiation mechanisms, such as IRES-mediated translation, and plays a significant role in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Jiang2016Proteomic; Ross2019Eukaryotic).

## Structure
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5B (eIF5B) is a GTPase involved in the initiation of translation. Structurally, eIF5B is characterized by a chalice-like shape, comprising several distinct domains. The protein includes a GTP-binding domain, which is structurally similar to those found in translation factors EF1A and EF2, as well as Ras and heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (DEVER2001Universal). This domain is crucial for its function in ribosomal subunit joining (Chukka2021Established).

eIF5B consists of four domains: the G domain, domain II, domain III, and domain IV. Domains II and IV are antiparallel β-barrels, while domain III is an α/β/α-sandwich (DEVER2001Universal). The G domain interacts with the 60S ribosomal subunit and is involved in GTP hydrolysis, which is necessary for the release of eIF5B and the transition to elongation (Chukka2021Established). Domain IV interacts with Met-tRNAiMet and is crucial for its delivery (Kuhle2014Structural).

The protein's structure is stabilized by a long α-helix, known as helix H12, which connects the GTP-binding domain to domain IV. This helix acts as a lever arm and is essential for maintaining the proper spacing and stability of the 80S ribosomal complex (Shin2011Structural). The structural integrity of helix H12 is critical for eIF5B's role in translation initiation (Shin2011Structural).

## Function
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5B (eIF5B) is a GTPase that plays a critical role in the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. It is primarily involved in the final step of translation initiation, where it facilitates the joining of the small (40S) and large (60S) ribosomal subunits to form the elongation-competent 80S initiation complex. This process is essential for the proper translation of mRNA into proteins (Chukka2021Established; Lapointe2021eIF5B).

eIF5B interacts with several other initiation factors, including eIF1A, to stabilize and remodel the 48S initiation complex, ensuring the correct positioning of the initiator Met-tRNAiMet on the ribosome. This interaction is crucial for the fidelity of start-codon selection and the transition from initiation to elongation (Wang2020Structural; Lapointe2021eIF5B). The protein's activity is regulated by GTP hydrolysis, which is necessary for its release from the ribosome and the progression of the translation process (Chukka2021Established).

eIF5B is also involved in non-canonical translation initiation mechanisms, such as internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation, which is particularly important under stress conditions (Jiang2016Proteomic). In healthy cells, eIF5B is essential for maintaining proteostasis, impacting cell growth and proliferation (Jiang2016Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5B (EIF5B) plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in the regulation of mRNA translation. Alterations in EIF5B expression levels have been linked to cancer cell survival and proliferation. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), EIF5B promotes the translation of anti-apoptotic proteins such as XIAP, Bcl-xL, cIAP1, and c-FLIP, which help cancer cells evade apoptosis. Depletion of EIF5B in GBM cells sensitizes them to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, suggesting its role in apoptosis resistance (Ross2019Eukaryotic). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high levels of EIF5B are associated with poor prognosis, and its depletion can reduce tumor growth and enhance sensitivity to treatments like temozolomide (Chukka2021Established). EIF5B also regulates pathways like mTOR and MAPK, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation (Chukka2021Established).

In prostate cancer, EIF5B regulates the expression of PD-L1, a protein involved in immune response modulation. Silencing EIF5B reduces PD-L1 expression, inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and enhancing apoptosis, which suggests its potential as a target for immunotherapy (Li2021eIF5B). These findings highlight EIF5B's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
EIF5B, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5B, is involved in several critical interactions during the translation initiation process. It plays a pivotal role in the association of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits to form the 80S initiation complex. EIF5B interacts with eIF5, where domain IV of eIF5B binds to the C-terminus of eIF5, facilitating the formation and stabilization of the 48S initiation complex (Chukka2021Established). EIF5B also interacts with eIF1A, with domains III and IV of eIF5B engaging the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding domain and C-terminal tail of eIF1A. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of eIF5B and the joining of ribosomal subunits after codon recognition (Chukka2021Established).

The G-domain of eIF5B interacts with the 60S ribosomal subunit and is involved in GTP hydrolysis, which is necessary for the release of eIF5B and the transition to the elongation phase of protein synthesis (Chukka2021Established). EIF5B also interacts with eIF2A, particularly under stress conditions, to facilitate the delivery of Met-tRNAiMet (Chukka2021Established). These interactions underscore the essential role of eIF5B in both canonical and non-canonical translation initiation pathways.
