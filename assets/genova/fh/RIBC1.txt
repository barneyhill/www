# RIBC1

## Overview
RIBC1, or RIB43A domain with coiled-coils 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains. These domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the RIBC1 protein may play a role in cellular structural organization or signaling pathways. The gene is located on the X chromosome and has been implicated in various genetic and epigenetic alterations associated with neurological and developmental disorders, as well as certain cancers. Notably, copy-number variations involving RIBC1 have been linked to X-linked mental retardation, while hypermethylation of the gene has been observed in ovarian carcinoma, indicating its potential involvement in disease pathogenesis (Erdogan2020Genome‑wide; Almal2011Implications; Zhang2009Copy). Further research is necessary to fully understand the functional implications of RIBC1 in these contexts.

## Clinical Significance
The RIBC1 gene has been implicated in several neurological and developmental disorders through its involvement in gene copy-number variations (CNVs). In the context of mental retardation (MR), CNVs involving RIBC1, along with other genes such as SMC1A, HSD17B10, and HUWE1, have been associated with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). These CNVs are characterized by overlapping duplications at the Xp11.22 region, suggesting that dosage-sensitive genes like RIBC1 may contribute to the MR phenotype (Almal2011Implications; Zhang2009Copy).

In addition to its role in MR, RIBC1 has been studied in the context of ovarian cancer. Research indicates that the RIBC1 gene is hypermethylated in individuals with ovarian carcinoma, suggesting that changes in its methylation status may be significant for cancer differentiation (Erdogan2020Genome‑wide).

While the specific clinical significance of RIBC1 mutations is not fully understood, its involvement in these conditions highlights the potential impact of genetic and epigenetic alterations in disease mechanisms. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise role of RIBC1 in these and possibly other conditions.
