# HSPH1

## Overview
HSPH1 is a gene that encodes the heat shock protein family H (Hsp110) member 1, a molecular chaperone involved in maintaining protein homeostasis within cells. The Hsp110 protein is a member of the heat shock protein family and functions primarily as a nucleotide exchange factor, facilitating the disassembly of misfolded proteins and preventing protein aggregation, particularly under stress conditions such as heat shock. It is characterized by a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD), which are crucial for its interaction with other heat shock proteins, notably those in the Hsp70 family. Hsp110 plays a significant role in cellular proteostasis by assisting in protein folding and stabilization, and its activity is regulated by heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1). The gene and its encoded protein have been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer, where alterations in HSPH1 expression are associated with disease prognosis and treatment response (Chakafana2021The; Miao2021Quantitative; Li2020Oncogene).

## Structure
HSPH1, also known as Hsp110, is a chaperone protein characterized by a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD). The NBD is highly conserved and plays a crucial role in regulating nucleotide exchange with canonical Hsp70s, while the SBD is more divergent, featuring extended acidic insertions in its SBD-β and SBD-α subunits (Chakafana2021The). The SBD of Hsp110 includes a peptide-binding β-sandwich subdomain (SBDβ) and an α-helical lid subdomain (SBDα), with the SBDα segment having unique acidic insertions that enhance substrate binding efficiency (Mattoo2013Hsp110; Chakafana2021The).

Hsp110 can form a 1:1 complex with Hsp70, interacting through their distal lobes in the NBDs, and the crystal structure of yeast Hsp110 with bovine Hsp70 shows a pseudosymmetrical dimer with tight interactions between the NBDs (Mattoo2013Hsp110). The protein's structure is similar to that of Hsp70, with Hsp110 having seven β strands in the SBD compared to eight in canonical Hsp70s (Chakafana2021The). Hsp110 is unique among nucleotide exchange factors as it can turn Hsc70 into an effective disaggregating machinery (Mattoo2013Hsp110).

## Function
HSPH1, also known as Hsp110, is a molecular chaperone that plays a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis within cells. It is primarily involved in the disassembly of misfolded proteins, a process crucial during stress conditions such as heat shock. HSPH1 assists in protein folding and stabilization, preventing protein aggregation and aiding in the refolding of denatured proteins, thereby ensuring cellular proteostasis (Brocchieri2008hsp70; Miao2021Quantitative).

HSPH1 is active in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum, where it functions in synergy with other heat shock proteins, such as those in the HSP70 family, to maintain efficient protein homeostasis. This collaboration enhances the cell's ability to survive adverse conditions by limiting the effects of protein-damaging agents and blocking pathways of cell death, such as apoptosis or necrosis (Li2020Oncogene; KARIYA2013Identification).

The protein's activity is regulated at the transcriptional level by heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), which is activated in response to stress. This regulation ensures that HSPH1 is upregulated during stress conditions, contributing to the cellular stress response and cytoprotection (KARIYA2013Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HSPH1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In lung adenocarcinoma, the rs2280059 polymorphism in the HSPH1 gene is associated with the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) like gefitinib. Patients with the AA or GA genotype of this polymorphism have a decreased risk of recurrence and death compared to those with the GG genotype, suggesting a significant impact on progression-free and overall survival (Li2020Oncogene).

In breast cancer, HSPH1 expression is linked to poor prognosis. A comprehensive transcriptomic analysis identified HSPH1 as one of the heat shock proteins associated with clinical outcomes, with higher expression levels correlating with more aggressive cancer subtypes and poorer survival rates (Zoppino2018Comprehensive).

HSPH1 is also involved in colorectal adenomatous polyposis, where variants in the gene were identified in patients, although the pathogenicity of these variants remains unclear. The gene's overexpression in tumor tissues suggests a potential role in cancer development (Horpaopan2014Genome‐wide).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of HSPH1 in cancer prognosis and treatment response.

## Interactions
HSPH1, also known as Hsp110, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a molecular chaperone. It forms heterodimers with Hsp70 through interactions in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), facilitating the exchange of ADP for ATP, which is essential for protein folding and stabilization (Chakafana2021The). HSPH1 acts as a nucleotide exchange factor for HSPA1, a member of the Hsp70 family, maintaining co-translationally ubiquitylated proteins in a soluble state necessary for proteasomal degradation (Tian2020Dual). This interaction is critical for protein quality control and thermotolerance, particularly in cancer cells (Tian2020Dual).

HSPH1 also interacts with other heat shock proteins, such as Hsp40 and small heat shock proteins (sHsps), forming a chaperone machinery that assists in protein reactivation and disaggregation (Franco2023Sorghum). The structural basis for the cooperation between Hsp70 and Hsp110 chaperones involves the stabilization of Hsp70 in an open conformation by Hsp110, facilitating nucleotide exchange (Polier2008Structural). These interactions highlight the role of HSPH1 in maintaining cellular proteostasis and its potential involvement in cancer-related pathways.
