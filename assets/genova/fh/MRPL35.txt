# MRPL35

## Overview
MRPL35 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L35, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial ribosome's large 39S subunit. This protein plays a significant role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a key process in cellular energy production (O’Brien2003Properties). Unlike bacterial ribosomes, mitochondrial ribosomes, including MRPL35, have a higher protein content, contributing to their unique structural and functional characteristics within the mitochondria (O’Brien2003Properties). MRPL35 is encoded by nuclear DNA and imported into the mitochondria, where it assembles with mitochondrial rRNAs to form functional ribosomes (O’Brien2003Properties). The evolutionary origins of MRPL35 suggest a shared ancestry with eubacterial proteins, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular metabolism (O’Brien2003Properties). Despite its critical function, detailed insights into MRPL35's specific roles in healthy human cells remain limited in the current literature.

## Function
MRPL35 is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically part of the large 39S subunit. It plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a process critical for ATP production in cells (O’Brien2003Properties). The mitochondrial ribosomes, including MRPL35, are characterized by a higher protein content compared to their bacterial counterparts, which contributes to their unique structure and function within the mitochondria (O’Brien2003Properties).

MRPL35 is encoded by nuclear genes and imported into the mitochondria, where it assembles with mitochondrially transcribed rRNAs to form ribosomes. These ribosomes are responsible for translating mRNAs that encode essential proteins for the oxidative phosphorylation system, thereby playing a vital role in cellular energy metabolism (O’Brien2003Properties). The evolutionary origin of MRPL35, along with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, suggests a common eubacterial ancestry, highlighting its fundamental role in cellular function (O’Brien2003Properties). Despite its critical involvement in mitochondrial translation, specific functional details about MRPL35 in healthy human cells are not extensively documented in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MRPL35 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MRPL35 is overexpressed, correlating with advanced stages and metastasis. Knockdown of MRPL35 in NSCLC cells leads to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. This effect is mediated through the activation of the p53 signaling pathway and downregulation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, such as CDK1, BIRC5, and CHEK1 (Zhao2023Knockdown; Bacon2024Mitochondrial).

In colorectal cancer, high MRPL35 expression is associated with poor survival outcomes. Its downregulation results in increased reactive oxygen species production, leading to DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis (Bacon2024Mitochondrial; Bao2022Potential). Similarly, in gastric cancer, MRPL35 is linked to metastasis and advanced stages, with knockdown inhibiting tumor formation and promoting apoptosis (Bacon2024Mitochondrial).

Beyond cancer, MRPL35 has been identified as a potential target in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, highlighting its broader clinical significance in mitochondrial dysfunction-related conditions (Rasooly2024Largescale).

## Interactions
MRPL35, a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for mitochondrial function. It is part of the central protuberance of the large mitoribosomal subunit and interacts with proteins such as Mrp7, MrpL36, MrpL7, MrpL17, and MrpL28, forming a subcomplex essential for the assembly of the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) complex (Box2017MrpL35). A mutation at the Y275 residue of MRPL35 affects its interaction with COX assembly chaperones, Coa3 and Cox14, disrupting the assembly of Coa3-COA complexes and leading to a defective COX-assembly phenotype (Box2017MrpL35). This mutation also reduces the co-purification of Mrp7 with MRPL35, indicating a disruption in their association and affecting the stability of Mrp7 (Box2017MrpL35).

MRPL35's interactions extend to its role in coordinating the synthesis of the Cox1 subunit with its assembly into the COX enzyme, involving proteins Cox14 and Coa3 (Box2017MrpL35). These interactions are vital for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the COX complex, particularly under stress conditions (Box2017MrpL35).
