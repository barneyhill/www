# B3GNT7

## Overview
The B3GNT7 gene encodes the enzyme UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 7, a glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of keratan sulfate, a type of glycosaminoglycan. This enzyme is crucial for the elongation of keratan sulfate chains by adding N-acetylglucosamine residues, which is essential for the structural integrity of tissues such as the cornea and the extracellular matrix in the brain (Littlechild2018Keratan; TakedaUchimura2022Beta3GnT7). B3GNT7 also plays a significant role in the regulation of mucin O-glycosylation in the intestinal mucosa, impacting the mucosal barrier's integrity, particularly under inflammatory conditions like ulcerative colitis (Wang2024B3GNT7). Additionally, the enzyme is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its role in glycan synthesis within the Golgi apparatus (Mkhikian2016Golgi). Alterations in B3GNT7 expression have been linked to various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Wang2024B3GNT7; Pucci2022Glycosyltransferases).

## Function
The B3GNT7 gene encodes the enzyme β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-7, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of keratan sulfate (KS), a glycosaminoglycan involved in maintaining the structural integrity of various tissues. This enzyme is responsible for the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to the non-reducing terminus of the growing KS chain, a necessary step for KS elongation. This process is essential for the proper formation of KS proteoglycans, which are important for maintaining corneal transparency and function (Littlechild2018Keratan).

In the adult brain, B3GNT7 is expressed in oligodendrocyte precursor cells and oligodendrocytes, where it contributes to the synthesis of KS-modified proteoglycans, such as Ptprz1/phosphacan, which are components of the perineuronal net. This suggests a role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix, potentially influencing synaptic plasticity and axonal regrowth (TakedaUchimura2022Beta3GnT7).

B3GNT7 is also involved in the regulation of mucin O-glycosylation in the intestinal mucosa, which is critical for maintaining the integrity and function of the colonic mucosal barrier. This function is particularly important in the context of inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis (Wang2024B3GNT7).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the B3GNT7 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of ulcerative colitis (UC), B3GNT7 expression is significantly reduced in patients compared to non-IBD controls. This reduction is particularly notable during moderate to severe stages of UC, correlating negatively with the endoscopic severity of the disease. The gene's involvement in mucin O-glycosylation suggests that its decreased expression may compromise the mucin barrier, exacerbating colonic inflammation (Wang2024B3GNT7).

In the field of oncology, B3GNT7 has been associated with cancer prognosis. While it plays a tumor-suppressive role in colon cancer by promoting Lewis antigen expression, its expression is linked to a worse prognosis in various cancer cohorts, although not specifically in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) (Pucci2022Glycosyltransferases). In brain lower grade glioma (LGG), B3GNT7 is identified as having a very high prognostic value, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Pucci2022Glycosyltransferases).

In the cornea, the absence of B3GNT7 leads to structural abnormalities similar to those seen in macular corneal dystrophy, due to its critical role in keratan sulfate proteoglycan synthesis (Littlechild2018Keratan).

## Interactions
B3GNT7 is involved in several significant protein interactions, particularly with members of the mucin MUC family, including MUC2, MUC3, and MUC6. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of mucin glycosylation, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the mucosal barrier in the colon. The protein-protein interaction network analysis has demonstrated a strong interaction between B3GNT7 and these mucins, suggesting its role in the biosynthesis of mucin-type O-glycans. This process is vital for modulating inflammatory responses in the colon, and the expression of B3GNT7 is notably decreased in inflammatory colonic tissue, correlating with the severity of ulcerative colitis (Wang2024B3GNT7).

In the context of glycan synthesis, B3GNT7 is part of a self-correcting mechanism in the Golgi apparatus that maintains cellular homeostasis. It synthesizes bioequivalent poly-LacNAc containing glycans, compensating for the loss of LacNAc branches and maintaining cell surface LacNAc density. This process involves interactions with other glycosylation enzymes and is crucial for preserving the galectin-glycoprotein lattice, which is important for immune homeostasis (Mkhikian2016Golgi).
