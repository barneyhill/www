# TSR2

## Overview
TSR2 is a gene that encodes the TSR2 ribosome maturation factor, a protein integral to the assembly and function of the 40S ribosomal subunit. This protein is categorized as a ribosome maturation factor and plays a pivotal role in the nuclear import and assembly of ribosomal proteins, particularly eS26, facilitating their proper integration into the ribosome. The TSR2 protein is characterized by a structured N-terminal domain and a flexible C-terminal tail, which are essential for its interactions and functions in ribosome assembly. Mutations in the TSR2 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including Diamond-Blackfan Anemia, due to their impact on ribosomal protein binding and maturation processes (Schütz2018Molecular; Gripp2014Diamond–Blackfan). Additionally, TSR2 has been studied for its potential role in cancer therapy, particularly in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, where its expression levels are altered (He2017TSR2).

## Structure
The TSR2 ribosome maturation factor is a protein involved in the assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Its molecular structure includes a well-defined N-terminal domain (Tsr2-N) composed of six α-helices and a small anti-parallel β-sheet. This domain is crucial for its interaction with the ribosomal protein eS26 (Schütz2018Molecular). The C-terminal tail of TSR2 is described as conformationally mobile and lacks a defined secondary structure, which allows it to prevent eS26 aggregation by keeping it RNA-free (Schütz2018Molecular).

The interaction between TSR2 and eS26 involves specific regions of TSR2, such as helix α3, the C-terminal part of helix α4, and the loop between helices α4 and α5, which are important for binding eS26 (Schütz2018Molecular). The TSR2 protein does not stably associate with pre-ribosomal particles, indicating its role is more transient in the ribosome assembly process (Schütz2014A).

Mutations in TSR2, such as the E64G mutation, have been linked to Diamond-Blackfan anemia, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity for proper ribosomal function (Schütz2018Molecular). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its function in ribosome maturation.

## Function
The TSR2 gene encodes a ribosome maturation factor that plays a critical role in the assembly and function of the 40S ribosomal subunit. In healthy human cells, TSR2 is involved in the nuclear import and assembly of the ribosomal protein eS26, facilitating a RanGTP-independent mechanism to dissociate eS26 from importins and form a stable complex with it. This complex prevents eS26 from proteolysis and aggregation, ensuring its safe transfer to the 90S pre-ribosome, which is essential for ribosome assembly (Schütz2018Molecular; Schütz2014A).

TSR2 also regulates the release and reincorporation of the ribosomal protein Rps26 from mature ribosomes, enabling a reversible ribosome-mediated response to stress. This process is crucial for maintaining the balance of Rps26-containing and Rps26-deficient ribosomes, which is important for cellular responses to environmental changes (Yang2021The).

Mutations in TSR2 can impair its ability to bind eS26, leading to defects in ribosome maturation and conditions such as Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (Schütz2018Molecular). TSR2's activity is primarily located in the nucleolus and cytoplasm, contributing to efficient protein synthesis and cellular growth.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TSR2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. One significant disorder linked to TSR2 mutations is Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA), a rare congenital anemia characterized by defective red blood cell production. Mutations in TSR2, such as the E64G mutation, impair its interaction with ribosomal protein eS26, which is crucial for ribosome assembly and function. This disruption can lead to DBA, as seen in cases with myelodysplastic features (MFD) and mandibulofacial dysostosis (Schütz2018Molecular; Gripp2014Diamond–Blackfan; Pelagiadis2023The).

In laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), TSR2 expression is significantly reduced compared to healthy tissues. Overexpression of TSR2 in LSCC cell lines has been shown to induce apoptosis by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (He2017TSR2).

Additionally, a mutation in TSR2 affecting the splice junction of exon 5 has been associated with hairless streaks in cattle, indicating its role in hair follicle formation and potential implications in similar human conditions (Murgiano2015Hairless). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of TSR2 in both hematological and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
TSR2 interacts with the ribosomal protein eS26, playing a crucial role in ribosome assembly. TSR2 binds directly to eS26, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid analysis and in vitro binding studies, facilitating the transfer of eS26 to the 90S pre-ribosome (Schütz2014A). This interaction is essential for the cytoplasmic processing of 20S pre-rRNA to mature 18S rRNA, as depletion of eS26 leads to the accumulation of immature 20S pre-rRNA and reduced levels of free 40S subunits (Schütz2014A).

TSR2 also functions in the disassembly of the importin:eS26 complex, extracting eS26 from importins like Kap123, Pse1, and Kap104 in a RanGTP-independent manner. This process is specific to eS26, as TSR2 does not dissociate other importin:r-protein complexes (Schütz2014A). The interaction between TSR2 and eS26 involves distinct binding sites, with TSR2's C-terminal acidic tail preventing eS26 from aggregating by keeping it RNA-free (Schütz2018Molecular).

Mutations in TSR2, such as the DBA-linked hTsr2E64G, impair its ability to bind eS26, leading to growth defects and accumulation of immature 20S pre-rRNA (Schütz2018Molecular). Overexpression of eS26 can rescue these defects, underscoring the importance of TSR2:eS26 interactions (Schütz2018Molecular).
