# IL17RE

## Overview
IL17RE is a gene that encodes the protein interleukin 17 receptor E, a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed on epithelial cells and Th17 cells. This receptor is a critical component of the immune system, playing a significant role in mediating inflammatory responses. It forms a receptor complex with IL-17RA to bind the cytokine IL-17C, which is involved in activating downstream signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK. These pathways are essential for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides, contributing to the maintenance of mucosal barriers and epithelial integrity. IL17RE is also involved in the differentiation and function of Th17 cells, which are crucial for immune responses and are implicated in autoimmune diseases. The receptor's role in inflammatory pathways makes it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in conditions characterized by chronic inflammation, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (Chang2011Interleukin17C; Nies2020IL17CIL17RE:; Jiang2024Suppression).

## Function
IL17RE (interleukin 17 receptor E) is a receptor primarily expressed on epithelial cells and Th17 cells, playing a crucial role in immune system signaling. It forms a receptor complex with IL-17RA to bind IL-17C, a cytokine involved in inflammatory responses. This interaction activates downstream signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK, which are essential for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides (Nies2020IL17CIL17RE:; Song2016The).

In epithelial cells, IL17RE contributes to the maintenance of mucosal barriers and the integrity of epithelial tissues by enhancing the expression of tight-junction proteins and various cytokines and chemokines. This function is vital for host defense against bacterial, fungal, and viral infections (Nies2020IL17CIL17RE:).

In Th17 cells, IL17RE is involved in the differentiation and function of these cells, promoting the production of cytokines such as IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22. This signaling pathway is crucial for Th17 cell-mediated immune responses and is implicated in autoimmune diseases (Chang2011Interleukin17C). The receptor's activity in these cells highlights its role in both protective immunity and inflammatory pathology.

## Clinical Significance
IL17RE is implicated in various inflammatory skin conditions, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Alterations in IL17RE expression or function can contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases by facilitating a self-sustaining inflammatory feedback loop involving IL-17C and its receptor interactions with IL-17RA and IL-17RE. This loop promotes the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, exacerbating skin inflammation (Jiang2024Suppression). In mouse models, the absence of IL-17RE results in reduced skin inflammation, indicating its critical role in these conditions (Jiang2024Suppression).

The gene is also associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although the context does not directly link IL17RE to IBD, it highlights the involvement of IL17REL, a related gene, in the disease. This suggests that similar pathways might be involved in the pathogenesis of IBD, although further research is needed to clarify IL17RE's specific role (Sasaki2016Wholeexome).

Overall, IL17RE's involvement in inflammatory pathways makes it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in diseases characterized by chronic inflammation, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (Jiang2024Suppression).

## Interactions
IL17RE, a member of the interleukin-17 receptor family, primarily interacts with IL-17C to form a signaling complex crucial for immune responses. IL17RE specifically binds to IL-17C, and this interaction is facilitated through a heterodimeric receptor complex with IL-17RA. This complex is essential for the signaling pathway that leads to the production of IL-17A in Th17 cells, which are involved in autoimmune responses (Chang2011Interleukin17C; Nies2020IL17CIL17RE:).

The IL-17C-IL17RE interaction recruits the adaptor protein Act1, which is necessary for downstream signaling. Act1 binds to the SEFIR motif in IL17RE, suggesting a homotypic interaction that is critical for the signaling cascade. This interaction is confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments showing the association of IL-17RA and IL17RE to form a functional signaling complex (Chang2011Interleukin17C).

IL17RE is also involved in activating the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, which are important for inflammatory responses. These pathways are activated in epithelial cells and other cell types expressing high levels of IL17RE, such as keratinocytes (Nies2020IL17CIL17RE:; Song2016The).
