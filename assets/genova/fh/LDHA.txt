# LDHA

## Overview
Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is a gene that encodes the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase A, a crucial component of cellular metabolism. This enzyme is classified as an oxidoreductase and plays a pivotal role in the glycolytic pathway by catalyzing the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, thereby facilitating the regeneration of NAD+ from NADH. This process is essential for maintaining cellular redox balance, particularly under anaerobic conditions. LDHA is predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm but is also present in mitochondria and the nucleus, where it contributes to various cellular functions, including energy metabolism and protection against oxidative stress. The enzyme's activity is regulated through interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications, making it a significant focus in cancer research due to its overexpression in various tumors and its role in promoting tumor progression and immune evasion (Forkasiewicz2020The; Sharma2022Role; Lin2022Mutual).

## Structure
Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is a key enzyme involved in the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, a process crucial in glycolysis. The primary structure of LDHA consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function (Woodford2020Structural). The tertiary structure of LDHA is characterized by a three-dimensional conformation stabilized by interactions such as hydrogen bonds and disulfide bridges. LDHA contains a nucleotide-binding motif known as the Rossmann fold, essential for its function (Woodford2020Structural).

LDHA functions as a tetramer, representing its quaternary structure, and can form different isoenzymes through various subunit combinations. This tetrameric form is crucial for its enzymatic activity and regulation (Woodford2020Structural). The enzyme's active site is formed by a substrate-binding domain and a flexible loop that closes upon substrate binding, facilitating catalysis. Key residues involved in this process include Asp168, Arg171, Thr246, and His193, which are crucial for NADH binding and substrate coordination (Woodford2020Structural). Common post-translational modifications of LDHA include phosphorylation and acetylation, which can affect its activity and stability (Woodford2020Structural).

## Function
Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is a key enzyme in cellular metabolism, primarily involved in the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, a process that is crucial for regenerating NAD+ from NADH. This reaction is essential for maintaining the NADH/NAD+ ratio in the cytoplasm, which is critical for cellular redox balance and energy production, especially under anaerobic conditions (Forkasiewicz2020The; Lin2022Mutual). LDHA is predominantly located in the cytoplasm but is also found in mitochondria and, to a lesser extent, in the nucleus, where it participates in DNA duplication and transcription (Lin2022Mutual).

In healthy human cells, LDHA plays a significant role in regulating energy metabolism and protecting against oxidative damage by reducing the demand for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation, thereby minimizing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Lin2022Mutual). The enzyme's activity is crucial during hypoxic conditions to maintain energy production, allowing glycolysis to continue through the regeneration of NAD+ (Forkasiewicz2020The). LDHA also acts as a sensor of ROS accumulation, with its nuclear translocation being associated with protective responses against oxidative stress (Lin2022Mutual).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LDHA gene are significantly associated with various cancers. LDHA is often overexpressed in cancers such as pancreatic, breast, prostate, and gastric cancers, contributing to tumor progression, invasion, and immune evasion (Sharma2022Role). In pancreatic cancer, the c-Myc-LDHA axis is crucial for tumor progression, with high expression levels linked to larger tumor size and advanced stages, correlating with poor overall survival (He2015The). In prostate cancer, high LDHA expression is associated with decreased survival probability, and its regulation by the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway influences cancer progression (Ye2024Fibroblast).

LDHA's role in cancer is also linked to its involvement in immune evasion. It creates an acidic microenvironment through lactate production, inhibiting immune cell function and promoting immunosuppressive cells, which contributes to immune escape in tumors (Feng2018Lactate). LDHA inhibition has shown potential in reducing tumor growth and enhancing immune responses, particularly when combined with immunotherapies (Sharma2022Role).

LDHA's expression and activity are regulated by various transcription factors and post-translational modifications, which influence cancer cell metabolism and survival. These regulatory mechanisms highlight LDHA as a potential target for cancer therapy (Feng2018Lactate; Urbańska2019Unappreciated).

## Interactions
Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function and regulation. LDHA interacts with the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HULC, which enhances its binding with fibroblast growth factor receptor type 1 (FGFR1). This interaction increases the phosphorylation of LDHA, promoting aerobic glycolysis, a process crucial for cancer cell metabolism and growth (Wang2020Interactome). HULC specifically binds to LDHA, but not to LDHB, and this interaction is quantified with a dissociation constant (K_d) of 2.898 × 10^-8 M (Wang2020Interactome).

LDHA also interacts with polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phosphatidic acids (PUFA-PA), such as 18:0/20:4-PA and 18:0/22:6-PA. These interactions induce secondary structural changes in LDHA, reducing its α-helix and β-sheet content, which leads to a decrease in its enzymatic activity (Hoshino2020Polyunsaturated). The binding of these PA species to LDHA is specific and does not occur with other phospholipids like phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylserine (Hoshino2020Polyunsaturated). These interactions highlight the role of LDHA in cellular metabolism and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in cancer.
