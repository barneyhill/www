# FAM117B

## Overview
FAM117B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 117 member B. This protein is primarily involved in cellular processes such as translation, RNA splicing, and mitochondrial ribosomal activity, largely through its interaction with the DYRK1A kinase (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization). FAM117B is expressed in various brain cell types, including astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes, indicating its potential role in neurological functions (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization). The protein is predominantly cytoplasmic, aligning with its involvement in translation and splicing activities (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization). Additionally, FAM117B has been implicated in several diseases, including gastric cancer and lacunar stroke, due to its role in key signaling pathways and genetic expression patterns (Traylor2021Genetic; Zhou2023FAM117B). Despite these associations, further research is necessary to fully elucidate the biochemical and functional characteristics of FAM117B in human health and disease (Ananthapadmanabhan2023Insights).

## Function
FAM117B is a protein that interacts with the DYRK1A kinase, suggesting its involvement in several cellular processes. It is phosphorylated by DYRK1A, which may regulate its functions in translation, RNA splicing, and mitochondrial ribosomal activity (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization). Proteomic analysis has identified FAM117B as part of a network involving proteins related to the splicing machinery, ribosomal proteins, and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, indicating its potential roles in these areas (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization).

FAM117B is expressed in various brain cell types, including astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes, suggesting a role in neurological processes (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization). Its interaction with DYRK1A implies that FAM117B might influence or depend on DYRK1A's function in neurological conditions (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization). The protein is primarily cytoplasmic, which aligns with its involvement in translation and splicing activities (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization).

Despite these insights, the specific biochemical and functional characterization of FAM117B in healthy human cells remains limited, highlighting a need for further research to elucidate its precise roles and mechanisms (Ananthapadmanabhan2023Insights).

## Clinical Significance
FAM117B has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In gastric cancer, FAM117B is overexpressed and contributes to tumor growth and chemoresistance by interacting with the KEAP1/NRF2 signaling pathway. It competes with NRF2 for binding to KEAP1, reducing NRF2 degradation and activating the pathway, which is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy (Zhou2023FAM117B). 

FAM117B is also associated with lacunar stroke, where genetically elevated expression of the gene has been linked to the condition. This association was confirmed through colocalization analysis, suggesting a consistent relationship between FAM117B expression and lacunar stroke (Traylor2021Genetic). 

In the context of cardiovascular disease, FAM117B has been identified as a candidate gene through chromatin organization annotation, although it remains poorly studied in this area (Haitjema2017Additional). 

These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of FAM117B in various diseases, suggesting that alterations in its expression or interactions could serve as targets for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
FAM117B is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. In gastric cancer, FAM117B interacts with the KEAP1/NRF2 signaling pathway. It binds to the DGR domain of KEAP1 through its ETGE motif, competing with NRF2 for KEAP1 binding. This interaction inhibits the ubiquitination and degradation of NRF2, leading to increased NRF2 protein levels and activation of its target genes, which promotes cancer cell growth and chemoresistance (Zhou2023FAM117B).

FAM117B also interacts with DYRK1A, a protein kinase involved in various cellular functions. This interaction was confirmed through reciprocal immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments. FAM117B is suggested to interact with DYRK1A independently, without forming large multisubunit complexes, although it shares some common interactors like DCAF7, which may act as a scaffold protein (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization; ananthapadmanabhan2015understanding).

Proteomic analyses have identified FAM117B's interactions with proteins involved in splicing, translation, and mitochondrial functions, such as SRSF2, RPS15, and MRPS31. These interactions suggest potential roles in translation processes and mitochondrial ribosomal function (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization). The phosphorylation of FAM117B by DYRK1A may regulate these interactions, although further research is needed to elucidate these mechanisms.
