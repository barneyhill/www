# HOXA13

## Overview
The HOXA13 gene is a member of the homeobox gene family, which encodes transcription factors critical for regulating developmental processes. The protein encoded by HOXA13, homeobox A13, is characterized by its homeodomain, a DNA-binding motif that allows it to regulate the expression of target genes involved in embryonic development and tissue differentiation. As a transcription factor, homeobox A13 plays a pivotal role in the regionalization of the myometrium during pregnancy and is involved in various signaling pathways that influence cell adhesion, immune response, and contractility. Mutations in HOXA13 are linked to congenital disorders such as Hand-foot-genital syndrome and Guttmacher syndrome, highlighting its importance in normal developmental processes (Innis2002AHOXA13; Liu2015HoxA13; Utsch2002A).

## Structure
The HOXA13 protein is characterized by a DNA-binding domain (A13DBD) that has been structurally analyzed using NMR spectroscopy. The A13DBD forms a dimer that binds to an 11-mer DNA duplex with high affinity, exhibiting a dissociation constant of 7.5 nM (Zhang2011Structural). The protein's main chain adopts a canonical homeodomain fold, consisting of three alpha-helices: a1 (residues 329-341), a2 (residues 347-356), and a3 (residues 362-379). The first two helices form an antiparallel helical hairpin, stabilized by electrostatic salt bridges between E334/R352 and E338/R350 (Zhang2011Structural).

The N-terminal arm (residues 324-329) of the A13DBD interacts with the DNA minor groove, while the C-terminal helix (residues 362-382) contacts the major groove, specifically recognizing the ATAA nucleotide sequence (Zhang2011Structural). Key residues such as V373 are critical for DNA recognition, forming hydrophobic contacts with pyrimidine methyl groups (Zhang2011Structural). The dimerization of HOXA13 is crucial for its function, facilitating multivalent DNA contacts and transcriptional activation (Zhang2011Structural).

Mutations in key residues, such as F344, can weaken dimerization and reduce transcriptional activity, highlighting the importance of specific residues in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the protein (Zhang2011Structural). The atomic coordinates of the NMR-derived structure have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Databank under accession number 2l7z (Zhang2011Structural).

## Function
The HOXA13 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regionalization of the human myometrium during pregnancy. It is highly expressed in the lower uterine segment (LUS) of the myometrium, where it regulates the transcription of genes such as prostacyclin synthase (PTGIS) and periostin (POSTN). These genes are crucial for maintaining the contractile phenotype of the LUS myometrium before term labor, contributing to the resistance against mechanical stretch and preventing fetal descent (Liu2015HoxA13).

HOXA13 influences multiple signaling pathways in myometrial cells, including those related to cell surface receptor-mediated signaling, extracellular matrix-related wounding response, cell adhesion, immune response, and cell motion. It enhances myometrial cell contractility and adhesion, which are essential for maintaining pregnancy (Liu2015HoxA13). The gene's expression is spatially and temporally regulated during embryonic development, and its differential expression between the fundal and LUS myometrium is crucial for the functional differentiation of the uterus during pregnancy (Liu2015HoxA13).

Mutations in HOXA13 can lead to developmental abnormalities, underscoring its critical role in normal cellular function and tissue patterning (Liu2015HoxA13).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HOXA13 gene are associated with several congenital syndromes, primarily Hand-foot-genital syndrome (HFGS) and Guttmacher syndrome. HFGS is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by malformations of the distal limbs and genitourinary tract. Common features include short thumbs, clinodactyly of the fifth finger, and urogenital anomalies such as hypospadias and bicornuate uterus. These phenotypes are often linked to polyalanine expansions in the HOXA13 gene, which can lead to haploinsufficiency and affect protein-protein interactions crucial for normal development (Frisen2003A; Yokoyama20177p15; Utsch2002A).

Guttmacher syndrome, also associated with HOXA13 mutations, shares some features with HFGS but includes additional anomalies like postaxial polydactyly and absent nails. This condition is linked to a missense mutation in the HOXA13 homeobox, which likely alters the gene's DNA-binding properties, resulting in both loss and gain of function (Innis2002AHOXA13; Yokoyama20177p15).

Alterations in HOXA13 expression can also contribute to certain cancers, such as leukemia, by disrupting normal cell differentiation and proliferation, although specific mechanisms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Interactions
HOXA13 is known to participate in several physical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, which are crucial for its function as a transcription factor. It can form dimers, which are essential for its role in transcriptional activation. The dimerization of HOXA13 allows it to bind symmetrically to DNA, facilitating multivalent contacts that can bend the DNA duplex and influence transcription (Zhang2011Structural). Specific residues, such as R337, K343, and F344, are critical for this dimerization, with mutations at these sites significantly reducing transcriptional activity (Zhang2011Structural).

HOXA13 also interacts with Smad proteins, specifically the MH2 domain of Smad5, Smad1, and Smad2, but not Smad4. These interactions are specific to group 13 HOX proteins and do not require DNA-binding capability, suggesting a mechanism of repression that involves protein-protein interactions rather than direct DNA binding (Williams2005Group). HOXA13 can modulate Smad transcriptional activation functions, potentially interfering with the recruitment of co-activators or the interaction with the basal transcription complex (Williams2005Group).

Additionally, HOXA13 directly binds to DNA regions upstream of the Bmp2 and Bmp7 genes, acting as an enhancer of gene expression. This binding is specific to sequences containing a HOX-specific TAAT nucleotide core (Knosp2004HOXA13).
