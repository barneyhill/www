# RHBDL3

## Overview
RHBDL3 is a gene that encodes the protein rhomboid-like 3, which is a member of the rhomboid family of intramembrane serine proteases. These proteins are characterized by their ability to cleave other proteins within the membrane, a process that is crucial for various cellular functions, including signaling and regulation of protein activity. Rhomboid-like 3 is involved in the proteolytic processing of membrane-bound substrates, which can influence pathways related to cell communication and development. The precise biological roles and mechanisms of RHBDL3 and its encoded protein are still under investigation, but they are believed to play significant roles in cellular homeostasis and possibly in disease processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
