# OPHN1

## Overview
The OPHN1 gene encodes the protein oligophrenin 1, a Rho-GTPase-activating protein (Rho-GAP) that plays a pivotal role in neuronal development and synaptic function. Oligophrenin 1 is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining synaptic structure and function. The protein is characterized by several domains, including a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a RhoGAP domain, which collectively facilitate its interactions with membranes and small GTPases. These interactions are essential for synaptic plasticity, particularly in stabilizing AMPA receptors at excitatory synapses. Mutations in the OPHN1 gene are linked to X-linked intellectual disability and other neurological disorders, underscoring its significance in cognitive processes and neuronal connectivity (Nadif2009The; Bergmann2003Oligophrenin).

## Structure
The OPHN1 (oligophrenin 1) protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. It contains an N-terminal Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a central RhoGAP domain. The BAR domain, spanning amino acids 19-225, is involved in membrane binding and curvature induction, and it forms dimers that interact with membranes and small GTPases (SantosRebouças2013A; Pirozzi2011Insertion). This domain is composed of four alpha helices, with the fourth helix adopting a coiled-coil conformation, suggesting interaction with another protein interface (Pirozzi2011Insertion).

The PH domain, located between amino acids 265-370, interacts with phosphoinositides, conferring membrane-binding specificity (SantosRebouças2013A). The RhoGAP domain, spanning amino acids 380-572, regulates RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 by stimulating the GTPase activity of these small G proteins (SantosRebouças2013A; Billuart1998Oligophrenin1). At the C-terminus, OPHN1 contains three proline-rich regions that serve as putative SH3-binding sites for endocytic adaptor proteins (SantosRebouças2013A).

The protein's structure allows it to regulate cell adhesion, spreading, and cytoskeletal organization, primarily through its interaction with RhoA and Rac1 (Elvers2012The). The BAR domain's interaction with the GAP domain inhibits its activity and guides OPHN1 to the plasma membrane to interact with active RhoGTPases (SantosRebouças2013A).

## Function
The OPHN1 gene encodes a Rho-GTPase-activating protein (Rho-GAP) that plays a critical role in synaptic function and neuronal development by regulating the actin cytoskeleton. In healthy human cells, OPHN1 is essential for the maturation and plasticity of excitatory synapses, particularly by stabilizing AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which are crucial for fast excitatory neurotransmission (Nadif2009The). OPHN1 is highly expressed in neurons across major brain regions, including the hippocampus and cortex, and is present in both axons and dendrites (Nadif2009The).

The protein's Rho-GAP activity is vital for maintaining synaptic structure and function, as it regulates the actin cytoskeleton, influencing dendritic spine morphology and synaptic strength (Nadif2009The). OPHN1 is recruited to dendritic spines by synaptic activity, particularly through NMDA receptor activation, where it forms complexes with AMPARs, modulating RhoA and Rho-kinase activities to stabilize AMPARs and maintain spine structure (Nadif2009The). This stabilization prevents the endocytosis of AMPARs, ensuring their presence on the cell surface, which is essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Nadif2009The). OPHN1's function is crucial for the development of excitatory circuits, supporting cognitive processes such as learning and memory (Nadif2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OPHN1 gene are associated with a range of neurological and developmental disorders, primarily X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). These mutations can lead to conditions such as cerebellar hypoplasia, epilepsy, hypotonia, and strabismus. Affected individuals often exhibit facial dysmorphisms, including deep-set eyes, infraorbital creases, and a prominent chin (Larson2014Exonic; Bergmann2003Oligophrenin). MRI findings in patients with OPHN1 mutations frequently reveal cerebellar vermian hypoplasia, malformations of the cerebellar hemispheres, and caudate atrophy (Larson2014Exonic).

The clinical presentation of OPHN1 mutations is variable, with some individuals showing mild to moderate intellectual disability, seizures, and ventriculomegaly, while others may have more severe symptoms (Moortgat2018Expanding). The variability in phenotypic expression, particularly in females, may be influenced by X chromosome inactivation patterns (Moortgat2018Expanding). In some cases, OPHN1 mutations are associated with specific syndromic forms of XLID, characterized by cerebellar and facial abnormalities (Chabrol2005Delineation).

Mutations in OPHN1 can result from various genetic alterations, including deletions, insertions, and point mutations that disrupt the gene's functional domains, leading to impaired synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity (SantosRebouças2013A; Bergmann2003Oligophrenin).

## Interactions
Oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1) is a Rho-GTPase-activating protein that participates in various protein interactions critical for synaptic function and neuronal development. OPHN1 interacts with Endophilin A2/3, which is essential for mGluR-dependent long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of surface AMPA receptor (AMPAR) expression during synaptic plasticity (Nadif2011Rapid). OPHN1 also interacts with Homer1b/c, which is important for the positioning of endocytic zones near the postsynaptic density, affecting AMPAR recycling and synaptic potentiation (NakanoKobayashi2014The).

In neuroendocrine cells, OPHN1 interacts with endophilin A1, a BAR domain-containing protein involved in endocytosis, linking exocytosis to compensatory endocytosis (Houy2015Oligophrenin1). OPHN1 also interacts with Rev-erbα, a nuclear receptor involved in circadian clock regulation, affecting its localization and stability (Valnegri2011A). These interactions highlight OPHN1's role in synaptic vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, and synaptic plasticity, contributing to its function in cognitive processes and its association with intellectual disabilities.
