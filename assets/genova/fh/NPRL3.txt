# NPRL3

## Overview
NPRL3 is a gene that encodes a protein known as NPR3-like, GATOR1 complex subunit, which is a critical component of the GATOR1 complex involved in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. This protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and plays a significant role in cellular processes such as nutrient sensing, cell growth, and metabolism by inhibiting mTORC1 activity, particularly under conditions of nutrient deprivation (Iffland2020NPRL3:; Iffland2018DEPDC5). Structurally, NPRL3 contains an N-terminal Longin domain that facilitates its interaction with NPRL2, another subunit of the GATOR1 complex, forming a heterodimer essential for the complex's function (Shen2018Architecture). Mutations in the NPRL3 gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders, including familial focal epilepsy and malformations of cortical development, underscoring its importance in normal brain function and development (Hu2023Identification; Sim2015Familial).

## Structure
NPRL3 is a subunit of the GATOR1 complex, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. The protein structure of NPRL3 includes an N-terminal Longin domain (NLD), which forms a heterodimer with the NLD of NPRL2, another subunit of the GATOR1 complex (Shen2018Architecture). This interaction is essential for the assembly and function of the GATOR1 complex, as the C-terminal domains of NPRL2 and NPRL3 create a large contact surface that reinforces their interaction (Shen2018Architecture).

NPRL3 is also involved in the interaction with GATOR2, indicating its role in nutrient sensing and signaling pathways (Shen2018Architecture). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could influence its function and interactions. Variants of NPRL3 can arise from alternative splicing, potentially affecting its structural and functional properties.

The structural determination of the GATOR1 complex, including NPRL3, was achieved using cryo-electron microscopy, which provided insights into its architecture and interaction with Rag GTPases (Shen2018Architecture). However, specific details about the molecular structure of NPRL3, such as its secondary and tertiary structures, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The NPRL3 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the GATOR1 complex, which also includes NPRL2 and DEPDC5. This complex functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) towards the Rags complex, playing a crucial role in negatively regulating the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, NPRL3 helps inhibit mTORC1 activity, particularly during nutrient deprivation, by preventing the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, which is necessary for its activation (Iffland2020NPRL3:; Iffland2018DEPDC5).

The mTORC1 pathway is a master regulator of cell growth, metabolism, and proliferation. By modulating this pathway, NPRL3 influences various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, autophagy, and cell size regulation. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it helps maintain cellular homeostasis by responding to amino acid availability (Iffland2018DEPDC5; Bertuzzi2020A).

Mutations in NPRL3 can lead to dysregulation of mTORC1, resulting in conditions such as familial focal epilepsy and malformations of cortical development, highlighting its importance in normal brain development and function (Hu2023Identification; Sim2015Familial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NPRL3 gene, a component of the GATOR1 complex, are associated with various forms of epilepsy, particularly focal epilepsy. These mutations can lead to the dysregulation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for brain development and function. NPRL3-related epilepsy often presents as focal epilepsy, including frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) and sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE), with some cases exhibiting drug-resistant epilepsy (Zhang2023Clinical). 

The pathogenic variants in NPRL3 include frameshift, nonsense, and missense mutations, as well as exon deletions. These mutations can result in a loss of function of the GATOR1 complex, leading to abnormal enhancement of the mTOR signaling pathway (Zhang2023Clinical). The clinical spectrum of NPRL3-related epilepsy is broad, with onset ranging from infancy to adulthood, and includes conditions such as familial focal epilepsy with variable foci (FFEVF) (Hu2023Identification; Li2021A).

NPRL3 mutations are also linked to focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and other brain abnormalities, although not all patients exhibit structural brain changes. The incomplete penetrance of epilepsy in NPRL3 mutation carriers suggests that additional genetic or environmental factors may influence the clinical phenotype (Hu2023Identification; Zhang2023Clinical).

## Interactions
NPRL3 is a component of the GATOR1 complex, which also includes DEPDC5 and NPRL2. This complex plays a crucial role in negatively regulating the mTORC1 signaling pathway. NPRL3 interacts with NPRL2 to form a heterodimer, which is essential for the inhibitory function of GATOR1 on mTORC1 activity. The interaction between NPRL3 and NPRL2 is facilitated by their similar domain organizations, including the N-terminal Longin domain and the C-terminal domains that form a vast contact surface, reinforcing their interaction (Shen2018Architecture).

NPRL3 also interacts with DEPDC5, which directly contacts RagA and NPRL2. This interaction is crucial for the formation of an intact GATOR1 complex, necessary for the regulation of mTORC1 signaling (Shen2018Architecture). The GATOR1 complex, including NPRL3, acts as a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) for RagA, a component of the Rag GTPases that signal nutrient availability to mTORC1 (Shen2018Architecture).

In Drosophila, NPRL3 interacts with FKBP39, which promotes the degradation of NPRL3, thereby influencing TORC1 activity. This interaction is nutrient-dependent, with FKBP39 reducing NPRL3 levels to maintain TORC1 activity under nutrient-rich conditions (Zhou2021FKBP39).
