# OR2T12

## Overview
The OR2T12 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily T member 12, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules, facilitating the sense of smell by initiating signal transduction pathways in the olfactory epithelium (Connor2018The). Beyond its primary function in olfaction, OR2T12 has been associated with various biological processes and conditions, including major depressive disorder and acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting potential roles in neurological and hematological contexts (Wong2016The; Ahn2019Remission). The protein's involvement in these diverse physiological and pathological processes highlights its significance in both sensory and non-sensory functions, warranting further investigation into its broader biological roles.

## Function
OR2T12 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules and initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR2T12 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Connor2018The).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR2T12 has been implicated in other biological processes. A genome-wide association study identified significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in OR2T12 and major depressive disorder (MDD) in a Mexican-American cohort. This suggests that OR2T12 may have functions beyond olfaction, potentially influencing neurological or psychological conditions (Wong2016The).

While the primary function of OR2T12 in healthy human cells is related to olfactory perception, its involvement in other physiological processes remains an area of active research. The exact mechanisms by which OR2T12 might influence non-olfactory functions are not yet fully understood.

## Clinical Significance
The OR2T12 gene has been implicated in several conditions through genetic studies. In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted on a Mexican-American cohort, a significant association was found between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the OR2T12 gene and major depressive disorder (MDD). This SNP, located on chromosome 1, exhibited a major allele 'T' and a minor allele frequency of 0.30 in cases compared to 0.07 in controls, with a highly significant P-value of 4.39E-20, suggesting a potential role in the genetic predisposition to MDD (Wong2016The).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the OR2T12 gene was identified as part of a leukemic clone in a study examining clonal dynamics over a nine-year period. Although the specific role of OR2T12 in AML is not detailed, its presence in the leukemic clone indicates it may be involved in the disease's progression or relapse (Ahn2019Remission).

Additionally, a study on medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) identified a missense variant in the OR2T12 gene, though the study did not elaborate on its specific clinical implications (Kim2022Identification).
