# VCF2

## Overview
VCF2 is a gene that encodes the protein VCP nuclear cofactor family member 2, which is a member of the FAM104 protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the nuclear localization of the ATPase p97, also known as VCP, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as DNA replication and DNA damage repair. VCF2 facilitates the nuclear import of p97 through a non-canonical helical motif, specifically interacting with the N domain of p97 via a conserved C-terminal alpha-helix. This interaction is essential for the formation of the p97-UFD1-NPL4 complex, which plays a significant role in maintaining genome integrity and cellular homeostasis. The protein's function underscores its importance in cellular responses to stress and damage, as well as in the regulation of protein and organelle homeostasis (Körner2023The).

## Structure
The VCF2 protein, a member of the FAM104 family, is characterized by its interaction with the p97 protein, facilitated by a highly conserved C-terminal alpha-helical structure. This alpha-helix is crucial for binding to the N domain of p97, involving a hydrophobic pocket and a hydrogen bonding network (Körner2023The). The C-terminal region contains conserved residues, such as N188 and L191, which are essential for this interaction, and mutations in these residues disrupt binding (Körner2023The).

VCF2 is expressed in multiple isoforms, with isoforms 1, 2, and 5 containing the p97-interacting C-terminal helix (Körner2023The). These isoforms exhibit sequence homology, suggesting evolutionary conservation (Körner2023The). The protein also features a classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS) near the N-terminus, which is important for its nuclear accumulation and function in promoting the nuclear localization of p97 (Körner2023The).

While the study provides insights into the interaction of VCF2 with p97, it does not offer a detailed molecular structure of VCF2 alone (Körner2023The).

## Function
VCF2, a member of the FAM104 protein family, plays a crucial role in the nuclear localization of the ATPase p97, also known as VCP. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA replication and DNA damage repair, which are essential for maintaining genome integrity and cellular homeostasis (Körner2023The). VCF2 interacts directly with p97 through a non-canonical helical motif, facilitating its nuclear import. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal alpha-helix of VCF2 and the N domain of p97, highlighting the importance of specific conserved residues within VCF2 for binding (Körner2023The).

In healthy human cells, VCF2 is part of the p97-UFD1-NPL4 complex, which is implicated in nuclear functions such as DNA damage repair and transcription regulation (Körner2023The). The presence of VCF2 is critical for the proper functioning of p97, as its loss leads to reduced nuclear levels of p97, impaired cell growth, and increased sensitivity to p97 inhibition (Körner2023The). VCF2's role in promoting the nuclear localization of p97 underscores its significance in maintaining protein and organelle homeostasis, as well as ensuring efficient cellular responses to stress and damage (Körner2023The).

## Interactions
VCF2, a member of the FAM104 protein family, interacts with the p97 protein, also known as VCP, through a highly conserved C-terminal alpha-helix. This interaction is crucial for the nuclear localization of p97. VCF2 forms complexes with p97-UFD1-NPL4 and p97-UBXN2B, but not with all p97 complexes, indicating specificity in its interactions (Körner2023The). The binding of VCF2 to p97 is mediated by the N domain of p97, which is necessary and sufficient for this interaction. The C-terminal region of VCF2, particularly a conserved alpha-helical region, is essential for binding, as deletions in this region abolish the interaction (Körner2023The).

VCF2's interaction with p97 is implicated in nuclear functions such as DNA damage repair and regulation of DNA replication. The presence of a classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS) in VCF2 facilitates its nuclear accumulation, which in turn promotes the nuclear localization of p97 (Körner2023The). The study suggests that VCF2, along with VCF1, plays a significant role in modulating the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of p97, which is crucial for optimal p97 function, particularly under conditions of limited p97 activity (Körner2023The).
