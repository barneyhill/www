# SPMAP2

## Overview
SPMAP2 is a gene that encodes the sperm microtubule associated protein 2, which plays a crucial role in the structural organization and function of microtubules within sperm cells. This protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, which is essential for the stabilization and regulation of microtubule dynamics during spermatogenesis. The proper functioning of SPMAP2 is vital for the formation of the sperm tail, which is necessary for motility and successful fertilization. Mutations or dysregulation of the SPMAP2 gene can lead to defects in sperm motility, potentially resulting in male infertility (Qiu2020aarFDC).
