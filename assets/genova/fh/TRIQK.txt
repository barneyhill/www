# TRIQK

## Overview
The TRIQK gene encodes the protein known as triple QxxK/R motif containing, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of a specific motif, the QxxK/R motif, which is implicated in protein-protein interactions and may play a role in cellular signaling pathways. Although the precise biological functions of TRIQK are still under investigation, it is believed to be involved in the regulation of gene expression and cellular differentiation. The protein's interactions and potential involvement in signaling pathways suggest it may have significant implications in understanding certain diseases and developmental processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
