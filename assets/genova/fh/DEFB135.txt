# DEFB135

## Overview
DEFB135 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 135, which is part of the defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides play a crucial role in the innate immune system by providing a first line of defense against a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Defensin beta 135 is categorized as an antimicrobial peptide and is involved in disrupting the membrane integrity of microbial cells, thereby inhibiting their growth and proliferation. The expression of DEFB135 and its protein product is regulated by various factors, including microbial exposure and inflammatory cytokines, highlighting its importance in immune response modulation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
