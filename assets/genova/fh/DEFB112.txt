# DEFB112

## Overview
DEFB112 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 112, a member of the beta-defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are integral to the innate immune system, providing a primary defense mechanism against a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Defensin beta 112 is particularly noted for its role in the human reproductive system, where it is expressed in tissues such as the testis and epididymis. This expression suggests its involvement in critical reproductive processes, including spermatogenesis and sperm maturation. Additionally, DEFB112 contributes to mucosal immunity by enhancing cell adhesion and protecting epithelial surfaces from microbial invasion, underscoring its significance in both immune defense and reproductive health (Zheng2021A).

## Function
Defensin beta 112 (DEFB112) is part of the beta-defensin family, which are antimicrobial peptides expressed in various tissues, including the reproductive tract. These peptides play crucial roles in innate immunity by providing a first line of defense against pathogens. DEFB112, like other beta-defensins, is involved in disrupting microbial membranes, thereby exhibiting antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses (Zheng2021A).

In the context of human reproductive biology, DEFB112 and other beta-defensins are implicated in processes such as sperm maturation and fertility. The absence of beta-defensins can lead to reduced sperm motility, although the precise mechanisms remain unclear (Zheng2021A). The study by Zheng et al. identified DEFB112 in the human testis and epididymis, suggesting its involvement in spermatogenesis and sperm maturation (Zheng2021A).

Beta-defensins, including DEFB112, are also known for their roles in cell adhesion and immune response, contributing to the maintenance of mucosal immunity by protecting epithelial surfaces from microbial invasion (Zheng2021A). These functions highlight the importance of DEFB112 in both local immune defense and reproductive health.
