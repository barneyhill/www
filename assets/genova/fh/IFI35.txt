# IFI35

## Overview
IFI35 is a gene that encodes the interferon-induced protein 35, a protein involved in immune response modulation. The protein is characterized by a leucine zipper motif, which facilitates dimerization and interaction with other proteins, categorizing it within the Bzip family of transcription factors (Li2021Transcriptional; Meyerdierks1999A). IFI35 is primarily induced by interferons and plays a critical role in regulating antiviral and inflammatory signaling pathways. It acts as a negative regulator of the RIG-I antiviral signaling pathway and influences the activity of key transcription factors such as IRF-3 and IRF-7, thereby modulating the host's immune response (Das2014InterferonInducible). The protein forms complexes with other proteins, such as Nmi, and is involved in various cellular processes, including the inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and migration (Jian2018Interferon‐induced). IFI35's interactions and regulatory functions make it significant in the context of autoimmune diseases and neuroinflammatory conditions, where its expression levels and interactions can influence disease progression and treatment outcomes (Das2015Trim21; Lang2022Expression).

## Structure
IFI35, also known as interferon-induced protein 35, is characterized by a leucine zipper motif at its N-terminus, which is a common feature in the Bzip family of transcription factors and facilitates protein dimerization (Li2021Transcriptional; Meyerdierks1999A). This motif consists of a periodic repetition of leucines or other hydrophobic residues forming a parallel, two-stranded, α-helical coil, which is known to mediate protein-protein interactions (Meyerdierks1999A). In humans, IFP35 forms homodimers and heterodimers, particularly with the Nmi protein, indicating its involvement in complex quaternary structures (Zhou2000Interferonα; Chen2000Interferoninducible).

The protein is involved in forming high molecular weight cytosolic complexes, with a molecular mass ranging from 200 to 440 kDa, suggesting its role in large protein aggregates (Zhou2000Interferonα; Meyerdierks1999A). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a crucial role in the function and interaction of IFP35, particularly in its association with Nmi, where dephosphorylation is necessary for complex formation (Zhou2000Interferonα). The protein also contains NID domains that interact with Nmi, influencing downstream signaling pathways (Li2021Transcriptional).

## Function
IFI35, or interferon-induced protein 35, plays a significant role in modulating immune signaling pathways, particularly those related to inflammation and antiviral responses. In healthy human cells, IFI35 is primarily induced by interferons and is involved in the regulation of the RIG-I antiviral signaling pathway. It acts as a negative regulator by promoting the proteasomal degradation of RIG-I through K48-linked ubiquitination, maintaining RIG-I in its phosphorylated, inactive form. This regulation helps modulate the host's innate immune response, preventing excessive antiviral activity that could be detrimental to the host (Das2014InterferonInducible).

IFI35 also influences the transcription and activation of key transcription factors such as IRF-3 and IRF-7, which are involved in the induction of IFNβ, a crucial component of the antiviral response. By suppressing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of these factors, IFI35 down-regulates the IFNβ promoter, thereby modulating the antiviral response (Das2014InterferonInducible).

In endothelial cells, IFI35 inhibits cell proliferation and migration by targeting the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, specifically by inhibiting the transcription and nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB. This activity is crucial for processes like re-endothelialization after vascular injury (Jian2018Interferon‐induced).

## Clinical Significance
IFI35 (interferon induced protein 35) is implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of autoimmune diseases, IFI35 is involved in the regulation of the innate antiviral response. Dysregulation of the Nmi-IFI35 complex, modulated by Trim21, can lead to excessive production of type-I interferons, contributing to conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (Das2015Trim21). 

In the central nervous system, IFI35 plays a role in neuroinflammatory conditions. Its expression is significantly upregulated in multiple sclerosis (MS), suggesting its potential as a predictor of disease outcome and treatment response (Lang2022Expression). The inverse correlation between IFI35 and GANAB expression in MS patients treated with interferon indicates that IFI35 may be involved in the disease's progression and response to therapy (De2021GANAB). 

IFI35 also appears to negatively regulate certain immune pathways in astrocytes, as RNA interference knockdown of IFI35 in these cells results in decreased expression of several immune response genes, highlighting its role in the innate immune response of astrocytes (Lang2022Expression).

## Interactions
IFI35, also known as interferon induced protein 35, is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in immune response modulation. IFI35 interacts with Nmi (N-myc and STAT interactor) to form a high molecular mass complex. This interaction stabilizes IFI35 by inhibiting its degradation through a proteasome-mediated pathway, and is crucial for the formation of the complex in various cell types, including Jurkat cells (Chen2000Interferoninducible). The Nmi-IFI35 complex is enhanced by interferon-alpha (IFN-α) treatment, which induces the formation of a heterodimeric complex that is associated with the dephosphorylation of IFP35 (Zhou2000Interferonα).

IFI35 also interacts with B-ATF, a member of the AP1 family of transcription factors. This interaction disrupts B-ATF:Jun heterodimers, forming non-DNA-binding B-ATF:IFI35 heterodimers, which may affect the expression of AP1 responsive genes (Wang1996IFP). Additionally, IFI35 interacts with Trim21 and Nmi, where Trim21 mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of Nmi, influencing the innate antiviral response (Das2015Trim21). IFI35 also interacts with STAT1 in IFN-stimulated cells, potentially reducing STAT1 transcriptional activity and downregulating the IFN response (Kerr2020Dynamic).
