# CTNNA3

## Overview
CTNNA3 is a gene that encodes the protein catenin alpha 3 (αT-catenin), which is a member of the catenin family involved in cell adhesion. This protein plays a critical role in the cadherin-catenin complex, linking cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton and facilitating cell-cell adhesion, thereby contributing to tissue morphogenesis and stability (Zhao2022Expression). αT-catenin is particularly significant in cardiac muscle cells, where it interacts with plakophilin-2 at intercalated discs, essential for cardiac function (Goossens2007A). The gene is also implicated in various clinical conditions, including laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, autism spectrum disorder, and dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its importance in both cellular function and disease (Bacchelli2014A; Singer2021Characterization; FanjulFernández2013Cell–cell; Hung2022Decreased).

## Structure
CTNNA3 encodes the αT-catenin protein, which is involved in cell adhesion and is part of the catenin family. The primary structure of αT-catenin consists of 895 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 100 kDa (Smith2011Alpha). The protein includes specific domains such as the vinculin homology domains, which are crucial for its function in cell adhesion and interaction with other proteins like β-catenin and actin filaments (Smith2011Alpha; Vite2015New).

The secondary structure of αT-catenin likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of catenin proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding necessary for its interaction with other proteins, such as plakophilin-2 at the intercalated disc in cardiomyocytes, which is essential for cardiac function (Chiarella2018αTcatenin:).

CTNNA3 also has splice variant isoforms, including alpha-T-catenin B (AT-B) and alpha-T-catenin X (AT-X). AT-X lacks the first six exons and the vinculin homology domain, resulting in a truncated protein that cannot restore cell adhesion in certain cell lines (Smith2011Alpha). These isoforms suggest tissue-specific roles, particularly in the testis and brain (Vite2015New).

## Function
CTNNA3, also known as α-T-catenin, is a protein that plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and maintaining the structural integrity of tissues. It is part of the cadherin-catenin complex, which links cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating cell-cell adhesion. This protein is active in the cytoplasm and at cell junctions, contributing to tissue morphogenesis and stability (Zhao2022Expression).

In the context of autophagy and YAP/TAZ signaling pathways, CTNNA3 is involved in regulating the localization and activity of YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivators. α-catenins, including CTNNA3, can sequester YAP/TAZ in the cytosol, inhibiting their activity. When autophagy is inhibited, α-catenins accumulate, leading to reduced YAP/TAZ activity, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Pavel2021αCatenin). Conversely, autophagy activation results in YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation and increased activity, highlighting the dynamic role of CTNNA3 in cellular signaling (Pavel2021Cell).

CTNNA3 is also essential for forming stretch-resistant cell-cell adhesion complexes, which are vital for tissue development during fetal life and the immune system. Its interactions with cadherin-binding partners such as β-catenin and γ-catenin are crucial for junction remodeling and assembly, particularly in the heart (Zhao2022Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CTNNA3 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, a type of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, CTNNA3 acts as a tumor suppressor. Mutations in this gene are found in approximately 15% of cases and are associated with increased tumor cell migration and invasion, leading to a poor prognosis (FanjulFernández2013Cell–cell).

In arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), decreased expression of αT-catenin, encoded by CTNNA3, is linked to the disease. This reduction affects the stability of desmosomal proteins, crucial for cardiac cell integrity, and is observed in more than half of ARVC patients (Hung2022Decreased).

CTNNA3 is also associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A compound heterozygous deletion in CTNNA3 has been identified in individuals with ASD, suggesting a role in neurodevelopmental disorders. This deletion leads to a frameshift and premature stop codon, potentially causing a loss of function (Bacchelli2014A).

Additionally, CTNNA3 alterations have been linked to dilated cardiomyopathy, where a 255-kb intragenic deletion was identified in a patient, indicating a potential role in cardiac diseases (Singer2021Characterization).

## Interactions
CTNNA3, encoding αT-catenin, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for cell adhesion and signaling. αT-catenin specifically interacts with plakophilin-2 (PKP2) in cardiac muscle cells, particularly at the intercalated discs. This interaction is mediated by a central domain of αT-catenin binding to the amino-terminal head domain of PKP2, which is the only plakophilin expressed in cardiomyocytes (Goossens2007A). This interaction is significant for recruiting desmosomal proteins to hybrid adhering junctions, forming a mixed-type, reinforced junction known as the area composita, which connects to both intermediate filaments and the actin cytoskeleton (Goossens2007A).

αT-catenin also interacts with other plakophilins such as PKP3 and PKP1, but not with other armadillo proteins like p0071, delta-catenin, p120ctn, or ARVCF. This specificity suggests a unique role for αT-catenin in strengthening cell-cell adhesion in contractile cells by forming hybrid adhering junctions that combine elements of classical desmosomes and adherens junctions (Goossens2007A). The interaction between αT-catenin and plakophilin-2 is crucial for maintaining the integrity of intercalated disc structures, which are essential for cardiac function (Hung2022Decreased).
