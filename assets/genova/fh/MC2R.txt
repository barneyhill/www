# MC2R

## Overview
The MC2R gene encodes the melanocortin 2 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in the adrenal cortex by mediating the effects of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) on steroidogenesis. This receptor is integral to the stress response, metabolism, and immune regulation through its involvement in the synthesis and secretion of glucocorticoids, such as cortisol. The MC2R protein is characterized by a seven transmembrane domain structure typical of GPCRs and requires the presence of accessory proteins, particularly melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein (MRAP), for proper trafficking and functional expression. Mutations in the MC2R gene are linked to familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD), a condition marked by adrenal unresponsiveness to ACTH, leading to cortisol deficiency and associated clinical symptoms (Fridmanis2017ACTH; al2011Familial; Novoselova2018Pathophysiology).

## Structure
The melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven transmembrane domain architecture, typical of GPCRs. The MC2R protein sequence includes seven transmembrane helices, four cytoplasmic loops, and four extracellular loops, as identified through molecular modeling studies (Dieudonné2014Modeling). The receptor's structure is crucial for its function, with specific residues and motifs playing significant roles in its activity. For instance, the 'DRY' motif contains a conserved arginine residue, although it does not form a salt bridge as seen in some structural homologs (Dieudonné2014Modeling).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are important for MC2R's functionality. Glycosylation at the N-terminus is essential for the receptor's transport to the plasma membrane, with two specific glycosylation sites identified. Mutations that disrupt these sites can hinder surface transportation, although co-expression with MRAP1 can mitigate this effect (Fridmanis2017ACTH). Phosphorylation, particularly at serine/threonine residues, is involved in receptor desensitization and internalization, with mutations at these sites affecting receptor transport and response to ACTH (Fridmanis2017ACTH).

MC2R requires the presence of accessory proteins, such as MRAP, for functional expression. MRAP forms unique anti-parallel homodimeric structures that are essential for MC2R trafficking to the cell surface (Ramachandrappa2013The). These structural and functional characteristics underscore the complexity of MC2R's role in cellular signaling.

## Function
The melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) is a G protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in the adrenal cortex, where it plays a critical role in mediating the effects of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) on steroidogenesis. Upon ACTH binding, MC2R activates the Gs protein, leading to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and subsequent production of cyclic AMP (cAMP). This signaling cascade activates protein kinase A (PKA), which is essential for the synthesis and secretion of glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, crucial for stress response, metabolism, and immune regulation (Novoselova2018Pathophysiology; Roy2007Differential).

MC2R's function is tightly regulated by melanocortin receptor accessory proteins (MRAPs), particularly MRAP1, which is necessary for the receptor's proper trafficking to the cell surface and its responsiveness to ACTH. Without MRAP1, MC2R is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a lack of ACTH responsiveness (Novoselova2018Pathophysiology; Liang2013Using). The receptor's activity is also modulated by the agouti protein, which acts as an antagonist (Rodrigues2014Intracellular). MC2R is involved in various intracellular signaling pathways, including the cAMP/PKA pathway and, in some contexts, the ERK1/2 pathway, which are crucial for maintaining adrenal function and cell proliferation (Rodrigues2014Intracellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MC2R gene, which encodes the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor, are primarily associated with familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. FGD is characterized by adrenal unresponsiveness to ACTH, leading to deficient cortisol production while maintaining normal mineralocorticoid levels (Chung2010Phenotypic; al2011Familial). This condition results in elevated ACTH levels, causing symptoms such as skin hyperpigmentation, hypoglycemia, jaundice, failure to thrive, and increased susceptibility to infections (Heshmatzad2020The; Abuduxikuer2019Novel).

FGD is genetically heterogeneous, with type 1 FGD caused by mutations in the MC2R gene, accounting for about 25% of cases (Chung2010Phenotypic; Heshmatzad2020The). The majority of MC2R mutations are missense mutations, which lead to proteins with some residual function, while nonsense or splice site mutations result in more severe phenotypes due to the complete loss of functional proteins (Duan2022A; Chung2010Phenotypic). Novel mutations, such as c.128T > G (p.Leu43Arg) and c.251T > A (p.Ile84Asn), have been identified and are predicted to be pathogenic (Heshmatzad2020The).

Patients with MC2R mutations may also exhibit tall stature, possibly due to cortisol deficiency failing to inhibit the growth of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) (Duan2022A). Genetic testing, including next-generation sequencing, is crucial for diagnosing FGD and distinguishing between its subtypes (Heshmatzad2020The).

## Interactions
The melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) interacts primarily with the melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein (MRAP) to achieve functional expression and activation. MRAP is essential for the trafficking of MC2R from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, where it can be activated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (Webb2010Minireview:). MRAP forms a homodimer with reverse topology and interacts with MC2R to facilitate its activation. This interaction involves specific motifs within MRAP, such as the LDYI motif, which are crucial for MC2R activation (Dores2014Analyzing; Dores2021Hypothesis).

MRAP2, a paralog of MRAP, can also support MC2R trafficking and activation, although it does not compensate for MRAP function in cases of familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD) caused by MRAP mutations (Webb2010Minireview:). MRAP and MRAP2 can heterodimerize, and both proteins are involved in receptor trafficking and signaling (Webb2010Minireview:). The interaction between MC2R and MRAP is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation, highlighting the direct physical interaction necessary for MC2R's function as an ACTH receptor (Webb2010Minireview:).
