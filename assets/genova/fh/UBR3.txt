# UBR3

## Overview
UBR3 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 3, which is a member of the RING-UBR subfamily of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and regulation within the cell. UBR3 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of DNA repair proteins, sensory signal processing, and cardiac function. Unlike its homologs UBR1 and UBR2, UBR3 does not recognize N-end rule substrates, suggesting distinct substrate specificities and physiological roles (Tasaki2007Biochemical). The protein is prominently expressed in sensory systems, indicating its involvement in sensory signal processing (Tasaki2007Biochemical). Mutations in the UBR3 gene have been associated with developmental disorders and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Murcia2020Breakpoint; Li2023Specific).

## Structure
The UBR3 protein is a member of the RING-UBR subfamily of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which includes UBR1 and UBR2. It is encoded by two isoforms, resulting from alternative RNA splicing, with predicted mouse cDNA isoforms encoding proteins of 1,889 and 1,893 residues (Tasaki2007Biochemical). UBR3 shares a low but significant sequence similarity with UBR1 and UBR2, with 22% identity, while UBR1 and UBR2 are 47% identical to each other (Tasaki2007Biochemical).

UBR3 contains several key domains essential for its function as a ubiquitin ligase, including the UBR box, the WxRNG domain, the RING-H2 finger, and the autoinhibitory domain (Tasaki2007Biochemical). These domains are crucial for substrate recognition and ubiquitin transfer. The UBR box is a zinc finger-like domain that plays a role in substrate recognition, particularly in the N-end rule pathway, although UBR3 does not recognize N-end rule substrates like UBR1 and UBR2 (Tasaki2007Biochemical).

UBR3 interacts with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes HR6A and HR6B, similar to UBR1 and UBR2, but it may have different substrate specificities or functions, possibly involving non-N-end rule physiological ligands (Tasaki2007Biochemical). The protein is prominently expressed in sensory systems, indicating a role in sensory signal processing (Tasaki2007Biochemical).

## Function
UBR3 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in regulating protein levels through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In healthy human cells, UBR3 is primarily involved in the regulation of the DNA repair protein APE1. It polyubiquitylates APE1, targeting it for proteasomal degradation, which is essential for maintaining genome stability. This regulation prevents the overexpression of APE1, which can lead to genomic instability by causing an accumulation of DNA single-strand breaks that may convert into double-strand breaks during replication (Meisenberg2011Ubiquitin).

UBR3 is also involved in sensory systems, where it is expressed in various sensory tissues, including those related to olfaction, touch, vision, hearing, and taste. It is suggested that UBR3 may play a role in the reception or processing of sensory signals, potentially through interactions with small metabolites or regulatory proteins (Tasaki2007Biochemical).

Additionally, UBR3 is implicated in the regulation of cardiac Na v 1.5 channels, where it facilitates their degradation via the proteasome pathway, affecting cardiac function by modulating the expression and function of these channels (Zhao2015Cardiac).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UBR3 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. Disruptions in UBR3 due to balanced chromosomal translocations have been linked to developmental delay and brain dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, suggesting its role as a candidate gene in these disorders (Murcia2020Breakpoint). UBR3 is also implicated in cancer, with studies indicating its downregulation in various cancers, except for esophageal carcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma where it is upregulated. The highest mutation rate of UBR3 was observed in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (Li2023Specific).

UBR3's role in maintaining genome stability is crucial, as it regulates the levels of the DNA repair protein APE1. Loss of UBR3 leads to increased APE1 levels, resulting in genomic instability characterized by DNA double-strand breaks and increased susceptibility to DNA damage (Meisenberg2011Ubiquitin). This instability could potentially contribute to conditions involving genomic instability, although specific diseases are not directly mentioned (Meisenberg2011Ubiquitin).

In sensory systems, UBR3 knockout mice exhibit impaired olfactory function and suckling behavior, leading to neonatal lethality, highlighting its importance in sensory processing and survival (Tasaki2007Biochemical).

## Interactions
UBR3, a ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. In Drosophila, UBR3 interacts with Costal-2 (Cos2), a key component of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. This interaction is necessary for the poly-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Cos2, which is essential for proper Hh signaling (Li2016Ubr3). UBR3 also interacts with Kif7, a mammalian homolog of Cos2, regulating its protein levels through polyubiquitination, which affects Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling in mammalian cells (Li2016Ubr3).

In the context of apoptosis regulation in Drosophila, UBR3 interacts with the Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (DIAP1). This interaction enhances DIAP1-mediated caspase ubiquitination, promoting the anti-apoptotic function of DIAP1. UBR3 forms a complex with DIAP1 and caspases, facilitating their interaction and the ubiquitination of caspases, which is crucial for inhibiting apoptosis (Huang2014Ubr3).

In human cells, UBR3 has been identified as a major E3 ubiquitin ligase for the DNA repair protein APE1, mediating its ubiquitylation in the cytoplasm (Meisenberg2011Ubiquitin).
