# TRPV5

## Overview
TRPV5 is a gene that encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 5 (TRPV5), a highly selective calcium ion channel. This protein is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family and is primarily involved in calcium homeostasis. TRPV5 is predominantly expressed in the distal convoluted tubule and connecting tubule of the kidney, where it facilitates the reabsorption of calcium ions from the urine back into the bloodstream, playing a critical role in maintaining the body's calcium balance (Mensenkamp2024TRPV5). Structurally, TRPV5 is characterized by a tetrameric assembly with each monomer comprising six transmembrane helices, forming a channel that is regulated by various endogenous molecules and calciotropic hormones (Pumroy2020Structural; Hughes2018Structural). The gene's mutations and polymorphisms have been associated with clinical conditions such as hypercalciuria and kidney stone disease, highlighting its significance in renal calcium handling and bone health (Guleray2024Decreased; Khaleel2015A).

## Structure
The TRPV5 protein is a calcium-selective ion channel that plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis. It is part of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family and is characterized by a tetrameric structure, with each monomer consisting of six transmembrane helices (S1-S6) (Pumroy2020Structural). The S1-S4 helices form a voltage sensing-like domain (VSLD), while the S5 and S6 helices contribute to the formation of the central pore and lower gate of the channel (Pumroy2020Structural). The pore domain includes a pore helix (PH) that acts as the upper gate or selectivity filter (Pumroy2020Structural).

TRPV5 contains six N-terminal ankyrin repeats, which form a skirt-like enclosure essential for regulatory interactions (Pumroy2020Structural). The TRP domain, a helix running parallel to the membrane, interacts with the S1-S4 bundle and the pore domain, playing a key role in channel gating (Pumroy2020Structural). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity.

The channel's gating is modulated by endogenous molecules like phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and calmodulin (CaM). PI(4,5)P2 binds between the N-linker, S4-S5 linker, and S6 helix, inducing conformational changes that open the channel (Hughes2018Structural). CaM binds to the C-terminal peptides, mediating calcium inhibition through a cation-π interaction (Hughes2018Structural).

## Function
TRPV5 is a highly selective calcium (Ca2+) channel that plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis in the body. It is primarily expressed in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and connecting tubule (CNT) of the kidney, where it facilitates the reabsorption of Ca2+ from the urine back into the bloodstream. This process is essential for maintaining the body's overall Ca2+ balance, which is tightly regulated by the intestine, kidney, and bone (Mensenkamp2024TRPV5). TRPV5 acts as the apical entry gate for calcium ions, allowing calcium in the urine to flow along a concentration gradient through the channel pore into the cell, a process that is essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis (Hughes2018Structural).

The activity of TRPV5 is regulated by various factors, including calciotropic hormones such as vitamin D3 and parathyroid hormone (PTH), which modulate its expression and activity (Mensenkamp2024TRPV5). The channel's function is also influenced by intracellular Ca2+ levels through feedback inhibition and by the mobilization of the channel to the plasma membrane (Mensenkamp2024TRPV5). TRPV5's role in Ca2+ reabsorption is part of a three-step process involving Ca2+ transport across the apical membrane, cytosolic diffusion facilitated by calbindin-D28k, and extrusion into the blood via NCX1 and PMCA1b (Mensenkamp2024TRPV5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TRPV5 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting calcium homeostasis. A notable mutation, p.(Val598Met), leads to autosomal recessive renal calcium-wasting hypercalciuria, characterized by increased calcium excretion in urine, intermittent kidney stones, and increased bone formation without improving bone phenotype. This mutation disrupts TRPV5's function by affecting its calcium permeability and protein stability (Guleray2024Decreased).

TRPV5 polymorphisms, such as rs4236480, have been linked to an increased risk of kidney stone disease (KSD) and stone multiplicity in patients with calcium nephrolithiasis. These polymorphisms may affect the stability and function of the TRPV5 protein, leading to decreased calcium reabsorption and hypercalciuria, a known risk factor for stone formation (Khaleel2015A; Ali2022Association).

Alterations in TRPV5 expression are also implicated in bone disorders. In TRPV5 knockout mice, the absence of this channel results in renal calcium wasting, compensatory intestinal hyperabsorption, and reduced bone thickness, suggesting a role in bone health and calcium metabolism (Hoenderop2003Renal). Additionally, TRPV5 expression changes are linked to osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, affecting bone resorption and chondrocyte metabolism (Luo2023Alterations).

## Interactions
TRPV5 interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its function and regulation. One significant interaction is with the S100A10-annexin 2 complex. S100A10 binds to a specific sequence in the C-terminal tail of TRPV5, and this interaction is essential for the channel's activity and proper localization to the plasma membrane. Mutations in the S100A10 binding site, particularly at the threonine residue, disrupt this interaction, leading to impaired channel function and mislocalization (van2003Functional).

TRPV5 also interacts with Calbindin-D28K (CaBP 28K), a calcium-binding protein that acts as a dynamic calcium buffer. CaBP 28K enhances TRPV5-mediated calcium transport by associating with the channel at low intracellular calcium concentrations. This interaction is calcium-dependent and involves the EF-hand motifs of CaBP 28K, which are crucial for its function as a calcium buffer (Lambers2006CalbindinD28K).

Additionally, TRPV5 interacts with Rab11a, a Rab GTPase that influences its trafficking to the plasma membrane. Rab11a's GTP-bound form facilitates the translocation of TRPV5-containing vesicles to the membrane, promoting channel activity (Mensenkamp2024TRPV5). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms that control TRPV5 function and its role in calcium homeostasis.
