# AAGAB

## Overview
The AAGAB gene encodes the alpha and gamma adaptin binding protein, also known as p34, which is integral to clathrin-mediated vesicle transport. This protein is involved in the endocytosis and recycling of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Axl, playing a critical role in cellular signaling and homeostasis. The protein contains a Rab-like GTPase domain and an adaptin-binding domain, facilitating interactions with adaptor protein complexes AP-1 and AP-2, which are essential for membrane trafficking processes (Charfeddine2016Clinical; Eytan2013A). Mutations in the AAGAB gene are linked to punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type 1 (PPPK1), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hyperkeratotic lesions on the palms and soles (Charfeddine2016Clinical; Akasaka2015Two). The gene's involvement in other conditions, such as congenital dysplasia of the hip and potential systemic malignancies, suggests a broader phenotypic impact (Elhaji2019AAGAB; Eytan2013A).

## Function
The AAGAB gene encodes a protein known as p34, which plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated vesicle transport, a process essential for the endocytosis and recycling of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Axl. This protein contains two functional domains: a Rab-like GTPase domain and an adaptin-binding domain. The Rab-like GTPase domain, spanning amino acids 157-249, may function as a chaperone in membrane trafficking, while the adaptin-binding domain interacts with the NH2-terminal domains of a and c-adaptin (Charfeddine2016Clinical).

In healthy human cells, AAGAB facilitates the proper trafficking and recycling of RTKs, which are vital for cellular signaling and homeostasis. The protein interacts with the c-adaptin subunit of adaptor protein 1 (AP1) and the a-adaptin subunit of AP2, which are associated with the trans-Golgi network and plasma membrane, respectively (Eytan2013A). AAGAB's role in clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and receptor recycling, ensuring that signaling pathways function correctly and efficiently (Charfeddine2016Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AAGAB gene are primarily associated with punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type 1 (PPPK1), also known as Buschke-Fischer-Brauer syndrome. This autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by multiple hyperkeratotic lesions on the palms and soles, which typically begin in adolescence and worsen with age (Charfeddine2016Clinical; Akasaka2015Two). The condition is linked to various heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the AAGAB gene, which lead to premature termination codons and result in a dysfunctional protein (Pöhler2013Heterozygous; Li2013Lossoffunction).

The AAGAB gene encodes a protein involved in clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking, which is crucial for maintaining skin integrity. Mutations in this gene disrupt normal cellular processes, contributing to the pathogenesis of PPPK1 (Harjama2021Hereditary). The clinical presentation of PPPK1 can vary, with some patients experiencing severe hyperkeratosis that may be painful and socially debilitating (Pohler2014New).

In addition to skin manifestations, some studies suggest a potential link between AAGAB mutations and an increased risk of systemic malignancies, although this association requires further investigation (Elhaji2019AAGAB). The gene's role in other conditions, such as congenital dysplasia of the hip, has also been explored, indicating a broader phenotypic spectrum for AAGAB mutations (Eytan2013A).

## Interactions
The AAGAB gene encodes a protein that interacts with alpha and gamma adaptins, which are components of adaptor protein complexes involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These interactions are mapped to the NH2-terminal domains of the adaptins, despite only 32% identity in these domains (Giehl2012Nonsense). AAGAB can be coimmunoprecipitated with soluble adaptor complexes AP-1 and AP-2, suggesting a role in preventing adaptors from coassembling with soluble clathrin or participating in uncoating processes by aiding the removal of adaptors from coated vesicles (Giehl2012Nonsense). 

In the context of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage, AAGAB interacts with NEDD4-1, a protein involved in PTEN nuclear translocation. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating that AAGAB and NEDD4-1 can pull down each other in cultured neurons (Dai2021Aagab). The polyubiquitination of both AAGAB and NEDD4-1 increases in neurons subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation, suggesting a regulatory mechanism where AAGAB influences the stability and function of NEDD4-1, affecting PTEN localization (Dai2021Aagab). These interactions highlight AAGAB's role in membrane trafficking and its potential involvement in significant cellular processes.
