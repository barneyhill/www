# ALG8

## Overview
The ALG8 gene encodes the ALG8 alpha-1,3-glucosyltransferase, an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the N-glycosylation process within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells. This enzyme is categorized as a transmembrane protein, characterized by its 11 transmembrane domains, which are essential for its function in the ER (Haeuptle2009Congenital). ALG8 alpha-1,3-glucosyltransferase is responsible for the addition of glucose residues to lipid-linked oligosaccharides, a critical step in the assembly of these oligosaccharides, which are necessary for proper protein glycosylation (Schollen2004Clinical; VuillaumierBarrot2018Wide). Mutations in the ALG8 gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, manifesting in a range of clinical symptoms due to defects in glycosylation (Sorte2012Severe; VuillaumierBarrot2018Wide). Additionally, ALG8 mutations have been implicated in atypical polycystic kidney and liver diseases, highlighting the gene's broader significance in human health (Apple2022Atypical).

## Structure
The ALG8 gene encodes the ALG8 alpha-1,3-glucosyltransferase, a protein involved in the biosynthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides. This enzyme is predicted to be an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein with 11 transmembrane domains and a size of 526 amino acids (Haeuptle2009Congenital). The transmembrane domains are crucial for its function within the ER, facilitating its role in the glycosylation process. 

The ALG8 protein is involved in the addition of glucose residues to lipid-linked oligosaccharides, a key step in N-glycosylation. A potential N-glycosylation site is identified at position p.N96, indicating a post-translational modification that may be important for its function (Haeuptle2009Congenital). Mutations in ALG8, including missense, nonsense, splicing defects, and frameshift mutations, can lead to severe congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) by disrupting the protein's enzymatic activity (Haeuptle2009Congenital).

The structure of ALG8 is characterized by its transmembrane domains, which are integral to its function in the ER. The membrane topology prediction of the glucosyltransferase 2 was performed similarly to the DPAGT1 enzyme, suggesting a complex structure essential for its role in glycosylation (Haeuptle2009Congenital).

## Function
The ALG8 gene encodes the enzyme dolichyl-P-Glc:Glc 1 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 -PP-dolichyl α1,3-glucosyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in the N-glycosylation process within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells (Schollen2004Clinical; VuillaumierBarrot2018Wide). This enzyme is responsible for the addition of the second glucose residue onto the growing lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) chain, a critical step in the assembly of LLOs (Sorte2012Severe; Vesela2009A). The proper assembly of these oligosaccharides is essential for the glycosylation of proteins, which affects their folding, stability, and function (Schollen2004Clinical; Stölting2009Novel).

In healthy cells, ALG8 ensures the correct assembly and function of glycoproteins, which are vital for numerous cellular functions, including protein quality control and cellular homeostasis (Sorte2012Severe; VuillaumierBarrot2018Wide). The enzyme operates on the luminal membrane of the ER, where it facilitates the transfer of glucose molecules to the LLO chain, contributing to the synthesis of the dolichol-linked N-glycan precursor (Sorte2012Severe; Schollen2004Clinical). This process is highly conserved across eukaryotes, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing multisystemic disorders (Schollen2004Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALG8 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation, specifically CDG-Ih. These disorders are characterized by a broad range of clinical phenotypes, including severe neurological dysfunction, developmental delays, and multi-organ failure. Patients with ALG8-CDG often present with symptoms such as infantile hypotonia, growth retardation, visual impairment, and dysmorphic features. In severe cases, the condition can lead to early death (Sorte2012Severe).

The ALG8 gene encodes an enzyme crucial for the glycosylation process, and mutations can lead to defects in the synthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides. This results in glycosylation deficiencies that manifest in various clinical symptoms, including hepato-intestinal and neurological issues (Vesela2009A; VuillaumierBarrot2018Wide). The clinical spectrum of ALG8-CDG is wide, with some patients experiencing milder symptoms and longer survival, while others suffer from severe, life-threatening conditions (VuillaumierBarrot2018Wide).

In addition to congenital disorders of glycosylation, heterozygous variants in the ALG8 gene have been linked to atypical polycystic kidney disease and polycystic liver disease, suggesting a broader impact of ALG8 mutations on organ function (Apple2022Atypical).
