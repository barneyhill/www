# CXorf49B

## Overview
CXorf49B is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the protein known as chromosome X open reading frame 49B. This protein is categorized as a hypothetical protein, as its specific biological functions and interactions remain largely uncharacterized in the current scientific literature. While the precise role of CXorf49B in cellular processes is not yet fully understood, it is hypothesized to be involved in various cellular pathways due to its expression patterns observed in different tissues. Further research is necessary to elucidate the functional significance of CXorf49B and its potential implications in health and disease.
