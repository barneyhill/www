# GRHL3

## Overview
The GRHL3 gene encodes the grainyhead-like transcription factor 3, a critical protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in epidermal differentiation and epithelial morphogenesis. As a transcription factor, GRHL3 regulates the expression of genes essential for keratinocyte differentiation and plays a significant role in maintaining cell-type specificity by modulating super-enhancers in epidermal cells (Klein2017GRHL3; Chen2021Epidermal). Beyond its nuclear functions, GRHL3 also participates in cytoplasmic and membrane-associated activities, influencing cell shape changes necessary for epithelial morphogenesis through the regulation of actomyosin networks and planar cell polarity molecules (KimuraYoshida2018Cytoplasmic). The protein's activity is finely tuned by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and by mechanisms like intronic polyadenylation, which control its expression levels in different cellular contexts (Chen2021Epidermal; Krzywinska2018Threonine). Mutations in GRHL3 have been linked to several congenital disorders, including spina bifida and nonsyndromic cleft palate, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Kotarba2020Grainyheadlike; Lemay2017Rare).

## Structure
The GRHL3 protein is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. It contains several important domains, including a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and an oligomerization domain (OD), which are essential for its function (Krzywinska2018Threonine). The transactivation domain (TAD) is another critical region that facilitates the transcriptional activity of GRHL3 (Krzywinska2018Threonine). GRHL3 is characterized by a DNA-binding immunoglobulin fold, which is homologous to the DNA-binding domain of the tumor suppressor p53 (Mlacki2015Recent).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, are significant for the regulation of GRHL3's activity. Threonine 454 (T454) is a key phosphorylation site located between the DNA-binding and oligomerization domains. This site is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates, indicating its importance (Krzywinska2018Threonine). Phosphorylation at T454 is mediated by various kinases, including MAP kinases, and is crucial for GRHL3's function (Krzywinska2018Threonine). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs141193530 and rs41268753 can disrupt this phosphorylation site, affecting GRHL3's function (Kotarba2020Grainyheadlike).

The GRHL3 protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, as shown by immunofluorescence analysis, despite mutations that affect its phosphorylation (Krzywinska2018Threonine). The protein's structure and post-translational modifications provide insights into its regulatory mechanisms and potential implications in human diseases (Krzywinska2018Threonine).

## Function
The GRHL3 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in epidermal differentiation and epithelial morphogenesis. In the nucleus, GRHL3 functions as a transcriptional activator, modulating the expression of genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation, such as SPRR1B, S100A9, and SBSN, which are essential for mid- and late-epidermal differentiation (Chen2021Epidermal). GRHL3 is also involved in the regulation of super-enhancers in epidermal keratinocytes, where it binds to these regions to activate transcription during differentiation and represses non-keratinocyte super-enhancers to maintain cell-type specificity (Klein2017GRHL3).

In addition to its nuclear functions, GRHL3 has roles in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it acts as a transducer of cell shape changes necessary for epithelial morphogenesis. This involves the regulation of actomyosin networks and planar cell polarity molecules, which are crucial for processes like neurulation and wound repair (KimuraYoshida2018Cytoplasmic). GRHL3's activity is modulated by intronic polyadenylation, which suppresses its expression in undifferentiated keratinocytes to prevent premature differentiation, highlighting its role in balancing progenitor and differentiated states (Chen2021Epidermal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GRHL3 gene are associated with several congenital and developmental disorders. GRHL3 has been implicated in spina bifida, a type of neural tube defect. Studies have identified rare deleterious variants in GRHL3, including frameshift and missense mutations, in individuals with spina bifida. These mutations are often located in the trans-activation domain of the gene, suggesting a pathogenic role in neural tube defects (Lemay2017Rare).

GRHL3 is also linked to nonsyndromic cleft palate (nsCPO) and Van der Woude syndrome (VWS). Research has identified both rare truncating mutations and a common susceptibility variant, rs41268753, associated with nsCPO. These mutations are often found in the DNA binding domain of GRHL3, indicating a genotype-phenotype correlation (Mangold2016Sequencing). In African populations, GRHL3 mutations have been shown to contribute to the risk of nonsyndromic cleft palate, with some variants exhibiting incomplete penetrance (Eshete2017LossofFunction).

In cancer, GRHL3 mutations are relatively rare but have been observed in nonmelanoma skin cancer and malignant melanoma. These mutations may impair the tumor-suppressive functions of GRHL3, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Kotarba2020Grainyheadlike).

## Interactions
GRHL3 (grainyhead-like transcription factor 3) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. In endothelial cells, GRHL3 interacts with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), enhancing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. This interaction is more pronounced when GRHL3 is located outside the nucleus, particularly in its variant lacking the nuclear localization signal (GRHL3 ∆biNLS), which increases eNOS activity and NO production (Jander2021ExtraNuclear). 

In the context of epidermal differentiation, GRHL3 interacts with components of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway, such as VANGL2, a planar cell polarity (PCP) protein. This interaction is crucial for cell shape changes during epithelial morphogenesis (KimuraYoshida2018Cytoplasmic). 

GRHL3's role in regulating gene expression is also modulated by intronic polyadenylation (IpA) in keratinocytes. The Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) and HNRNPA3 collaborate to promote the usage of an IpA site within GRHL3, affecting its expression and the expression of its target genes (Chen2021Epidermal). These interactions highlight GRHL3's multifaceted role in cellular differentiation and function.
