# LEPR

## Overview
The LEPR gene encodes the leptin receptor, a transmembrane protein that is a member of the class I cytokine receptor family. This receptor is integral to the regulation of energy balance and body weight, primarily through its interaction with the hormone leptin. The leptin receptor is predominantly expressed in the hypothalamus, where it plays a critical role in appetite regulation and metabolic processes. Upon binding with leptin, the receptor activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which is essential for mediating leptin's effects on energy homeostasis. The LEPR gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, with the long isoform, LEPRb, being crucial for full signal transduction. Mutations in the LEPR gene can lead to severe obesity and metabolic disorders due to impaired leptin signaling (Gorska2010Leptin; Kleinendorst2020Leptin).

## Structure
The LEPR gene encodes the leptin receptor, a protein that is part of the class I cytokine receptor family. The leptin receptor consists of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. The extracellular domain is composed of 816 amino acids and includes conserved cysteine residues and a WSXWS motif, characteristic of the class I cytokine receptor family. It features seven structural domains, including fibronectin type III (FNIII) folds in domains 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7, and an immunoglobulin-like fold in domain 3 (Tartaglia1995Identification; Bakshi2022Trajectory). The transmembrane domain is 23 amino acids long (Bakshi2022Trajectory).

The intracellular domain varies among isoforms, with the longest isoform, LEPRb, containing essential signaling domains such as box homology motifs 1, 2, and 3, which are crucial for JAK-STAT signaling (Wada2014Leptin; Bakshi2022Trajectory). LEPR undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including LEPRa-f, which share identical extracellular and transmembrane domains but differ in their intracellular domains (Bakshi2022Trajectory). The receptor can form homodimers and oligomers, with leptin binding inducing dimerization necessary for signal transduction (Devos1997Ligandindependent; Saxton2023Structural).

## Function
The LEPR gene encodes the leptin receptor, which plays a crucial role in regulating energy balance and body weight by mediating the effects of the hormone leptin. In healthy human cells, the leptin receptor is primarily active in the hypothalamus, where it influences appetite and metabolism. The receptor is involved in several molecular processes, including the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which is essential for leptin signal transduction. Upon leptin binding, JAK2 kinase is activated, leading to the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptor. This allows STAT proteins to bind, become phosphorylated, and translocate to the nucleus to activate gene expression (Gorska2010Leptin).

The leptin receptor exists in multiple isoforms, with the long isoform, ob-rb, being crucial for full signal transduction. This isoform is predominantly expressed in the hypothalamus and is vital for maintaining energy homeostasis and regulating the activity of secretory organs (Gorska2010Leptin). The receptor's signaling pathways impact processes such as fat storage, glucose homeostasis, and neuroendocrine function, contributing to the regulation of feeding behavior and energy expenditure (Leshan2006Leptin). The leptin receptor also plays a role in the immune system, influencing both innate and adaptive immunity (Gorska2010Leptin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LEPR gene, which encodes the leptin receptor, are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily characterized by severe early-onset obesity and related metabolic and endocrine abnormalities. Individuals with LEPR mutations often experience hyperphagia, or excessive eating, due to impaired satiety signaling, leading to significant weight gain from an early age (Kleinendorst2020Leptin; Dubern2012Leptin). These mutations can also result in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, affecting pubertal development and fertility (Nunziata2018Functional).

LEPR mutations can lead to a nonfunctional leptin receptor, rendering leptin treatment ineffective. This condition is known as leptin receptor deficiency and is characterized by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the LEPR gene (Kleinendorst2020Leptin). The deficiency is linked to severe obesity and hyperphagia, with some patients also experiencing pituitary hormone disturbances (Kleinendorst2020Leptin).

The clinical presentation of LEPR mutations can vary, with some individuals showing additional symptoms such as recurring infections and altered growth, potentially due to residual LEPR activity or the specific nature of the mutation (Nunziata2018Functional). Treatment options are limited, but the MC4R agonist setmelanotide has shown promise in reducing appetite and body weight in some cases (Voigtmann2021Identification).

## Interactions
The leptin receptor (LEPR) is involved in several critical interactions that facilitate its role in energy homeostasis and appetite regulation. LEPR interacts with leptin, forming a 1:1 complex that subsequently dimerizes into a 2:2 complex. This interaction is crucial for the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the JAK/STAT phosphorylation cascade, which is similar to other cytokine receptor complexes (Simien2023A; Saxton2023Structural).

LEPR also engages in interactions with various proteins that modulate its signaling capabilities. For instance, the phosphorylation of Y985 in the LEPR creates a binding site for SHP2, which recruits Grb2 and activates the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway. This pathway is significant for maintaining energy balance, as disruptions can lead to obesity and leptin resistance (Wauman2011Leptin).

Additionally, LEPR interacts with IRS proteins, such as IRS1 and IRS2, which are recruited via SH2B1 to enhance JAK2 activity and promote downstream signaling. IRS4 interacts with the phospho-Y1077 motif of LEPR, functioning as an adaptor protein for PI3K and other signaling molecules, which are essential for the regulation of food intake and body weight (Wauman2011Leptin).
