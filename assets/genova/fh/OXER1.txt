# OXER1

## Overview
OXER1 is a gene that encodes the oxoeicosanoid receptor 1, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in various physiological and pathological processes. The receptor is primarily recognized for its role in mediating the effects of 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE), a potent chemoattractant for immune cells such as eosinophils and neutrophils, thereby playing a crucial role in immune cell migration and chemotaxis (Kalyvianaki20235OxoETEOXER1:; Powell2020Targeting). Beyond its immunological functions, OXER1 is implicated in the regulation of steroidogenesis and cell proliferation, particularly in steroidogenic tissues like the adrenal glands and testis (Mori2023New). The receptor's involvement in signaling pathways, including ERK1/2 phosphorylation, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases and certain cancers (Thomas2019Membrane; Powell2020Targeting).

## Function
OXER1, a G-protein-coupled receptor, is primarily involved in mediating the biological actions of 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE), a potent chemoattractant for human white blood cells. This receptor is expressed in various inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages, and plays a significant role in immune cell migration and chemotaxis (Kalyvianaki20235OxoETEOXER1:; Powell2020Targeting). OXER1 activation by 5-oxo-ETE leads to intracellular calcium mobilization and the inhibition of cAMP production, which are crucial for the chemotactic response in neutrophils and eosinophils (Thomas2019Membrane; Hosoi2005TG1019OXE).

In addition to its role in immune responses, OXER1 is involved in the regulation of steroidogenesis and cell proliferation, particularly in steroidogenic tissues such as the adrenal glands and testis (Mori2023New). The receptor's activation triggers signaling pathways, including ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which promotes cellular responses like migration and proliferation (Thomas2019Membrane). OXER1's involvement in these processes highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases and certain cancers (Powell2020Targeting).

## Clinical Significance
OXER1, also known as G Protein-coupled Receptor 170 (GPR170), is implicated in the progression of hormone-sensitive cancers, particularly prostate and breast cancer. In prostate cancer, OXER1 is associated with cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis through pathways involving p38α, PI3K/Akt, and FAK. Testosterone acts as an antagonist to OXER1-mediated pathways, inhibiting cell migration and metastasis (Masi2021Molecular; Kalyvianaki2019Membrane). In breast cancer, high OXER1 expression correlates with poor prognosis and is linked to increased cell proliferation and migration via the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway. Silencing OXER1 reduces these processes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Masi2020OXER1).

OXER1 expression is also altered in cancerous tissues. In prostate cancer, OXER1 mRNA levels are decreased compared to non-cancerous tissues, which may be due to variations in mRNA processing or differences in epithelial/tumor content (Kalyvianaki2019Membrane). In breast cancer, OXER1 mRNA levels are lower in estrogen-receptor-positive tumors, likely due to gene deletions (Masi2020OXER1). These alterations in expression and interaction highlight OXER1's clinical significance in cancer progression.

## Interactions
OXER1, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in several protein interactions that influence prostate cancer cell survival and signaling pathways. It forms a multiprotein complex with phospholipase C-beta (PLC-beta) and protein kinase C-epsilon (PKCe) in prostate cancer cells. This complex is crucial for efficient signaling that promotes cancer cell survival. The interaction between these proteins is disrupted by the 5-Lox inhibitor MK591, leading to apoptosis, indicating the importance of this complex in cell survival (Sarveswaran2013OXER1).

OXER1 also interacts with testosterone, acting as a membrane androgen receptor. Testosterone binds to OXER1, antagonizing the effects of its natural ligand, 5-oxoETE, on signaling pathways, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, and cell migration. This interaction suggests that testosterone can influence prostate cancer cell migration and metastasis through OXER1 (Kalyvianaki2017Antagonizing).

In breast cancer, OXER1 regulates the expression of RACK1, a protein involved in cell proliferation and migration. Silencing OXER1 leads to down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway and reduced RACK1 expression, highlighting a functional link between OXER1 and RACK1 in cancer progression (Masi2020OXER1).
