# GCNT4

## Overview
GCNT4 is a gene that encodes the enzyme glucosaminyl (N-acetyl) transferase 4, which is a glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the branching of O-glycan cores, a process essential for the maturation of mucin-type glycoproteins, which are crucial for cellular differentiation and function (Guindolet2022Glycogene). The protein is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine to specific substrates, thereby modifying glycan structures that are important for cell-cell communication and signaling. GCNT4's expression is associated with cell differentiation, particularly in human limbal epithelial cells, and it is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory conditions, due to its role in glycosylation pathways and cellular homeostasis (Wu2017Network; Guindolet2022Glycogene).

## Function
The GCNT4 gene encodes glucosaminyl (N-acetyl) transferase 4, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the branching of O-glycan cores, a key step in the processing of mucin-type glycoproteins. These glycoproteins are essential for the maturation of mucin-type O-glycans, which are characteristic of differentiated cell types, including human corneal epithelial cells (Guindolet2022Glycogene). GCNT4 is typically active in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine to specific substrates, contributing to the modification of glycan structures. This activity is important for cell-cell communication, signaling, and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

In the context of human limbal epithelial cells, GCNT4 expression is associated with cell differentiation. Its expression increases during the stratification of primary cultures, indicating its role in glycosylation pathways linked to cell differentiation (Guindolet2022Glycogene). The enzyme's activity in branching O-glycan cores is linked to the loss of clonogenic potential in these cells, suggesting its involvement in the transition from proliferative to differentiated states (Guindolet2022Glycogene).

## Clinical Significance
GCNT4 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer, GCNT4 is identified as a central hub gene in gene-miRNA networks, suggesting its significant role in cancer progression and potential as a diagnostic or therapeutic target (Wu2017Network). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), GCNT4 is part of an amino acid metabolism-associated gene signature that predicts prognosis and response to immunotherapy, indicating its involvement in cancer metabolism and immune response (Zhang2022Identification).

GCNT4 is also involved in inflammatory responses. It is upregulated in the bronchial mucosa in response to TNF, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, which affects bacterial adhesion and may contribute to inflammatory diseases (GrouxDegroote2020Glycosylation). In the context of multiple sclerosis, GCNT4 expression is down-regulated following IL-7 stimulation, suggesting a role in immune function alterations associated with the disease (Jäger2013IL7RA). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GCNT4 in various pathological conditions, particularly in cancer and inflammatory diseases.
