# TMEM182

## Overview
TMEM182 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 182, which is characterized by its involvement in cellular membranes and its role as a transmembrane protein. This protein is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, where it plays a significant role in regulating myogenesis and muscle regeneration. TMEM182 interacts with integrin beta 1 (ITGB1), a critical membrane receptor involved in cell adhesion and muscle development, influencing key signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt and ERK. The protein acts as a negative regulator of myogenic differentiation, impacting muscle growth and repair processes. Additionally, TMEM182 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including central obesity and oral squamous cell carcinoma, where it is influenced by inflammatory signals and microRNA interactions (Hsing2019TNFαinduced; Luo2021TMEM182).

## Structure
TMEM182 is a transmembrane protein characterized by four transmembrane spans, with both the N-terminus and C-terminus located intracellularly (Luo2021TMEM182). It is predicted to have a structure similar to the transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) proteins, which suggests a role in cellular membranes (Luo2021TMEM182). A significant feature of TMEM182 is a large extracellular loop, specifically between amino acids 52-62, which is crucial for its interaction with integrin beta 1 (ITGB1) (Luo2021TMEM182). Deletion of this region abolishes the protein's ability to bind ITGB1, highlighting its importance in the protein's function (Luo2021TMEM182).

The interaction between TMEM182 and ITGB1 affects ITGB1's binding affinity for extracellular matrix components and its intracellular signaling pathways, such as the PI3K-Akt and ERK pathways (Luo2021TMEM182). TMEM182's regulatory role in myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration is dependent on this interaction (Luo2021TMEM182). The protein's structure, with its transmembrane-spanning regions, is essential for its function in muscle development and its interaction with ITGB1 (Luo2021TMEM182). The study does not provide specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
TMEM182 is a transmembrane protein involved in myogenesis and muscle regeneration. It is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, where it plays a role in regulating myoblast differentiation and muscle fiber formation. TMEM182 interacts with integrin beta 1 (ITGB1), a membrane receptor crucial for cell adhesion and muscle development, affecting the ITGB1-laminin interaction essential for myoblast differentiation, migration, and adhesion (Luo2021TMEM182).

The protein acts as a negative regulator of myogenic differentiation by inhibiting myotube formation and muscle regeneration. Overexpression of TMEM182 reduces the expression of myogenic marker genes and decreases the phosphorylation of intracellular signaling pathways such as FAK, ERK, and Akt, which are important for muscle growth and repair (Luo2021TMEM182). TMEM182's interaction with ITGB1 is crucial for its function, as it modulates ITGB1 activation and downstream signaling pathways during myogenesis (Luo2021TMEM182).

In TMEM182-knockout models, there is an increase in muscle mass and accelerated muscle regeneration, indicating its inhibitory role in muscle development (Luo2021TMEM182). TMEM182's activity is localized to specific cellular membranes, influencing cellular signaling and structural maintenance.

## Clinical Significance
The TMEM182 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly central obesity and its associated metabolic disorders. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs141764639, in the TMEM182 gene is significantly associated with central obesity in a Korean population. This polymorphism is linked to increased waist circumference, elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as TNF-α, and abnormal lipid profiles, including elevated triglycerides and reduced HDL cholesterol levels. These changes are risk factors for coronary heart disease and diabetes (Ma2020Identification).

In addition to its role in obesity, TMEM182 expression is influenced by inflammatory signals. In vitro studies have shown that treatment with TNF-α, a proinflammatory cytokine, results in decreased TMEM182 transcript levels, suggesting its sensitivity to inflammatory conditions (Wu2008Expression).

TMEM182 is also involved in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The gene is targeted by miR-450a, which is upregulated in OSCC and reduces TMEM182 expression, affecting cell adhesion and promoting invasiveness. This interaction is mediated through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, highlighting the role of TMEM182 in cancer progression (Hsing2019TNFαinduced).

## Interactions
TMEM182 interacts with integrin beta 1 (ITGB1), a key membrane receptor involved in cell adhesion and muscle development. This interaction is crucial for regulating myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration. TMEM182 directly binds to the hybrid domain of ITGB1, specifically between amino acids 387-470, through its large extracellular loop, particularly the conserved region of amino acids 52-62. Deletion of this region abolishes the interaction, highlighting its importance (Luo2021TMEM182).

The interaction between TMEM182 and ITGB1 affects the ITGB1-laminin interaction, which is essential for myoblast migration and adhesion. Overexpression of TMEM182 reduces laminin binding to ITGB1, while knockout of TMEM182 increases this interaction. This modulation of ITGB1-laminin binding influences intracellular signaling pathways, such as the FAK, ERK, and Akt pathways, which are important for myogenesis and muscle regeneration (Luo2021TMEM182).

In the context of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), TMEM182 is targeted by miR-450a, which downregulates its expression. This interaction affects cell adhesion and invasion, with miR-450a reducing TMEM182 expression, thereby decreasing cellular adhesion in OSCC cells (Hsing2019TNFαinduced).
