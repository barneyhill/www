# FGF4

## Overview
Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) is a gene that encodes a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, which is involved in a wide array of biological processes, including embryonic development, cell growth, and tissue repair. The protein product of FGF4, also known as fibroblast growth factor 4, is a paracrine signaling molecule that plays a pivotal role in maintaining the pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells, as well as in the development of various embryonic structures (Mayshar2008Fibroblast; Kosaka2009Pleiotropic). FGF4 functions by binding to fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), initiating signaling pathways that are crucial for cell survival and differentiation (Kosaka2009Pleiotropic). The protein's interaction with heparan sulfate is essential for its activity, influencing its binding affinity and signaling capabilities (Belov2013Molecular). Alterations in FGF4 expression or mutations in the gene have been linked to various diseases, including certain cancers and developmental disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Urbini2019Gain; Lim2022InSilico).

## Structure
FGF4, a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, is characterized by a conserved core homology domain of 125 amino acids that adopts a beta-trefoil fold consisting of 12 antiparallel beta strands. This structure is typical of paracrine FGFs, including FGF4, and is crucial for its biological functions (Belov2013Molecular). The core domain is flanked by variable amino and carboxy-terminal regions, which regulate distinct biological activities. FGF4 has a moderate to high affinity for heparan sulfate (HS), a cofactor in FGF signaling. The HS binding site is composed of the beta1-beta2 loop and the extended beta10-beta12 region, which provide basic amino acids and backbone atoms for HS binding (Belov2013Molecular).

The primary sequence variation in the HS binding site results in discrete affinity for HS, forming FGF-specific morphogenetic gradients (Belov2013Molecular). Although specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of FGF4 are not provided, crystal structures of FGF4 have been solved, which could offer insights into these structural details (Belov2013Molecular). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and can have splice variant isoforms due to alternative splicing of mRNA.

## Function
FGF4 (fibroblast growth factor 4) is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, which plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and development. In healthy human cells, FGF4 is involved in maintaining the pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ES cells) by working with transcription factors such as Oct-3/4 and Sox2 to activate genes essential for these processes (Kosaka2009Pleiotropic). It acts as an autocrine growth regulator in human embryonic stem cells (HESCs), promoting their self-renewal and proliferation (Mayshar2008Fibroblast).

FGF4 is also crucial for embryogenesis, particularly in the proliferation of the inner cell mass (ICM) and the development of various embryonic structures, such as the limb mesenchyme and the gut tube (Feldman1995Requirement; Kosaka2009Pleiotropic). It is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT), which are essential for morphogenesis during embryonic development, by regulating the expression of Snail and E-cadherin (Kosaka2009Pleiotropic).

FGF4 functions through binding to fibroblast growth factor receptors, initiating signaling pathways like the Shp2/Src/Ras/Erk pathway, which are vital for cell survival and differentiation (Kosaka2009Pleiotropic). It is active in the extracellular space, where it interacts with cell surface receptors to mediate its effects (Powers2000Fibroblast).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FGF4 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In bladder cancer, non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in FGF4 are associated with decreased protein stability and poor prognosis. These nsSNPs are involved in the GFR-MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for bladder cancer pathogenesis, and high FGF4 expression correlates with a worse prognosis (Lim2022InSilico).

In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), particularly in quadruple wild-type GISTs, a recurrent focal gain of the FGF3/FGF4 locus on chromosome 11q13.3 leads to overexpression of FGF4. This overexpression is a key pathogenic driver in these tumors, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Urbini2019Gain).

FGF4 gene duplications have also been linked to craniosynostosis, a condition characterized by premature fusion of cranial sutures. A case study reported a de novo mosaic interstitial duplication on chromosome 11q11–q13.3, including the FGF4 gene, associated with developmental delay and craniofacial abnormalities (Jehee2007An).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of FGF4 in various pathological conditions, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
FGF4 interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), particularly FGFR1, to mediate various biological processes. The interaction between FGF4 and FGFR1 involves specific peptide sequences within the FGF4 protein. Studies have identified peptides from the FGF4 sequence, specifically regions 136-150 and 179-206, that bind to FGFR1. These interactions were confirmed using techniques such as mass spectrometry and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) (Jendryczko2021Peptibody).

FGF4 also interacts with heparan sulfate (HS), a glycosaminoglycan that modulates its binding to FGFRs. The binding of FGF4 to HS is tissue-specific and depends on the sulfation pattern of HS. In certain tissues, such as the heart and major blood vessels, FGF4 does not bind to HS unless heparin is present, indicating that the endogenous HS lacks the necessary sulfation pattern for FGF4 binding (Allen2001Role).

These interactions are crucial for the formation of FGF signaling complexes, which are essential for FGF4's role in cell proliferation and differentiation. The specific binding patterns and requirements highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing FGF4's interactions with its receptors and HS (Allen2001Role; Ishihara1994Structural).
