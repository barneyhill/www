# EIF4EBP1

## Overview
The EIF4EBP1 gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), a key regulator of mRNA translation in eukaryotic cells. As a translational repressor, 4E-BP1 binds to the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), inhibiting the formation of the eIF4F complex and thus blocking cap-dependent translation initiation. This interaction is modulated by the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, primarily through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which alters its affinity for eIF4E and allows translation to proceed. The protein is characterized by several phosphorylation sites and specific motifs that facilitate its regulatory functions. 4E-BP1 plays a critical role in cellular growth and proliferation, responding to various growth signals and nutrient availability. Dysregulation of EIF4EBP1 expression and function has been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Wang2005Distinct; Cha2015EIF4EBP1; Sun2019Mitosis-related).

## Structure
The EIF4EBP1 gene encodes the protein 4E-BP1, which plays a crucial role in regulating translation by binding to eIF4E and inhibiting cap-dependent translation initiation. The primary structure of 4E-BP1 consists of 118 amino acids in humans, with a molecular weight of approximately 15 kDa (Sun2019Mitosis-related). The protein contains several phosphorylation sites, including threonine (T)37, T46, serine (S)65, T70, S83, S101, and S112, which are critical for its regulatory function (Sun2019Mitosis-related).

4E-BP1 has specific motifs that contribute to its function, such as motif 1 (54 YXXXXLΦ 60) for eIF4E binding, motif 2 (a proline-turn-helix segment), and motif 3 (70 IPGVTS/TP 84) for high-affinity eIF4E association (Sun2019Mitosis-related). The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, particularly by mTORC1, regulates its interaction with eIF4E, with different phosphorylation patterns observed throughout the cell cycle (Sun2019Mitosis-related).

Post-translational modifications, especially phosphorylation, are significant for 4E-BP1's activity. During mitosis, phosphorylation at Ser-83 by CDK1/cyclin B is noted, although it does not prevent 4E-BP1 from binding eIF4E (Sun2019Mitosis-related). The protein exists in multiple isoforms, such as α, β, γ, and δ, identified through gel electrophoresis, with the δ isoform being the most phosphorylated and not binding to eIF4E (Sun2019Mitosis-related).

## Function
EIF4EBP1 encodes the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), which plays a crucial role in regulating mRNA translation in healthy human cells. 4E-BP1 functions as a translational repressor by binding to eIF4E, a key factor in the initiation of protein synthesis. This binding prevents eIF4E from interacting with eIF4G, thereby blocking the formation of the eIF4F complex and inhibiting cap-dependent mRNA translation initiation (Wang2005Distinct).

The activity of 4E-BP1 is modulated by its phosphorylation status, which is regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 disrupts its interaction with eIF4E, allowing eIF4E to bind eIF4G and initiate translation. This phosphorylation is influenced by various factors, including amino acids and insulin, and is sensitive to the inhibitor rapamycin (Wang2005Distinct).

4E-BP1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it responds to cellular growth signals by modulating protein synthesis. This regulation is essential for controlling cell growth and proliferation, as well as for adapting to changes in nutrient availability and cellular conditions (Wang2005Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EIF4EBP1 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), EIF4EBP1 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to noncancerous liver tissues, with high expression levels associated with poor 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates. This suggests that EIF4EBP1 is an independent predictor of survival in HCC patients (Cha2015EIF4EBP1). In glioblastoma, EIF4EBP1 overexpression is driven by transcriptional activation from factors such as ETS1 and MYBL2, contributing to tumorigenic functions like angiogenesis (Hauffe2022Eukaryotic).

In breast cancer, high EIF4EBP1 expression is linked to increased mTOR pathway activity and cancer cell proliferation, serving as a biomarker for poor prognosis. It is particularly elevated in triple-negative breast cancers and correlates with worse disease-free and overall survival (Nelson2024High; Rutkovsky2019Eukaryotic). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), EIF4EBP1 acts as a tumor suppressor, with loss of gene copies correlating with poor survival outcomes. mTOR inhibitors can restore its tumor-suppressive function by preventing phosphorylation (Wang20194EBP1). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, EIF4EBP1 functions as an oncogene, promoting cell proliferation and invasion (Gui2021circCHST15).

## Interactions
EIF4EBP1, also known as 4E-BP1, interacts with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) to regulate protein synthesis. In its nonphosphorylated form, 4E-BP1 binds to eIF4E, preventing the binding of eIF4G and thereby inhibiting the recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit, which is crucial for translation initiation (Sekiyama2015Molecular). This interaction is characterized by a consensus motif, YXXXXLΦ, which is shared with eIF4G (Sekiyama2015Molecular). The C-terminal loop of 4E-BP1, comprising residues P71 to P84, forms a motif stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with eIF4E (Sekiyama2015Molecular).

The binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E is regulated by phosphorylation, primarily by mTORC1, which reduces its affinity for eIF4E and allows translation initiation to resume (Sekiyama2015Molecular). Phosphorylation at specific residues, such as T70 and S65, influences the binding dynamics (Sekiyama2015Molecular). The small molecule inhibitor 4EGI-1 can modulate this interaction by dissociating eIF4G from eIF4E while stabilizing the binding of unphosphorylated 4E-BP1, highlighting its dual activity in translation regulation (Sekiyama2015Molecular). The interaction between 4E-BP1 and eIF4E is crucial for inhibiting cap-dependent translation initiation, as demonstrated by various experimental systems (Sekiyama2015Molecular).
