# A3GALT2

## Overview
The A3GALT2 gene encodes the enzyme alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase 2, which is a member of the glycosyltransferase family. This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids by catalyzing the transfer of galactose in an alpha-1,3 linkage to specific substrates. The activity of alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase 2 is crucial for the formation of certain glycan structures that play significant roles in cellular recognition and signaling processes. Variations in the A3GALT2 gene have been associated with alterations in glycosylation patterns, which can have implications for various biological functions and disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
