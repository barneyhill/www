# RABL6

## Overview
RABL6 is a gene that encodes the protein RAB, member RAS oncogene family like 6, commonly referred to as RABL6A. This protein is a member of the RAS oncogene family and functions as a GTPase, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis. RABL6A is involved in several signaling pathways, notably interacting with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and the ARF tumor suppressor, which influence tumor growth and progression in different cancer types (Umesalma2019RABL6A; Kohlmeyer2024RABL6A). The protein's interactions with oncogenic and tumor-suppressive factors underscore its role as an oncogenic driver, making it a potential target for cancer therapy. RABL6A's expression levels have been linked to prognosis in various cancers, including pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, gastric cancer, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Xu2021CircTMC5; Feng2020High).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RABL6 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), RABL6A acts as an oncogenic driver by inhibiting the tumor-suppressive PP2A/AKT signaling pathway, promoting tumor growth. Silencing RABL6A in PNET cells leads to cell-cycle arrest and reduced tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Umesalma2019RABL6A). 

In gastric cancer, RABL6 expression is upregulated and correlates with poor prognosis. It is involved in immune regulation and is associated with the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8. Lower RABL6 expression is linked to better overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Xu2021CircTMC5).

RABL6 is also overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), where it promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. High RABL6 expression is associated with poorer prognosis and increased lymph-vascular invasion, making it a potential therapeutic target (Feng2020High).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, RABL6 expression is increased and linked to lower survival rates. It is regulated by the AR/miR-122-5p/RABL6 signaling axis, which affects cancer progression (Tang2021Androgen).

## Interactions
RABL6A, a member of the RAS oncogene family, engages in several significant protein interactions that influence cellular processes and tumorigenesis. It interacts with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), inhibiting its tumor-suppressive activity on the AKT signaling pathway, which promotes tumor growth in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) (Umesalma2019RABL6A). RABL6A also associates with the ARF tumor suppressor, influencing the degradation of p53 through Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination, and potentially relocates ARF from the nucleus to the cytosol (Kohlmeyer2024RABL6A). 

In laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), RABL6 interacts with the CHRNA5 protein, a relationship enhanced by nicotine exposure, which stabilizes RABL6 expression and promotes metastasis (Shen2024Nicotineinduced). RABL6A is also involved in the regulation of the RB1 signaling pathway, where it inhibits RB1 independently of p53, promoting cell proliferation (Kohlmeyer2024RABL6A). 

Additionally, RABL6A influences the expression of oncogenic factors such as c-Myc and VEGFA, and interacts with the tumor suppressor p19ARF, suggesting a role in tumor angiogenesis and progression (Maharjan2021RABL6A). These interactions highlight RABL6A's role as an oncogenic driver in various cancers.
