# DNAJC25

## Overview
DNAJC25 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C25, which is part of the HSP40 subfamily of heat shock proteins. These proteins function as co-chaperones, primarily interacting with Hsp70 to facilitate various cellular processes such as protein folding, translocation, and degradation (LIU2012DNAJC25). The DNAJC25 protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and is notably expressed in liver tissues, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular health by assisting in protein folding and preventing aggregation (ACUN2021DNAJC25). In addition to its fundamental cellular functions, DNAJC25 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly as a potential tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer, where its expression is often reduced in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues (LIU2012DNAJC25; ACUN2021DNAJC25).

## Function
DNAJC25 is a member of the HSP40 subfamily of heat shock proteins, which function as co-chaperones by binding to Hsp70. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including protein translation, folding, unfolding, translocation, and degradation (LIU2012DNAJC25). DNAJC25 is localized in the cytoplasm and is highly expressed in liver tissues (LIU2012DNAJC25). It plays a role in maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular health by assisting in protein folding and preventing aggregation, which are critical for cellular stress responses (ACUN2021DNAJC25).

In the context of cancer, DNAJC25 has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor gene, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it is downregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. Its overexpression in experimental settings has been shown to inhibit colony growth and enhance apoptosis, suggesting its role in inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell death (LIU2012DNAJC25). Although its specific function in healthy human cells is not directly addressed, its involvement in these processes indicates its importance in maintaining cellular function and preventing tumorigenesis (LIU2012DNAJC25).

## Clinical Significance
DNAJC25 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In breast cancer, DNAJC25 is suggested to function as a tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is significantly reduced in certain breast cancer cell lines and clinical samples compared to normal tissues. High levels of DNAJC25 expression are associated with favorable post-progression survival, although its impact on overall survival and relapse-free survival is not significant. Genetic alterations such as point mutations and copy number variations in DNAJC25 are rare in breast cancer, and its promoter region is typically hypomethylated, indicating that other epigenetic mechanisms may regulate its expression (ACUN2021DNAJC25).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, DNAJC25 expression is also reduced, and its overexpression has been shown to induce apoptosis and inhibit colony formation in liver cancer cells. DNAJC25 is negatively regulated by RNF149, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which promotes its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Higher DNAJC25 levels in HCC tissues are linked to better overall and disease-free survival, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor in this cancer type as well (Guo2023RNF149; Kaida2021Regulation).

## Interactions
DNAJC25, a member of the Hsp40 family, is involved in interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DNAJC25 has been identified as a substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF149. This interaction is significant as RNF149 mediates the degradation of DNAJC25 through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The interaction between DNAJC25 and RNF149 was validated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrated that overexpression of RNF149 leads to reduced levels of DNAJC25 protein. This effect is dependent on the ligase activity of RNF149, as it was not observed with a mutant form of RNF149 lacking this activity. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was able to rescue DNAJC25 levels, further supporting the role of RNF149 in targeting DNAJC25 for degradation (Guo2023RNF149).

DNAJC25 is also noted for its reduced expression in liver and breast cancers, suggesting a potential tumor suppressive role. Overexpression of DNAJC25 has been shown to induce apoptosis and inhibit colony formation in liver cancer cells, although specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context remain to be elucidated (Kaida2021Regulation).
