# AMD1

## Overview
The AMD1 gene encodes the enzyme adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1, which is a pivotal component in the polyamine biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is classified as a decarboxylase and is responsible for the decarboxylation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a critical step in the production of polyamines such as spermidine and spermine. These polyamines are essential for various cellular processes, including nucleic acid synthesis, cell growth, and apoptosis. The enzyme's activity is facilitated by its unique structural features, including a pyruvoyl group that is crucial for its catalytic function. AMD1's role extends beyond basic cellular functions, as it is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer, where its expression levels correlate with tumor aggressiveness and patient prognosis (Bian2021AMD1; Xu2019Polyamine).

## Structure
Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1 (AMD1) is an enzyme involved in the polyamine biosynthesis pathway. The primary structure of AMD1 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that are crucial for its enzymatic function. The secondary structure of AMD1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function (Campagna‐Slater2010Finding). The tertiary structure of AMD1 forms a functional enzyme with a specific three-dimensional shape necessary for its activity. This structure is stabilized by interactions such as p-p stacking and cation-p interactions, which are important for ligand binding (Campagna‐Slater2010Finding).

AMD1 may form a homodimer as its quaternary structure, which is common among enzymes involved in similar biochemical pathways. A notable feature of AMD1 is the presence of a pyruvoyl group, a cofactor generated through post-translational modification, which is essential for its catalytic activity (Campagna‐Slater2010Finding). The enzyme's activity is also influenced by specific amino acid residues, such as the substitution of Ile to Met at codon 70, which affects its processing and catalytic efficiency (NISHIMURA1998Structure). These structural features are critical for the enzyme's role in polyamine biosynthesis and cellular function.

## Function
S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1 (AMD1) is a crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines, specifically spermidine and spermine, which are essential for various cellular processes. AMD1 catalyzes the decarboxylation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to produce decarboxylated SAM, which serves as an aminopropyl donor in the conversion of putrescine to spermidine and spermine (Xu2019Polyamine). These polyamines are involved in critical cellular functions such as differentiation, apoptosis, nucleic acid synthesis, transcription, translation, autophagy, and protection from oxidative stress (Xu2019Polyamine).

In healthy human cells, AMD1 plays a significant role in maintaining normal cellular functions and processes. The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cellular proliferation and stability (Xu2019Polyamine). Polyamines synthesized by AMD1 are necessary for cell growth and survival, and they contribute to the formation of hypusine, an uncommon amino acid in eukaryotic initiation factor 5A isoform 1 (eIF5A), which prevents ribosomal stalling during the translation of mRNAs encoding polyproline tracts (Xu2019Polyamine). This function is crucial for maintaining efficient protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AMD1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and gastric cancer. In HCC, AMD1 upregulation enhances the stemness, growth, and metastatic potential of cancer cells. High AMD1 levels are associated with increased drug resistance to sorafenib, a common treatment for HCC, and correlate with reduced overall survival and disease-free survival in patients. Mechanistically, AMD1 upregulates core transcription factors like NANOG, SOX2, and KLF4, which are crucial for cancer stem cell properties, and affects mRNA stability through m6A methylation modulation (Bian2021AMD1).

In gastric cancer, high AMD1 expression is linked to shorter overall survival and is more pronounced in advanced tumor stages. It significantly increases the risk of invasive depth, lymphatic invasion, and distant metastasis. Knockdown of AMD1 in gastric cancer cells reduces cell proliferation and migration, suggesting its role in tumor growth and progression (Xu2019Polyamine).

AMD1 expression is also influenced by methionine in prostate cancer cells, where it plays a role in cell cycle regulation. Methionine can promote AMD1 expression, suggesting dietary considerations for prostate cancer management (Shen2020Effect).

## Interactions
AMD1 (adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1) is involved in several interactions that influence its role in polyamine metabolism and cancer progression. Although there is no direct interaction between AMD1 and FTO, a demethylase, AMD1 indirectly influences FTO expression and activity through its role in polyamine synthesis. High levels of AMD1 increase spermidine (SPD) levels, which in turn upregulate FTO and pluripotency factors, enhancing the interaction between FTO and IQGAP1, a scaffold protein. This interaction is stabilized by polyamination, a post-translational modification, and is crucial for the expression of stemness genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells (Bian2021AMD1).

AMD1 also plays a role in the AMD1-IQGAP1-FTO-NANOG/SOX2/KLF4 axis, which is significant for maintaining stem cell-like properties in HCC cells. This axis involves the modulation of mRNA m6A methylation levels, where AMD1 affects mRNA stability by regulating FTO activity, leading to decreased m6A levels and increased expression of core transcription factors like NANOG, SOX2, and KLF4 (Bian2021AMD1). These interactions highlight AMD1's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
