# SEPTIN3

## Overview
SEPTIN3 is a gene that encodes the protein septin 3, a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins. These proteins are integral to various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeletal organization. Septin 3 is particularly notable for its role in neuronal development and function, where it is predominantly expressed. It is involved in synaptic and neuronal autophagy, acting potentially as an autophagy receptor by interacting with proteins such as LC3B and GABARAPL2. Structurally, septin 3 is part of the SEPT3 subgroup, characterized by the absence of a C-terminal coiled coil, which allows for the formation of rod-like octameric protofilaments. This structural feature contributes to its functional plasticity and ability to participate in filament polymerization and stabilization. The gene and its encoded protein have been implicated in various neurological and oncological conditions, highlighting their clinical significance (Tóth2022Neuronalspecific; Castro2020A; Miske2023Septin3).

## Structure
SEPTIN3 is a member of the septin family characterized by its conserved GTPase domain, which plays a crucial role in its function. The primary structure of SEPTIN3 includes several Atg8 interacting motifs (AIMs), also known as LC3-interacting regions (LIRs), which are important for its interaction with proteins involved in autophagy, such as LC3 and GABARAP. Among these, LIR4 is considered the most likely functional motif due to its structural flexibility and potential for binding (Tóth2022Neuronalspecific).

The secondary structure of SEPTIN3 features a typical septin fold, which includes a three-layered architecture with a six-stranded central β-sheet. This structure is stabilized by interactions at the G and NC interfaces, with variations observed in the NC interfaces (Castro2020A). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, allowing for specific interactions with ligands and other proteins.

In terms of quaternary structure, SEPTIN3 forms part of hetero-oligomeric complexes, contributing to the assembly of rod-like octameric protofilaments. This assembly is facilitated by the absence of a C-terminal coiled coil, which is a unique feature of the SEPT3 subgroup, allowing for functional plasticity at specific septin interfaces (Castro2020A). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which may influence its interactions and function.

## Function
SEPTIN3 is a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeletal organization. In healthy human cells, SEPTIN3 plays a significant role in maintaining cell shape and facilitating cell division. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for neuronal development and function (Castro2020A).

SEPTIN3 is expressed predominantly in neural cells and is involved in synaptic and neuronal autophagy. It binds to autophagy proteins such as Atg8 homolog LC3B and GABARAPL2, and its colocalization with LC3B increases upon chemical autophagy induction in primary neuronal cells. This suggests that SEPTIN3 may act as an autophagy receptor in neurons, with potential implications for synaptic pruning and autophagy regulation (Tóth2022Neuronalspecific).

Structurally, SEPTIN3 is part of the SEPT3 subgroup, which lacks a C-terminal coiled coil and forms rod-like octameric protofilaments. This subgroup is implicated in facilitating the polymerization of filaments, which can associate with biological membranes and trigger various cellular events. The structural plasticity at the NC interface of SEPTIN3 is crucial for its function in filament formation and stabilization (Castro2020A).

## Clinical Significance
SEPTIN3 has been implicated in several neurological and oncological conditions due to its role in synaptic function and cellular processes. Alterations in SEPTIN3 expression have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, where increased levels of SEPT2/3 were observed in the temporal neocortex of patients compared to non-AD subjects. A polymorphic site in the SEPT3 gene was significantly associated with Alzheimer's in a case-control study, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Neubauer2017The; Marttinen2015Synaptic).

In the context of cancer, SEPTIN3 has been identified as a novel target antigen in autoimmune cerebellar ataxia, a paraneoplastic neurological syndrome. This condition is linked to cancer outside the brain, with autoantibodies against SEPTIN3 found in patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia. The study suggests a potential link between SEPTIN3 expression and cancer, as it was ectopically expressed in tumor samples from one patient (Miske2023Septin3).

SEPTIN3 is also upregulated in certain cancers, such as medulloblastoma and teratocarcinoma, indicating its involvement in tumorigenesis (Connolly2011Septin). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SEPTIN3 in both neurodegenerative and oncological diseases.

## Interactions
SEPTIN3 is known to interact with several proteins, particularly in the context of autophagy. It binds to the autophagy-related proteins LC3B and GABARAPL2, with dissociation constants of approximately 362.3 nM and 496.7 nM, respectively. These interactions suggest that SEPTIN3 may function as an autophagy receptor, playing a role in autophagosome formation and synaptic pruning (Tóth2022Neuronalspecific).

SEPTIN3 also colocalizes with LC3B on autophagic vesicles, indicating its involvement in autophagic processes. This colocalization is enhanced upon autophagy induction, such as with the drug AUTEN-67, which increases the interaction between SEPTIN3 and LC3B in neuronal cultures (Tóth2022Neuronalspecific).

In addition to its role in autophagy, SEPTIN3 is part of a broader network of septin proteins involved in cellular processes like cell division and vesicle transport. It forms part of septin complexes, such as hetero-octamers, and interacts with other septins like SEPT7, which is crucial for the stability of these complexes (Neubauer2017The; Desterke2019Proteinprotein). These interactions highlight SEPTIN3's role in maintaining cellular structure and function.
