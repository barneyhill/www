# CLEC4M

## Overview
CLEC4M is a human gene that encodes the C-type lectin domain family 4 member M protein, also known as L-SIGN or DC-SIGNR. This protein is a C-type lectin receptor primarily expressed on liver sinusoidal and lymph node endothelial cells, where it plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating the clearance of glycoproteins such as von Willebrand factor (VWF) and Factor VIII (FVIII) from the plasma. The CLEC4M protein is characterized by its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which facilitates binding to mannose-rich glycans, and its ability to form tetramers, enhancing its ligand-binding affinity. The gene's variability, particularly in its variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) region, influences its function and has been associated with clinical conditions such as von Willebrand disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (Zhang2021CLEC4s; Swystun2019The; Rydz2013The).

## Structure
The CLEC4M protein, also known as DC-SIGNR, features a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that is crucial for its function in binding mannose-rich glycans. The primary structure of the CRD spans residues 262-399, which includes specific regions such as a-helix 1 and b-sheets 6 and 7 (Probert2014NMR). The secondary structure is characterized by these alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are integral to the glycan-binding site. 

The tertiary structure of CLEC4M's CRD undergoes significant conformational changes in response to pH variations, particularly at low pH levels. These changes are associated with the release of calcium ions, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and glycan-binding capability of the CRD (Probert2014NMR). The CRD can exist in different forms depending on calcium ion presence: the holo-CRD (Ca2+-bound), apo-CRD (Ca2+-free), and a 'Ca2+-depleted' form at low pH (Probert2014NMR).

CLEC4M can form tetramers, a quaternary structure that enhances its binding affinity for ligands. This multimeric form is facilitated by the neck region, which contains multiple repeat motifs (Probert2014NMR). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may influence the stability and function of CLEC4M, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
The human gene CLEC4M encodes a C-type lectin receptor known as L-SIGN, which is primarily expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and lymph node endothelial cells. This receptor plays a crucial role in the clearance of von Willebrand factor (VWF) from the plasma. CLEC4M binds to VWF in a glycan-dependent manner, with N-linked glycans being essential for this interaction. The receptor facilitates the internalization and clearance of VWF through receptor-mediated endocytosis, contributing to the regulation of plasma VWF levels and influencing the risk of von Willebrand disease (Rydz2013The).

CLEC4M also interacts with other ligands, including viral glycoproteins, and is involved in the endocytic pathway and catabolism of these proteins. It binds to mannose-containing glycans on Factor VIII (FVIII) and mediates its internalization, which is crucial for maintaining physiological FVIII levels and preventing elevated plasma levels that could increase the risk of thrombosis (Swystun2019The).

The receptor's structure includes a neck region with variable number tandem repeats (VNTR), which is important for tetramerization and high-avidity binding to ligands, affecting its function in ligand binding and internalization (Rydz2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CLEC4M gene have been associated with various clinical conditions, particularly affecting von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels and von Willebrand disease (VWD). Variability in the CLEC4M gene, especially in its variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) region, influences VWF binding and internalization, impacting plasma VWF levels and potentially contributing to the risk of VWD (Rydz2013The). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs868875 in CLEC4M has been linked to lower VWF levels, although it is not associated with VWD in the general population. However, it is linked to type 1 VWD in mutation-negative individuals (Sanders2015CLEC4M; Rydz2013The).

In type 1 VWD patients, certain VNTR genotypes, such as 57 and 67, are more frequent, suggesting a role in disease susceptibility (Manderstedt2018Genetic). The missense mutation rs2277998 in CLEC4M is also more common in type 1 VWD patients, potentially affecting the protein's function (Manderstedt2018Genetic). Additionally, CLEC4M expression is significantly down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, indicating a potential role in cancer pathogenesis (Zhang2021CLEC4s). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CLEC4M in various diseases, particularly those related to blood clotting and cancer.

## Interactions
CLEC4M, a C-type lectin receptor, is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its role in binding and internalizing glycoproteins. It interacts with von Willebrand factor (VWF), binding to it in a manner dependent on N-linked glycans. This interaction facilitates the internalization and clearance of VWF, contributing to variations in plasma VWF levels (Rydz2013The). CLEC4M also binds to the VWF:Factor VIII (FVIII) complex, with the binding being both VWF-dependent and independent. This interaction is mediated by mannose-exposed glycans on FVIII and is calcium-dependent (Swystun2019The).

CLEC4M shares ligand profiles with its homolog DC-SIGN, including interactions with ICAM-3 and viral glycoproteins such as HIV-1 gp-120, HCV E2, and SARS-CoV (Rydz2013The). The receptor is expressed on endothelial cells in the liver and lymph nodes, where it mediates endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits, leading to the catabolism of its ligands (Swystun2019The). The VNTR region in CLEC4M is crucial for its tetramerization and high-avidity binding to ligands, although the effect of VNTR alleles on binding affinity remains controversial (Rydz2013The).
