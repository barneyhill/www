# CCDC166

## Overview
The CCDC166 gene encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 166, which is characterized by the presence of a coiled-coil domain, a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, although its specific biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. The coiled-coil domain is a common feature in proteins that are involved in structural and regulatory roles within the cell, suggesting that CCDC166 may play a part in maintaining cellular architecture or signaling pathways. Further research is needed to clarify the precise mechanisms and pathways in which CCDC166 is involved, as well as its potential implications in human health and disease.
