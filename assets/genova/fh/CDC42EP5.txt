# CDC42EP5

## Overview
CDC42EP5, also known as Borg3, is a gene that encodes the CDC42 effector protein 5, a member of the Borg family of Cdc42 effector proteins. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton, influencing cell morphology and motility through its interactions with small GTPases like CDC42 and septins. CDC42 effector protein 5 is characterized by its CRIB domain, which facilitates binding to active Cdc42, and a BH3 domain, which is essential for septin binding and filament bundling. The protein plays a crucial role in actin and septin filament organization, contributing to cellular processes such as migration, signaling, and tissue development. Its involvement in the modulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton is particularly significant in the context of cancer progression, where it has been implicated in enhancing the invasive and metastatic potential of melanoma cells (Farrugia2016The; Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound; Farrugia2019Cdc42EP5BORG3).

## Structure
CDC42EP5, also known as Borg3, is a member of the Borg family of Cdc42 effector proteins. It is characterized by a highly homologous N-terminal CRIB domain, which is crucial for binding to active Cdc42 and TC10, but not Rac1 (Farrugia2016The). CDC42EP5 is the smallest member of the Borg family, consisting of approximately 150 amino acids, with a molecular weight of about 15.5 kDa (Farrugia2016The). Unlike other Borg proteins, CDC42EP5 lacks the BH2 domain but contains the BH3 domain, which is necessary for binding to septins (Farrugia2016The). The central region of CDC42EP5 includes a proline-rich domain, which may contribute to its structural or scaffolding functions (Farrugia2016The).

CDC42EP5 interacts with the septin cytoskeleton, specifically binding to SEPT6/7 heterodimers or SEPT2/6/7 trimers, but not to septin monomers (Farrugia2016The). This interaction is facilitated by the BH3 domain, which is involved in septin binding and the induction of septin filament bundling (Farrugia2016The). CDC42EP5 has been reported to induce lamellipodium formation in fibroblasts, suggesting a role in promoting actin polymerization at the leading edge of migrating cells (Farrugia2016The). The regulation of CDC42EP5 involves interactions with other Rho GTPases and phosphorylation by kinases such as ERK3 and MK5 (Farrugia2016The).

## Function
CDC42EP5, also known as Borg3, is a member of the CDC42 effector protein family that plays a significant role in cytoskeletal organization and cell morphology. It primarily functions by interacting with the small GTPase CDC42, which regulates its activity. CDC42EP5 is involved in the organization of actin and septin filaments, crucial components of the cytoskeleton. It binds to septins through its BH3 domain, promoting septin filament bundling and co-localization with actin fibers, which is essential for maintaining cellular structure and function (Farrugia2016The; Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

In healthy cells, CDC42EP5 is implicated in the stabilization of stress fibers and the organization of actomyosin networks, particularly in the perinuclear region. This stabilization is vital for the maturation of focal adhesions, which are necessary for efficient cell migration (Farrugia2019Cdc42EP5BORG3). CDC42EP5 also plays a role in cell shape regulation and lamellipodium formation, contributing to cell motility and polarity (Farrugia2016The).

The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cellular dynamics by modulating the actin cytoskeleton and interacting with septins, thereby impacting processes such as cell signaling, migration, and tissue development (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

## Clinical Significance
CDC42EP5, also known as BORG3, plays a significant role in cancer progression, particularly in melanoma. Alterations in the expression of CDC42EP5 have been linked to increased melanoma cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Studies have shown that overexpression of CDC42EP5 enhances the migratory abilities of melanoma cells, promoting invasion and metastasis, while its silencing impairs these processes (Farrugia2019Cdc42EP5BORG3). CDC42EP5 modulates the actomyosin cytoskeleton by interacting with SEPT9, which is crucial for the invasive behavior of melanoma cells. This interaction promotes actomyosin contractility and cell motility, contributing to cancer aggressiveness (Farrugia2019Cdc42EP5BORG3).

The gene's role in modulating SEPT9 to promote actomyosin function is essential for both rounded-amoeboid and elongated-mesenchymal modes of melanoma cell migration, which are critical for metastasis (Farrugia2019Cdc42EP5BORG3). The Cdc42EP5-SEPT9 axis has been identified as a potential target for therapeutic intervention to reduce melanoma metastasis by affecting these migration modes (Farrugia2019Cdc42EP5BORG3). While the clinical significance of specific mutations in CDC42EP5 is not detailed, its expression and interaction with SEPT9 are crucial for the invasive properties of melanoma cells, highlighting its potential as a target for cancer treatment (Farrugia2019Cdc42EP5BORG3).

## Interactions
CDC42EP5, also known as BORG3, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cell morphology and motility. It interacts with the small GTPase CDC42, which is crucial for its localization and function in binding partners such as septins and actin (Farrugia2016The). CDC42EP5 binds to septin heterodimers and trimers, specifically SEPT6/7 and SEPT2/6/7, through its BH3 domain, but not to septin monomers (Farrugia2016The). This interaction is important for septin filament bundling and the formation of filamentous structures that co-localize with actin fibers (Farrugia2016The).

CDC42EP5 also interacts with SEPT9, a member of the septin family, to modulate actomyosin function, which is essential for melanoma cell invasion and metastasis. This interaction enhances the ability of SEPT9 to cross-link actin filaments into stress fibers and cortical actin, promoting actomyosin contractility (Farrugia2019Cdc42EP5BORG3). The interaction between CDC42EP5 and SEPT9 is critical for the assembly of SEPT9 structures at actomyosin bundles, affecting cell migration and invasion (Farrugia2019Cdc42EP5BORG3). CDC42EP5 is also a substrate of atypical MAP kinases ERK3 and MK5, which may regulate the neuronal cytoskeleton and dendritic spine formation (Farrugia2016The).
