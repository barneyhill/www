# ENPP1

## Overview
ENPP1 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1) is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane glycoprotein involved in several critical physiological processes. The protein product of ENPP1 is primarily responsible for the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), playing a vital role in regulating bone and cartilage mineralization by inhibiting hydroxyapatite crystal formation (Kato2012Crystal; Roberts2019ENPP1). Additionally, ENPP1 is implicated in purinergic signaling, influencing epithelial barrier function and cell migration, and modulating immune responses through the cGAS-STING pathway (Kato2018Structural; Curtis2018Neutrophils). The protein also interacts with the insulin receptor, affecting glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, which is linked to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (Kato2012Crystal; Roberts2019ENPP1). Mutations in the ENPP1 gene are associated with several disorders, including generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) and autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets type 2 (ARHR2), highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular and systemic homeostasis (Rutsch2021Hereditary; LorenzDepiereux2010LossofFunction).

## Structure
ENPP1 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of ENPP1 includes a signal peptide, two somatomedin B-like domains (SMBDs), a catalytic domain, and a nuclease-like domain (al‐Rashida2013Therapeutic). The catalytic domain contains two zinc ions crucial for its enzymatic activity (Kato2012Crystal). 

The secondary structure of ENPP1 features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to the stability and function of its domains (Kato2012Expression). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, with the catalytic and nuclease-like domains aligning closely between human and mouse ENPP1, showing a root-mean-square deviation of less than 1 Å (Dennis2020Crystal). 

In terms of quaternary structure, human ENPP1 is described as a disulfide-linked dimer, although the studied construct is based on a monomeric, secreted form (Dennis2020Crystal). Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, with nine potential glycosylation sites identified, which vary in their glycosylation levels (Dennis2020Crystal). ENPP1 also has several splice variant isoforms, which can influence its function and localization (al‐Rashida2013Therapeutic).

## Function
ENPP1 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), which is crucial for regulating bone and cartilage mineralization by inhibiting hydroxyapatite crystal formation (Kato2012Crystal; Roberts2019ENPP1). This function is essential for maintaining the balance between mineralization promoters and inhibitors, ensuring proper skeletal tissue development (Roberts2019ENPP1).

ENPP1 also participates in purinergic signaling, influencing epithelial barrier function and cell migration. It affects the formation and recovery of epithelial barriers and facilitates cell migration, potentially through adenosine signaling pathways (Curtis2018Neutrophils). In the immune system, ENPP1 modulates the cGAS-STING pathway by hydrolyzing 2′3′-cGAMP, thereby regulating immune responses (Kato2018Structural).

Additionally, ENPP1 is involved in insulin signaling by interacting with the insulin receptor, which can influence glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. This interaction is linked to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (Kato2012Crystal; Roberts2019ENPP1). ENPP1's diverse roles highlight its importance in maintaining cellular and systemic homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ENPP1 gene are primarily associated with generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI), a severe autosomal recessive disorder characterized by calcification of large and medium-sized arteries, leading to arterial stenosis, myocardial ischemia, and potentially death within the first six months of life (Ruf2004The; Rutsch2021Hereditary). ENPP1 mutations result in decreased levels of extracellular pyrophosphate (PPi), a key inhibitor of hydroxyapatite crystal deposition, due to reduced enzymatic activity (Rutsch2021Hereditary).

ENPP1 mutations are also linked to autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets type 2 (ARHR2), a condition characterized by elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels, leading to hypophosphatemia and bone deformities (Kotwal2019Clinical; LorenzDepiereux2010LossofFunction). Patients with GACI who survive infancy may develop ARHR2 in childhood (Rutsch2021Hereditary).

Additionally, ENPP1 mutations can cause pseudoxanthoma elasticum, a condition involving multisystemic calcification, including in the skin and eyes (Rutsch2021Hereditary). The phenotypic spectrum of ENPP1-associated diseases is broad, with overlapping features between GACI, ARHR2, and other calcification disorders (Staretz‐Chacham2019Novel). The genetic prevalence of ENPP1 deficiency is estimated to be approximately 1 in 64,000 pregnancies, with a higher carrier frequency in East Asian populations (Chunn2022Estimation).

## Interactions
ENPP1 interacts with various proteins, influencing multiple cellular processes. It is known to interact directly with the insulin receptor, inhibiting insulin signaling. This interaction is enhanced by the K173Q polymorphism in ENPP1, which increases its inhibitory effect on insulin signaling (Kato2012Crystal). The somatomedin-B-like (SMB) domains of ENPP1, particularly SMB2, play a crucial role in its dimerization, which is important for its inhibitory function on insulin signaling (Dimatteo2013Role).

ENPP1 also forms homodimers through its SMB domains, which are involved in its structural arrangement on the cell membrane. This dimerization is mediated by conserved patches on the SMB domains, facilitating a stable configuration that may influence its interactions with other cellular components (Bellacchio2012In).

Additionally, ENPP1 is targeted by variable heavy (VH) domains that allosterically inhibit its enzymatic activity. These VH domains bind near the ENPP1 active site, affecting substrate coordination and reaction geometry without occluding the active site, thus acting as noncompetitive inhibitors (Solomon2023Discovery).
