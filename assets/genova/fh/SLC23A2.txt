# SLC23A2

## Overview
The SLC23A2 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 23 member 2 (SVCT2), which is a sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter. This protein is integral to cellular uptake of ascorbic acid, the active form of vitamin C, and is categorized as a transmembrane transporter due to its structure comprising 14 transmembrane helices. SVCT2 is expressed in various human tissues, excluding the lung and skeletal muscle, and plays a pivotal role in maintaining intracellular vitamin C levels, which are crucial for antioxidant defense and metabolic functions (Darwish2021Association; Nydegger2020Vitamin). The gene's variations have been linked to several chronic diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular conditions, underscoring its clinical significance (Linowiecka2020Vitamin; Darwish2021Association).

## Structure
The SLC23A2 gene encodes the SVCT2 protein, a sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter. The protein exhibits a '7-TM Inverted Repeat' (7TMIR) fold, characterized by 14 transmembrane helices arranged in two sets of seven (Nydegger2020Vitamin). The core domain of SVCT2 comprises transmembrane helices (TMHs) 1-4 and 8-11, which contain most of the hydrophilic substrate-binding residues. The gate domain, consisting of TMHs 5-7 and 12-14, is primarily hydrophobic and undergoes significant conformational changes during the transport process (Nydegger2020Vitamin).

The transport mechanism of SVCT2 is suggested to follow an elevator model, where the gate domain plays a crucial role in substrate translocation (Nydegger2020Vitamin). Dimerization is essential for the function of these transporters, with dimer formation mediated through the gate domains (Nydegger2020Vitamin). The protein's function is influenced by the presence of specific ions, such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, which are necessary for its activity even in the presence of Na+ (Nydegger2020Vitamin). The SLC23 family, to which SVCT2 belongs, is part of the nucleobase:cation symporter 2 (NCS2) family, indicating a conserved transport mechanism across different organisms (Nydegger2020Vitamin).

## Function
The SLC23A2 gene encodes the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2), which is crucial for the uptake of ascorbic acid, the functional form of vitamin C, into cells. This transporter is essential for maintaining adequate intracellular concentrations of vitamin C, which is vital for its antioxidant properties and various metabolic functions. SVCT2 is expressed in most human tissues, except the lung and skeletal muscle, and plays a significant role in protecting cells from oxidative stress and promoting the maturation of type 1 collagen (Darwish2021Association).

The activity of SVCT2 is important for maintaining cellular health by securing intracellular ascorbate accumulation against its concentration gradient. This function is critical for the antioxidant defense system, as vitamin C acts as an electron donor in enzymatic and chemical reactions, quenching reactive oxygen species and preventing cellular damage (STRATAKIS2000Mapping). Proper functioning of SVCT2 ensures sufficient vitamin C levels in plasma and cells, which is necessary for normal metabolic processes and the prevention of various diseases (Darwish2021Association). Variations in the SLC23A2 gene can lead to low vitamin C levels, which have been associated with several chronic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, coronary heart disease, and cancer (Darwish2021Association).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC23A2 gene, which encodes the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter SVCT2, have been associated with various diseases and conditions. Polymorphisms in SLC23A2, such as rs6116568 and rs12479919, have been linked to an increased risk of gastric cancer (Wright2009Genetic; Linowiecka2020Vitamin). Other variants, including rs6133175 and rs1776948, are associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and follicular lymphoma (Linowiecka2020Vitamin). The rs4987219 variant is linked to a higher risk of colorectal adenoma and may modify the risk of HPV16-associated head and neck cancer (Linowiecka2020Vitamin).

In the context of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), methylation changes in the SLC23A2 gene have been correlated with disease severity. Lower methylation levels in the 5' UTR of SLC23A2 are observed in type III-IV SMA patients compared to type I, suggesting a potential increase in gene expression (Zheleznyakova2015Methylation). Additionally, the GG genotype of the rs1279683 polymorphism in SLC23A2 is associated with a higher risk of primary open-angle glaucoma (ZanonMoreno2014SLC23A2).

These genetic variations and methylation changes in SLC23A2 can influence cancer risk, vitamin C metabolism, and other conditions, highlighting the gene's clinical significance.

## Interactions
The SLC23A2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the solute carrier family, specifically involved in the transport of vitamin C. This protein, known as SVCT2, plays a significant role in vitamin C uptake, particularly in the liver, and is more interactive with vitamin C than its counterpart SVCT1 (LI2019Association). SLC23A2 is associated with several types of cancer, including gastric cancer, lymphoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, and is suggested to be expressed more highly in hematopoietic stem cells compared to more differentiated cells (LI2019Association).

The interactions of SLC23A2 with other genes, particularly in the context of leukemia, involve complex networks. SLC23A2 is negatively associated with BCL2 through intermediary genes such as BAG4, BCL2L13, MCL1, and BECN1, indicating indirect pathways of interaction (LI2019Association). The study also highlights the intricate network of interactions involving SLC23A2, suggesting its role in broader gene expression pathways and its potential impact on leukemia-related processes (LI2019Association). These interactions are significant for understanding the roles of SLC23A2 in vitamin C pathways and potential therapeutic applications (LI2019Association).
