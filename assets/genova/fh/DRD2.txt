# DRD2

## Overview
The DRD2 gene encodes the dopamine receptor D2, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in the dopaminergic system of the central nervous system. This receptor is integral to modulating neurotransmission by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity, thereby influencing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels (Świtała2022Impact). The dopamine receptor D2 is predominantly expressed in the striatum and pituitary gland, where it is involved in the regulation of dopamine synthesis and release, as well as in cognitive processes such as working memory and attentional control (Zhang2007Polymorphisms). The receptor exists in two isoforms, D2L and D2S, which are differentially expressed postsynaptically and presynaptically, respectively, and are crucial for the modulation of neurotransmitter systems like GABA and glutamate (Zhang2007Polymorphisms). Variations in the DRD2 gene have been associated with a range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and substance use disorders (Noble2002D2).

## Structure
The DRD2 gene encodes the dopamine receptor D2, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This domain is identified between positions 51-426, with some predictions extending from 35-437 (Lira2021A). The receptor's secondary structure predominantly consists of alpha helices, typical of GPCRs, and includes additional structural features such as disulfide linkages, beta strands, and hairpins in certain mutants (Lira2021A). 

The tertiary structure of DRD2 involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, forming a binding pocket for ligands such as dopamine and antipsychotic drugs like haloperidol. The binding pocket is compact, with specific interactions such as a conserved salt bridge between haloperidol and Asp114, and the involvement of residues like Phe110 and Trp100 in ligand binding and receptor activation (Fan2020Haloperidol).

The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, are common in GPCRs and may affect DRD2 function, though specific modifications are not detailed here. The DRD2 gene also produces different isoforms through alternative splicing, which can result in distinct functional properties (Lira2021A).

## Function
The DRD2 gene encodes the dopamine receptor D2, which is a critical component of the dopaminergic system in the central nervous system. This receptor is involved in modulating neurotransmission by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity, thereby regulating intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (Świtała2022Impact). DRD2 receptors are predominantly expressed in the striatum and pituitary gland, where they play a significant role in the postsynaptic regulation of dopamine synthesis and release (Świtała2022Impact).

In the striatum, DRD2 receptors are involved in reinforcement learning, particularly in learning from negative outcomes. They modulate the activity of striatopallidal neurons, which is crucial when dopamine levels are low, such as during negative prediction errors (Frank2009Prefrontal). The DRD2 gene also influences cognitive processes, including working memory and attentional control, by affecting neuronal activity and gene expression in the prefrontal cortex and striatum (Zhang2007Polymorphisms).

The DRD2 receptor exists in two isoforms, D2L (long) and D2S (short), which are expressed postsynaptically and presynaptically, respectively. These isoforms are essential for dopamine modulation of GABA and glutamate transmission in the striatum, impacting cognitive functions and neuronal excitability (Zhang2007Polymorphisms).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the DRD2 gene, which encodes the dopamine receptor D2, have been implicated in a range of psychiatric and neurological disorders. Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in DRD2, such as the F389V mutation, can alter dopamine signaling and affect the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs like risperidone, influencing treatment outcomes for conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Lira2021A). The TaqI A1 allele of DRD2 is associated with a higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease, particularly in relation to motor fluctuations and late-onset hallucinations (Noble2002D2). This allele is also linked to substance use disorders, including alcohol, cocaine, and opioid dependence, as well as obesity and pathological gambling (Noble2002D2).

In children and adolescents, the c.957C > T polymorphism in DRD2 is associated with externalizing behaviors such as attention problems and hyperactivity, potentially contributing to conditions like ADHD (Della2018Dopamine). Variants of the DRD2 gene have also been linked to mood disorders, schizophrenia, and posttraumatic stress disorder, with the A1 allele being particularly implicated in these conditions (Noble2002D2). These findings highlight the significant role of DRD2 gene variations in influencing disease susceptibility and therapeutic responses.

## Interactions
The DRD2 gene encodes the dopamine receptor D2, which participates in various protein interactions that influence its function and signaling pathways. The D2 dopamine receptor (D2-R) interacts with more than 20 dopamine receptor-interacting proteins (DRIPs), including the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor NR2B subunits, which have the highest affinity for D2-R and affect NMDA receptor-mediated currents and behavioral responses (Blagotinšek2020Critical). Prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) also interacts with D2-R, linking impaired dopaminergic signaling to depression (Blagotinšek2020Critical).

The D2-R forms heteromers with adenosine A2A and cannabinoid CB1 receptors, stabilized by electrostatic interactions between arginine-rich motifs in the ICL3 of D2-R and A2A receptors, and phosphorylated casein kinase 1/2 sites in ICL3 and C-tail of the CB1 receptor (Blagotinšek2020Critical). The D2S isoform of DRD2 interacts with the dopamine transporter (DAT) in the presynaptic terminal, stabilizing it in the plasma membrane and influencing dopamine reuptake, which is significant in the context of cocaine abuse (Sullivan2013Dopamine).

In astrocytes, DRD2's anti-inflammatory effects are mediated through a β-arrestin2-dependent mechanism. α-Synuclein disrupts this interaction by interfering with the β-arrestin2-TAB1 interaction, promoting inflammation (Du2018αSynuclein).
