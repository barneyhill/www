# KRTAP9-7

## Overview
KRTAP9-7 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 9-7, which is part of the keratin-associated protein (KRTAP) family. These proteins are integral to the structural composition of hair and other keratinized tissues. The KRTAP9-7 protein is characterized by its high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, crucial for the protein's stability and function. These bonds enable the protein to interact with keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the mechanical strength and texture of hair fibers (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). While the specific post-translational modifications of KRTAP9-7 remain underexplored, its role in hair structure is well-documented, highlighting its importance in the cross-linking of keratin filaments (Mantilla2024Expression). The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of interest in studies of hair biology and related structural proteins (Adav2018Studies).

## Structure
The KRTAP9-7 protein is characterized by a primary structure rich in cysteine, serine, and glycine, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds. These bonds are crucial for the protein's secondary and tertiary structures, contributing to its stability and conformation (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). KRTAP9-7, like other keratin-associated proteins, typically does not form a quaternary structure as it does not assemble into large complexes (Adav2018Studies). 

The protein is approximately 100 amino acids long and is known for its interactions with other keratin-associated proteins and late cornified envelope proteins, which are facilitated by its cysteine-rich regions (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). These interactions are often studied using protein-protein interaction data, such as affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which has identified interactions with proteins like MCM2 (Siddiqui2018Chromosome).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in KRTAP9-7, potentially affecting its function and interactions, although specific modifications for this protein are not detailed in the available context (Adav2018Studies). The protein's role in hair structure is linked to its ability to cross-link keratin intermediate filaments, providing mechanical strength and shape (Mantilla2024Expression).

## Function


## Interactions
KRTAP9-7, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, is known for its interactions with other keratin-associated proteins (KRTAPs) and keratin intermediate filaments. These interactions are crucial for the structural integrity and mechanical properties of hair fibers. KRTAPs, including KRTAP9-7, typically form disulfide bonds with keratins, which influence hair texture and strength (Siddiqui2018Chromosome).

KRTAP9-7 has been identified to interact with the protein MCM2 through affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) experiments. However, it is noted that positive results from AP-MS may imply indirect or non-specific interactions, suggesting that further validation is necessary to confirm the specificity of this interaction (Siddiqui2018Chromosome).

The keratin-associated proteins, including KRTAP9-7, are often used as baits in yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays to capture other KRTAPs due to their tendency to interact with each other. This characteristic makes them effective in studying protein-protein interactions within the KRTAP family (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). Despite these known interactions, specific experimental data on KRTAP9-7's interactions are limited in databases like IntAct or BioGrid (Siddiqui2018Chromosome).
