# POMT1

## Overview
POMT1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme protein O-mannosyltransferase 1, which is integral to the process of protein O-mannosylation, a specific type of glycosylation. This enzyme is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is essential for the proper glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, a glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in linking the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton within cells. The POMT1 protein functions in a heteromeric complex with POMT2, and this complex is necessary for the enzymatic activity that facilitates the transfer of mannose residues to serine or threonine residues on target proteins. The activity of POMT1 is vital for muscle function and neural development, and deficiencies in this enzyme are associated with various congenital muscular dystrophies, including Walker-Warburg syndrome and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (AkasakaManya2011Different; Manya2003Demonstration; Bausewein2016Functional).

## Structure
The POMT1 protein is an integral membrane protein involved in protein O-mannosylation, a critical post-translational modification. It is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains, with studies suggesting the presence of seven transmembrane helices (AkasakaManya2011Different; AkasakaManya2006Physical). The protein's topology is similar to that of its yeast homolog, ScPmtp1, with specific loops and termini located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen (AkasakaManya2011Different).

POMT1 forms a heterocomplex with POMT2, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This complex formation is necessary for the transfer of mannose residues to serine or threonine residues on target proteins (Manya2003Demonstration; AkasakaManya2006Physical). Mutations in POMT1 can disrupt this activity, leading to conditions such as Walker-Warburg syndrome, although these mutations do not prevent complex formation with POMT2 (AkasakaManya2006Physical).

The protein's structure includes specific amino acids critical for its function, such as Arg 30, Glu 44, and Arg 105, which are essential for its enzymatic activity but not for complex formation with POMT2 (AkasakaManya2011Different). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which could affect its function and stability. However, detailed information on the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of POMT1 is not provided in the available context.

## Function
Protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the O-mannosylation process, a type of glycosylation where mannose is added to serine or threonine residues on proteins. This modification is essential for the proper glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG), a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex that connects the extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton. Proper glycosylation of α-DG is crucial for muscle function and cellular integrity (AkasakaManya2011Different; Manya2003Demonstration).

POMT1 functions in a heteromeric complex with POMT2, and both are required for enzymatic activity. This complex catalyzes the initial step of O-mannosyl glycan biosynthesis by transferring a mannosyl residue from dolichyl phosphate mannose to specific proteins (Manya2009Role; Manya2003Demonstration). The activity of POMT1 is dependent on N-glycosylation, which is necessary for maintaining the enzyme's activity and conformation (Manya2009Role).

POMT1 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and is highly expressed in tissues such as the fetal brain, testis, and skeletal muscle, indicating its importance in muscle and neural development (Manya2003Demonstration). Deficiencies in POMT1 activity are linked to congenital muscular dystrophies, highlighting its critical role in maintaining normal cellular functions (Bausewein2016Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POMT1 gene are associated with a range of congenital muscular dystrophies, most notably Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), muscle-eye-brain disease, and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). WWS is a severe condition characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy, brain malformations such as cobblestone lissencephaly, and eye abnormalities, often leading to early mortality (BeltránValero2002Mutations; van2006The). Mutations in POMT1 result in defective glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, impairing its interaction with extracellular matrix proteins and affecting muscle and neuronal function (BeltránValero2002Mutations; Willer2004Targeted).

Approximately 20% of WWS cases are linked to POMT1 mutations, which can include nonsense, frameshift, and missense mutations, leading to a complete loss of protein mannosyltransferase activity (BeltránValero2002Mutations; van2006The). The severity of the phenotype often correlates with the type and location of the mutation, with biallelic loss of function mutations typically resulting in more severe manifestations (Geis2019Clinical).

In addition to WWS, POMT1 mutations are implicated in milder forms of muscular dystrophy, such as LGMD2K, which presents with muscle weakness and mild mental retardation (Lommel2010Correlation; Balci2005An). The clinical spectrum of POMT1-related disorders highlights the critical role of proper glycosylation in muscle and brain development.

## Interactions
POMT1 interacts with POMT2 to form a heteromeric complex essential for its enzymatic activity. This interaction is crucial for the protein O-mannosyltransferase activity, as neither POMT1 nor POMT2 alone can produce significant enzymatic function (Manya2003Demonstration). The complex formation between POMT1 and POMT2 is necessary for the initial step of O-mannosyl glycan biosynthesis, which is vital for the normal function of α-dystroglycan, a glycoprotein involved in muscle and brain function (Manya2009Role; Manya2003Demonstration).

Mutations in POMT1 can significantly reduce its enzymatic activity, although these mutations do not affect the ability of POMT1 to form complexes with POMT2 (AkasakaManya2011Different). This suggests that while POMT1 is critical for enzymatic activity, its interaction with POMT2 is more about forming a functional complex rather than being solely responsible for the catalytic function (AkasakaManya2011Different). The interaction between POMT1 and POMT2 is homologous to the interactions seen in yeast, where similar protein complexes are formed for O-mannosylation processes (Manya2003Demonstration).
