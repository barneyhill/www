# WBP2

## Overview
The WBP2 gene encodes the WW domain binding protein 2, a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling and transcriptional regulation. As a transcriptional coactivator, WBP2 is involved in modulating the activity of steroid hormone receptors, such as estrogen and progesterone receptors, thereby influencing hormone-dependent gene expression. The protein is characterized by its WW-binding motifs and GRAM domain, which facilitate interactions with other proteins, including those in the Hippo signaling pathway. WBP2 is ubiquitously expressed and functions as an adaptor molecule, contributing to various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and synaptic function. Clinically, WBP2 is implicated in oncogenesis and hearing loss, with its dysregulation associated with several cancers and auditory dysfunctions (Buniello2016Wbp2; McDonald2011Biophysical; Dhananjayan2006WW).

## Structure
The WBP2 protein is characterized by the presence of specific domains that contribute to its function. It contains WW-binding motifs, which interact with WW domains in other proteins, such as the YAP2 transcriptional regulator (McDonald2011Biophysical). The protein includes a GRAM domain, located N-terminal to the proline-rich (PR) domain, which encompasses three PPXY motifs (PY1-PY3) (McDonald2011Biophysical). These motifs are crucial for binding interactions with WW domains, and the presence of a glycine residue in the PPXYXG sequence is important for high-affinity binding (McDonald2011Biophysical).

WBP2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, including a long isoform that is predominant in the cochlea and is essential for auditory function (Buniello2016Wbp2). Another splicing variant, tWBP-2, is expressed specifically in the thyroid and results from a 135 bp internal deletion, leading to a protein lacking 45 amino acids compared to the full-length WBP2 (NITSCH2004WBP2).

The protein is ubiquitously expressed and may act as an adaptor molecule, facilitating interactions between various proteins (NITSCH2004WBP2). The structural dynamics and binding affinities of WBP2 are influenced by its secondary structure, which includes a polyproline type II (PPII) helical conformation (McDonald2011Biophysical).

## Function
WBP2 (WW domain binding protein 2) functions as a transcriptional coactivator, primarily enhancing the activity of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) in human cells. It plays a crucial role in modulating hormone-dependent transcriptional activities, which are essential for the proper functioning of these steroid hormone receptors. WBP2 interacts with these receptors in a hormone-dependent manner, enhancing their transcriptional activity and facilitating the expression of target genes (Dhananjayan2006WW).

WBP2 is also involved in the regulation of epidermal stem cell proliferation and differentiation. It works in conjunction with Yes-associated protein (YAP) to promote cell proliferation by driving TEAD-mediated transcription of genes that support cell growth and survival. This interaction is crucial for the clonal expansion of both normal and neoplastic human epidermal stem cells (Walko2017A).

In the auditory system, WBP2 is essential for maintaining normal glutamatergic synapses in the cochlea. It regulates the expression of estrogen receptors and post-synaptic proteins, which are critical for synaptic transmission. Loss of WBP2 expression leads to hearing impairment due to synaptic dysfunction (Buniello2016Wbp2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the WBP2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and hearing loss. In cancer, WBP2 acts as an oncogene, with its overexpression linked to various cancers, including breast, liver, gastric, and lung cancers. In breast cancer, WBP2 is often overexpressed, especially in aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2-positive cancers, correlating with larger tumor size, higher grade, and poorer survival outcomes (Tabatabaeian2020The; Lim2021Reciprocal). WBP2's role in cancer is further supported by its involvement in multiple signaling pathways, such as Wnt, EGFR, and Hippo, which contribute to cancer progression and chemoresistance (Tabatabaeian2020The; Lim2021Reciprocal).

In the context of hearing, WBP2 mutations are linked to progressive high-frequency hearing loss. WBP2 deficiency leads to disrupted expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the cochlea, resulting in synaptic dysfunction and glutamate excitotoxicity, which are primary causes of hearing impairment (Buniello2016Wbp2). These findings highlight the gene's critical role in maintaining normal auditory function and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in hearing loss (Buniello2016Wbp2).

## Interactions
WBP2 (WW domain binding protein 2) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling and transcriptional regulation. WBP2 interacts with components of the microprocessor complex, including Drosha, DGCR8, and DDX5, to inhibit microRNA biogenesis. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of pri-miRNA processing into pre-miRNA, and WBP2's nuclear localization enhances its inhibitory effect on the microprocessor complex (Tabatabaeian2021WBP2).

WBP2 also interacts with YAP and TAZ, key components of the Hippo signaling pathway. These interactions are mediated by the WW domains of YAP and TAZ and the PPXY motifs of WBP2. The interaction with TAZ is particularly important for TAZ's oncogenic properties, as it enhances TAZ-driven transcriptional activity and cellular transformation (McDonald2011Biophysical; Chan2010WW).

In breast cancer, WBP2 interacts with estrogen and progesterone receptors, acting as a coactivator. This interaction is facilitated by the PY motifs of WBP2, which are crucial for its coactivation function and for recruiting YAP to target gene promoters (Dhananjayan2006WW).
