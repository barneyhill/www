# PCGF2

## Overview
PCGF2, also known as MEL18, is a gene that encodes the polycomb group ring finger 2 protein, a critical component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1). This protein is characterized by its RING finger domain, which confers E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the mono-ubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119, a key modification for gene repression (Colombo2019Topology; Niessen2009Talking). Additionally, PCGF2 contains a RAWUL domain essential for PRC1 complex assembly (Munawar2022Interplay). As a part of the canonical PRC1 complexes, PCGF2 plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression, influencing processes such as cell differentiation and development (Loubiere2019Cell; Piunti2021The). The protein's interactions with other PRC1 components and its involvement in various cellular pathways underscore its importance in maintaining chromatin structure and regulating gene expression.

## Structure
PCGF2, also known as MEL18, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. The protein contains a RING finger domain, which is essential for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the mono-ubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119, a modification associated with gene repression (Colombo2019Topology; Niessen2009Talking). PCGF2 also possesses a RAWUL domain, which is important for the assembly of PRC1 complexes (Munawar2022Interplay).

PCGF2 forms a heterodimer with RING1B, enhancing the catalytic activity of RING1B by increasing its affinity for nucleosomes and reducing its affinity for the E2 enzyme, thus promoting E2 enzyme turnover (Colombo2019Topology). This interaction is crucial for the structural integrity and function of the PRC1 complex. PCGF2 is involved in canonical PRC1 complexes, which are characterized by the presence of CBX proteins that recognize the H3K27me3 mark (Scelfo2019Functional).

Post-translational modifications of PCGF2 include ubiquitination, which can affect its stability and function (Niessen2009Talking). The protein's structure and interactions are vital for its role in transcriptional repression and chromatin modification.

## Function
PCGF2, also known as MEL18, is a component of the canonical Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (cPRC1), which plays a crucial role in transcriptional repression through chromatin modification. In healthy human cells, PCGF2 is involved in the mono-ubiquitination of lysine 119 on histone H2A (H2AK119Ub), a modification associated with transcriptional silencing (Loubiere2019Cell). This activity is essential for maintaining stable gene repression during development, particularly in the regulation of homeotic genes (Piunti2021The).

PCGF2 contributes to the stability of the PRC1 complex, which is necessary for the repression of target genes and the maintenance of chromatin structure (Piunti2021The). It is active in the nucleus, where it influences chromatin compaction and gene silencing, thereby playing a significant role in cell differentiation and development (Loubiere2019Cell). PCGF2 is also involved in the differentiation of the hematopoietic lineage, where it acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting differentiation and inhibiting proliferation (Loubiere2019Cell).

In the context of development, PCGF2 can compensate for the absence of its homolog PCGF4 (BMI1), indicating its importance in maintaining the integrity of the PRC1 complex and ensuring proper developmental outcomes (Piunti2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PCGF2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in reproductive and cancer-related conditions. In the context of female reproductive health, PCGF2 is crucial for ovarian follicle development and ovulation. Mutations or changes in PCGF2 expression can lead to ovarian dysfunction diseases such as secondary premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and anovulation. These conditions are characterized by a loss of follicles, ovulation defects, and a lengthened estrus cycle, ultimately leading to subfertility (Wang2022Polycomb).

In cancer, PCGF2 plays a complex role. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PCGF2 expression is typically lower in cancerous tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Overexpression of PCGF2 in HCC cells has been shown to reduce cell proliferation and tumor sphere formation, indicating a potential tumor-suppressing role. This suggests that PCGF2 could be a therapeutic target to reduce stem-like properties and increase drug sensitivity in HCC (Hu2022PCGF2).

In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), PCGF2 negatively regulates the degradation of the PML-RARA oncoprotein, potentially influencing resistance to arsenic trioxide (ATO) treatment. Alterations in PCGF2 expression may impact the effectiveness of ATO therapy, highlighting its clinical significance in APL treatment (Jo2016PCGF2).

## Interactions
PCGF2, also known as MEL-18, is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and interacts with various proteins to regulate gene expression. It shares a high sequence homology with PCGF4 and both proteins are involved in canonical PRC1 complexes, which bind to chromatin via CBX proteins recognizing the H3K27me3 mark (Munawar2022Interplay). PCGF2 interacts with several PRC1 components, including PHC1, PHC2, CB2, CBX4, CBX8, SCML2, SCMH1, RBBP4, and RBBP7, indicating its role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression (Munawar2022Interplay).

PCGF2 also interacts with UBE2I, a SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme, and acts as a negative regulator of UBE2I-mediated degradation processes. This interaction is crucial for regulating the degradation of the PML-RARA oncoprotein in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, particularly in the context of arsenic trioxide treatment (Jo2016PCGF2). The interaction between PCGF2 and UBE2I is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays, highlighting its role in post-transcriptional regulation (Jo2016PCGF2).

PCGF2's interactions extend to other chromodomain-containing proteins, such as CBX4, CBX7, and CBX8, which are part of the PRC1 complex, further emphasizing its involvement in maintaining transcriptional repression (Vandamme2011Interaction).
