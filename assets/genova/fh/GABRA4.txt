# GABRA4

## Overview
The GABRA4 gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit alpha4 (α4), which is a component of the GABA A receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel that plays a critical role in inhibitory neurotransmission within the central nervous system. This receptor is a pentameric complex typically composed of various subunits, including alpha, beta, and gamma, which together form a functional ion channel. The α4 subunit is particularly involved in forming extrasynaptic receptors that mediate tonic inhibition, thereby regulating neuronal excitability and contributing to cognitive and social functions (Fan2020Transcriptomics; Sajan2024De). The expression of the GABRA4 gene is notably high in the dentate gyrus and thalamus, suggesting its involvement in synaptic plasticity and spatial learning, especially during developmental stages such as puberty (Fan2020Transcriptomics). Variants in this gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal brain function (Sajan2024De).

## Structure
The GABRA4 gene encodes the alpha4 subunit of the GABA A receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel involved in inhibitory neurotransmission. The primary structure of the GABRA4 protein consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's overall stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the polypeptide, allowing it to interact with other subunits to form a functional receptor. The quaternary structure of the GABA A receptor typically includes two alpha, two beta, and one gamma subunit, forming a pentameric complex (Sajan2024De).

The GABRA4 protein contains specific domains, including the extracellular ligand-binding domain and transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function as an ion channel. The transmembrane domains are particularly important, as they form the channel through which ions pass, contributing to the receptor's role in inhibitory neurotransmission (Sajan2024De). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, potentially affecting the protein's function and interactions. Splice variant isoforms of GABRA4 may exist, leading to functional diversity in the receptor's activity (Mulligan2012Complex).

## Function
The GABRA4 gene encodes the alpha 4 (α4) subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA A R), which is a ligand-gated ion channel involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. These receptors are pentamers composed of various subunits, allowing for a diversity of receptor subtypes. In healthy human cells, α4-containing GABA A Rs are expressed in neurons and glial cells, contributing to a variety of pentameric assemblies, including those with a delta (δ) subunit. These receptors are primarily located in extrasynaptic regions and are responsible for tonic inhibition, a form of inhibitory neurotransmission that regulates neuronal excitability (Fan2020Transcriptomics; Sajan2024De).

The expression of α4-containing receptors is highest in the dentate gyrus and thalamus, with intermediate expression in the striatum and lower expression in other brain regions. This distribution suggests a role in modulating excitatory and inhibitory signals, which is crucial for normal cognitive and social functions (Fan2020Transcriptomics; Sajan2024De). The GABRA4 gene is implicated in synaptic plasticity and spatial learning, particularly during puberty, and is involved in contextual fear memory (Fan2020Transcriptomics). Variants in GABRA4 have been associated with neurodevelopmental and epileptic phenotypes, indicating its importance in maintaining normal brain function (Sajan2024De).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GABRA4 gene, which encodes the α4-subunit of the GABA A receptor, have been linked to various neurological disorders. De novo missense variants in GABRA4, such as c.797 C > T, p.(Pro266Leu), c.899 C > A, p.(Thr300Asn), and c.634 G > A, p.(Val212Ile), have been associated with developmental delay, behavioral abnormalities, and epilepsy. These variants are found in patients with overlapping phenotypes, including epileptiform EEG abnormalities, attention deficits, seizures, autistic features, and structural brain abnormalities (Sajan2024De). Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that these variants alter the dynamics of the receptor's transmembrane domain, supporting their pathogenicity (Sajan2024De).

The GABRA4 gene shows a significant depletion of missense variation in the general population, particularly in the region encoding amino acids 1-334, where the reported variants are located. This suggests that these variants may result from early post-zygotic events, as indicated by somatic mosaicism observed in whole blood and ectodermal tissue (Sajan2024De). The study of these variants highlights the potential role of GABRA4 in monogenic epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders, with implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions (Sajan2024De).
