# PRR20G

## Overview
PRR20G is a gene that encodes the proline-rich protein 20G, which is part of a family of proteins characterized by a high content of proline residues. These proteins are often involved in various cellular processes, including signaling pathways and structural functions, due to their ability to form flexible and dynamic structures. The proline-rich 20G protein is implicated in cellular interactions and may play a role in modulating protein-protein interactions, although its specific functions and mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Research into PRR20G and its encoded protein is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its potential roles in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
