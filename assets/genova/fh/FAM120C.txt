# FAM120C

## Overview
FAM120C is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 120, specifically member C. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin regulation, RNA processing, and signaling pathways. FAM120C is a component of the 'Chromatin regulation complex 1', interacting with proteins such as DMAP1 and SATB1, which suggests its role in modulating gene expression and cellular stress responses (Youn2018High-Density; Qin2020Mapping). The gene has clinical significance, as mutations and alterations in FAM120C are associated with intellectual and developmental disorders, as well as certain cancers, where its expression levels may influence disease prognosis and patient outcomes (Boonsawat2019Elucidation; Ming2022The; Jian2021The).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FAM120C gene have been associated with various intellectual and developmental disorders. A microduplication involving FAM120C, located at Xp11.22, has been linked to X-linked intellectual disability (ID) without microcephaly. However, in some cases, additional genetic variants may contribute to the expressivity of microcephaly, highlighting the complexity of genetic contributions to this condition (Boonsawat2019Elucidation).

In the context of cancer, FAM120C has been implicated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) through alternative splicing events. These events are associated with patient prognosis and immune cell infiltration, although FAM120C itself is not an independent prognostic marker (Jian2021The). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), high expression of FAM120C is correlated with better overall survival, suggesting a potential protective role in this cancer type (Ming2022The).

In multiple myeloma, FAM120C is significantly downregulated in patients, although it is not highlighted as a primary biomarker for disease activity or outcomes (Apipongrat2022Serum). These findings indicate that FAM120C may play diverse roles in different diseases, influenced by its expression levels and genetic alterations.

## Interactions
FAM120C is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the context of chromatin regulation. It is a component of the 'Chromatin regulation complex 1', which includes proteins such as DMAP1, MORF4L1, JAZF1, SATB1, and SRRM1. This association is supported by affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and immunofluorescence (IF) data, indicating close proximity and potential functional interactions among these proteins (Qin2020Mapping).

In addition to its role in chromatin regulation, FAM120C has been identified in high-density proximity mapping studies, which revealed a 76% overlap in the recovery of high-confidence preys, suggesting its involvement in various protein interactions. These studies utilized FLAG affinity purification and mass spectrometry data to map subcellular organization, further supporting FAM120C's role in complex protein networks (Youn2018High-Density).

FAM120C's interactions are not limited to chromatin-related proteins; it is also implicated in RNA processing and signaling pathways, potentially influencing gene expression and cellular stress responses. These interactions highlight FAM120C's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential impact on various biological functions.
