# GINS2

## Overview
GINS2 is a gene that encodes the protein GINS complex subunit 2, a crucial component of the GINS complex involved in DNA replication. The GINS complex, comprising four subunits—Sld5, Psf1, Psf2 (GINS2), and Psf3—plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. This complex is integral to the formation of the CMG helicase, which unwinds the DNA double helix at replication forks, facilitating DNA synthesis (Nabais2021Biallelic; Yu2020Mining). GINS2, as part of this complex, is essential for maintaining genomic stability and ensuring accurate cell division, thereby preventing replication stress and genomic instability (Shen2018Loss). Dysfunction of the GINS2 gene can lead to various clinical conditions, including Meier-Gorlin syndrome and several types of cancer, where it is often overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis (p&gt; GINS2; Tian2020&lt; Nabais2021Biallelic).

## Structure


## Function
The GINS2 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the GINS complex, which plays a vital role in the initiation and progression of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. This complex, along with CDC45 and the MCM2-7 proteins, forms the CMG helicase, which is essential for unwinding the DNA double helix at replication forks, thereby facilitating DNA synthesis (Nabais2021Biallelic; Yu2020Mining). The GINS complex is active in the nucleus, where it ensures accurate DNA replication, contributing to cell cycle progression and maintaining genomic stability (Shen2018Loss).

In healthy human cells, GINS2 is involved in the stages and number of centrosome duplications during cell division, which affects chromosome segregation (Shen2018Loss). Proper functioning of GINS2 is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and ensuring accurate cell division, as it helps prevent replication stress and genomic instability (Nabais2021Biallelic). The GINS2 gene's role in healthy cells is to ensure proper DNA replication, and its dysfunction can lead to conditions like Meier-Gorlin syndrome, characterized by growth delays and craniofacial abnormalities (Nabais2021Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the GINS2 gene have significant clinical implications. In lung adenocarcinoma, GINS2 is overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and increased tumor cell proliferation, migration, and reduced apoptosis. This suggests its role as a prognostic biomarker and its involvement in cancer progression through pathways related to cell cycle regulation and DNA repair (p&gt; GINS2; Tian2020&lt). 

GINS2 is also implicated in Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGORS) when a biallelic variant, p.(Arg114Leu), is present. This variant is associated with craniosynostosis and affects the protein's interaction with components of the CMG helicase complex, crucial for DNA replication. The variant is considered hypomorphic, maintaining partial function, and is rare, with few cases identified (Nabais2021Biallelic).

In various cancers, including cervical, gastric, glioma, and non-small cell lung cancer, GINS2 is upregulated, promoting tumor cell proliferation and migration while inhibiting apoptosis. Its expression correlates with clinicopathological features such as tumor size and metastasis, indicating its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Shan2022GoIchiNiSan). In triple-negative breast cancer, GINS2 overexpression is linked to enhanced cancer stem cell properties and invasion, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Peng2016GINS2).

## Interactions
GINS2, as part of the GINS complex, interacts with several key proteins involved in DNA replication. The GINS complex, which includes the subunits Sld5, Psf1, Psf2 (GINS2), and Psf3, forms a crucial component of the CMG complex (Cdc45-MCM-GINS), essential for helicase activity during DNA replication. GINS2, through the GINS complex, interacts with the MCM2-7 helicase and Cdc45, facilitating the activation of the helicase and the progression of the replication fork (Aparicio2009The; Chang2007Crystal).

The GINS complex is known to mediate interactions between the MCM complex and other replication factors, such as DNA polymerases. It is suggested that GINS2, as part of the GINS complex, may interact with the DNA polymerase α-primase complex, supporting its polymerase activities (Chang2007Crystal). The interactions within the GINS complex are primarily mediated by hydrophobic residues, contributing to its stability and function (Chang2007Crystal).

In yeast, GINS2 is involved in the association of DNA polymerases with replication origins, interacting with proteins like Dpb11 and Sld3, which are crucial for the initiation of DNA replication (Takayama2003GINS). These interactions highlight the essential role of GINS2 in coordinating the assembly and function of the replication machinery.
