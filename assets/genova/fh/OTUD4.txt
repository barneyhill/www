# OTUD4

## Overview
OTUD4 is a gene that encodes the protein OTU deubiquitinase 4, which is a member of the deubiquitinating enzyme family. This protein is characterized by the presence of an ovarian tumor (OTU) domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity in cleaving ubiquitin chains, thereby regulating protein degradation and signaling pathways (Mevissen2013OTU; Das2019New). OTU deubiquitinase 4 is involved in various cellular processes, including immune signaling, DNA repair, and stress response, and it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Zhao2018OTUD4; Das2019New). The protein's interactions with other proteins and RNA suggest its involvement in complex regulatory networks, impacting processes such as stress granule formation and translation regulation (Das2019New; Jaynes2020OTUD4). Dysregulation of OTUD4 has been linked to several diseases, including glioblastoma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Luo2023CSE; Fodder2023Brain; Ci2024OTUD4).

## Structure
The OTUD4 protein is characterized by the presence of an ovarian tumor (OTU) domain, which is essential for its deubiquitinating activity, allowing it to cleave ubiquitin chains (Mevissen2013OTU; Das2019New). It also contains a putative Tudor-like domain, although it lacks classical RNA-binding domains (Das2019New). The protein is predicted to have large portions that are disordered or unfolded, as indicated by the PONDR-VSL2 and foldIndex algorithms (Das2019New). These intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are enriched in glycine, arginine, and lysine residues, which may facilitate RNA interactions (Das2019New).

The C-terminal part of OTUD4 is rich in amino acid motifs such as RGG, RG, RS, and GYSG, which are common in other disordered RNA-binding proteins (Das2019New). OTUD4 is involved in various cellular processes, including stress granule formation and RNA transport, and its function may be regulated by post-translational modifications like phosphorylation (Das2019New). The protein's structure and interactions suggest a role in translation regulation and stress response, potentially linking it to neurodegenerative diseases (Das2019New).

## Function
OTUD4 (OTU deubiquitinase 4) is a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in modulating MyD88-dependent NF-kB signaling, which is essential for innate immune responses. OTUD4 specifically deubiquitinates K63-linked ubiquitin chains on MyD88, a key adaptor protein in IL-1 and TLR signaling pathways, thereby inhibiting NF-kB signaling and preventing hypersensitization of cells (Zhao2018OTUD4).

OTUD4 is also involved in DNA repair processes by stabilizing alkylation repair enzymes such as ALKBH2 and ALKBH3. It interacts with other deubiquitinases like USP7 and USP9X to promote the stability of ALKBH3, independent of its catalytic activity, suggesting a scaffolding function (Zhao2015Noncanonical).

In addition to its roles in immune signaling and DNA repair, OTUD4 is implicated in the regulation of stress granule formation and translation. It is recruited to stress granules during cellular stress and is necessary for their proper formation, impacting cell survival and translation regulation (Das2019New). OTUD4's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress in healthy human cells (Das2019New).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the OTUD4 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In glioblastoma (GBM), a type of brain cancer, OTUD4 is upregulated, with its expression increasing with the clinical grade of glioma. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in GBM patients, as OTUD4 promotes tumor cell proliferation and invasion by stabilizing CDK1 and activating the MAPK signaling pathway (Ci2024OTUD4).

In the context of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, OTUD4 expression is reduced in the lung tissues of smokers and in cigarette smoke extract-induced emphysema mouse models. This downregulation is linked to increased apoptosis in lung epithelial cells, suggesting a protective role of OTUD4 against lung tissue damage (Luo2023CSE).

OTUD4 is also associated with neurodegenerative diseases. It has been identified as a significant locus in DNA methylation changes related to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), particularly in the FTLD-TDP subtypes. Alterations in OTUD4 expression and methylation are linked to changes in neuronal proportions and disease progression (Fodder2023Brain). Additionally, mutations in OTUD4 have been found in a familial form of Gordon Holmes syndrome, characterized by ataxia and hypogonadotropism (Das2019New; Zhao2015Noncanonical).

## Interactions
OTUD4 (OTU deubiquitinase 4) is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with several RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) such as SMN1, HuB, IGF2BP3, G3BP1, and TIAR, which are associated with stress granules. These interactions are partly RNA-dependent, indicating OTUD4's involvement in RNA-protein networks and stress granule dynamics (Das2019New). OTUD4 also binds directly to RNA, including its own mRNA, suggesting a role in RNA regulation despite lacking classical RNA-binding domains (Das2019New).

In the context of TGFβ signaling, OTUD4 interacts with the TGFβ receptor complex, specifically associating with the TβRI and TβRII subunits, which enhances TGFβ signaling by modulating receptor ubiquitination (Jaynes2020OTUD4). OTUD4 also forms complexes with deubiquitinases USP7 and USP9X, stabilizing proteins like ALKBH3 and ALKBH2, which are involved in DNA damage response (Zhao2015Noncanonical). In glioblastoma, OTUD4 interacts with CDK1, stabilizing it by removing specific ubiquitin chains, thus promoting cell proliferation and invasion (Ci2024OTUD4). These interactions highlight OTUD4's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and stress response.
