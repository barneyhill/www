# CMTM3

## Overview
CMTM3, or CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing member 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the chemokine-like factor superfamily. The CMTM3 protein is characterized by its transmembrane nature, containing three putative transmembrane regions and a conserved MARVEL domain, which is associated with vesicle trafficking and membrane apposition events (Zhong2006Characterization). This protein functions as a scaffold for signaling proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways, including the regulation of androgen receptor activity and the NF-κB pathway (Zhang2015CMTM3; Zhang2023CMTM3). CMTM3 is implicated in various cancers, where its expression is often downregulated, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Li2014CMTM3; Su2013CMTM3). The gene's expression and function are influenced by epigenetic modifications, such as promoter methylation, which can lead to its silencing in cancerous tissues (Li2014CMTM3; Su2013CMTM3).

## Structure
The CMTM3 protein is encoded by the CMTM3/CKLFSF3 gene and consists of 182 amino acids, forming a complete open reading frame (Zhong2006Characterization). It is characterized by three putative transmembrane regions, which is atypical for its superfamily members that usually have four (Zhong2006Characterization). The protein is highly hydrophobic, with the N-terminus and one loop located outside the cell membrane, while the C-terminus and another loop are inside the cell membrane (Zhong2006Characterization). A notable feature of CMTM3 is the presence of a MARVEL domain, which is conserved across species and is associated with vesicle trafficking and membrane apposition events (Zhong2006Characterization).

CMTM3 is also known to contain a leucine zipper and two LXXLL motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and may contribute to its function as a scaffold in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane (Li2014CMTM3). The protein is localized to the cytoplasm and may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. The gene has several splice variant isoforms, which can influence its function and localization (Li2014CMTM3).

## Function
CMTM3 (CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing member 3) is a protein that functions as a scaffold for signaling proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear membrane in healthy human cells (Zhang2015CMTM3). It is involved in transducing signals from cell-surface receptors, potentially activating extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), which are crucial for various cellular processes (Zhang2015CMTM3). CMTM3 also plays a role in inhibiting the transcriptional activity of androgen receptors and the expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in LNCaP cells, which are a model for prostate cancer research (Zhang2015CMTM3).

The protein is part of a novel family associated with chemokines and the transmembrane-4 superfamily, indicating its involvement in immune system functions and the male reproductive system (Su2013CMTM3; Zhang2015CMTM3). CMTM3 contains a leucine zipper and two LXXLL motifs, which are structural features that facilitate its role as a scaffold and its localization to the cytoplasm (Hu2015CMTM3). These molecular characteristics suggest that CMTM3 is integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating cell communication and signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
CMTM3 is implicated in various cancers, where its expression is often downregulated or silenced, contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis. In testicular cancer, CMTM3 is frequently downregulated, and its re-expression can suppress cell growth and migration by inducing cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis (Li2014CMTM3). This downregulation is often associated with the methylation of its promoter region (Li2014CMTM3).

In gastric cancer, CMTM3 is silenced or downregulated, primarily due to promoter methylation, and its restoration inhibits cell migration and invasion, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Su2013CMTM3). High CMTM3 expression correlates with a favorable prognosis and higher survival rates in gastric cancer patients (Su2013CMTM3).

CMTM3 is also reduced in prostate cancer, where its expression is linked to tumor differentiation and malignancy. Its re-expression in prostate cancer cells inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion (Hu2015CMTM3).

In colorectal cancer, CMTM3 promoter hypermethylation is associated with cancer initiation and progression, and its re-expression can inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis (Li2017DNA). CMTM3 also plays a role in inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma, further supporting its function as a tumor suppressor (Li2017CKLFLike).

## Interactions
CMTM3 interacts with NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) in gastric epithelial cells, particularly during Helicobacter pylori infection. This interaction is significant as CMTM3 stabilizes NEMO by reducing its ubiquitylation, a modification crucial for NEMO degradation. The stabilization of NEMO by CMTM3 promotes the activation of the NF-κB pathway, which is important for immune response and cell survival. The interaction between CMTM3 and NEMO has been confirmed through various experimental methods, including coimmunoprecipitation, HA-ubiquitin pull-down assay, and immunofluorescence (Zhang2023CMTM3).

CMTM3's role in stabilizing NEMO suggests a functional interaction that may involve direct or indirect binding, although the specific type of ubiquitylation and the detailed mechanism remain to be further investigated (Zhang2023CMTM3). This interaction is crucial for maintaining homeostasis in the immune system and suggests that CMTM3 acts as a positive regulator of the NF-κB pathway during H. pylori infection (Zhang2023CMTM3).
