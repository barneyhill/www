# TKTL2

## Overview
The TKTL2 gene encodes the transketolase-like protein 2, which is a member of the transketolase family of enzymes. This protein plays a crucial role in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), a metabolic pathway that is essential for cellular processes such as nucleotide synthesis and maintaining redox balance through the production of NADPH (Deshpande2019The). Structurally, TKTL2 shares significant similarity with the canonical transketolase (TKT), retaining key catalytic residues necessary for its enzymatic activity, which suggests its functional role as a transketolase in cellular metabolism (Deshpande2019The). The gene's expression has been linked to various cancers, including ovarian and colon cancer, where it may serve as a potential marker or therapeutic target due to its altered expression levels in cancerous tissues (Almutairi2022CancerTestis; Zhao2019Prognostic).

## Structure
The human transketolase-like protein 2 (TKTL2) shares significant structural similarity with the transketolase enzyme (TKT). TKTL2 is 64% identical and 92% conserved compared to TKT in a specific region, indicating a strong structural resemblance (Deshpande2019The). Homology models of TKTL2, based on the crystal structure of human TKT, reveal a close structural alignment with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.3 Å for α-carbon atoms, suggesting a high degree of structural similarity (Deshpande2019The).

The secondary structure of TKTL2 includes a substrate binding cleft similar to that in TKT, which stabilizes the thiamine diphosphate (TDP) cofactor in a similar orientation (Deshpande2019The). The tertiary structure features a cleft between the homodimer surfaces that accommodates the cofactor-substrate, similar to TKT (Deshpande2019The). Key residues involved in substrate binding and interactions with the TDP cofactor include H78, N189, H258, and Q428, which are structurally equivalent to those in TKT (Deshpande2019The).

The quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is crucial for forming a functional active site, as both subunits contribute essential residues (Deshpande2019The). The conservation of catalytic residues, such as E366 and H110, supports TKTL2's function as a transketolase (Deshpande2019The).

## Function
TKTL2 (transketolase-like 2) is a protein involved in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), a crucial metabolic pathway that supports cellular processes by generating ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis and NADPH for reductive biosynthesis and antioxidant defense (Deshpande2019The). TKTL2 is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular growth and maintenance by supporting anabolic reactions and maintaining redox balance (Deshpande2019The).

Structurally, TKTL2 shares significant similarity with the canonical transketolase (TKT), retaining key catalytic residues such as E366, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Deshpande2019The). Unlike TKTL1, TKTL2 retains the H110 residue, suggesting it can function effectively as a transketolase (Deshpande2019The). The protein stabilizes the TDP diphosphate group through hydrogen bonds and coordination with an Mg2+ cation, similar to TKT, allowing it to perform similar functions in binding and stabilizing substrates (Deshpande2019The).

The structural analysis indicates that TKTL2 maintains a substrate binding and stabilization mechanism akin to TKT, suggesting its potential functional role as a transketolase in cellular processes (Deshpande2019The). This functional similarity to TKT implies that TKTL2 plays a significant role in the transfer of 2-carbon ketose groups, contributing to metabolic pathways essential for cell biology (Deshpande2019The).

## Clinical Significance
The TKTL2 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In ovarian cancer, high mRNA expression of TKTL2 is associated with unfavorable progression-free survival (PFS) in patients, particularly those with serous ovarian cancer. However, this correlation is not observed in patients with endometrioid ovarian cancer. High TKTL2 expression is also linked to poor overall survival (OS) in ovarian cancer patients, although this association does not extend to specific subtypes like serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer (Zhao2019Prognostic).

In colon cancer, TKTL2 expression is elevated in cancerous tissues compared to normal colon tissues, suggesting its potential role as a cancer marker or therapeutic target. The gene is expressed in 25% of colon cancer tissues, indicating its involvement in colon cancer pathology (Almutairi2022CancerTestis).

TKTL2 expression is also noted in certain types of leukemia, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL), but not in breast cancer samples, suggesting a degree of specificity in its expression across different cancer types (Almutairi2022CancerTestis). The role of TKTL2 in lung adenocarcinoma has been highlighted, with increased expression levels observed in cancer tissues, although its clinical significance in this context requires further elucidation (Niu2022Transketolase).
