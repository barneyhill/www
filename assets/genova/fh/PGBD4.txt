# PGBD4

## Overview
PGBD4 is a gene that encodes the protein piggyBac transposable element derived 4, which is part of the piggyBac transposable element-derived family. This protein is categorized as a transposase, which is an enzyme that facilitates the movement of transposable elements within the genome. Transposases like piggyBac transposable element derived 4 are crucial for genomic rearrangements and can influence gene expression and genome stability. The PGBD4 gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential roles in genomic evolution and their implications in various biological processes and diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
