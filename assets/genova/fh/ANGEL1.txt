# ANGEL1

## Overview
ANGEL1 is a gene that encodes the protein angel homolog 1, which is a member of the CCR4 family and functions primarily as a 2',3' cyclic phosphatase. This protein plays a pivotal role in the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway, a critical cellular mechanism that ensures the fidelity of protein synthesis by degrading mRNAs associated with stalled ribosomes. ANGEL1 is essential for maintaining proteome integrity by preventing the accumulation of aberrant proteins, particularly those arising from mRNAs lacking stop codons. The protein is known to interact with various components of the RQC pathway, including RACK1, LTN1, ubiquitin, and the SKI complex, and is localized predominantly in the cytoplasmic perinuclear area, suggesting a functional association with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Additionally, ANGEL1 has been identified as a binding partner of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), although this interaction does not significantly impact global protein synthesis rates (NicholsonShaw2022The; Gosselin2013Tracking).

## Function
The ANGEL1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a 2',3' cyclic phosphatase, playing a crucial role in the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway in human cells. This pathway is responsible for the degradation of mRNAs associated with stalled ribosomes, ensuring the integrity of the proteome by preventing the production of potentially toxic non-functional protein products. ANGEL1 is a rate-limiting factor in the degradation of mRNA during RQC, particularly for mRNAs lacking stop codons, and its catalytic activity is essential for this function (NicholsonShaw2022The).

ANGEL1 associates with several components of the RQC pathway, including RACK1, LTN1, ubiquitin, and the SKI complex, indicating its involvement in protein-mediated interactions independent of RNA. It also binds to coding regions of mRNAs and sequence features correlated with stalled ribosomes, such as guanosine-rich sequences (NicholsonShaw2022The). Additionally, ANGEL1 interacts with eIF4E, a key player in translation initiation, through a specific eIF4E-binding motif, although this interaction does not significantly affect global protein synthesis rates (Gosselin2013Tracking). ANGEL1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasmic perinuclear area, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, suggesting a role related to these cellular structures (Gosselin2013Tracking).

## Interactions
ANGEL1, a member of the CCR4 family, interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes. It has been identified as a new partner of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a key player in the initiation of translation. This interaction is mediated through a consensus eIF4E-binding motif, which ANGEL1 shares with other proteins like eIF4GI and 4E-BP1. The interaction between ANGEL1 and eIF4E has been confirmed through affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation experiments (Gosselin2013Tracking).

ANGEL1 also associates with components of the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway, including RACK1, LTN1, ubiquitin, and the SKI complex. These interactions are largely protein-mediated and resistant to RNase A treatment, indicating they are independent of RNA (NicholsonShaw2022The). ANGEL1 is involved in mRNA degradation during RQC, associating with coding regions of mRNAs, particularly those with sequence features correlated with stalled ribosomes (NicholsonShaw2022The).

Additionally, ANGEL1 interacts with the GATOR2 complex, which is involved in mTORC1 activation, and proteins important for neuronal cytoskeletal functions (NicholsonShaw2022The). These interactions suggest a multifaceted role for ANGEL1 in cellular regulation and mRNA processing.
