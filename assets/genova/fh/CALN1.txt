# CALN1

## Overview
The CALN1 gene encodes the protein calneuron 1, a calcium-binding protein that belongs to the calmodulin superfamily. Calneuron 1 is primarily expressed in the brain and plays a significant role in calcium signaling pathways, which are essential for various cellular processes, including learning and memory (Wu2001Identification). The protein is characterized by its EF-hand domains, which facilitate calcium binding, thereby influencing intracellular calcium levels and signaling. Calneuron 1 is notably involved in the regulation of Golgi to plasma membrane trafficking by modulating the activity of phosphatidylinositol 4-OH kinase IIIβ (PI-4KIIIβ) in response to calcium levels, a function critical for maintaining neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity (Mundhenk2019Caldendrin). Additionally, calneuron 1 interacts with various receptors, including G-protein coupled receptors, and is implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, highlighting its clinical significance (Lisek2024CalciumAssociated; Xia2015Experimental).

## Function
The CALN1 (calneuron 1) gene encodes a calcium-binding protein that is part of the calmodulin superfamily, primarily expressed in the brain. CALN1 is involved in calcium signaling pathways, which are crucial for various cellular processes, including learning and memory. The protein contains EF-hand domains, which are known for their calcium-binding capabilities, suggesting a role in regulating intracellular calcium levels and signaling (Wu2001Identification).

CALN1 is highly expressed in regions of the brain such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, areas critical for cognitive functions. Its expression increases significantly during the second postnatal week in mice, aligning with the development of learning capabilities, indicating its involvement in cognitive development and neuronal function (Wu2001Identification).

In terms of cellular localization, CALN1 is associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it regulates Golgi to plasma membrane trafficking. It plays a role in controlling the trafficking of proteins by modulating the activity of phosphatidylinositol 4-OH kinase IIIβ (PI-4KIIIβ) in response to calcium levels, establishing a calcium threshold for enzyme activation (Mundhenk2019Caldendrin). This function is crucial for maintaining normal neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity.

## Clinical Significance
The CALN1 gene has been implicated in schizophrenia, a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder. Research indicates that alterations in CALN1 expression can significantly disrupt human forebrain development, leading to schizophrenia-like symptoms. Knockout studies in both organoids and mice have shown that the absence of CALN1 results in severe dysregulation of gene expression networks, affecting pathways related to neuron-to-neuron synapse, neuron migration, and axonogenesis. These disruptions contribute to delayed neuronal maturation and deficits in gliogenesis, which are critical for proper neuronal activity and connections (Li2024Calneuron).

In animal models, CALN1 knockout mice exhibit behaviors associated with hallucinations, such as spontaneous startle and head-twitch responses. These behaviors are considered analogous to hallucination-like symptoms in humans and can be mitigated by the antipsychotic drug SEP-363856, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Li2024Calneuron). The gene's role in schizophrenia is further supported by its significant impact on gene expression profiles in forebrain organoids, where it induces the most severe perturbations among studied schizophrenia risk genes (Li2024Calneuron). These findings underscore the critical role of CALN1 in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, highlighting its potential as a target for future therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
CALN1 (calneuron 1) is involved in several interactions that influence neuronal signaling and function. It regulates the activity of phosphatidylinositol 4-OH kinase IIIβ (PI4KIIIβ) by inhibiting it at low calcium levels, which affects vesicle assembly in the trans-Golgi network (Lisek2024CalciumAssociated; Mundhenk2019Caldendrin). This inhibition is released at higher calcium levels, allowing PI4KIIIβ activation (Mundhenk2019Caldendrin).

CALN1 also interacts with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), specifically modulating the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR)-dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) heteromers, which are targets for treating Parkinson's disease and other neuropsychiatric disorders (Lisek2024CalciumAssociated). Additionally, CALN1 interacts with the cannabinoid CB1 receptor in a calcium-dependent manner, blocking Gi-mediated signaling (Lisek2024CalciumAssociated).

CALN1 is a target of microRNA-137 (miR-137), which downregulates its expression by binding to its 3′UTR, a mechanism implicated in schizophrenia (Xia2015Experimental). Exosomal miR-675 also targets CALN1, promoting cell migration and invasion in metastatic osteosarcoma by downregulating CALN1 expression (Gong2018Exosomal).
