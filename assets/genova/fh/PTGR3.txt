# PTGR3

## Overview
PTGR3, or prostaglandin reductase 3, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the metabolism of prostaglandins, specifically functioning as a 15-oxoprostaglandin-Δ13-reductase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the conversion of 15-keto-PGE2 to 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2, thereby modulating the bioactive levels of prostaglandins that influence adipogenesis through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) pathway (Yu2013Prostaglandin). PTGR3 is expressed in various tissues, including heart and adipose tissues, and is particularly active in the stromal vascular fractions of adipose tissue (Yu2013Prostaglandin). The enzyme's activity is NADPH-dependent, and it is involved in the broader metabolism of prostaglandins, impacting processes such as adipocyte differentiation and potentially influencing metabolic disorders like obesity (Yu2013Prostaglandin).

## Function
Prostaglandin reductase 3 (PTGR3) is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of prostaglandins, specifically functioning as a 15-oxoprostaglandin-Δ13-reductase. It catalyzes the conversion of 15-keto-PGE2 to 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2, a process that reduces the bioactive levels of 15-keto-PGE2, a ligand for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) (Yu2013Prostaglandin). This enzymatic activity is significant in modulating adipogenesis, as PTGR3 negatively regulates adipocyte differentiation by decreasing the proadipogenic effects of 15-keto-PGE2 through the regulation of PPARγ activity (Yu2013Prostaglandin).

PTGR3 is expressed in various tissues, including heart, brown adipose tissue, and white adipose tissue, and is particularly active in the stromal vascular fractions of adipose tissue rather than in mature adipocytes (Yu2013Prostaglandin). During the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes, PTGR3 expression decreases, suggesting its role in early stages of adipogenesis (Yu2013Prostaglandin). The enzyme's activity is NADPH-dependent, and it also metabolizes other prostaglandins, such as 15-keto-PGF2α, 15-keto-PGF1α, and 15-keto-PGE1, indicating its broader role in prostaglandin metabolism (Yu2013Prostaglandin).

## Clinical Significance
PTGR3 (prostaglandin reductase 3) plays a significant role in adipogenesis and is implicated in metabolic disorders, particularly obesity. Alterations in PTGR3 expression have been linked to increased adipogenesis, as its downregulation is associated with enhanced adipocyte differentiation and increased intracellular triglyceride levels. This suggests that PTGR3 acts as a negative regulator of adipogenesis by modulating PPARγ activity, a key regulator of fat cell development (Yu2013Prostaglandin).

In murine models of obesity, PTGR3 expression is notably decreased in white adipose tissue, indicating its potential role as a modulator of adiposity. The knockdown of PTGR3 in 3T3-L1 cells accelerates adipocyte differentiation, further supporting its involvement in fat accumulation and metabolism (Yu2013Prostaglandin).

While specific diseases directly resulting from PTGR3 mutations are not detailed, its dysregulation is suggested to be linked to metabolic disorders characterized by altered adipogenesis. The study of PTGR3 provides a foundation for understanding its clinical significance in metabolic health and disease, particularly in the context of obesity and related conditions (Yu2013Prostaglandin).

## Interactions
PTGR3, or prostaglandin reductase 3, is involved in the regulation of adipogenesis through its interaction with PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma). PTGR3 negatively regulates adipocyte differentiation by modulating PPARγ activity. It achieves this by converting 15-keto-PGE2, a substrate that enhances adipogenesis by activating PPARγ, into an inactive form, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2, thereby reducing PPARγ activation (Yu2013Prostaglandin). 

The interaction between PTGR3 and PPARγ has been demonstrated in transfection experiments, where overexpression of PTGR3 in 293 cells reduced the 15-keto-PGE2-mediated transactivation of PPARγ in a dose-dependent manner (Yu2013Prostaglandin). Knockdown of PTGR3 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes led to accelerated differentiation and increased expression of adipogenic markers, indicating its inhibitory role in adipogenesis (Yu2013Prostaglandin). 

While PTGR3 shares some homology with PTGR2, specific interactions of PTGR3 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its regulatory effect on PPARγ are not detailed in the available literature (Tseng2021Increasing).
