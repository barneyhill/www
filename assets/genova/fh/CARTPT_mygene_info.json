multiple biologically active peptides. These peptides play a role in appetite, energy balance, maintenance of body weight, reward and addiction, and the stress response. Expression of a similar gene transcript in rodents is upregulated following administration of cocaine and amphetamine. Mutations in this gene are associated with susceptibility to obesity in humans.
