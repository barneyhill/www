# CFAP119

## Overview
CFAP119 is a gene that encodes the protein cilia and flagella associated protein 119, which plays a crucial role in the structural assembly and stability of axonemes, the core components of cilia and flagella. These structures are essential for cellular functions such as movement, fluid flow, and sensory activities. The CFAP119 protein is particularly significant in the context of mammalian sperm, where it is a component of the central apparatus of the sperm axoneme, specifically associated with the C1a and C1e projections. It is part of a complex that includes other proteins like SPAG17, MORN2, and DPY30, which are vital for the assembly and stability of these projections (Zhu2024Incell). Mutations in the CFAP119 gene have been linked to reproductive and immune issues, highlighting its importance in maintaining the structural integrity of ciliary and flagellar structures (Nakade2022Frame; Peers2024Gene).

## Function
CFAP119, or cilia and flagella associated protein 119, is involved in the structural assembly and stability of axonemes, which are the core components of cilia and flagella. These hair-like structures are essential for various cellular functions, including movement, fluid flow, and sensory activities. In the context of mammalian sperm, CFAP119 is a component of the central apparatus of the sperm axoneme, specifically associated with the C1a and C1e projections. It is part of a complex that includes proteins such as SPAG17, MORN2, and DPY30, which are crucial for the assembly and stability of these projections (Zhu2024Incell).

The role of CFAP119 in healthy human cells is implied to be significant in maintaining the structural integrity of cilia and flagella, which are vital for proper cellular signaling and motility. Although specific functions in human cells are not detailed, its involvement in the axoneme suggests a critical role in ensuring the proper function of ciliary and flagellar structures, impacting processes such as sperm motility and potentially other ciliary functions in different cell types (Zhu2024Incell).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP119 gene have been implicated in several health issues, particularly affecting male fertility and immunity. In cheetahs, CFAP119 is one of the genes with premature termination codons (PTCs) shared among all individuals studied, which may contribute to defects in male fertility and immunity, both known issues in cheetah populations (Peers2024Gene). The gene's pseudogenization is linked to sterility, including azoospermia, a condition characterized by the absence of sperm in semen, which is common in cheetahs (Peers2024Gene).

In humans, CFAP119 is associated with the structure and function of cilia and flagella. Alterations in this gene can lead to ciliopathies, a group of disorders caused by ciliary dysfunction. These conditions may result in primary ciliary dyskinesia, which is characterized by respiratory issues, infertility, and other systemic problems. Although specific human diseases directly linked to CFAP119 mutations are not detailed in the provided context, the gene's role in ciliary function suggests its potential involvement in such disorders (Nakade2022Frame). The study of CFAP119 in various species highlights its importance in reproductive health and immune function, with potential implications for understanding similar conditions in humans.

## Interactions
CFAP119 is a component of the central apparatus (CA) in the mammalian sperm axoneme, specifically associated with the C1a and C1e projections. It is part of a structural assembly that includes other proteins such as SPAG17, MORN2, and DPY30. The C1a projection assembly is centered around the rachis protein SPATA17, which binds to SPAG6, while the SPAG17-DPY30 complex forms the head of both C1a and C1e projections. Although the specific physical interactions of CFAP119 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, it is implied to be integral to the structural assembly of these projections (Zhu2024Incell). 

The role of CFAP119 in the CA suggests it may participate in multiprotein complexes essential for the stability and function of the axoneme, contributing to processes like ciliary movement. However, the context does not provide explicit details on any direct interactions with nucleic acids or transient interactions such as activating or inhibitory roles. The evolutionary differences in the C1a projections between mammals and other species, such as C. reinhardtii, highlight the unique composition of the mammalian CA, where CFAP119 is a significant component (Zhu2024Incell).
