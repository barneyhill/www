# FAM83A

## Overview
FAM83A is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 83, specifically member A. This protein is characterized by the presence of several domains, including the Domain of Unknown Function 1669 (DUF1669), which is involved in protein-protein interactions crucial for its role in oncogenesis (Lee2012FAM83A; Marino2022FAM83A). FAM83A is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in cancer progression, where it interacts with key signaling molecules such as β-catenin and TCF4, influencing pathways like Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Zhou2023Blymphoid). The protein is also involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and transcriptional regulation, contributing to its oncogenic potential (Marino2022FAM83A). Due to its significant role in cancer biology, FAM83A is considered a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in cancers such as breast and lung cancer (Snijders2017FAM83).

## Structure
FAM83A is a 434-amino acid protein that contains several specific domains, including the Domain of Unknown Function 1669 (DUF1669), serine-rich domains, and proline-rich domains (PRDs) (Lee2012FAM83A; Marino2022FAM83A). The DUF1669 domain is located at the N-terminus and is involved in interactions with other proteins, such as β-catenin, AXIN1, and GSK3β, which are crucial for its role in cancer progression (Zhou2023Blymphoid). The proline-rich domains contain a conserved PxxP motif that interacts with Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing proteins (Lee2012FAM83A).

FAM83A undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by B-lymphoid tyrosine kinase (BLK) at tyrosine 138, which enhances its oncogenic potential (Zhou2023Blymphoid). This phosphorylation affects its interaction with β-catenin and TCF4, influencing Wnt/β-catenin signaling and transcriptional activity (Zhou2023Blymphoid).

The protein has several splice variants, encoding four isoforms, with variants 3, 4, and 5 showing abundant expression in tumor specimens (Yuan2024Promotion). These isoforms may contribute to its diverse roles in different cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer.

## Clinical Significance
FAM83A is implicated in several cancers, notably breast and lung cancer, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapies. In breast cancer, FAM83A is highly expressed in tumor tissues and linked to adverse survival outcomes. It interacts with c-RAF and PI3K p85, leading to resistance against EGFR-TKIs, and its expression enhances cell proliferation and invasion (Jin2022Comprehensive). FAM83A is also overexpressed in HER2+ breast cancers, including those resistant to trastuzumab, and is associated with shortened survival (Marino2022FAM83A).

In lung cancer, particularly non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), FAM83A is significantly upregulated and correlates with reduced overall survival. It promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasion by regulating pathways such as Wnt, Hippo, and EMT (Gan2020Systematic; Wang2021FAM83A). FAM83A's expression is higher in tumors with EGFR mutations, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target specific to EGFR mutant cancers (Cai2019Systematic).

Overall, FAM83A's role in cancer progression and treatment resistance highlights its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers (Snijders2017FAM83).

## Interactions
FAM83A interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cancer progression, particularly in pancreatic and breast cancers. In pancreatic cancer, FAM83A is phosphorylated by B-lymphoid tyrosine kinase (BLK) at tyrosine 138, which enhances its interaction with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction inhibits the assembly of the β-catenin destruction complex, stabilizing β-catenin and promoting its nuclear translocation, which enhances transcriptional activity of Wnt target genes (Zhou2023Blymphoid). FAM83A also interacts with TCF4, affecting histone acetylation and transcriptional regulation of Wnt target genes (Zhou2023Blymphoid).

In breast cancer, FAM83A interacts with proteins involved in cytoskeleton reorganization, such as LIMA1, PLEC, MYL6, and MYH10, in hTERT-immortalized breast epithelial cells. In primary epithelial cells, it interacts with DDX3X and LAMB3, which are involved in post-transcriptional regulation and cell adhesion, respectively (Marino2022FAM83A). FAM83A also interacts with c-Raf and other proteins, suggesting its involvement in pro-oncogenic signaling pathways (Marino2022FAM83A). These interactions highlight FAM83A's role in promoting cell proliferation and its potential as a biomarker for cancer initiation.
