# RBBP8

## Overview
RBBP8 is a gene that encodes the RB binding protein 8, endonuclease, commonly referred to as CtIP. This protein is a nuclear adaptor involved in critical cellular processes, particularly DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. CtIP is characterized as an endonuclease with a largely intrinsically disordered structure, featuring conserved domains that facilitate its interactions with other proteins and DNA. It plays a pivotal role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through homologous recombination, a process essential for maintaining genomic stability. CtIP's interactions with key proteins such as BRCA1 and the MRN complex underscore its importance in DNA end resection and checkpoint regulation during the cell cycle. The gene's clinical significance is highlighted by its association with various genetic disorders and cancer predispositions, making it a subject of interest in genomic stability and cancer research (Yan2023A; Mozaffari2021Human).

## Structure
The RBBP8 gene encodes the CtIP protein, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. CtIP is characterized by a largely intrinsically disordered structure with two conserved domains at the N- and C-terminus. The N-terminal domain contains coiled-coil heptad repeats that facilitate CtIP dimerization, contributing to its quaternary structure (Mozaffari2021Human). The C-terminal domain is Sae2-like and includes a conserved DNA binding motif, enabling CtIP to form protein-DNA filaments and promote DNA bridging (Mozaffari2021Human).

CtIP also contains a tetramerisation motif and an extended coiled-coil region, along with an unstructured central region. It features non-canonical nuclease motifs and specific protein interaction sites, which are crucial for its function in DNA repair pathways (Mozaffari2021Human). The protein undergoes phosphorylation, a common post-translational modification, which is essential for its interactions and functions in DNA repair, particularly CDK-mediated phosphorylation at specific sites (Mozaffari2021Human).

CtIP's structure and interactions are vital for its role in DNA end resection, promoting homology-directed repair mechanisms and influencing the choice between different DNA repair pathways (Mozaffari2021Human).

## Function
RBBP8, also known as CtIP, is a nuclear adaptor protein involved in crucial molecular processes related to DNA metabolism and genome stability. It plays a significant role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through homologous recombination, a process essential for maintaining genome integrity (Mozaffari2021Human). RBBP8 facilitates DNA end resection, a critical step in homologous recombination, by interacting with the MRN complex to promote nucleolytic processing of DSBs (Mozaffari2021Human). This interaction is necessary for the formation of the CtIP-BRCA1 complex, which is crucial for the G2/M transition checkpoint, thereby influencing cell cycle regulation (Mozaffari2021Human).

RBBP8 also plays a role in transcriptional regulation, particularly during the G1/S transition, and is involved in DNA damage checkpoint signaling and replication fork protection (Mozaffari2021Human). Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its interactions with other proteins and its stability (Mozaffari2021Human). By modulating these processes, RBBP8 contributes to genomic stability and prevents tumorigenesis, highlighting its dual role in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (Mozaffari2021Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RBBP8 gene, which encodes the CtIP protein, have significant clinical implications. Biallelic hypomorphic variants of CtIP, leading to C-terminal truncated proteins, are associated with Jawad and Seckel syndromes. These conditions are characterized by severe microcephaly and mental retardation, but they do not predispose individuals to cancer (Mozaffari2021Human; Agha2014A). In cancer research, CtIP has been linked to breast cancer risk, particularly in individuals with BRCA1 mutations. Certain frameshift variants have been identified in early-onset breast cancer patients without BRCA1 mutations, suggesting a role in cancer predisposition (Zarrizi2020Germline; Mozaffari2021Human).

A novel germline mutation, RBBP8 (c.841G>T), has been identified in a Chinese family with a history of various cancers, including breast, liver, lung, gastric, and thyroid cancers. This mutation results in a truncated protein that loses its binding site to BRCA1, promoting tumorigenesis and increasing sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (Yan2023A). Additionally, epigenetic inactivation of RBBP8 through methylation has been observed in urothelial bladder carcinoma, correlating with reduced gene expression and poorer progression-free survival (Mohanad2022Epigenetic). These findings highlight the diverse roles of RBBP8 in various diseases and its potential as a biomarker for cancer predisposition and treatment response.

## Interactions
RBBP8, also known as CtIP, is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. It interacts with BRCA1, a well-known tumor suppressor, forming a complex that is essential for DNA end resection during homologous recombination repair. This interaction is critical for maintaining genome integrity and is regulated by phosphorylation (Mozaffari2021Human).

RBBP8 also associates with the MRN complex, which includes MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1, to facilitate DNA end resection. This interaction is necessary for the recruitment of other proteins like BLM and Exo1 to DNA double-strand breaks, promoting homologous recombination (Wang2013The). The interaction with NBS1 is particularly important for the phosphorylation of CtIP, which is crucial for its function in DNA repair (Wang2013The).

In gastric cancer, RBBP8 interacts with CtBP and BRCA1 to suppress the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. This suppression is mediated by the recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC) to the p21 promoter, leading to reduced histone acetylation and transcriptional repression (Yu2019RBBP8CtIP). These interactions highlight RBBP8's dual role in DNA repair and tumorigenesis.
