# CAP2

## Overview
Cyclase-associated protein 2 (CAP2) is a gene that encodes the cyclase-associated actin cytoskeleton regulatory protein 2, a key player in actin filament dynamics. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein involved in the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including muscle contraction, cell motility, and synaptic plasticity. CAP2 is particularly significant in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, where it contributes to the structural integrity and function of sarcomeres, the fundamental units of muscle contraction. Additionally, CAP2 is expressed in the brain, where it influences neuron structure and synaptic function. Mutations or deficiencies in CAP2 have been linked to cardiac conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias, underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining cardiac health (Aspit2018CAP2; Rust2020CAPt’n).

## Structure
Cyclase-associated protein 2 (CAP2) is a multifunctional protein involved in actin filament dynamics. The molecular structure of CAP2 includes several distinct domains and motifs. The N-terminal domain contains a coiled-coil region followed by a helical folded domain (HFD), which is crucial for oligomerization and interaction with F-actin, enhancing cofilin-mediated actin disassembly (Purde2019Oligomerization; Rust2020CAPt’n). The HFD forms a bundle of six antiparallel α-helices, a structure conserved across species (Pelucchi2020Cyclaseassociated).

The central region of CAP2 includes two proline-rich motifs and a WASP homology 2 (WH2) domain, which are involved in actin nucleation and elongation (Rust2020CAPt’n). The C-terminal region forms a β-sheet structure, known as the CAP and Retinitis Pigmentosa Protein 2 (CARP) domain, which participates in homodimer formation and binds ADP-G-actin with high affinity (Rust2020CAPt’n).

CAP2 can form disulfide-crosslinked dimers, with the N-terminal region and Cys 32 residue being critical for this dimerization, which is essential for its function in actin turnover and synaptic plasticity (Pelucchi2020Cyclaseassociated). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, and alternative splicing can lead to different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and localization.

## Function
The CAP2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in actin filament dynamics, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of cells, particularly in the heart and skeletal muscle. In healthy human cells, CAP2 is involved in the precise control of actin filament length, contributing to the structural integrity and force-generating capacity of the heart muscle. This control is vital for the proper function of sarcomeres, the basic units of muscle contraction (Aspit2018CAP2).

CAP2 regulates the termination of actin polymerization at specific sites within the sarcomere, such as the Z-disc and A-band region, and influences the balance between G-actin and F-actin, which is critical for the rapid turnover of actin filaments in actively contracting cells (Aspit2018CAP2). The protein interacts with cofilin and twinfilin to promote actin filament severing and depolymerization, facilitating high rates of actin turnover (Aspit2018CAP2).

In addition to its role in muscle cells, CAP2 is expressed in the brain, where it affects neuron structure and synaptic plasticity, interacting with Cofilin1 to influence spine morphology and synaptic transmission (Rust2020CAPt’n). CAP2's function in these processes requires its ability to form disulfide cross-linked homodimers, which are crucial for its interaction with Cofilin1 and subsequent actin depolymerization (Rust2020CAPt’n).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CAP2 gene have been linked to several cardiac conditions, most notably dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and supraventricular tachycardia. In a study involving a Bedouin family, a specific mutation in the CAP2 gene was identified, which affects the splicing of exons 6 and 7, leading to the deletion of 64 amino acids in the protein. This mutation results in impaired actin dynamics, crucial for heart function, and is associated with DCM and cardiac conduction disease (Aspit2018CAP2).

In mouse models, CAP2 deficiency leads to cardiomyopathy characterized by ventricular and atrial dilation, cardiac fibrosis, and increased apoptosis in the myocardium. These structural and functional heart defects are due to the essential role of CAP2 in maintaining sarcomeric organization in cardiac tissue (Peche2012Ablation). CAP2 deficiency also results in arrhythmias, including atrioventricular blocks and sinus arrests, due to altered connexin distribution and increased myocardial fibrosis (Stöckigt2016Deficiency).

Overall, CAP2 mutations and deficiencies disrupt actin filament dynamics and sarcomere integrity, leading to significant cardiac abnormalities and increased susceptibility to arrhythmias and heart failure.

## Interactions
CAP2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cellular processes. It interacts with n-cofilin through its C-terminal domain, with a preference for the unphosphorylated form of n-cofilin, which is active in actin depolymerization (Kumar2016Neuronal). CAP2 also forms disulfide cross-linked homodimers, which are essential for its interaction with Cofilin1, a key regulator of actin dynamics (Rust2020CAPt’n).

In the context of cancer, CAP2 interacts with RACK1, a scaffold protein, through its N-terminal domain. This interaction is crucial for activating the FAK/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, promoting gastric cancer metastasis (Zhang2023CAP2). CAP2 competes with SRC for binding to RACK1, leading to the release and phosphorylation of SRC, which further activates the ERK pathway (Zhang2023CAP2).

CAP2 also interacts with actin, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating its role in actin filament dynamics (Hubberstey1996Mammalian). These interactions highlight CAP2's involvement in both neuronal and cancer-related processes, influencing cell shape, motility, and signaling pathways.
