# TLE2

## Overview
TLE2 (Transducin-Like Enhancer of Split 2) is a gene that encodes a transcriptional corepressor protein, which is a member of the Groucho/TLE family. This family of proteins is characterized by their role in transcriptional repression, achieved through interactions with DNA-bound repressor proteins rather than direct DNA binding. The TLE2 protein is involved in several critical cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, by modulating transcriptional activity in pathways such as Notch and Wnt signaling. It plays a significant role in the development and maturation of pancreatic endocrine cells and is implicated in various signaling pathways that influence neurogenesis and hematopoiesis (Chen2000GrouchoTLE; Agarwal2015The). TLE2's involvement in these pathways highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on disease states, particularly in cancer, where its expression levels have been associated with clinical outcomes (Wu2019ANLN; Hu2020TLE2).

## Structure


## Function
TLE2 (Transducin-Like Enhancer of Split 2) is a transcriptional corepressor involved in various molecular processes crucial for cell differentiation and development. It is a member of the Groucho/TLE family of proteins, which do not bind directly to DNA but are recruited by DNA-bound repressor proteins to modulate transcription. TLE2 interacts with several transcription factors, including Nkx2-2, Nkx6-1, Hes1, and Arx, which are essential for the development and maturation of pancreatic endocrine cells (Hoffman2008Expression). 

In the pancreas, TLE2 is expressed in major hormone-producing cell types and plays a role in maintaining progenitor cells and facilitating the maturation of specialized endocrine cells (Hoffman2008Expression). It is involved in the Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining progenitor states and regulating cell differentiation (Hoffman2008Expression). TLE2 also modulates the repressive abilities of Arx, impacting the specification of β-cells (Hoffman2008Expression).

TLE2 is active in the nucleus, where it forms transcription repression complexes, influencing pathways like Wnt signaling and impacting processes such as neurogenesis and hematopoiesis (Chen2000GrouchoTLE; Agarwal2015The).

## Clinical Significance
TLE2 has been implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression levels associated with significant clinical outcomes. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), high TLE2 expression correlates with better overall survival and disease-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. Overexpression of TLE2 in PDAC cell lines reduces proliferation and increases sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine, indicating a tumor suppressor role (Hu2020TLE2).

In muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), TLE2 is predominantly expressed in luminal subtypes and is associated with favorable overall survival and disease-free survival. Its expression is inversely correlated with oncogenic pathways, supporting its role as a tumor suppressor. TLE2 expression is also linked to better prognosis in lower-stage tumors, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for prognostic prediction (Wu2019ANLN).

In endometrial cancer, TLE2 is down-regulated, particularly in serous cancers, and this down-regulation is associated with shorter survival. This suggests that decreased TLE2 expression may lead to increased Wnt signaling, promoting tumor growth and reducing survival (Carlson2013TLE2). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TLE2 expression alterations in cancer prognosis and treatment strategies.

## Interactions
TLE2, a transcriptional corepressor, participates in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in transcriptional repression. TLE2 interacts with Hairy/Enhancer of Split (HES) proteins, which are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors involved in the Notch signaling pathway. This interaction is essential for the repression of proneural genes, which promote neural fate (Grbavec1998Transducin‐like). TLE2 also forms homodimers and heterodimers with TLE1, mediated by its amino-terminal domain, which overlaps with its dimerization domain (Grbavec1998Transducin‐like).

In addition to its interactions with HES proteins, TLE2 is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. It interacts with components such as β-catenin (CTNNB1), TCF7, and LEF1, suggesting a role in modulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is important in tumorigenesis and cancer development (Wu2019ANLN). TLE2 also interacts with UTY and UTX proteins, which are related to the yeast transcriptional co-repressor SSN6, indicating a conserved mechanism of transcriptional repression across species (GRBAVEC1999Grouchotransducinlike). These interactions highlight TLE2's role in regulating gene expression through its involvement in multiprotein complexes and signaling pathways.
