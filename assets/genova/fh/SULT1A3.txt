# SULT1A3

## Overview
SULT1A3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme sulfotransferase family 1A member 3, a cytosolic enzyme involved in the sulfation of monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and catecholamines. This enzyme belongs to the sulfotransferase family, characterized by its ability to transfer sulfuryl groups from the co-factor 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to various substrates, facilitating their metabolism and excretion (Kurogi2021SULT; Toth2023Role). SULT1A3 is predominantly expressed in the small intestine and plays a crucial role in the presystemic inactivation of numerous compounds, including drugs and dietary substances (Riches2009Quantitative). The enzyme's activity is influenced by genetic polymorphisms, which can affect drug metabolism and efficacy (Bairam2019Impact). Additionally, SULT1A3 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and liver diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Xie2020The; Kurogi2021SULT).

## Structure
The SULT1A3 protein is a member of the sulfotransferase enzyme family, characterized by a classical cytosolic SULT fold with an alpha/beta motif. Its primary structure consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that contribute to its unique substrate specificity, particularly for monoamines like dopamine (Lu2005Crystal). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a central four-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices and loops (AllaliHassani2007Structural). 

The tertiary structure of SULT1A3 features a Rossmann fold, a common structural motif in sulfotransferases, which facilitates its enzymatic activity (Yoshinari2001Crystal). This structure is crucial for the binding of the cofactor 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP) and the substrate dopamine, with specific residues such as Glu146 and Asp86 playing key roles in substrate binding and specificity (Lu2005Crystal). 

SULT1A3 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and stability. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, allowing for functional diversity (AllaliHassani2007Structural). The quaternary structure involves the formation of monomers, each capable of binding a PAP and a dopamine molecule (Lu2005Crystal).

## Function
SULT1A3 is a human cytosolic sulfotransferase enzyme primarily involved in the sulfation of monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, and catecholamines, including epinephrine and norepinephrine (Kurogi2021SULT; Toth2023Role). This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a sulfuryl group from the co-factor 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to these substrates, a process crucial for their metabolism, inactivation, and excretion (Kurogi2021SULT; Toth2023Role). SULT1A3 is predominantly expressed in the small intestine, where it plays a significant role in the presystemic inactivation of various compounds, including drugs and dietary substances (Riches2009Quantitative; Kurogi2021SULT).

The enzyme's structure is characterized by high flexibility, particularly in the loop regions L2 and L3, which are essential for substrate recognition and binding (Toth2023Role). This flexibility allows SULT1A3 to selectively bind and metabolize specific compounds, contributing to its substrate specificity (Toth2023Role). SULT1A3's activity is also influenced by genetic polymorphisms, which can affect its sulfating activity and, consequently, the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of drugs metabolized by this enzyme (Bairam2019Impact; Kurogi2021SULT).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and genetic polymorphisms in the SULT1A3 gene have been linked to various pathological disorders. These include autism spectrum disorders, cognitive and developmental delays, speech delay, behavior abnormalities, obesity, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. These conditions are associated with mutations in chromosome 16 at position 16p11.2, where SULT1A3 is located (Kurogi2021SULT). 

In the context of liver diseases, SULT1A3 expression is notably increased in tumor tissues of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, correlating with enhanced enzymatic activity and elevated metastatic capacity. This increased expression is negatively correlated with dopamine concentration but positively associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell acquisition, promoting tumor metastasis (Xie2020The). 

SULT1A3 activity is also reported to be decreased in liver samples with steatosis, diabetic cirrhosis, and alcoholic cirrhosis, potentially leading to reduced sulfation of drugs like acetaminophen and opioids (Xie2020The). Genetic variations in SULT1A3 can affect drug metabolism, influencing drug efficacy and the risk of adverse reactions (Kurogi2021SULT). These genetic differences may result in varied drug responses among individuals with different SULT1A3 genotypes (Kurogi2021SULT).

## Interactions
SULT1A3 interacts with various substrates and cofactors, playing a crucial role in the sulfonation of monoamines such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. The enzyme forms a complex with 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP) and dopamine, where specific residues like Glu146 and Asp86 are essential for stabilizing the interaction with dopamine through electrostatic interactions (Lu2005Crystal). These interactions are critical for the enzyme's substrate specificity and catalytic activity.

The structural dynamics of SULT1A3 are influenced by its interactions with substrates, as demonstrated by the stabilization of the enzyme upon dopamine binding. This binding constrains the enzyme's conformational dynamics, particularly affecting loop L2, which adopts a closed conformation (Toth2023Role). The enzyme's interaction with dopamine is further characterized by hydrogen bonds involving His108 and Lys106, and van der Waals interactions with Phe142, Phe24, and Phe81 (Lu2005Crystal).

Mutagenesis studies have shown that changes in key residues, such as E146A and D86A, can alter the enzyme's substrate specificity, making it more similar to SULT1A1, which prefers neutral phenols (Toth2023Role). These findings highlight the importance of specific amino acid interactions in determining the functional properties of SULT1A3.
