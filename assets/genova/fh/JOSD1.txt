# JOSD1

## Overview
JOSD1 (Josephin domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of protein homeostasis by removing ubiquitin moieties from substrate proteins. The protein encoded by JOSD1 is characterized by its Josephin domain, which is integral to its function as a deubiquitinase. This enzyme is involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, signal transduction, and cellular stress responses, by modulating the ubiquitination status of target proteins. JOSD1 is particularly noted for its specificity towards K11, K48, and K63 ubiquitin linkages, which are crucial in directing proteins towards degradation pathways or autophagy (Grasty2019Structural). The protein's activity is implicated in the regulation of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation and survival (Sun2024Regulation). Additionally, JOSD1's interactions with proteins such as SOCS1 and MCL1 underscore its role in cellular stress responses and cancer chemoresistance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology and liver disease (Chowdhury2024Deubiquitinase; Wu2019JOSD1).

## Function
JOSD1 (Josephin domain containing 1) encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in the removal of ubiquitin from proteins, a critical process for regulating protein degradation, localization, and activity. This protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, playing a significant role in maintaining protein homeostasis and signal transduction within cells (Zeng2020MachadoJoseph).

JOSD1 exhibits specificity for certain ubiquitin linkage types, particularly K11, K48, and K63, which are prevalent in cells and associated with protein degradation pathways. This specificity suggests a role in cellular protein quality control, potentially directing proteins to the proteasome or mediating autophagy (Grasty2019Structural). The enzyme's activity is relatively slow with small model substrates, indicating it may require activation, possibly through an unknown partner or mono-ubiquitination (Grasty2019Structural).

In healthy cells, JOSD1 is involved in modulating the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival. It stabilizes the YAP protein by inhibiting its K48-linked polyubiquitination, thereby preventing its degradation. This stabilization enhances YAP protein stability, which is associated with cellular growth and survival (Sun2024Regulation). The precise physiological role of JOSD1 in healthy human cells, however, remains less detailed in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the JOSD1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and liver conditions. In gynecological cancers, JOSD1 is associated with acquired chemoresistance. It stabilizes the antiapoptotic protein MCL1, inhibiting mitochondrial apoptotic signaling and promoting cell survival. This stabilization contributes to chemoresistance, as high levels of JOSD1 and MCL1 are linked to poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients (Wu2019JOSD1). JOSD1's role in stabilizing MCL1 is crucial, as its depletion leads to increased apoptosis and reduced tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wu2019JOSD1).

In liver diseases, JOSD1 plays a protective role against hepatic proteotoxicity. It interacts with and stabilizes SOCS1, a suppressor of cytokine signaling, enhancing cell viability under proteotoxic stress. This interaction is crucial for mitigating hepatocellular damage, as JOSD1 depletion results in increased apoptosis in liver cells (Chowdhury2024Deubiquitinasea). JOSD1's protective function is dependent on its enzymatic activity and monoubiquitination, which are essential for its role in reducing cell death under stress conditions (Chowdhury2024Deubiquitinasea). These findings highlight JOSD1's significance in both cancer progression and liver disease management.

## Interactions
JOSD1, a deubiquitinating enzyme, engages in several significant protein interactions that influence its function. It interacts with the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), deubiquitinating and stabilizing it under proteotoxic stress. This interaction is crucial for JOSD1's role in mitigating apoptosis in hepatocytes, as SOCS1 sufficiency is necessary for JOSD1 to modulate cell death under such conditions (Chowdhury2024Deubiquitinasea; Chowdhury2024Deubiquitinase).

JOSD1 also interacts with MCL1, an antiapoptotic member of the BCL-2 family. This interaction stabilizes MCL1 by deubiquitinating it, specifically removing K48-linked ubiquitin chains, which inhibits mitochondrial apoptotic signaling and contributes to chemoresistance in gynecological cancers (Wu2019JOSD1).

Additionally, JOSD1 is known to interact with the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cell morphology, motility, and membrane dynamics. This interaction is suggested to affect the stability and arrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, thereby altering membrane dynamics and cell motility (Seki2013JosD1).

These interactions highlight JOSD1's role in cellular processes by modulating protein stability and signaling pathways, contributing to its functions in proteotoxic stress response and cancer chemoresistance.
