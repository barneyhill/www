# C17orf75

## Overview
C17orf75 is a gene located on chromosome 17 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 17 open reading frame 75. This protein is a component of the WDR11 complex, which plays a crucial role in vesicle tethering, particularly in the endosome-to-trans-Golgi network (TGN) trafficking pathway. While C17orf75 is associated with the stability and function of the WDR11 complex, it is considered less essential for the complex's stability compared to other components like WDR11 and FAM91A1. The protein's localization is dependent on these other complex members, as it is lost from the TGN region when WDR11 or FAM91A1 is disrupted (Navarro2018The). Additionally, C17orf75 mRNA contains binding sites for miR-619-5p, indicating potential regulatory interactions at the RNA level (Atambayeva2017The).

## Function


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
C17orf75 is part of the WDR11 complex, which includes proteins FAM91A1 and WDR11. This complex is involved in vesicle tethering, particularly in the endosome-to-TGN trafficking pathway. C17orf75 is stably associated with WDR11 and FAM91A1, although it is considered more dispensable for the complex's stability compared to the other two proteins. Knocking out C17orf75 does not affect the localization of WDR11 and FAM91A1, but C17orf75 itself is lost from the TGN region in cells where WDR11 or FAM91A1 is disrupted, indicating its dependence on these proteins for proper localization (Navarro2018The).

The WDR11 complex also interacts with other proteins involved in vesicle tethering, such as Rab6A, golgin-245 (GOLGA4), and TBC1D23, although specific interactions of C17orf75 with these proteins are not detailed (Navarro2018The). Additionally, C17orf75 mRNA has binding sites for miR-619-5p, suggesting a regulatory interaction at the RNA level, although the functional implications of this interaction are not fully explored (Atambayeva2017The).
