# TMEM161B

## Overview
TMEM161B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 161B, which is part of the Tmem161 protein family. This protein is characterized by its eight transmembrane domains, suggesting a role in cellular processes such as ion transport and signaling (Smith2023Fins). While the precise molecular mechanisms of TMEM161B remain largely unexplored, it is implicated in critical biological functions, including the regulation of cardiac rhythm and intracellular calcium ion handling, which are essential for maintaining cardiac action potential dynamics (Smith2023Fins). Mutations in the TMEM161B gene have been associated with severe neurological defects and structural heart anomalies, highlighting its significance in human development and disease (Smith2023Fins; Spielmann2022Extensive). Despite these insights, further research is needed to fully elucidate the molecular activities and clinical implications of TMEM161B.

## Structure
The TMEM161B protein is part of the Tmem161 protein family, which is evolutionarily ancient and found across various species, including sponges, worms, flies, and jawless fishes (Smith2023Fins). TMEM161B contains eight transmembrane domains, which are characteristic of proteins that span the cell membrane and are involved in cellular processes such as ion transport and signaling (Smith2023Fins). However, no other identifiable domains have been described, and its precise molecular mechanism of action remains unknown (Smith2023Fins).

The protein shares 48% amino acid similarity with TMEM161A, another member of the Tmem161 family, which also has eight predicted transmembrane domains (Smith2023Fins). Despite these similarities, the specific molecular structure and function of TMEM161B remain largely unexplored, and there is no detailed information available on its secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures. The protein's role in regulating cardiac rhythm and morphology, particularly through its involvement in intracellular calcium ion handling, suggests a functional importance in electrical activity regulation, but the structural basis for this function is not yet understood (Smith2023Fins). There is no information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
The TMEM161B gene encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in membrane transport and signaling. Although the specific molecular mechanisms of TMEM161B in healthy human cells remain largely unknown, it is implicated in several important biological functions. TMEM161B is essential for human development, with mutations in the gene leading to severe neurological defects such as polymicrogyria, seizures, microcephaly, and hypotonia. These mutations are hypomorphic, indicating a partial loss of function, which aligns with the absence of complete loss-of-function variants in the population (Smith2023Fins).

In terms of cardiac function, TMEM161B is involved in regulating cardiac rhythm and intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) handling. In model organisms like zebrafish and mice, TMEM161B affects electrical activity in the heart and regulates ion currents at the plasma membrane, specifically inhibiting potassium (I Kr) and calcium (I CaL) ion currents. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cardiac action potential dynamics (Smith2023Fins). In knockout mouse models, TMEM161B deficiency leads to increased heart mass and altered calcium oscillation in cardiomyocytes, suggesting its role in cardiac morphology and function (Smith2023Fins). Despite these insights, the precise molecular activities of TMEM161B in human cells require further investigation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TMEM161B gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. Homozygous or compound heterozygous missense mutations in TMEM161B are linked to cortical folding malformations of the brain, leading to conditions such as polymicrogyria, intractable seizures, microcephaly, and hypotonia. These mutations are considered hypomorphic, as they are less severe than a complete knockout (Smith2023Fins). 

In terms of cardiac health, TMEM161B has been implicated in structural heart defects. Mouse models with homozygous deletions of TMEM161B exhibit significant cardiac anomalies, including ventricular septal defects (VSD), and these findings suggest a potential role for TMEM161B in human congenital heart disease (Spielmann2022Extensive). 

TMEM161B is also associated with behavioral phenotypes, with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk variants linked to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and major depressive disorder (Smith2023Fins). Additionally, the TMEM161B-AS1 lncRNA, located at the TMEM161B locus, is involved in cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, potentially by sponging specific microRNAs, which may influence tumor progression and patient prognosis in cancers such as glioma and esophageal cancer (Chen2021Overexpression; Lu2022Novel).
