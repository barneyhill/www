# VPS53

## Overview
VPS53 is a gene that encodes a protein subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which is integral to intracellular vesicle trafficking. The VPS53 protein is involved in the retrograde transport of vesicles from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), a process essential for maintaining Golgi structure and function, as well as for the proper sorting and recycling of proteins and lipids (Khakurel2023Role; PérezVictoria2010Ang2FatFree). Structurally, VPS53 contains a C-terminal fragment with α-helical bundles that facilitate protein-protein interactions, crucial for its role in the GARP complex (Vasan2010Structure). Mutations in the VPS53 gene have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as progressive cerebello-cerebral atrophy type 2 (PCCA2) and hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP), highlighting its clinical significance (Feinstein2014VPS53mutations; HausmanKedem2019VPS53). Additionally, VPS53 has been implicated in colorectal cancer, where its expression levels influence tumor progression through autophagy pathways (Peng2020&lt; p&gt; VPS53).

## Structure
The VPS53 protein is a subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which plays a crucial role in retrograde transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. The molecular structure of VPS53 includes a C-terminal fragment that folds into a single domain composed of two adjacent α-helical bundles. The first bundle forms a long stem, while the second is more globular, with an extended hydrophobic region on the surface likely involved in protein-protein interactions (Vasan2010Structure). This C-terminal fragment is structurally similar to subunits of other tethering complexes, such as Dsl1, the exocyst, and COG, suggesting a common evolutionary origin (Vasan2010Structure).

The VPS53 protein is part of a stable 1:1:1 complex with Vps52p and Vps54p, essential for protein sorting at the yeast late Golgi. This complex is conserved across eukaryotic organisms, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Conibear2000Vps52p). The protein contains regions of predicted coiled-coil structure, which may facilitate protein-protein interactions necessary for complex assembly (Conibear2000Vps52p). The VPS53 protein does not have well-characterized functional domains or sequence homology to other proteins (Conibear2000Vps52p).

## Function
The VPS53 gene encodes a subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which is essential for vesicle tethering and trafficking within cells. In healthy human cells, the GARP complex, including VPS53, plays a critical role in the retrograde transport of vesicles from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This process is vital for maintaining Golgi structure and function, as well as for the proper sorting and recycling of proteins and lipids (Khakurel2023Role; PérezVictoria2010Ang2FatFree).

VPS53 is involved in the tethering and fusion of endosome-derived transport carriers to the TGN, interacting with SNARE proteins such as Syntaxin 6 to facilitate these processes (PérezVictoria2010Ang2FatFree). The GARP complex is crucial for the recycling of vacuolar/lysosomal sorting receptors and other proteins, which is essential for lysosomal enzyme sorting, endosomal cholesterol traffic, and autophagy (PérezVictoria2010Ang2FatFree).

In the context of Golgi physiology, VPS53 is important for maintaining normal glycosylation processes by ensuring the proper retention and recycling of Golgi glycosylation enzymes. Disruption of VPS53 function can lead to defects in protein glycosylation and mislocalization of Golgi enzymes (Khakurel2023Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VPS53 gene have been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders. Progressive cerebello-cerebral atrophy type 2 (PCCA2) is caused by mutations in VPS53, specifically the c.2084A>G and c.1556+5G>A mutations. This condition is characterized by profound mental retardation, progressive microcephaly, spasticity, and early onset epilepsy, and has been observed in families of Jewish Moroccan ancestry (Feinstein2014VPS53mutations). The mutations affect the C-terminal domain of VPS53, disrupting its role in the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which is crucial for recycling endocytic vesicles to the Golgi (Feinstein2014VPS53mutations).

VPS53 has also been implicated in hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP), a condition characterized by spasticity and intellectual disability. A homozygous variant in VPS53 was identified in two sisters with HSP, suggesting a pathogenic role for this variant in the disorder (HausmanKedem2019VPS53).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), VPS53 is downregulated, and its overexpression has been shown to suppress tumor progression by promoting autophagy. This suggests that VPS53 may act as a tumor suppressor in CRC through the autophagy signaling pathway (Peng2020&lt; p&gt; VPS53).

## Interactions
VPS53 is a subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which is essential for protein sorting at the yeast late Golgi. It forms a stable 1:1:1 complex with Vps52p and Vps54p, with each protein present in a single copy within the complex (Conibear2000Vps52p). This complex is crucial for the proper recycling of membrane proteins and is involved in vesicular transport pathways distinct from those used by other vacuolar membrane proteins (Conibear2000Vps52p).

The C-terminal fragment of VPS53 is important for interactions with transport vesicles, possibly through a conserved surface patch that may interact with the retromer coat of endosome-derived vesicles (Vasan2010Structure). This region is not required for GARP complex assembly but is necessary for membrane trafficking (Vasan2010Structure).

Phosphorylation of VPS53 by the kinase Snf1 is crucial for the formation of a Golgi-Mitochondria Contact Site (GoMiCS) in yeast, affecting mitochondrial dynamics and morphology. This phosphorylation does not impact the assembly of the GARP complex but influences interactions with mitochondrial proteins, such as Tom-70, under specific conditions (Wycislo2020Phosphorylation).
