# ALG3

## Overview
ALG3 is a gene that encodes the ALG3 alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase, a crucial enzyme in the N-glycosylation pathway. This enzyme is a transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is responsible for the addition of a mannose residue to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor, a key step in the assembly of N-glycans. The ALG3 protein's activity is essential for the proper folding and function of glycoproteins, which are critical for various cellular processes. Mutations in the ALG3 gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, specifically ALG3-CDG, characterized by a range of clinical manifestations due to defective glycosylation processes (Haeuptle2009Congenital; Alsharhan2021Expanding).

## Structure
The ALG3 protein, also known as mannosyltransferase 6, is a 438-amino acid enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides. It is a transmembrane protein that spans the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane seven times, indicating a complex tertiary structure with multiple transmembrane domains (Haeuptle2009Congenital). The primary structure of ALG3 includes potential N-glycosylation sites at positions p.N83 and p.N253, which are common post-translational modifications (Haeuptle2009Congenital). These transmembrane domains and loops protruding into the ER lumen are highly conserved among eukaryotes, suggesting their importance in the protein's function (Haeuptle2009Congenital).

Mutations in ALG3, including point mutations and a splicing defect, are primarily located in the luminally oriented loops, which are likely involved in forming the active center of the protein (Haeuptle2009Congenital). The ALG3 gene encodes an alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase, which transfers a mannose from dolichol phosphate mannose onto the lipid-linked oligosaccharide intermediate in the ER lumen (Alsharhan2021Expanding). The protein's structure and function are critical for proper N-glycan synthesis, and its mutations are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) (Haeuptle2009Congenital).

## Function
The ALG3 gene encodes a mannosyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the N-glycosylation pathway, a vital process for protein folding and stability in human cells. This enzyme is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is responsible for catalyzing the addition of a mannose residue to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) precursor, specifically converting Man5GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol to Man6GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol (Himmelreich2019Novel; Alsharhan2021Expanding). This step is essential for the proper assembly of N-glycans, which are subsequently transferred to nascent proteins, ensuring their correct folding and function (Denecke2004An).

The ALG3 protein's activity is oriented towards the ER lumen, where it utilizes dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) as a substrate (Himmelreich2019Novel). The product of ALG3's enzymatic action, Man6GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol, is further elongated by other mannosyltransferases to form the mature LLO, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, which is crucial for the glycosylation of proteins by the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex (Himmelreich2019Novel). Proper function of ALG3 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and the stability of glycoproteins, which are critical for various cellular processes and organismal health (Denecke2004An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALG3 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation, specifically ALG3-CDG, also known as CDG type Id. This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by a range of clinical manifestations due to defective glycosylation processes. Patients with ALG3-CDG often present with severe neurological involvement, including intellectual disability, developmental delays, and intractable seizures. Ocular abnormalities such as strabismus and optic atrophy, as well as skeletal anomalies like arthrogryposis and scoliosis, are common (Paketci2020Successful; Alsharhan2021Expanding).

Endocrine abnormalities, including hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency, are frequently observed, along with recurrent respiratory infections due to immunodeficiency. Gastrointestinal issues, such as feeding difficulties and failure to thrive, are also prevalent (Alsharhan2021Expanding). Biochemically, ALG3-CDG is marked by altered N-glycan processing, with an accumulation of immature lipid-linked oligosaccharides (Sun2005Congenital).

The disorder is linked to specific genetic mutations, including missense mutations and splice site variants, which lead to the production of truncated or dysfunctional proteins. These mutations disrupt the normal glycosylation pathway, resulting in multisystemic symptoms (Schollen2005CDGId; Denecke2004An). Management of ALG3-CDG is primarily supportive, focusing on addressing the diverse clinical manifestations (Alsharhan2021Expanding).

## Interactions
ALG3 (ALG3 alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase) is involved in the glycosylation process, specifically catalyzing the α1,3-mannosylation of glycoproteins. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the interaction of ALG3 with other proteins, particularly in the context of ovarian cancer metastasis. ALG3 enhances the α1,3-mannosylation of the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), which facilitates its interaction with a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 8 (ADAM8). This interaction is significant as it activates the ADAM8/Ras/ERK signaling pathway, promoting ovarian cancer peritoneal metastasis (Cui2022ALG3).

The interaction between α1,3-mannosylated uPAR and ADAM8 is strengthened by ALG3, as confirmed by confocal observations and immunoprecipitation results. This interaction is crucial for the metastatic potential of ovarian cancer cells, as it increases the binding of uPAR with urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and enhances the activation of ADAM8 (Cui2022ALG3). The study suggests that ALG3's role in modifying uPAR glycosylation is a key factor in its interaction with other proteins, contributing to cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis (Cui2022ALG3).
