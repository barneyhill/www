# SUV39H1

## Overview
SUV39H1 is a gene that encodes the SUV39H1 histone lysine methyltransferase, a key enzyme involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. This protein is categorized as a histone lysine methyltransferase and plays a pivotal role in chromatin organization by catalyzing the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), a modification crucial for the formation of heterochromatin and transcriptional repression (Robin2007Posttranslational; Maison2016The). The SUV39H1 protein contains a chromodomain and a SET domain, which are essential for its function in recognizing methylated histones and facilitating methyltransferase activity, respectively (Wang2012Crystal; Melcher2000StructureFunction). Through its interactions with other proteins, such as DNA methyltransferases and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), SUV39H1 integrates histone and DNA methylation processes, contributing to the maintenance of genomic stability and regulation of gene expression (Fuks2003The; Maison2016The). Alterations in SUV39H1 expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Chu2020SUV39H1; Saha2021Insight).

## Structure
The SUV39H1 protein is a histone lysine methyltransferase characterized by its modular structure, which includes a chromodomain at the N-terminus and a SET domain at the C-terminus. The chromodomain, spanning amino acids 44-106, is crucial for recognizing and binding to methylated lysine residues on histone H3, specifically H3K9me2/3. This domain features a conserved SH3-like β-barrel and a long C-terminal helix, forming a partial aromatic cage that is essential for its binding specificity (Wang2012Crystal).

The SET domain, located between amino acids 249 and 412, is vital for the protein's methyltransferase activity, facilitating the di- and tri-methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3. This domain is involved in chromatin interactions and is necessary for the redistribution of chromatin-associated proteins like M31 (HP1β) (Chin2006Catalytic; Melcher2000StructureFunction).

SUV39H1 is a phosphoprotein, with phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal tail, SET domain, and chromodomain, which may regulate its activity and interactions (Melcher2000StructureFunction). The protein functions as a monomer in solution, as indicated by structural studies (Wang2012Crystal).

## Function
SUV39H1 is a histone lysine methyltransferase that plays a critical role in chromatin organization and gene silencing through its methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9). This modification is essential for the formation of heterochromatin, a tightly packed form of DNA that is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression (Robin2007Posttranslational; Maison2016The). SUV39H1 is active in the nucleus, where it influences chromatin structure and function, impacting processes such as transcriptional repression and DNA repair (Melcher2000StructureFunction).

The protein contains a chromo domain and a SET domain, both of which are vital for its function. The chromo domain facilitates heterochromatin localization by interacting with HP1 proteins, while the SET domain is involved in modulating chromatin properties and phosphorylation patterns of histone H3 (Melcher2000StructureFunction). SUV39H1 also enhances the sumoylation of HP1α, linking the SUMO pathway to HP1α marking at pericentric heterochromatin, which is important for centromere function and genome stability (Maison2016The).

In healthy human cells, SUV39H1's activity is crucial for proper chromosome segregation and mitotic progression, with its deregulation leading to growth defects and chromosomal instability (Melcher2000StructureFunction).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SUV39H1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SUV39H1 is upregulated and associated with aggressive tumor characteristics, promoting cell migration and proliferation. Depletion of SUV39H1 in HCC cells leads to increased autophagy and apoptosis, indicating its role in cancer cell survival (Saha2021Insight). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), SUV39H1 acts as a tumor suppressor, particularly in MLL-AF9-induced AML. Overexpression of SUV39H1 in these models decreases leukemia stem cell frequency and delays disease progression, while its suppression accelerates leukemia progression (Chu2020SUV39H1).

In colorectal cancer, SUV39H1 mRNA levels are elevated in a subset of patients, although this elevation does not significantly correlate with clinicopathological characteristics or DNA methylation status of certain genes (Kang2007Association). In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high SUV39H1 expression is linked to poorer disease-free survival and is associated with immune cell infiltration, suggesting its potential as a target for epigenetic therapy (Zhang2022Clinical).

SUV39H1 also plays a role in radiation-induced senescence, where its downregulation leads to genomic instability and increased expression of satellite transcripts, contributing to senescence-related chromatin changes (Sidler2014SUV39H1).

## Interactions
SUV39H1, a histone lysine methyltransferase, engages in various interactions with other proteins that are crucial for its role in chromatin modification and gene silencing. It interacts with DNA methyltransferases Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a, both in vitro and in vivo, forming a complex network that links histone and DNA methylation processes. These interactions are specific, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fuks2003The).

SUV39H1 also interacts with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), particularly HP1β, which binds to specific regions of Dnmt1 and the PHD-like motif of Dnmt3a. This interaction suggests a functional association that may contribute to epigenetic gene regulation (Fuks2003The). The protein also enhances the sumoylation of HP1α, interacting directly with Ubc9, a SUMO-conjugating enzyme, through a specific domain distinct from its methyltransferase domain (Maison2016The).

In addition, SUV39H1 interacts with the EVI1 oncoprotein, forming a complex with histone methyltransferase activity that enhances transcriptional repression. This interaction occurs through the C-terminus of SUV39H1 and the proximal zinc finger domain of EVI1 (Cattaneo2008EVI1). SUV39H1 also interacts with the HTLV-1 Tax protein, repressing Tax transactivation of the HTLV-1 LTR promoter, which is dependent on SUV39H1's methyltransferase activity (Kamoi2006SUV39H1).
