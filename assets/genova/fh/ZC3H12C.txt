# ZC3H12C

## Overview
ZC3H12C is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger CCCH-type containing 12C, also known as Regnase-3 or MCPIP3. This protein is categorized as a ribonuclease (RNase) and is characterized by its CCCH-type zinc finger and PIN domains, which are essential for its RNA-binding and catalytic activities. ZC3H12C plays a critical role in immune homeostasis by regulating the degradation of RNA, particularly within myeloid cells, and is involved in the modulation of the interferon (IFN) pathway. It is also implicated in the regulation of inflammatory responses, acting as an inhibitor of NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory gene expression. The protein's function extends to endothelial cells, where it helps maintain vascular homeostasis by reducing TNFα-induced inflammation. Additionally, ZC3H12C is involved in cancer biology, particularly in colorectal cancer, where it influences tumor metastasis and immune cell infiltration through interactions with non-coding RNAs (Liu2013Zc3h12c; Du2024Regulation; von2019Immune).

## Structure
The ZC3H12C protein is characterized by its domain architecture, which includes the N-motif, PIN domain, CCCH-type zinc finger (ZnF) domain, and C-motif. The PIN domain is crucial for its ribonuclease (RNase) activity and features a typical Rossmann-like α/β/α sandwich fold. This domain contains a catalytic core with four conserved aspartate residues and a bound Mg2+ ion, essential for its enzymatic function (Garg2021PIN).

The ZnF domain of ZC3H12C is one of the shortest of its kind, with a consensus sequence C1X5C2X5C3X3H. It adopts a compact globular fold with a Zn2+ ion coordinated by conserved cysteine and histidine residues. This domain is involved in RNA recognition, utilizing stacking interactions via spatially conserved aromatic residues, such as tyrosine, to align RNA in a bent conformation (Garg2021PIN).

The protein's structure is further stabilized by two conserved glycine residues, which maintain a unique backbone conformation that facilitates the compact ZnF fold. Mutations in these residues lead to reduced RNase activity, highlighting their structural importance (Garg2021PIN). The ZC3H12C protein functions as an active RNase, requiring both its PIN and ZnF domains for full catalytic activity, suggesting cooperative RNA binding by these domains (Garg2021PIN).

## Function
The ZC3H12C gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in immune homeostasis and the regulation of the interferon (IFN) pathway, particularly within myeloid cells. This protein, also known as Regnase-3, is an RNase that localizes to endosomes and is involved in RNA degradation, which is crucial for maintaining immune balance and preventing lymphadenopathy (von2019Immune). Regnase-3 is regulated by IRF signaling and can degrade various RNA types, although its specific targets in macrophages are not fully understood (von2019Immune). It is highly expressed in differentiated macrophages and is upregulated during macrophage differentiation, particularly in inflammatory (M1-like) macrophages (von2019Immune).

In endothelial cells, ZC3H12C inhibits vascular inflammation by repressing NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory gene expression. It reduces TNFα-induced expression of chemokines and adhesive molecules, thereby decreasing monocyte adherence to endothelial cells (Liu2013Zc3h12c). This suggests that ZC3H12C acts as an endogenous inhibitor of TNFα-induced inflammatory signaling, contributing to the maintenance of vascular homeostasis (Liu2013Zc3h12c). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm involves binding to 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA, including Ifnγ and Regnase-1 mRNA, indicating its role in post-transcriptional regulation (von2019Immune).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZC3H12C gene, also known as MCPIP3, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of immune regulation and cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ZC3H12C expression is significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and this reduced expression is associated with poor overall survival. The gene is involved in immune responses, including T cell activation, and is positively correlated with CD8+ T cell infiltration, which is crucial for anti-tumor immunity. The circRNF216/miR-576-5p/ZC3H12C axis has been shown to influence CRC metastasis and immune cell infiltration, suggesting that ZC3H12C plays a role in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment (Du2024Regulation).

In immune-related conditions, ZC3H12C is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis. Its deficiency in mice leads to lymphadenopathy and altered immune responses, particularly affecting macrophage function and interferon signaling. This suggests that ZC3H12C is vital for preventing immune dysregulation and may be involved in conditions characterized by immune imbalance (von2019Immune). Additionally, ZC3H12C has been linked to the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-κB activation, indicating its potential role in inflammatory diseases (Liu2013Zc3h12c).

## Interactions
ZC3H12C, also known as MCPIP3, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in post-transcriptional regulation and immune response. Structurally, ZC3H12C contains a CCCH-type zinc finger domain and a PIN domain, both of which are essential for its RNA-binding and RNase activities. The PIN domain binds RNA through basic residues, while the zinc finger domain interacts with RNA via a positively charged groove, facilitating RNA degradation (Garg2021PIN).

ZC3H12C is part of a regulatory axis in colorectal cancer involving circRNF216 and miR-576-5p. It acts as a target for miR-576-5p, and its expression is modulated by circRNF216, which functions as a competitive endogenous RNA to alleviate miR-576-5p-mediated repression. This interaction influences tumor metastasis and CD8+ T cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (Du2024Regulation).

In the context of inflammation, ZC3H12C interacts with the transcription factor Gfi1 to form a negative feedback loop that inhibits NF-κB activation. This interaction is significant in regulating pro-inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages, highlighting ZC3H12C's role as an endogenous inhibitor of TNFα-induced inflammatory signaling (Guo2020Gfi1).
