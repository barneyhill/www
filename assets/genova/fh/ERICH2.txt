# ERICH2

## Overview
The ERICH2 gene encodes the protein glutamate rich 2, which is characterized by its high glutamate content. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. Glutamate rich 2 is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but it is implicated in intracellular signaling pathways. Recent studies have suggested a potential role for ERICH2 in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant for cellular proliferation and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to clarify the precise biological roles and clinical implications of ERICH2 and its encoded protein.
