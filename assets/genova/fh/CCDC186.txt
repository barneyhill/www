# CCDC186

## Overview
The CCDC186 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 186 protein, which is integral to the biogenesis and sorting of dense-core vesicles (DCVs) in neurons and endocrine cells. This protein is crucial for the regulated secretion of neuromodulators and hormones, impacting various cellular processes and organismal functions. CCDC186 operates in conjunction with the Rab GTPase RAB-2 and the endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) complex to facilitate the trafficking and maturation of DCVs, ensuring proper cargo sorting and recycling (Brugger2020A). The protein's localization near the trans-Golgi network and its interactions with proteins such as syntaxin 6 and chromogranin A underscore its role in vesicle trafficking and membrane interactions (CattinOrtolá2019CCDC186). Mutations in the CCDC186 gene are linked to severe health conditions affecting the endocrine and central nervous systems, highlighting its clinical significance (Arrabal2023Functional).

## Function
The CCDC186 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the biogenesis and sorting of dense-core vesicles (DCVs) in neurons and endocrine cells. These vesicles are essential for the secretion of neuromodulators and hormones, which are critical for various cellular processes and organismal functions (Brugger2020A). CCDC186 is involved in the trafficking and maturation of DCVs, working alongside the Rab GTPase RAB-2 and the endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) complex to ensure proper cargo sorting and recycling (Brugger2020A).

In healthy cells, CCDC186 facilitates the post-Golgi sorting of DCV cargos, ensuring the retention of mature cargos and the removal of non-DCV cargos. This process is vital for the regulated secretion of peptide hormones, such as insulin, and involves the interaction with proteins like carboxypeptidase D (CPD) and carboxypeptidase E (CPE) (CattinOrtolá2019CCDC186). CCDC186 localizes near the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and immature DCVs, where it forms ring-like structures around proinsulin, indicating its role in DCV membrane interactions (CattinOrtolá2019CCDC186). The protein's function is critical for maintaining proper levels and distribution of mature DCV cargos, impacting cellular signaling and metabolic regulation (CattinOrtolá2019CCDC186).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC186 gene are associated with a range of severe health conditions, primarily affecting the endocrine and central nervous systems. Patients with these mutations often present with symptoms such as microcephaly, brain atrophy, refractory epilepsy, and endocrine alterations. These conditions are characterized by developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, seizures, and MRI findings like frontotemporal atrophy and a thin corpus callosum (Arrabal2023Functional). 

The gene's mutations impair cargo sorting in dense-core vesicles, leading to incorrect secretion and potential misdirection towards lysosomal degradation, which affects the release of neuromodulators crucial for nervous system function (Arrabal2023Functional). Clinical observations have shown that affected individuals may experience severe non-ketotic hypoglycemia, hypothyroidism, and growth hormone deficiency, alongside neurological symptoms (Arrabal2023Functional). 

In addition to these findings, a study identified extensive hemi-methylation in the promoter region of CCDC186 in individuals with autism spectrum disorders and developmental delay, suggesting a potential link between methylation changes and these conditions (ArefEshghi2019Diagnostic). The gene has also been implicated in multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma through gene fusions, indicating its involvement in cancer development (Lu2016Clonality).

## Interactions
CCDC186 is involved in interactions with various proteins, primarily related to its role in dense-core vesicle (DCV) cargo sorting and maturation. It colocalizes with the SNARE protein syntaxin 6 and DCV cargos such as chromogranin A and proinsulin, indicating its involvement in vesicle trafficking near the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and immature dense-core vesicles (iDCVs) (CattinOrtolá2019CCDC186). The C-terminal domain of CCDC186, known as CC3, binds to RAB2, a Rab GTPase, which is crucial for its localization near the TGN (CattinOrtolá2019CCDC186).

CCDC186 is associated with the endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) complex and interacts with EIPR-1, which are involved in sorting and recycling cargo through the endosomal compartment (Arrabal2023Functional). Although CCDC186 does not directly interact with carboxypeptidase D (CPD), it may bind to CPD-positive membranes through another protein or directly to membranes, as suggested by its ability to associate with synthetic membrane liposomes (CattinOrtolá2019CCDC186). This interaction is essential for the removal of CPD from iDCVs during their maturation (CattinOrtolá2019CCDC186). The connection between CCDC186 and the EARP complex suggests a role in trafficking between EARP-positive endosomes and CCDC186-positive TGN/iDCV membranes (CattinOrtolá2019CCDC186).
