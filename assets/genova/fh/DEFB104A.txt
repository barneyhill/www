# DEFB104A

## Overview
DEFB104A is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 104A, a member of the beta-defensin family, which is known for its antimicrobial properties. This protein plays a significant role in the innate immune system by providing a defense mechanism against a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Defensin beta 104A is characterized by its unique structural features, such as a conserved arrangement of cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges, contributing to its stability and function (Pazgier2006Human). The protein exhibits strong bactericidal activity, particularly against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and is expressed in various tissues, including the testis, epididymis, and lung, indicating its involvement in both antimicrobial defense and immune response modulation (Pazgier2006Human; Semple2003Duplication). The evolution of DEFB104A has been shaped by positive selection, which has enhanced its antimicrobial efficacy through changes in amino acid charge (Semple2003Duplication).

## Structure
The DEFB104A gene encodes the human β-defensin 4 (hBD-4), a member of the β-defensin family known for its antimicrobial properties. The primary structure of DEFB104A includes a conserved arrangement of six cysteine residues, which are crucial for forming disulfide bridges that stabilize the protein's structure (Pazgier2006Human). These disulfide bonds contribute to the secondary structure, characterized by three β-strands arranged in an antiparallel sheet, flanked by an α-helical segment (Pazgier2006Human). The tertiary structure of DEFB104A features a 'defensin-like' topological fold, with a core consisting of these β-strands and an α-helix, stabilized by disulfide bridges (Pazgier2006Human).

DEFB104A is noted for its unique structural features compared to other human β-defensins, such as a different number of residues between its cysteine pairs, which may enhance its antimicrobial activity, particularly against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Semple2003Duplication). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the testis, epididymis, and lung, suggesting a role beyond antimicrobial activity, potentially linking innate and adaptive immune responses (Pazgier2006Human). The evolution of DEFB104A has been influenced by positive selection, particularly affecting the charge of amino acid residues, which may impact its antimicrobial properties (Semple2003Duplication).

## Function
DEFB104A encodes the protein defensin beta 104A, which is part of the beta-defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides play a crucial role in the innate immune system by providing a first line of defense against a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Defensin beta 104A is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, where it contributes to barrier protection by disrupting microbial membranes, thereby preventing infection (Ageitos2017Antimicrobial; Semple2003Duplication).

The protein is particularly noted for its strong bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, being more than sixfold stronger than other beta-defensins (Semple2003Duplication). This activity is attributed to positive selection in its second exon, which encodes the mature peptide, enhancing its antimicrobial properties through changes in amino acid charge (Semple2003Duplication). DEFB104A is also involved in modulating immune responses, as beta-defensins can act on dendritic cells to trigger adaptive immune responses, linking innate and adaptive immunity (Semple2003Duplication).

The gene is expressed most highly in the testes, suggesting a role in the innate defense mechanism of the male reproductive tract (Semple2003Duplication).
