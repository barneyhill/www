# ZNF215

## Overview
ZNF215 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 215, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by their ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. Zinc finger proteins are typically involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, development, and differentiation. The protein encoded by ZNF215 is implicated in the regulation of gene expression through its DNA-binding capabilities, which are facilitated by its zinc finger domains. Alterations in the expression of ZNF215 have been associated with several types of cancer, highlighting its potential role in oncogenesis and as a biomarker for cancer prognosis (Yang2021Loss; Liao2023CircZNF215).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZNF215 gene have been implicated in various cancers, notably cytogenetically abnormal acute myeloid leukemia (CA-AML) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). In CA-AML, ZNF215 is significantly upregulated compared to healthy subjects, and its higher expression levels are associated with poorer five-year survival outcomes. ZNF215 has been identified as an independent predictor for five-year survival, with a hazard ratio of 0.870, indicating that increased expression correlates with reduced survival rates (Yang2021Loss).

In the context of iCCA, a circular RNA derived from ZNF215, known as circZNF215, is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues and is linked to metastasis and poor prognosis. CircZNF215 promotes tumor growth and metastasis by inactivating the PTEN/AKT pathway, a critical pathway in cancer progression. This occurs through its interaction with peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1), which prevents PRDX1 from protecting PTEN from oxidative inactivation, leading to increased AKT phosphorylation. The knockdown of circZNF215 has been shown to enhance the antitumor effects of ipatasertib, an AKT inhibitor, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liao2023CircZNF215).
