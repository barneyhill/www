# FAM3C

## Overview
FAM3C is a gene that encodes the FAM3 metabolism regulating signaling molecule C, a protein involved in various cellular processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, and tissue remodeling. This protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and extracellular space, where it plays a crucial role in cell signaling pathways that regulate cell differentiation and proliferation. FAM3C is particularly significant in developmental processes and tissue repair, facilitating EMT and aiding in cell migration to sites requiring tissue regeneration. The protein's involvement in intercellular communication underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and organismal homeostasis. Alterations in FAM3C expression have been linked to several diseases, notably cancers, where it is associated with tumor progression and metastasis, as well as conditions affecting bone metabolism and liver function (Schmidt2023Inducible; Dong2022FAM3; Jia2023Integrating).

## Function
FAM3C, also known as ILEI (Interleukin-like EMT inducer), is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, and tissue remodeling. This protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and extracellular space, where it influences cell signaling pathways that are crucial for regulating cell differentiation and proliferation. These processes are vital for maintaining normal cellular functions and contribute to organismal outcomes such as wound healing and tissue regeneration.

In healthy human cells, FAM3C is involved in the modulation of EMT, a process where epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and adhesion properties to become mesenchymal stem cells. This transition is essential for developmental processes and tissue repair. By facilitating EMT, FAM3C aids in cell migration, allowing cells to move to sites where they are needed for tissue repair and regeneration. The protein's activity in the extracellular space suggests its role in intercellular communication, impacting how cells respond to their environment and interact with neighboring cells. Through these mechanisms, FAM3C contributes to the dynamic remodeling of tissues, ensuring proper cellular function and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FAM3C gene, also known as interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI), have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. Overexpression of FAM3C is associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor progression, and metastasis, contributing to poor prognosis in several cancers, including breast, hepatocellular, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers (Schmidt2023Inducible; Dong2022FAM3). In pancreatic cancer, high FAM3C expression is linked to increased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and reduced apoptosis, correlating with worse differentiation and liver metastasis (Dong2022FAM3). 

FAM3C is frequently co-amplified with the MET gene in various carcinomas, which is associated with increased invasiveness and poor clinical outcomes, particularly in lung and colorectal cancers (Schmidt2021The). In thyroid cancer, however, higher FAM3C expression is associated with favorable overall survival, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role in this context (Ma2020Identification).

Beyond cancer, FAM3C expression is linked to bone mineral density and osteoporosis, with specific genetic variants affecting bone metabolism and fracture risk (Jia2023Integrating). In mouse models, inducible overexpression of FAM3C leads to liver fibrosis and anemia, indicating its role in liver dysfunction and potential implications for metabolic diseases (Schmidt2023Inducible).
