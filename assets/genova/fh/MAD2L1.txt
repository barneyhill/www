# MAD2L1

## Overview
The MAD2L1 gene encodes the mitotic arrest deficient 2 like 1 protein, a crucial component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) during mitosis. This protein plays a vital role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) until all chromosomes are properly aligned, thereby preventing aneuploidy and maintaining genomic stability (Petty2011MAD2L1; Fang1998The). The MAD2L1 protein, also known as MAD2A, is characterized by its ability to form a tetrameric structure, which is essential for its function in the mitotic checkpoint (Percy2000Expression). It contains a HORMA domain, which is critical for its interactions with other proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and it is implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromosomal stability (Wei2020Bioinformatic; Chen2022MAD2L1).

## Structure
The MAD2L1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the spindle assembly checkpoint during mitosis. The primary structure of the MAD2L1 protein consists of 205 amino acids (Percy2000Expression). Its secondary structure includes beta sheets and alpha helices, which contribute to its overall conformation. The tertiary structure of MAD2L1 forms a "safety belt" conformation, which is crucial for its function in inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) by binding to CDC20 (Petty2011MAD2L1). This conformation is essential for the protein's role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation.

MAD2L1 can exist as a monomer or form a tetramer, which represents its quaternary structure. The tetrameric form is particularly important for its function in the mitotic checkpoint, as it is the active state that inhibits APC activation (Percy2000Expression). The protein contains a HORMA domain, which is essential for its role in cell cycle regulation. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the activity of MAD2L1, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. Splice variants of MAD2L1 may exist, potentially affecting its function and interactions.

## Function
The MAD2L1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, a mechanism essential for ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. This checkpoint prevents the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes are properly aligned at the metaphase plate, thereby maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy (Petty2011MAD2L1; Fang1998The). The MAD2L1 protein, also known as MAD2A, localizes to unattached kinetochores in human cells, where it monitors kinetochore attachments to the mitotic spindle (Petty2011MAD2L1). 

MAD2L1 functions by forming a complex with CDC20 and the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), inhibiting APC activation and causing cell cycle arrest at metaphase (Fang1998The; Percy2000Expression). This inhibition is crucial for delaying anaphase until all chromosomes are correctly attached to the spindle apparatus. The protein exists in two forms, a tetramer and a monomer, with the tetramer being responsible for inhibiting APC activation (Fang1998The). In healthy cells, MAD2L1 is widely expressed and localizes to the nucleus, playing a vital role in maintaining chromosomal integrity during cell division (Petty2011MAD2L1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MAD2L1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions, primarily due to its role in the spindle assembly checkpoint, which is crucial for maintaining chromosomal stability during cell division. Disrupted MAD2L1 function can lead to chromosomal instability (CIN) and aneuploidy, contributing to tumorigenesis. In mice, MAD2L1± cells are linked to chromosome instability, which can result in lung cancer (miR30a3p; Wang2019&lt; p&gt). Overexpression of MAD2L1 is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis in various cancers, including breast, lung, liver, and stomach cancers (Wang2015Biological).

In breast cancer, high MAD2L1 expression correlates with aggressive tumor characteristics and poor survival outcomes, such as increased risk of disease recurrence and death (Wang2015Biological). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MAD2L1 expression is significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and serves as an independent prognostic indicator in lung squamous cell carcinoma (Wei2020Bioinformatic). In prostate cancer, high MAD2L1 expression is linked to poorer prognosis and is associated with tumor dormancy mechanisms in bone metastases (Wang2022Singlecell). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MAD2L1 in cancer progression and prognosis.

## Interactions
MAD2L1, a crucial component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), interacts with several proteins to ensure proper chromosome segregation during cell division. It forms a heterotetramer with MAD1, which catalytically converts the inactive open form of MAD2 (O-MAD2) to the active closed form (C-MAD2). This active form then binds to CDC20, forming a complex that, along with BUBR1 and BUB3, inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), thereby arresting cell cycle progression until all chromosomes are correctly attached to spindle microtubules (Bates2020Too).

MAD2L1 also interacts with AURKA in Ewing's Sarcoma, stabilizing it and preventing its proteasomal degradation. This interaction promotes cell proliferation and reduces apoptosis, highlighting the role of MAD2L1 in cancer progression through the AURKA/MYC axis (Chen2022MAD2L1). In non-small cell lung cancer, MAD2L1 is part of a protein-protein interaction network involving BUB1, BUB1B, and other proteins related to cell cycle regulation, further emphasizing its role in mitotic processes (Wei2020Bioinformatic).

These interactions underscore MAD2L1's pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability and its potential implications in cancer development and progression.
