# FER

## Overview
The FER gene encodes the FER tyrosine kinase, a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell growth, differentiation, and survival. The FER protein is characterized by its kinase domain and a single SH2 domain, which facilitate interactions with phosphorylated tyrosines on growth factor receptors. It is structurally similar to the FPS/FES kinases and is ubiquitously expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it associates with chromatin. This widespread expression suggests its fundamental role in cellular regulation. FER is involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell-cell adhesion, and it modulates key signaling pathways, such as those involving p38 MAP kinase and PI3K, which are essential for processes like chemotaxis and cell motility. The kinase's interactions with various proteins, including the catenin-like substrate pp120 and Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor α, further underscore its importance in cellular dynamics and adhesion. Additionally, FER has significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer progression and metastasis, where its altered expression is linked to poor prognosis in several cancer types (Kim1995The; Hao1991Nuclear; Ivanova2013FER).

## Structure
The FER tyrosine kinase is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase characterized by a molecular weight of approximately 94 kDa. It contains a kinase domain and a single SH2 domain, which is involved in mediating interactions with phosphorylated tyrosines on growth factor receptors (Kim1995The). The FER protein also has an extensive amino terminus, which includes a 400-amino-acid sequence capable of forming coiled coils and oligomerizing into homotrimers, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions (Kim1995The).

The FER protein is structurally similar to the FPS/FES kinases, sharing a short, basic C-terminal tail and a large N-terminal hydrophilic domain, which are unique to these proteins (Pawson1989The). The amino terminus of FER mediates complex formation with the catenin-like substrate pp120, independent of the SH2 domain, indicating a constitutive interaction that does not rely on phosphotyrosine binding (Kim1995The).

FER is ubiquitously expressed and is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it associates with chromatin, suggesting a potential role in signal transduction related to cell growth or differentiation (Hao1991Nuclear). The protein undergoes autophosphorylation, a common post-translational modification for tyrosine kinases, which is indicative of its enzymatic activity (Hao1989Isolation).

## Function
FER tyrosine kinase is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, growth, differentiation, and survival. It plays a significant role in cytoskeletal organization and cell-cell adhesion. FER is ubiquitously expressed in all cell types examined, indicating its fundamental role in cellular regulation, potentially in cell growth (Kim1995The).

In mast cells, FER kinase is activated downstream of the high-affinity immunoglobulin E receptor (FcεRI) and the receptor protein-tyrosine kinase Kit. This activation is crucial for sustained p38 MAP kinase activation, which is necessary for maximal chemotaxis of activated mast cells. FER-deficient cells show less sustained p38 MAP kinase activation, leading to increased adhesion and decreased motility upon activation of FcεRI and the Kit receptor (Craig2002Fer).

FER kinase also modulates neutrophil chemotaxis by limiting the sustained activation of the PI3K pathway in response to end target chemoattractants. In the absence of FER, there is enhanced chemotaxis and sustained PI3K activity, indicating that FER kinase plays a role in regulating the balance between different signaling pathways during neutrophil chemotaxis (Khajah2013Fer).

## Clinical Significance
The FER gene, encoding a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, plays a significant role in cancer progression and metastasis. Alterations in FER expression are linked to various cancers, including breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In breast cancer, high FER expression is associated with aggressive phenotypes, larger tumor size, and poor prognosis, particularly in triple-negative and lymph node-negative patients (Ivanova2013FER). In ovarian cancer, FER is involved in a novel pathway that enhances metastasis through ligand-independent signaling downstream of the MET receptor, correlating with worse progression-free survival (Fan2016HGFindependent).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), elevated FER levels are linked to lower postoperative survival and increased tumor invasiveness (Chen2019YY1). In ccRCC, FER overexpression correlates with larger tumor size, advanced stage, and poor survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (WEI2012High). FER's role in cancer is further highlighted by its involvement in cell adhesion, migration, and resistance to apoptosis, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis (Li2009Identification; Pasder2006Downregulation).

## Interactions
The FER tyrosine kinase is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. FER is constitutively associated with the catenin-like substrate pp120, which interacts with components of the cadherin-catenin complex, suggesting a role in regulating cell-cell interactions (Kim1995The). This association is mediated by a 400-amino-acid sequence in the amino terminus of FER, capable of forming coiled coils (Kim1995The).

FER also interacts with Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor α (RhoGDIα), phosphorylating it on tyrosine residues, which affects its interaction with the small GTPase Rac. This phosphorylation reduces RhoGDIα's affinity for Rac, influencing the cellular pool of Rac (Fei2010The).

In integrin-mediated cell adhesion, FER phosphorylates cortactin (Ctn), a process crucial for efficient fibroblast migration. This phosphorylation is part of a signaling pathway involving reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is independent of Src family kinases and focal adhesion kinase (Sangrar2007FerMediated).

FER also mediates cross-talk between N-cadherin and β1-integrins, influencing cadherin and integrin functions. This involves the release of FER from the cadherin complex and its accumulation in the integrin complex, affecting cell adhesion and migration (Arregui2000The).
