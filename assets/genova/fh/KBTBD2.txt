# KBTBD2

## Overview
KBTBD2 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch repeat and BTB domain containing 2, which is categorized as a BTB-domain adaptor protein. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways, which are essential for maintaining normal metabolic processes and cellular functions. KBTBD2 is involved in metabolic regulation by enhancing insulin sensitivity and facilitating the degradation of p85α, a regulatory subunit of PI3K, thereby activating PI3K signaling. This activity is crucial for various cellular processes, including growth, proliferation, and survival. The gene's function is significant in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, and its dysregulation has been linked to metabolic disorders such as diabetes, lipodystrophy, and hepatic steatosis (Cheng2018Functional). Additionally, mutations in KBTBD2 have been associated with developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in both metabolic and developmental processes (Chundru2024Federated).

## Structure


## Function
KBTBD2 is a BTB-domain adaptor protein involved in the regulation of PI3K signaling pathways, which are crucial for maintaining normal metabolic processes and cellular functions in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in metabolic regulation by activating PI3K signaling and enhancing insulin sensitivity. The systemic depletion of KBTBD2 has been linked to metabolic disorders such as diabetes, lipodystrophy, and hepatic steatosis, highlighting its importance in metabolic homeostasis (Cheng2018Functional).

KBTBD2 exerts its effects through the degradation of p85α, a regulatory subunit of PI3K that acts as an inhibitor of multiple malignancies. By targeting p85α for degradation, KBTBD2 facilitates the activation of PI3K signaling, which is essential for various cellular processes, including growth, proliferation, and survival (Cheng2018Functional). This activity suggests that KBTBD2 may have oncogenic potential due to its role in modulating PI3K pathway activity, although its primary function in healthy cells is to support normal metabolic and cellular functions (Cheng2018Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KBTBD2 gene have been associated with several metabolic and developmental disorders. In humans, loss-of-function (LoF) mutations or damaging compound heterozygous genotypes in KBTBD2 have been linked to growth retardation, hyperglycemia, and diabetes. Patients with these mutations also exhibit additional phenotypic features such as microcephaly, cardiomyopathy, and developmental delay (Chundru2024Federated). A case study from CENTOGENE reported a patient with a homozygous LoF mutation in KBTBD2 who presented with intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly, and dysmorphic features, although without hyperglycemia or diabetes, and died at three months of age (Chundru2024Federated).

In mice, knockdown of KBTBD2 results in elevated expression of p85α, a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositol-3-kinase, leading to phenotypes such as lipodystrophy, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, severe diabetes, and growth retardation (Chundru2024Federated). The gene's role in insulin signaling and its potential oncogenic activity are linked to its ability to degrade p85α, which functions as an inhibitor of multiple malignancies (Cheng2018Functional). These findings suggest that KBTBD2 is crucial for normal metabolic and developmental processes, and its dysregulation can lead to significant clinical manifestations.

## Interactions
KBTBD2 is a BTB-domain adaptor protein that plays a role in the activation of PI3K signaling and insulin sensitivity. It interacts with the p85α protein, which is a regulatory subunit of PI3K. This interaction leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of p85α, thereby activating PI3K signaling. The degradation of p85α by KBTBD2 suggests a potential oncogenic activity, as p85α functions as an inhibitor of multiple malignancies (Cheng2018Functional). The systemic depletion of KBTBD2 has been associated with metabolic disorders such as diabetes, lipodystrophy, and hepatic steatosis, indicating its significant role in metabolic regulation through its interaction with p85α (Cheng2018Functional).

The context does not provide specific information about interactions of KBTBD2 with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond p85α. The role of KBTBD2 in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis involves forming complexes with CUL3, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which facilitates the degradation of target proteins. However, detailed interactions within this complex or with other proteins are not specified in the provided context.
