# MOV10

## Overview
MOV10 is a gene that encodes the Mov10 RNA helicase, a protein belonging to the family of RNA helicases, which are enzymes that unwind RNA molecules. The Mov10 RNA helicase is characterized by its ATP-dependent helicase activity, facilitating the unwinding of RNA duplexes in a 5′ to 3′ direction. This protein plays a pivotal role in various RNA processing activities, including nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, microRNA-mediated translation suppression, and the inhibition of retrotransposition, particularly of LINE-1 elements. Structurally, Mov10 RNA helicase contains a core helicase domain with seven conserved motifs essential for its function, as well as an N-terminal cysteine/histidine-rich domain that may facilitate protein-protein interactions. The protein is involved in both cytoplasmic and nuclear functions, interacting with key proteins such as Argonaute and Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) to regulate gene expression and protect mRNAs from degradation. Additionally, MOV10 has been implicated in antiviral defense and cancer progression, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genome integrity (Abudu2012Identification; Nawaz2021Unwinding; Goodier2012MOV10).

## Structure
MOV10 is a 5′ to 3′ RNA helicase involved in various RNA processing activities. The protein consists of 1,003 amino acids and includes a core helicase domain with seven conserved motifs, which are crucial for its ATP-dependent helicase activity (Abudu2012Identification; Gregersen2014MOV10). These motifs are located near the C-terminus, between residues 524-911, and are essential for unwinding RNA duplexes (Nawaz2021Unwinding). MOV10 also contains an N-terminal cysteine/histidine-rich domain, which may form a zinc-finger binding domain, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Nawaz2021Unwinding; Gregersen2014MOV10).

The protein's structure includes two RecA-like domains within the helicase core, contributing to its secondary and tertiary structures (Gregersen2014MOV10). MOV10 shares 40% homology with UPF1, another RNA helicase, and this similarity extends to the presence of a CH domain in its N-terminus (Nawaz2021Unwinding). MOV10 undergoes post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and acetylation, which affect its stability and function (Nawaz2021Unwinding).

There are two known isoforms of MOV10, resulting from alternative splicing. The first isoform includes all exons, coding for a 1077-amino acid protein, while the second lacks Exon 1, resulting in a 1004-amino acid protein (Nawaz2021Unwinding).

## Function
MOV10 is an RNA helicase that plays a crucial role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It functions primarily as an ATP-dependent helicase, unwinding RNA duplexes in a 5' to 3' direction, which is essential for resolving secondary structures in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs. This activity facilitates processes such as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and microRNA (miRNA) binding, contributing to mRNA turnover and gene regulation (Nawaz2021Unwinding; Gregersen2014MOV10).

MOV10 is involved in RNA-induced silencing and interacts with Argonaute proteins, acting as a cofactor for miRNA-mediated translation suppression. It also associates with the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) to protect certain mRNAs from degradation (Nawaz2021Unwinding). In addition to its cytoplasmic roles, MOV10 has a nuclear function, where it interacts with Polycomb group proteins to regulate gene expression through histone methylation (Nawaz2021Unwinding).

MOV10 also plays a significant role in inhibiting retrotransposition, particularly of LINE-1 (L1) elements, by associating with L1 RNA and proteins, thereby protecting the genome from insertional mutagenesis (Li2013The; Goodier2012MOV10). Its helicase activity is crucial for this protective role, as it unwinds RNA-DNA heteroduplexes during retrotransposition (Nawaz2021Unwinding).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the MOV10 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In the context of viral infections, MOV10 plays a significant role in antiviral defense. It has been shown to inhibit the replication of various viruses, including HIV-1, by interacting with viral components and restricting their replication. Mutations or reduced expression of MOV10 can lead to increased viral replication and pathogenicity, as observed in studies involving severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) and other bunyaviruses (Abudu2012Identification; Mo2020Host).

In cancer, particularly melanoma, MOV10 is involved in regulating lipid metabolism and Wnt5a signaling, which are crucial for tumor progression. Reduced expression of MOV10 is associated with increased Wnt5a secretion, promoting metastatic behavior in melanoma cells. This suggests that alterations in MOV10 expression could contribute to cancer progression and malignancy (Wang2015Regulation).

MOV10 also plays a critical role in neuronal development. Its reduced expression in mice leads to less dendritic branching and increased anxiety-like behavior, indicating its importance in maintaining normal neuronal circuitry. Alterations in MOV10 expression or function could potentially contribute to neurological disorders (Skariah2017Mov10).

## Interactions
MOV10 is an RNA helicase that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA regulation. It interacts with Argonaute 2 (AGO2) within the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), influencing microRNA (miRNA) pathways. MOV10 binds to mRNAs near microRNA recognition elements (MREs) and AGO binding sites, suggesting its involvement in miRNA-mediated translation suppression (Sievers2012Mixture; Kenny2014MOV10). 

MOV10 also interacts with the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), modulating AGO2's function and affecting mRNA and protein levels of its targets. This interaction is crucial for regulating translation suppression, as seen in the MAZ mRNA, where MOV10 and FMRP protect it from AGO2 binding (Kenny2014MOV10). 

In the context of viral RNA, MOV10 binds to the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of enterovirus 71 (EV71) genomic RNA, enhancing viral replication and translation by modulating internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity (Wang2016MOV10). 

MOV10 also associates with the L1 RNP complex, inhibiting retrotransposition by interacting with L1 elements, which are essential for retrotransposition (Goodier2012MOV10). These interactions highlight MOV10's multifaceted role in RNA regulation and its involvement in cellular defense mechanisms.
