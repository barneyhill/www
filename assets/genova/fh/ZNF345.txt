# ZNF345

## Overview
ZNF345 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 345, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger protein 345 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, by binding to DNA and influencing the expression of target genes. The specific functions and interactions of ZNF345 are still under investigation, but it is believed to play a role in the regulation of gene expression and may be implicated in certain cellular pathways and diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
