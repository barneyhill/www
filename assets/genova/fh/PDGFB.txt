# PDGFB

## Overview
The PDGFB gene encodes the platelet-derived growth factor subunit B, a vital growth factor involved in numerous cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and survival. This protein is a member of the platelet-derived growth factor family, characterized by its cystine-knot fold, which facilitates the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with PDGFA. These dimers interact with PDGF receptors, particularly PDGFR-β, to activate signaling pathways essential for vascular development, wound healing, and neurotrophic support (Heldin1999Mechanism; Chen2013Plateletderived). PDGFB's role extends to the central nervous system, where it supports neuronal and oligodendrocyte function, and to the vascular system, where it is crucial for pericyte recruitment and microvessel integrity (Lindblom2003Endothelial; Heldin1999Mechanism). Mutations in the PDGFB gene are linked to disorders such as Primary Familial Brain Calcification, underscoring its importance in maintaining the blood-brain barrier and normal physiological functions (Vanlandewijck2015Functional).

## Structure
The PDGFB protein is characterized by a cystine-knot fold, a structural motif common to the platelet-derived growth factor family, which includes anti-parallel β-strands linked by disulfide bridges. This configuration provides structural stability and facilitates dimer formation (Chen2013Plateletderived). The mature PDGFB protein consists of 109 amino acids and features a unique knotted arrangement of three intramolecular disulfide bonds, specifically Cys16-Cys60, Cys49-Cys97, and Cys53-Cys99, which are crucial for its biological activity (Oefner1992Crystal).

In its quaternary structure, PDGFB typically forms homodimers or heterodimers with PDGFA, stabilized by disulfide linkages (Chen2013Plateletderived). The dimerization results in a flat shape with loops at the ends of the β-strands, which are involved in receptor binding (Chen2013Plateletderived). The PDGFB dimer has an antiparallel arrangement, with significant van der Waals contacts at the dimer interface (Oefner1992Crystal).

Post-translational modifications of PDGFB include proteolytic processing, where a propeptide sequence is cleaved from the mature growth factor by furin or other proprotein convertases during secretion (Chen2013Plateletderived). This processing is essential for its functional activity and interaction with receptors.

## Function
PDGFB (platelet-derived growth factor subunit B) is a critical component in various cellular and developmental processes. It primarily functions by binding to PDGF receptors, particularly the PDGFR-β, on cell surfaces, which activates signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, proliferation, and survival (Fredriksson2004The; Heldin1999Mechanism). PDGFB is essential for the recruitment and proper investment of pericytes in the microvessel wall, a process crucial for maintaining vascular integrity and function. This interaction is mediated by PDGF-B produced by endothelial cells and its receptor expressed on pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (Lindblom2003Endothelial).

In the central nervous system, PDGFB plays a neurotrophic role, supporting the development and maintenance of neurons and oligodendrocytes, which are vital for myelination and neuronal survival (Heldin1999Mechanism). PDGFB is also involved in wound healing, acting as a chemotactic agent for fibroblasts and inflammatory cells, thereby facilitating tissue repair (Deuel1984Plateletderived). The protein's interaction with the extracellular matrix, particularly heparan sulfate, influences its retention and availability, affecting its biological activity (Heldin1999Mechanism). These functions underscore PDGFB's importance in both normal physiological processes and potential therapeutic applications.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PDGFB gene are associated with several significant medical conditions. One such condition is Primary Familial Brain Calcification (PFBC), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive calcifications in the brain. Mutations in PDGFB lead to a complete loss of PDGF-B function, resulting in impaired signaling pathways that are crucial for maintaining the blood-brain barrier and pericyte function. This impairment contributes to the development of PFBC, as evidenced by the presence of brain calcifications in affected individuals (Vanlandewijck2015Functional).

Idiopathic Basal Ganglia Calcification (IBGC) is another condition linked to PDGFB mutations. A de novo nonsense mutation in the PDGFB gene has been identified in a sporadic case of IBGC, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining the blood-brain barrier and preventing brain calcification (Nicolas2014A).

In mice, PDGFB mutations result in severe renal, cardiovascular, and hematological abnormalities, including renal glomeruli malformations and heart dilation. These findings suggest that PDGFB is crucial for normal renal and cardiovascular development, and its deficiency can lead to significant physiological dysfunctions (Levéen1994Mice).

## Interactions
PDGFB interacts primarily with the PDGF receptors, particularly PDGFRβ, to activate signaling pathways involved in cell growth and migration. The interaction between PDGF-B and PDGFRβ is characterized by a large interface that involves the D2 and D3 domains of PDGFRβ, with significant contributions from hydrophobic and aromatic-rich clusters on the PDGF-B side, particularly involving the L1 and L3 loops (HyeRyong2010Structures). Specific residues such as Arg27 and Ile30 in PDGF-B are crucial for binding and activation of the receptor (HyeRyong2010Structures; Clements1991Two).

PDGFB also forms complexes with other proteins and nucleic acids. For instance, it can interact with an aptamer, which blocks the PDGFRβ/PDGF-B interaction by preventing conformational changes in PDGF-B induced by PDGFRβ. This interaction is stabilized by specific regions of the aptamer, particularly Arm1 and Arm2, which are key for binding to PDGF-B (Vu2018Effect). These interactions highlight the role of PDGFB in various cellular processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
