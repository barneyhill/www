# LCE3B

## Overview
LCE3B is a gene that encodes the late cornified envelope 3B protein, which is part of the larger late cornified envelope (LCE) family. This family of proteins is integral to the formation and maintenance of the skin barrier, particularly through its role in keratinization and the development of the cornified envelope in the epidermis (Bassaganyas2013Worldwide). The LCE3B protein is expressed in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis, specifically in the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum, and is involved in the early stages of epidermal differentiation (Niehues2016Late). Its expression is upregulated in response to skin barrier disruption, indicating a role in skin repair and integrity (de2012Expression). The gene is also clinically significant due to its association with autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, particularly through a common deletion involving LCE3B and LCE3C, which is a known genetic risk factor for these conditions (Niehues2017PsoriasisAssociated).

## Function
LCE3B is part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster, which plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the skin barrier. The LCE3B protein is involved in the process of keratinization, contributing to the structure and function of the cornified envelope, a protective layer in the epidermis (Bassaganyas2013Worldwide). LCE3B is expressed in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis, specifically in the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum, but not in the stratum corneum (Niehues2016Late). This expression pattern suggests that LCE3B is involved in the early stages of epidermal differentiation and may play a role in skin barrier function and repair (Niehues2016Late).

In healthy human cells, LCE3B is upregulated in response to skin barrier disruption, indicating its involvement in the repair process (de2012Expression). The protein's expression is also inducible by cytokines, which are signaling molecules that mediate and regulate immunity and inflammation (Niehues2016Late). The presence of LCE3B in specific epidermal layers and its response to barrier disruption highlight its potential role in maintaining skin integrity and facilitating repair mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
The LCE3B gene, part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster, is implicated in several autoimmune disorders, most notably psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A common deletion involving LCE3B and LCE3C, known as LCE3C_LCE3B-del, has been identified as a significant risk factor for psoriasis. This deletion is associated with increased expression of the adjacent LCE3A gene, which may play a role in epidermal host defense and contribute to psoriasis pathogenesis (Niehues2017PsoriasisAssociated). The deletion is also linked to rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP)-positive patients, suggesting a pleiotropic effect as a common genetic risk factor for both psoriasis and RA (Docampo2010Deletion).

The LCE3C_LCE3B deletion is more prevalent in non-African populations, indicating a possible evolutionary advantage or adaptation (Niehues2017PsoriasisAssociated). This deletion may alter the skin's immune response and microbiome composition, potentially increasing susceptibility to autoimmune diseases (Niehues2017PsoriasisAssociated). The deletion's association with psoriasis is independent of other known genetic risk factors, such as the PSORS1 risk allele and variants in the IL-23R pathway (Hüffmeier2010Replication).

## Interactions
The LCE3B protein, part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) family, has been studied for its potential interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of skin diseases like psoriasis. Despite investigations into its interactions, direct physical interactions between LCE3B and other proteins, such as corneodesmosin (CDSN), have not been confirmed. Studies using co-expression experiments and GST pull-down assays did not provide evidence for direct interactions between LCE proteins, including LCE3B, and CDSN variants (Bergboer2014Analysis).

The LCE3B gene is part of a cluster that includes LCE3A, LCE3C, LCE3D, and LCE3E, which are involved in skin barrier function and are upregulated in response to skin barrier disruption. This suggests a role in barrier repair, although specific protein-protein interactions remain unverified (Bergboer2012A). The deletion of LCE3B, along with LCE3C, is a known genetic risk factor for psoriasis, indicating that these proteins may have a role in maintaining skin integrity, potentially through indirect interactions or signaling pathways rather than direct physical interactions (Chandra2016Increased).
