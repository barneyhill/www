# PGP

## Overview
Phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP) is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphoglycolate phosphatase, a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-type phosphatases. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in human cellular metabolism, particularly in metabolite repair and lipid metabolism. It is involved in the dephosphorylation of glycolytic metabolites, thereby preventing their accumulation and ensuring the proper functioning of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (Jeanclos2022Glycolytic). The enzyme's structure is characterized by a conserved catalytic core domain and cap domains that influence substrate specificity and oligomerization (Jeanclos2022Glycolytic). PGP is sensitive to redox changes, with its activity and oligomeric state being regulated by reversible oxidation of specific cysteine residues (Seifried2016Reversible). This regulation is crucial for its role in cellular responses to oxidative stress and energy homeostasis, impacting processes such as lipid signaling and cell proliferation (Jeanclos2022Glycolytic; Segerer2018A).

## Structure
Phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP) is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-type phosphatases, characterized by a conserved catalytic core domain with a Rossmanoid-fold and accessorized with cap domains that influence substrate binding (Jeanclos2022Glycolytic). The cap domains vary in size and structure, playing a crucial role in substrate specificity by interacting with substrate specificity loops (Jeanclos2022Glycolytic).

The tertiary structure of PGP includes a dynamic equilibrium between homodimers and tetramers, with the homodimerization occurring via the cap domain (Jeanclos2022Glycolytic). The mutation of Cys297 to Ser in the PGP C297S variant abolishes disulfide-mediated tetramer formation, indicating the importance of cysteine residues in oligomerization (Jeanclos2022Glycolytic). The active site is organized as a channel, with conformational changes in the cap domain affecting substrate access (Jeanclos2022Glycolytic).

PGP is sensitive to redox changes, with specific cysteine residues such as Cys35, Cys104, and Cys243 playing roles in reversible oxidation, which affects the enzyme's activity and oligomeric state (Seifried2016Reversible). These cysteine residues are involved in forming disulfide bonds that influence the enzyme's conformation and activity (Seifried2016Reversible).

## Function
Phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP) is a crucial enzyme in human cellular metabolism, primarily involved in metabolite repair and lipid metabolism. It dephosphorylates glycolytic metabolites such as 2-phospho-L-lactate, 4-phosphoerythronate, and 2-phosphoglycolate, preventing their accumulation, which can inhibit glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (Jeanclos2022Glycolytic). PGP is essential for maintaining glycolytic flux by dephosphorylating 2-phospho-L-lactate, thus preventing the inhibition of phosphofructokinase-2 and ensuring the production of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a key regulator of glycolysis (Jeanclos2022Glycolytic).

In lipid metabolism, PGP regulates glycerol-3-phosphate levels, influencing triacylglycerol turnover and fatty acid flux, which are critical for cellular responses to growth factors like epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Segerer2018A). PGP depletion leads to increased glycerol-3-phosphate and triacylglycerol levels, affecting lipid signaling pathways and cellular energy balance (Segerer2018A).

PGP is also involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress, as its activity is regulated by reversible oxidation, impacting its catalytic function and oligomeric state (Seifried2016Reversible). The enzyme's role in metabolite detoxification and energy homeostasis is vital for normal cell proliferation and development, with its inactivation leading to severe growth defects (Jeanclos2022Glycolytic).

## Interactions
Phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP) is involved in various interactions that influence its function and regulation. PGP is known to participate in redox-sensitive oligomerization, existing in equilibrium between dimers and tetramers. This oligomerization is mediated by a cap/cap interaction, with tetramerization being sensitive to redox conditions. The presence of reducing agents can decrease tetramer formation, highlighting a redox-sensitive interface. Cys297 plays a crucial role in this process, as its mutation to serine (C297S) results in the absence of tetrameric species, indicating its importance in redox-sensitive oligomerization (Seifried2016Reversible).

PGP also interacts with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling pathway. It is involved in EGF receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, where its activity is regulated by reversible oxidation. This regulation involves cysteine residues that mediate redox sensitivity, affecting PGP's catalytic activity and oligomeric state (Seifried2016Reversible). These interactions suggest that PGP is a cellular target of oxidation downstream of the EGF receptor, with cellular antioxidant systems capable of counteracting PGP oligomer formation and leading to its reactivation (Seifried2016Reversible).
