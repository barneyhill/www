# CENATAC

## Overview
CENATAC is a gene that encodes the centrosomal AT-AC splicing factor, a protein integral to the minor spliceosome, which is involved in the splicing of U12-type introns characterized by AT-AN splice sites. This protein plays a crucial role in the splicing process by participating in the U4atac/U6atac di-snRNP and U4atac/U6atac.U5 tri-snRNP complexes, which are essential for the formation of the catalytically active U12-dependent spliceosome (de2020Chromosomal). Beyond its splicing function, the centrosomal AT-AC splicing factor is localized to the centrosomes in human cells, where it is vital for ensuring error-free chromosome segregation during mitosis. It prevents centriole overduplication and spindle multipolarity, thereby maintaining chromosomal stability (de2020Chromosomal). The protein's activity is modulated by reversible post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its dual roles in splicing and chromosome segregation (de2020Chromosomal).

## Function
The CENATAC gene, also known as CCDC84, encodes a protein that is a novel component of the minor spliceosome, specifically involved in the splicing of U12-type introns, which are characterized by AT-AN splice sites. This protein is crucial for the proper splicing of these minor introns, which are less efficiently recognized and spliced compared to major U2-type introns (de2020Chromosomal). CENATAC's role in splicing is linked to its participation in the U4atac/U6atac di-snRNP and U4atac/U6atac.U5 tri-snRNP complexes, essential for forming the catalytically active U12-dependent spliceosome (de2020Chromosomal).

In healthy human cells, CENATAC is localized to the centrosomes and plays a critical role in promoting error-free chromosome segregation during mitosis. It suppresses centriole overduplication and spindle multipolarity, ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division (de2020Chromosomal). The protein's function is vital for maintaining chromosomal stability, as its depletion leads to chromosome congression defects and mitotic arrest (de2020Chromosomal). CENATAC's activity is regulated through reversible modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its role in splicing and chromosome segregation (de2020Chromosomal).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
CENATAC, also known as CCDC84, is a novel component of the minor spliceosome, specifically associating with the U4atac/U6atac and U4atac/U6atac.U5 snRNP complexes. It co-purifies with several known spliceosome components shared by both major and minor spliceosomes, with TXNL4B identified as its strongest interactor. TXNL4B is a paralog of the major spliceosome protein TXNL4A/Dim1, which is involved in 5' splice site recognition, suggesting that CENATAC may participate in similar recognition events (de2020Chromosomal).

CENATAC is implicated in minor intron splicing, particularly affecting A-type minor introns, and is linked to chromosomal instability due to defects in splicing. It is crucial for proper mitotic function, as its depletion leads to chromosome segregation errors and mitotic defects (de2020Chromosomal). The protein undergoes reversible modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity in the minor spliceosome (de2020Chromosomal).

Experimental procedures involving CENATAC in HeLa cells have utilized GFP pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation to study its interactions, although specific interaction partners are not detailed (de2020Chromosomal). These studies collectively aim to elucidate the physical interactions of CENATAC with other proteins and nucleic acids.
