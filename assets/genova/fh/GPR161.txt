# GPR161

## Overview
GPR161 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 161, a transmembrane receptor involved in critical cellular signaling pathways. This receptor is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, which facilitates its role in signal transduction across the cell membrane (Mukanov2019Recombinant). GPR161 is primarily located in the primary cilia of cells, where it functions as a negative regulator of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, a key pathway in vertebrate embryogenesis and development (Hwang2021Ciliary; Hoppe2023GPR161). The receptor's activity is modulated by cholesterol binding, which stabilizes its conformation for effective G protein coupling (Hoppe2023GPR161). GPR161 also acts as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP), recruiting protein kinase A (PKA) to the primary cilium, which is crucial for its regulatory functions (Bachmann2016Gpr161). Alterations in GPR161 expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including cancers and developmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and pathology (Carta2020Cancer; Feigin2014Gprotein–coupled).

## Structure
GPR161 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, which forms the core of its secondary and tertiary structures (Mukanov2019Recombinant). The receptor's extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) forms a beta hairpin that occludes the orthosteric ligand binding pocket, contributing to its self-activation (Hoppe2023GPR161). This conformation is similar to that of the orphan GPCR GPR52, which is also self-activated by its ECL2 (Hoppe2023GPR161).

The cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of GPR161 reveals its active state when bound to the Gs heterotrimer, stabilized by a sterol-like molecule at a conserved extrahelical site adjacent to transmembrane helices 6 and 7 (Hoppe2023GPR161). This sterol binding is crucial for GPR161's function in cAMP signaling (Hoppe2023GPR161). The receptor's C-terminus contains an A-kinase anchoring protein domain (AKAP), which is critical for its role in suppressing GLI2 transcription factor accumulation in cilia (Hoppe2023GPR161).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and potential palmitoylation at the C-terminal cysteine may influence GPR161's signal transduction and receptor mobility (Mukanov2019Recombinant). The receptor's structure and interactions are essential for its role in the Hedgehog signaling pathway and other cellular processes (Hoppe2023GPR161).

## Function
GPR161 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a critical role in the regulation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is essential for proper vertebrate embryogenesis, including the development of limbs, face, and nervous system. It is primarily located in the primary cilia of cells, where it acts as a negative regulator of the pathway by constitutively producing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (Hwang2021Ciliary; Hoppe2023GPR161). This cAMP production activates protein kinase A (PKA), which suppresses the Hedgehog pathway by preventing the accumulation of GLI2/3 transcription factors in the cilia (Bachmann2016Gpr161; Hoppe2023GPR161).

GPR161's activity is modulated by cholesterol, which binds to specific residues within the protein, stabilizing a conformation necessary for G protein coupling (Hoppe2023GPR161). The receptor also functions as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP), specifically recruiting PKA type I holoenzymes to the primary cilium, which is crucial for the phosphorylation of GPR161 itself and the regulation of signaling pathways (Bachmann2016Gpr161).

In healthy cells, GPR161's function is vital for maintaining a balance between Gli activators and repressors, preventing developmental abnormalities such as neural tube defects and limb malformations (Hwang2021Ciliary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GPR161 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers and developmental disorders. In breast cancer, GPR161 is notably overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where it promotes cell proliferation and invasion through the activation of the mTORC1/S6K pathway. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of relapse in basal breast cancer patients (Feigin2014Gprotein–coupled). GPR161's role in cancer is further highlighted by its coamplification with IQGAP1, which affects nutrient and growth factor signaling (Feigin2014Gprotein–coupled).

In medulloblastoma, particularly the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) subtype, germline mutations in GPR161 are associated with the disease's development in pediatric and infant patients. These mutations often result in the loss of function, leading to increased SHH signaling due to the gene's role as a suppressor of this pathway (Carta2020Cancer). The gene's involvement in developmental disorders is also evident in its association with neural tube defects and congenital cataracts in mice, as well as its potential link to pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (Nagata2016Toward).

## Interactions
GPR161 is involved in several key protein interactions that regulate its function and localization. It interacts with β-arrestin2, which is essential for its removal from the primary cilium. This process is dependent on GRK2, a kinase that phosphorylates GPR161, facilitating β-arrestin2 recruitment (Pal2016Smoothened). GPR161 also interacts with the PKA regulatory subunit Iα (PKA-RIα) through an atypical A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) motif in its cytoplasmic tail. This interaction is crucial for the co-exit of GPR161 and PKA-RIα from cilia upon Hedgehog pathway activation (May2020Timeresolved).

GPR161 acts as an AKAP, anchoring PKA type I holoenzymes to the primary cilium. This interaction involves specific hydrophobic pockets and leucine residues, which are critical for binding to the RIα subunit of PKA (Bachmann2016Gpr161). The interaction with PKA is significant for GPR161's role in cAMP signaling and its localization to the plasma membrane (Bachmann2016Gpr161).

In the context of breast cancer, GPR161 interacts with IQGAP1 and β-arrestin2, forming a scaffold that promotes cell proliferation and migration. This interaction is linked to the activation of the mTORC1/S6K pathway (Feigin2014Gprotein–coupled).
