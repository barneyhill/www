# ALKBH1

## Overview
The ALKBH1 gene encodes the alkB homolog 1, histone H2A dioxygenase, a member of the AlkB family of dioxygenases. This protein is characterized by its role as an Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, involved in the demethylation of DNA and RNA, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function (Westbye2008Human; Zhang2020Mammalian). ALKBH1 is active in various cellular compartments, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria, where it influences processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and translation (Müller2018Characterization). In addition to its role in nucleic acid demethylation, ALKBH1 acts as a histone dioxygenase, specifically modifying histone H2A, which is essential for neural differentiation and development (Ougland2012ALKBH1). The protein's activity is integral to regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis, impacting processes like embryogenesis and neural development (Zhang2020Mammalian; Ougland2012ALKBH1).

## Structure
The human ALKBH1 protein is a member of the AlkB family of dioxygenases, characterized by a double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) fold, also known as a 'jelly-roll' topology, which is crucial for its function as an Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (Van2020Structural; Tian2020Structural). The protein structure includes a central catalytic core with a highly conserved DSBH fold, featuring a metal ion-binding sequence (HxD…H) and an α-KG-binding sequence (R…R) (Tian2020Structural). 

ALKBH1 contains specific domains such as a unique N-terminal Flip0 and a nucleotide recognition lid (NRL) with Flip1 and Flip2, which contribute to its substrate specificity and catalytic function (Tian2020Structural). The protein's structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, forming a stability triangle involving Tyr184, Arg344, and Glu236 (Tian2020Structural). 

The protein also features disulfide bonds, specifically C118-C129 and C304-C371, which may contribute to structural stability (Silvestrov2014Homology). ALKBH1 is involved in the demethylation of DNA and RNA, with specific lysine residues, such as K133, playing a crucial role in its lyase activity (Müller2017Biochemical). The presence of potential zinc finger domains formed by cysteine and histidine residues suggests a role in DNA sequence recognition (Silvestrov2014Homology).

## Function
ALKBH1 is a human gene encoding a protein that functions as a dioxygenase, primarily involved in the demethylation of DNA and RNA. This protein is part of the AlkB family and is known for its role in removing methyl groups from nucleic acids, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function (Westbye2008Human; Zhang2020Mammalian). ALKBH1 is active in various cellular compartments, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria, influencing processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and translation (Müller2018Characterization).

In mitochondria, ALKBH1 is involved in the demethylation of 3-methylcytosine in DNA and RNA, contributing to the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA integrity (Westbye2008Human). It also plays a role in the regulation of RNA modifications, such as m5C, m1A, and m6A, which are important for RNA processing and stability (Zhang2021Demethyltransferase). In the nucleus, ALKBH1 acts as a histone dioxygenase, specifically modifying histone H2A, which is essential for neural differentiation and development (Ougland2012ALKBH1).

The protein's activity is crucial for regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis, impacting processes like embryogenesis and neural development (Zhang2020Mammalian; Ougland2012ALKBH1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ALKBH1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In gastric cancer, specifically stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), ALKBH1 is frequently mutated and overexpressed, correlating with poor overall survival and advanced tumor stages. Its high expression is associated with increased tumor malignancy and metastasis, making it a potential prognostic factor in STAD (Chang2024Spatial). In lung cancer, ALKBH1 expression is significantly elevated, promoting cell invasion and migration through the regulation of m6A RNA demethylation. This overexpression is linked to poorer clinical outcomes, suggesting its role in lung cancer progression (Li2021ALKBH1; Wu2021ALKBH18).

ALKBH1 is also involved in neurological disorders. Its role in demethylating m6A modifications is crucial for nervous system development, and alterations in its expression can lead to abnormal brain development, as seen in mouse models (Zhang2021Demethyltransferase). In the telencephalon, ALKBH1 knockout mice exhibit hippocampal atrophy and learning deficits, indicating its importance in cognitive functions and potential links to neuropsychological disorders (Kawarada2021Telencephalon‐specific). These findings highlight ALKBH1's significant impact on both cancer and neurological disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
The human ALKBH1 protein interacts with nucleic acids through its enzymatic activities, particularly as an AP lyase and N6-methyladenine (N6-mA) demethylase. ALKBH1 forms a covalent bond with DNA during its AP lyase activity, which is unusual for DNA repair enzymes. This interaction involves the formation of a covalent adduct with the 5′-DNA product, facilitated by nucleophilic residues such as C129 and potentially other residues in different protein regions (Müller2013A; Müller2017Biochemical). The protein's AP lyase activity is characterized by a preference for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) over double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (Müller2017Biochemical).

ALKBH1 also acts as a demethylase for N6-mA, with a preference for bubbled or bulged DNA substrates over ssDNA or dsDNA. This preference is attributed to its unique structural features, such as the 'Flip1' motif, which facilitates interaction with unpaired DNA regions (Zhang2020Mammalian). The protein's interaction with nucleic acids is further supported by its structural components, including a nucleotide-recognition lid and a central catalytic core, which are crucial for substrate selectivity and recognition (Tian2020Structural). These interactions highlight ALKBH1's role in DNA repair and epigenetic modification processes.
