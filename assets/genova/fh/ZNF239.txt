# ZNF239

## Overview
ZNF239 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 239, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. This protein is characterized by its ability to interact with specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing gene expression and chromatin structure. Zinc finger protein 239 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II, and has been implicated in the modulation of gene expression in response to external stimuli, such as human and bovine milk osteopontin treatment in intestinal cells (Christensen2023The). The protein also functions as a transcriptional repressor in certain contexts, such as in glioblastoma, where it regulates the expression of microRNAs like miR-124-1 (Algothmi2021In). Furthermore, ZNF239 is associated with disease states, including hepatocellular carcinoma and primary osteoporosis, highlighting its potential significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Wang2020Identification; Yalaev2024MicroRNA).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF239, or zinc finger protein 239, is involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, playing a significant role in gene expression and cellular processes. In the context of human and bovine milk osteopontin (OPN) treatment in intestinal Caco-2 cells, ZNF239 is upregulated and participates in the regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II, indicating its involvement in transcriptional processes (Christensen2023The). The protein's DNA-binding activity suggests it may influence gene regulation by interacting with specific DNA sequences, potentially affecting chromatin structure and gene transcription (Christensen2023The).

ZNF239 is also implicated in the regulation of miR-124-1 expression in glioblastoma, where it acts as a transcriptional repressor. This regulation is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and may be altered in cancerous conditions (Algothmi2021In). Additionally, ZNF239 is part of a gene signature associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, indicating its potential role in cancer biology and patient prognosis (Wang2020Identification). Despite these findings, the specific function of ZNF239 in healthy human cells remains less defined, with its role primarily inferred from studies in disease contexts.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF239 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in gene expression and cellular function. In the context of primary osteoporosis (OP), the ZNF239 gene, particularly the locus rs10793442, has been associated with radial fractures and low bone mineral density (BMD) in specific populations, such as women of Tatar ethnicity. This suggests that ZNF239 may be involved in bone health and fracture risk, highlighting the genetic heterogeneity of OP across different ethnic groups (Yalaev2024MicroRNA).

In cancer research, ZNF239 has been identified as part of a gene signature related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This signature, which includes ZNF239, has shown prognostic value in predicting patient survival, indicating that alterations in ZNF239 expression may contribute to HCC progression (Wang2020Identification). Additionally, ZNF239 has been noted as a transcriptional repressor upregulated in glioblastoma cells, potentially affecting the expression of miR-124-1, a microRNA involved in neuronal differentiation and cancer signaling pathways (Algothmi2021In).

These findings suggest that ZNF239 plays a significant role in both bone-related conditions and cancer, making it a potential target for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
