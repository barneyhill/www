# ARHGEF4

## Overview
ARHGEF4, also known as Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 4, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility. The protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), specifically activating the small GTPase Rac1, which is crucial for actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell migration (Zhang2019ARHGEF4mediates). ARHGEF4 is expressed predominantly in the brain, where it plays a role in synaptic function and plasticity by interacting with proteins such as Staufen1 and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (Lee2021Activity). The gene has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral disorders, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, due to its involvement in neuronal function and morphology (Dharmadhikari2012Small; Gimelli2013Recurrent).

## Function
ARHGEF4, also known as Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 4, is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility in healthy human cells. It functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rac1, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, which activates Rac1. This activation is crucial for the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, a process essential for maintaining cellular architecture and enabling cell migration (Zhang2019ARHGEF4mediates).

In hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), ARHGEF4 is significantly upregulated when cultured in three-dimensional collagen matrices, indicating its role in generating dendritic cellular processes and enhancing cell motility in a 3D environment. This suggests that ARHGEF4 is important for the morphological adaptation of cells to their environment, reflecting their natural state in tissues (Zhang2019ARHGEF4mediates).

In neurons, ARHGEF4 is expressed more highly in brain regions and functions as a negative regulator of synaptic function. It interacts with Staufen1, a dsRNA-binding protein, to modulate synaptic structural and functional plasticity by influencing the levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) in excitatory synapses (Lee2021Activity).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARHGEF4 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral disorders. A study identified a rare small recurrent deletion in the 2q21.1 region, which includes ARHGEF4, in individuals with developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), epilepsy, and other neurobehavioral abnormalities. This deletion was found in multiple unrelated families and a DECIPHER patient, but not in control groups, suggesting its pathogenic role in these conditions (Dharmadhikari2012Small).

The ARHGEF4 gene is expressed exclusively in the brain and is involved in regulating the actin cytoskeletal network, cell morphology, migration, and neuronal function. Defects in ARHGEF4 and other guanine nucleotide exchange factor genes are associated with various neurological diseases, making ARHGEF4 a candidate gene for disorders such as ADHD, X-linked mental retardation, and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (Dharmadhikari2012Small).

Additionally, a recurrent microdeletion at chromosome 2q21.1, which includes ARHGEF4, has been associated with neurological disorders such as psychomotor delay, hyperactivity, and aggressive behavior. This deletion was observed in a patient with developmental delays and behavioral problems, further supporting the gene's involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders (Gimelli2013Recurrent).

## Interactions
ARHGEF4, also known as ASEF, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function as a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor. It directly binds to the ARM domain of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein through its ABR domain, which is essential for its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity (Lee2021Activity). This interaction is crucial for the migration of colorectal cancer cells and is also significant in neuronal contexts, where ARHGEF4 negatively regulates synaptic function by interacting with Staufen1, a double-stranded RNA-binding protein (Lee2021Activity).

ARHGEF4 can bind simultaneously to both Staufen1 and APC, with Staufen1 acting as a negative regulator of ARHGEF4's GEF activity. This interaction reduces the Cdc42-GEF activity of ARHGEF4, affecting synaptic structural and functional plasticity (Lee2021Activity). The binding of Staufen1 to ARHGEF4 involves the N-terminal region of ARHGEF4, including the ABR, and affects the GEF activity of ARHGEF4 on Cdc42, with Staufen1 expression decreasing the GTPase activity of Cdc42 (Lee2021Activity).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, ARHGEF4 mRNA is enriched in IGF2BP3 immunoprecipitates, indicating a role in local translation in cell protrusions, which is crucial for cell motility and invasiveness (Taniuchi2014IGF2BP3mediated).
