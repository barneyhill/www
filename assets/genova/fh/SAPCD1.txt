# SAPCD1

## Overview
SAPCD1 is a gene that encodes the protein suppressor APC domain containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. The SAPCD1 protein is characterized by its role as a regulatory protein, influencing pathways that are critical for cell growth and differentiation. It is implicated in the modulation of the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant for its potential impact on cellular signaling and cancer biology (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and interactions of SAPCD1 is crucial for elucidating its role in health and disease, particularly in the context of its clinical significance.
