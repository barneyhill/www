# HNRNPF

## Overview
HNRNPF is a gene that encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F, a member of the hnRNP family, which are RNA-binding proteins involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism. The protein is characterized by its modular structure, including three quasi RNA recognition motifs (qRRMs) and two glycine-rich domains, which facilitate its role in RNA binding and interaction with other hnRNPs (Geuens2016The; Dominguez2006NMR). Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a crucial role in the regulation of mRNA stability, alternative splicing, and telomere maintenance (Xu2019HnRNP; Xie2021Crucial). Its ability to bind both RNA and DNA allows it to participate in various cellular processes, impacting cellular and organismal functions (Krecic1999hnRNP). Alterations in HNRNPF expression have been implicated in diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhou2021Identification).

## Structure
The HNRNPF gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F, which is characterized by its modular structure comprising three quasi RNA recognition motifs (qRRMs) and two glycine-rich domains. The qRRMs, named qRRM1, qRRM2, and qRRM3, are responsible for RNA binding, specifically recognizing poly(G) sequences known as G-tracts (Geuens2016The; Dominguez2006NMR). The qRRMs adopt a canonical RRM fold, consisting of a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and two alpha-helices, with additional secondary structure elements in qRRM1 and qRRM2, such as a small beta-hairpin and a C-terminal alpha-helix (Dominguez2006NMR).

The glycine-rich domains are thought to facilitate interactions with other hnRNPs, potentially contributing to the protein's quaternary structure (Mauger2008hnRNP). HNRNPF can form complexes with other hnRNPs, indicating its involvement in complex RNA processing activities (Weighardt1996The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may further modulate its function and interactions (Weighardt1996The). The unique structural features of HNRNPF, including its qRRMs and glycine-rich domains, enable it to play a critical role in RNA metabolism, particularly in alternative splicing and polyadenylation (Dominguez2006NMR).

## Function
HNRNPF is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family, which are RNA-binding proteins involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism. In healthy human cells, HNRNPF plays a crucial role in the regulation of mRNA stability and alternative splicing. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the processing of pre-mRNA by binding to specific RNA sequences, such as G-tracts, which can form G-quadruplex structures (Geuens2016The; Xie2021Crucial).

HNRNPF is involved in maintaining telomere length and telomerase activity by binding to the 5'-end of the human telomerase RNA component (hTERC), which is essential for telomere maintenance. This interaction is crucial for the self-renewal capacity of stem cells and their differentiation processes (Xu2019HnRNP; Xie2021Crucial). Additionally, HNRNPF regulates the alternative splicing of genes such as TCF3, which is important for maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells (Xie2021Crucial).

HNRNPF's ability to bind both RNA and DNA, due to its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), allows it to participate in various cellular processes, including transcription, mRNA transport, and translation, impacting cellular and organismal functions (Xie2021Crucial; Krecic1999hnRNP).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HNRNPF gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders. In breast cancer, specifically invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), HNRNPF is upregulated, with higher mRNA and protein expression levels associated with advanced cancer stages and lymph node metastasis. This suggests a role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, making HNRNPF a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in breast cancer (Zhou2021Identification).

In neurological diseases, hnRNP F, along with other hnRNPs, is involved in alternative splicing and stress granule formation, processes crucial for neuronal function. Misregulation of hnRNP F can contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In these conditions, hnRNP F is sequestered by GGGGCC repeats associated with C9orf72 mutations, potentially contributing to disease pathology (Low2020Heterogeneous).

HNRNPF also interacts with FOXP3 in regulatory T cells, influencing alternative splicing and affecting cell survival and apoptosis. This interaction is significant in conditions like lupus and arthritis, where it modulates the BCL-XS/BCL-XL ratio, impacting Treg cell function (Du2018FOXP3).

## Interactions
HNRNPF, a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and polyadenylation by recognizing poly(G) sequences, known as G-tracts, in RNA. These interactions are crucial for splicing efficiency and exon-intron definition, as demonstrated in the Bcl-x RNA, where hnRNP F influences the production of isoforms with opposing roles in apoptosis (Dominguez2006NMR).

HNRNPF also interacts with components of the telomerase holoenzyme complex, including GAR1, NOP10, DKC1, NHP2, EST1A, and TERF2. These interactions are independent of hTERC, as they are not disrupted by RNaseA treatment. HNRNPF colocalizes with DKC1, TCAB1, and hTERT in the nuclei, playing a role in modulating telomerase activity and promoting cell proliferation (Xu2019HnRNP).

In the context of splicing regulation, hnRNP F, along with hnRNP H, competes with the SR protein ASF/SF2 for binding to FGFR2 exon IIIc, which contains both an exonic splicing silencer and enhancer. This competition suggests a mechanism where hnRNP F antagonizes ASF/SF2, influencing alternative splicing outcomes (Mauger2008hnRNP).
