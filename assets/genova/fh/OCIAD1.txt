# OCIAD1

## Overview
OCIAD1 (OCIA domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial inner membrane protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly within the electron transport chain (ETC). The protein, also named OCIAD1, is characterized by its two transmembrane domains and is integral to mitochondrial function, playing a significant role in the regulation of energy metabolism and mitochondrial integrity (Tran2020OCIAD1; Le2021Genomewide). It interacts with various components of the ETC, such as NDUFS3 and MIC60, and forms complexes with the prohibitin complex, which are essential for the assembly and quality control of mitochondrial complexes, especially complex III (Le2021Genomewide; Shetty2018OCIAD1). Beyond its mitochondrial roles, OCIAD1 is implicated in several pathological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and various cancers, where it influences processes such as cell adhesion, chemoresistance, and cancer cell migration (Li2020OCIAD1; Wang2010Role).

## Structure
OCIAD1 is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein with two predicted transmembrane domains, indicating its role as an integral membrane protein. The protein is composed of 245 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 35 kDa (Tran2020OCIAD1; Le2021Genomewide). The topology of OCIAD1 has been studied using a bipartite split GFP complementation assay, revealing that both the N- and C-termini face the intermembrane space (IMS) (Le2021Genomewide).

The secondary structure of OCIAD1 includes two hydrophobic α-helices located in the amino acid regions 43-63 and 73-94 (Tran2020OCIAD1). These structural features are consistent with its localization and function within the mitochondrial inner membrane. The protein's C-terminus, comprising the last 25 amino acids, serves as an antigenic determinant, further supporting its orientation towards the IMS (Le2021Genomewide).

OCIAD1 interacts with the prohibitin complex, forming supramolecular complexes that are crucial for mitochondrial function. This interaction suggests a role in the quaternary structure, where OCIAD1 may act as a chaperone for cytochrome c1 within mitochondrial complex III assemblies (Le2021Genomewide). The protein's involvement in these complexes highlights its importance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function.

## Function
OCIAD1 (OCIA domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in regulating mitochondrial function and energy metabolism in human cells. The OCIAD1 protein is primarily localized to the mitochondria, where it plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain (ETC), particularly affecting the activity of complex I and complex III (Le2021Genomewide; Shetty2018OCIAD1). In human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), OCIAD1 modulates the balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), influencing the cells' energy metabolic state and their differentiation potential (Shetty2018OCIAD1).

OCIAD1's interaction with components of the ETC, such as NDUFS3 and MIC60, is essential for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function (Shetty2018OCIAD1). It also acts as a prohibitin client, forming complexes that are crucial for the assembly and quality control of the mitochondrial ETC, particularly complex III (Le2021Genomewide). This function is vital for ATP production and various metabolic processes in eukaryotic cells.

The regulation of complex I activity by OCIAD1 affects reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the expression of antioxidant enzymes, which are important for cell survival during differentiation (Shetty2018OCIAD1). Overall, OCIAD1 is integral to maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, impacting cellular energy metabolism and differentiation outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
OCIAD1 (OCIA domain containing 1) is implicated in several diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and various cancers. In Alzheimer's disease, OCIAD1 is associated with neurodegeneration by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, neuronal vulnerability, and synaptic damage. Elevated levels of OCIAD1 are observed in vulnerable brain regions, correlating with disease severity. The gene's misregulation, influenced by early pathological signals such as Abeta/GSK-3b and p53, contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal injury, playing a role in the progression of AD (Li2020OCIAD1).

In cancer, OCIAD1 is linked to ovarian cancer recurrence and chemoresistance. It is expressed more in metastatic ovarian tumors compared to primary ones, suggesting a role in cell adhesion and recurrence. OCIAD1 expression is influenced by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and is higher in chemoresistant cell lines, indicating its potential as a marker for recurrence and a target for therapeutic intervention (Wang2010Role).

OCIAD1 is also overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where it promotes cancer cell migration by regulating ATM, a gene associated with DNA damage response. This suggests OCIAD1's involvement in PDAC malignancy and its potential as a therapeutic target (Ji2019OCIAD1).

## Interactions
OCIAD1 is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with the prohibitin complex, specifically with subunits PHB1 and PHB2, which are part of the prohibitin interactome. These interactions are crucial for the assembly of mitochondrial complex III, as OCIAD1 acts as a regulatory determinant in this process (Le2021Genomewide). OCIAD1 also interacts with cytochrome c1 (CYC1), a catalytic subunit of complex III, and is essential for its processing. This interaction is necessary for the proper assembly of complex III, highlighting OCIAD1's role in mitochondrial function (Le2021Genomewide).

In ovarian cancer, OCIAD1 modulates integrin function, affecting cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. It interacts with β actin and α actinin 4, which may mediate its effects on integrin function, particularly β1 integrins. This interaction is important for cell adhesion and survival, contributing to chemoresistance in ovarian cancer (Wang2010Role). OCIAD1's interactions with these proteins suggest its involvement in maintaining cytoskeletal architecture and enhancing integrin function, which are critical for cancer progression (Wang2010Role).
