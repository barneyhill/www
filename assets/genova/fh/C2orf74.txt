# C2orf74

## Overview
C2orf74 is a gene located on human chromosome 2 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 2 open reading frame 74. This protein is characterized by its oxidoreductase activity, which plays a vital role in cellular oxidation-reduction processes, essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy production (Selvarajan2016Insilico). Additionally, the protein is associated with dephosphorylation processes, suggesting its involvement in regulating phosphorylation states within cells, a critical aspect of cellular signaling (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Predicted to be membrane-associated, C2orf74 may participate in intercellular communication and signaling functions (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). While its specific functions in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, C2orf74 has been implicated in various cellular processes and potential disease contexts, including Waardenburg Syndrome Type II and cancer-related pathways (Albarry2021Frameshift; Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Function
C2orf74 is a gene located on human chromosome 2, and its protein product is involved in several cellular processes. The protein encoded by C2orf74 has been identified to possess oxidoreductase activity, suggesting its role in oxidation-reduction processes, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy production in healthy human cells (Selvarajan2016Insilico). This activity indicates that C2orf74 may be integral to the membrane and participate in metabolic processes related to oxidation and reduction.

Additionally, C2orf74 is associated with dephosphorylation processes, as indicated by its related Gene Ontology (GO) terms such as 'GO:0016311~dephosphorylation' and 'GO:1903293~phosphatase complex' (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). This suggests that the protein may play a role in regulating phosphorylation states within the cell, which is a critical aspect of cellular signaling and function.

The protein is also predicted to be membrane-associated, which aligns with its potential role in intercellular communication and signaling functions (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite these insights, the specific functions of C2orf74 in healthy human cells require further experimental validation to fully elucidate its roles and mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
C2orf74 has been implicated in Waardenburg Syndrome Type II (WS2), a hereditary disorder characterized by pigmentary defects and hearing impairment. A study identified a rare missense variant (c.101T>G; p.Val34Gly) in the C2orf74 gene that segregates with the WS2 phenotype in a large family, except for two individuals. This variant is considered possibly damaging and deleterious, suggesting that C2orf74 may influence the expressivity of WS2, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Albarry2021Frameshift).

Research has also explored the potential role of C2orf74 in cancer. The gene is part of a subinteractome that includes proteins linked to cancer hallmarks, indicating possible involvement in cancer-related processes. Although specific diseases or conditions directly associated with mutations in C2orf74 are not detailed, its interactions with other proteins suggest a role in signaling cascades and regulatory networks critical for malignant cell transformation (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The gene's expression patterns across different cancer types have been studied for prognostic significance, highlighting its potential involvement in cancer-driven cellular processes (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Interactions
C2orf74 is involved in potential binary interactions with C20orf27, as identified through subinteractome analysis. This interaction is supported by the identification of 29 common protein partners, suggesting a network of interactions that may be relevant in cancer contexts (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The proteins associated with this interaction are linked to 'cancer hallmark' pathways and oncoproteins, indicating that C2orf74 might play a role in critical signaling cascades and regulatory networks related to cancer (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

The over-representation analysis of C2orf74 and its interaction partners highlights related Gene Ontology (GO) terms such as 'GO:0016311~dephosphorylation' and 'GO:1903293~phosphatase complex'. This suggests that C2orf74 may be involved in dephosphorylation processes and the formation of phosphatase complexes, which are significant in cellular regulation and cancer biology (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

Despite these findings, the specific physical interactions of C2orf74 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely uncharacterized. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise roles and interaction partners of C2orf74 in cellular processes and its potential implications in cancer.
