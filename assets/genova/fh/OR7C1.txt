# OR7C1

## Overview
The OR7C1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 7 subfamily C member 1, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection of odorant molecules and the initiation of olfactory signal transduction. Olfactory receptors, including OR7C1, are characterized by their seven transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. The OR7C1 gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the diversity of odorant recognition and the perception of smell. Understanding the specific ligands and signaling pathways associated with OR7C1 can provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying olfaction and its related physiological processes.
