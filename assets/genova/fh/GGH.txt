# GGH

## Overview
The GGH gene encodes the enzyme gamma-glutamyl hydrolase, which is a critical component in the metabolism of folate within cells. This enzyme is classified as a hydrolase and is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of polyglutamylated folates into monoglutamates, a process essential for maintaining cellular folate homeostasis and facilitating folate transport across cell membranes. The activity of gamma-glutamyl hydrolase is crucial for DNA synthesis, repair, and cell proliferation, as it influences the availability of folate, a vital cofactor in these processes (Kim2020Enzymes; Melling2017HighLevel). The enzyme is predominantly active in the lysosome and cytosol, where it regulates folate concentrations, impacting DNA methylation and genomic stability (Kim2014γGlutamyl). The balance between gamma-glutamyl hydrolase and folylpolyglutamate synthase, which adds glutamate residues to folate, is essential for the retention and availability of folate within cells (Kim2020Enzymes).

## Structure
The human γ-glutamyl hydrolase (hGH) enzyme is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary elements. The primary structure of hGH consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the GGH gene, with key residues such as Cys-110, His-220, and Glu-222 forming a catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic activity (Chave2000Molecular; Li2002Threedimensional). 

The secondary structure of hGH includes 11 α-helices and 14 β-strands, with a central eight-stranded β-sheet sandwiched between α-helices (Li2002Threedimensional). The tertiary structure reveals a large L-shaped cleft that contains the catalytically important residues, contributing to the enzyme's substrate recognition and hydrolysis capabilities (Li2002Threedimensional).

In terms of quaternary structure, hGH crystallizes as a homodimer, with the dimer interface primarily formed by two helices and one β-strand from each molecule. This dimerization is suggested to be necessary for the enzyme's active conformation, as indicated by the large monomer-monomer interface and the presence of catalytically essential Tyr-36 in the interface sequences (Li2002Threedimensional; Eisele2006Characterization).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at specific Asn-linked sites, with Asn-139 and Asn-179 being glycosylated, Asn-283 partially glycosylated, and Asn-92 not glycosylated (Li2002Threedimensional). These modifications are located on the exterior surface of the dimer, influencing the enzyme's stability and function.

## Function
Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in intracellular folate metabolism, which is essential for DNA synthesis, repair, and cell proliferation. GGH catalyzes the hydrolysis of polyglutamylated folates into monoglutamates, facilitating their transport across cell membranes and maintaining cellular folate homeostasis (Kim2020Enzymes; Melling2017HighLevel). This enzymatic activity is vital for the synthesis of nucleic acid thymidine and the methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine, both of which are important for maintaining DNA methylation patterns and genomic stability (Melling2017HighLevel).

In healthy human cells, GGH ensures the proper functioning of metabolic pathways that support normal cellular functions and genomic stability. The enzyme is primarily active in the lysosome and cytosol, where it regulates the concentration of polyglutamylated folic acid, serving as a cofactor for various folate-dependent enzymes involved in DNA metabolism (Kim2014γGlutamyl). The balance between GGH and folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS), which adds glutamate residues to folate, determines the retention and availability of folate within cells, influencing DNA synthesis and methylation (Kim2020Enzymes).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) gene have significant clinical implications across various cancer types. In breast cancer, high GGH expression is associated with poor prognosis, decreased disease-specific survival (DSS), and increased risk of recurrence. It is considered an independent prognostic factor for unfavorable clinical outcomes (Shubbar2013High). Similarly, in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), elevated GGH levels correlate with poor prognosis, advanced clinical stages, and specific genetic mutations, such as TP53. High GGH expression in UCEC is linked to lower survival probabilities and altered immune cell infiltration, suggesting its role in tumor progression and immune evasion (Yu2022Elevated).

In prostate cancer, particularly ERG-negative subtypes, high GGH expression is associated with poor prognosis and early biochemical recurrence. It is linked to increased cell proliferation and genetic instability, indicating its involvement in cancer progression (Melling2017HighLevel). In colon cancer, GGH expression influences metabolic pathways, with high levels suppressing glycolysis and correlating with better overall survival, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Chen2022Interaction). These findings underscore the potential of GGH as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.
