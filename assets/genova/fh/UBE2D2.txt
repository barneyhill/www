# UBE2D2

## Overview
UBE2D2 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D2, a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This enzyme belongs to the E2 family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, which are integral to the process of ubiquitination—a post-translational modification that tags proteins for degradation, regulates protein activity, and modulates various cellular processes. UBE2D2 is involved in the formation of polyubiquitin chains, particularly those linked through lysine 48, marking proteins for proteasomal degradation. The enzyme interacts with a variety of E3 ligases, serving as a central player in the ubiquitination network, and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as DNA repair and cell signaling pathways like NF-κB/IκB. Its activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress, and dysregulation of UBE2D2 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Hosseini2019E2; van2009A; McAlpine2024Structural).

## Structure
UBE2D2 is a member of the UBE2D family of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, characterized by a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain essential for its enzymatic activity. The UBE2D family, including UBE2D2, consists of four α-helical and four β-sheet regions within their structure, which are typical features of E2 enzymes (RomanTrufero2022The). The UBC domain facilitates the formation of a thioester bond with ubiquitin, a critical step in the ubiquitination process (Chiang2008UbiquitinConjugating).

UBE2D2 interacts with E1 and E3 enzymes through specific binding domains, and it can also engage in non-covalent interactions with free ubiquitin at the 'backside' region. This interaction is crucial for the self-assembly of UBE2D-ubiquitin conjugates into larger complexes, promoting the processive assembly of polyubiquitin chains (RomanTrufero2022The). The enzyme can adopt an extended 'inactive' configuration, which transitions to a closed 'active' configuration upon binding to an E3 enzyme, positioning the active site cysteine for catalysis (RomanTrufero2022The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and S-nitrosylation, regulate UBE2D2's interactions and stability. Specific phosphorylation sites, like Ser94 and Ser138, influence its function and stability (RomanTrufero2022The).

## Function
UBE2D2, also known as UbcH5B, is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation, transcription regulation, and cell signaling. It is involved in the formation of ubiquitin chains linked through lysine 48 (K48), marking proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome (van2009A). UBE2D2 interacts with a wide range of E3 ligases, acting as a hub protein in the ubiquitination network, which underscores its importance in maintaining the integrity of the ubiquitination system (van2009A).

In healthy human cells, UBE2D2 is crucial for the polyubiquitination and degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, a process that is enhanced by copper signaling (Opazo2021Nutrient). It also mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR), which is important for cholesterol homeostasis (Zhang2011The). UBE2D2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular functions, including DNA repair and the regulation of the NF-κB/IκB pathway (McAlpine2024Structural). Its activity is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and responding to cellular stress (Bukhari2024Design).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2D2 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in the ubiquitination process. Alterations in UBE2D2 expression or function are associated with Parkinson's disease, where it is involved in DNA repair and Parkin-mediated mitophagy, processes critical for the removal of damaged mitochondria. Disruptions in these processes may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (Hosseini2019E2). UBE2D2 is also linked to infectious diseases through its involvement in NF-κB signaling, a pathway crucial for immune response and inflammation (Hosseini2019E2).

In cancer, UBE2D2, along with other UBE2D family members, is involved in the ubiquitination of the p53 tumor suppressor protein, mediated by the MDM2/MDM4 E3 ligase complex. This process is essential for regulating p53-mediated responses such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Alterations in this pathway can have significant implications, as evidenced by the embryonic lethal phenotypes observed in mice with knockouts of MDM2 and MDM4, which can be rescued by knockout of the p53 gene (RomanTrufero2022The). Additionally, UBE2D2 is involved in the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and its dysregulation may contribute to diseases involving RTK signaling, such as cancer (RomanTrufero2022The).

## Interactions
UBE2D2, a member of the UBE2D family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, participates in various protein interactions crucial for its function in ubiquitination processes. It interacts with the MDM2/MDM4 E3 ligase complex, facilitating the ubiquitination of the p53 tumor suppressor protein, which is significant for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (RomanTrufero2022The). UBE2D2 also forms a stable complex with UBTD1, a ubiquitin-like domain-containing protein, as demonstrated by yeast-2-hybrid and affinity capture screens (Uhler2014The).

In the context of DNA repair, UBE2D2 interacts with the E3 ligase RNF138, contributing to the ubiquitination of CtIP, a protein involved in homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair (RomanTrufero2022The). It also plays a role in the regulation of receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RTKs) through its interaction with the CBL proto-oncogene, an E3 ligase, which leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of RTKs (RomanTrufero2022The).

UBE2D2's interactions extend to the ubiquitin variants (UbVs) that specifically inhibit its activity by blocking its engagement with E1 enzymes, thereby reducing the formation of the UBE2D2~Ub conjugate (McAlpine2024Structural). These interactions highlight UBE2D2's involvement in diverse cellular pathways and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
