# NFE2L3

## Overview
NFE2L3, also known as nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 3, is a gene that encodes the NFE2 like bZIP transcription factor 3, a member of the Cap'n'Collar (CNC) family of basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression related to antioxidant responses, lipid metabolism, and proteasome activity. It is characterized by its ability to bind DNA and form heterodimers with small Maf proteins, which is essential for its function as a transcription factor (Chevillard2011NFE2L3; Chowdhury2017Multiple). NFE2L3 is involved in various cellular processes, including maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and regulating inflammatory responses, and has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor behavior and patient prognosis (Saliba2022Loss; Xiong2024New).

## Structure
The NFE2L3 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the Cap'n'Collar (CNC) family of basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. The human NFE2L3 protein consists of 694 amino acids and includes several conserved domains crucial for its function, such as the NHB1 (N-terminal homology box 1), NHB2 (N-terminal homology box 2), CNC domain, basic region, and leucine zipper domains. These domains are essential for DNA-binding specificity and dimerization capabilities, which are critical for its role as a transcription factor (Chevillard2011NFE2L3).

NFE2L3 exists in multiple isoforms, including the glycosylated NFE2L3A, the non-glycosylated NFE2L3B, and the truncated NFE2L3C. These isoforms are associated with different subcellular compartments and have varying half-lives. The 'A' form is N-glycosylated, while 'B' and 'C' are unglycosylated, with the 'C' form potentially being a truncated version of the protein (Chevillard2011NFE2L3; Xiong2024New).

Post-translational modifications of NFE2L3 include glycosylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation. Glycosylation affects the stability and localization of its isoforms, while ubiquitination and phosphorylation are involved in its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Xiong2024New).

## Function
NFE2L3, also known as NRF3, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is part of the CNC-bZIP family and is involved in regulating gene expression related to antioxidant responses, lipid metabolism, and proteasome activity. NFE2L3 is anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and can translocate to the nucleus, where it binds to promoter regions of target genes to modulate their expression (Xiong2024New).

In terms of proteasome regulation, NFE2L3 binds to the ARE site in the promoter region of proteasome subunit genes, such as PSMB3, PSMB7, and POMP, to regulate their expression, which is essential for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis (Xiong2024New). It also interacts with NFE2L1 to modulate proteasome activity (Xiong2024New).

NFE2L3 is involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in cholesterol homeostasis. It enhances the transcription of genes associated with cholesterol synthesis, such as SREBP2, HMGCS1, and HMGCR, and facilitates extracellular cholesterol uptake by enhancing the transcription of RAB5 (Xiong2024New). Additionally, NFE2L3 plays a role in maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and regulating inflammatory responses (Xiong2024New).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NFE2L3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high expression of NFE2L3 is associated with malignant behavior and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting tumor progression through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Knockdown of NFE2L3 in HCC cells results in inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and increased apoptosis, indicating its role in tumorigenesis (Ren2020NFE2L3).

In colon cancer, particularly colon adenocarcinoma, NFE2L3 is upregulated and promotes cancer cell growth by repressing DUX4, a CDK1 inhibitor crucial for cell cycle progression. Its expression is regulated by the NF-kB signaling pathway, and silencing NFE2L3 reduces cell proliferation and tumor growth (Bury2019NFE2L3). Loss of NFE2L3 in a mouse model of colitis-associated tumorigenesis leads to reduced tumor size and number, suggesting its role in inflammation and tumor development (Saliba2022Loss).

NFE2L3 is also implicated in digestive system cancers, with elevated expression linked to poor outcomes in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and correlations with clinical features such as age and tumor stage (Li2024Identification). In malignant pleural mesothelioma, NFE2L3 is associated with the IL-2/STAT5/NLRP3 signaling pathway and immune response modulation, with higher expression levels correlating with worse prognosis (Wang2022NFE2L3).

## Interactions
NFE2L3, also known as NRF3, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its function in cancer and other cellular processes. It interacts with small Maf proteins to form heterodimers, which are essential for its DNA-binding activity and regulation of gene expression (Chowdhury2017Multiple). NFE2L3 is also associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, where it undergoes degradation mediated by E3 ubiquitin ligases such as HRD1 and β-TRCP. HRD1 and VCP are key regulators of its cytoplasmic degradation, while β-TRCP promotes its nuclear degradation through polyubiquitination (Xiong2024New; Chowdhury2017Multiple).

In the context of cancer, NFE2L3 interacts with various proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. It modulates gene expression by targeting the cell cycle regulator U2AF homology motif kinase 1 (UHMK1), promoting cell proliferation (Chowdhury2017Multiple). NFE2L3 also interacts with glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), which is necessary for its ubiquitination and degradation by FBW7 (Xiong2024New). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving NFE2L3, which plays a significant role in cancer progression and cellular stress responses.
