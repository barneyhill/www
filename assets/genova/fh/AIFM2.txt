# AIFM2

## Overview
AIFM2, or apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria-associated 2, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial flavoprotein involved in apoptosis and redox processes. The protein, also referred to as FSP1 or AMID, plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism, particularly in thermogenesis and oxidative stress response. It is characterized by its NADH oxidoreductase activity and its ability to translocate to mitochondria under specific stimuli, such as cold exposure or beta-adrenergic receptor activation, thereby enhancing mitochondrial function and energy expenditure (Xavier2023Molecular; Nguyen2020Aifm2). AIFM2 is also implicated in ferroptosis suppression by regenerating membrane-embedded antioxidants, which is significant in the context of cancer and other diseases (Xavier2023Molecular). The gene's expression and activity are linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer and severe acute pancreatitis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tan2020ATF6; Guo2023AIFM2).

## Structure
The AIFM2 protein, also known as apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria-associated 2, is a mitochondrial flavoprotein involved in apoptosis and redox processes. It contains specific domains, including an N-terminal hydrophobic or membrane domain (amino acids 1-27), a NADH oxidoreductase domain (amino acids 81-285), and an FAD domain (amino acids 286-308) (Nguyen2020Aifm2). The protein is associated with lipid droplets in brown adipose tissue and translocates to mitochondria upon cold exposure or beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation, indicating its role in thermogenesis (Nguyen2020Aifm2).

AIFM2 lacks a signal sequence but is N-myristoylated, which is essential for its association with lipid droplets (Nguyen2020Aifm2). Structural modeling efforts have been made using templates from Caldalkalibacillus thermarum type II NADH dehydrogenase, although detailed structural information such as primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures is not fully described (Novo2020The). The protein's role in ferroptosis suppression involves regenerating membrane-embedded antioxidants, specifically converting ubiquinone to ubiquinol using NAD(P)H (Xavier2023Molecular). Despite these insights, comprehensive structural details, including prominent folds and splice variant isoforms, remain to be elucidated.

## Function
AIFM2, also known as apoptosis-inducing mitochondria-associated factor 2, is a protein that plays a significant role in cellular metabolism and stress response. In healthy human cells, AIFM2 functions primarily as an NADH oxidase, supporting robust glycolysis and thermogenesis, particularly in brown adipose tissue (BAT). It is highly expressed in BAT and is crucial for cold- and diet-induced thermogenesis by maintaining cytosolic NAD levels, which are essential for sustaining high glycolytic rates (Nguyen2020Aifm2).

AIFM2 translocates from lipid droplets to mitochondria upon cold exposure or beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation, where it enhances mitochondrial activity and promotes thermogenesis by supporting the electron transport chain (ETC) (Nguyen2020Aifm2). This translocation is associated with increased NADH oxidase activity, which is critical for maintaining the NAD/NADH ratio and mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby enhancing oxidative metabolism and energy expenditure (Nguyen2020Aifm2).

Additionally, AIFM2 is involved in oxidative stress signaling within mitochondria, mediating communication between mitochondria and the nucleus under stress conditions (Miriyala2016Novel). It also plays a role in regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which is important for survival signaling pathways (Gong2007DNA).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AIFM2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), AIFM2 is significantly upregulated, which is associated with poor patient survival and higher recurrence rates. This upregulation promotes cancer metastasis by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation through the activation of SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling (Guo2023AIFM2). Knockdown experiments in HCC cell lines have shown that reducing AIFM2 expression decreases cell migration and invasion, indicating its role in promoting metastasis (Guo2023AIFM2).

AIFM2 is also overexpressed in several other cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma, stomach and esophageal carcinoma, and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, suggesting its potential oncogenic role in multiple cancers (Guo2023AIFM2). In non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with KEAP1 mutations, AIFM2, also known as FSP1, confers resistance to ferroptosis, a form of cell death, by being upregulated through NRF2 activation (Kim2023FSP1).

In severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), AIFM2 promotes acinar cell apoptosis and inflammation. Its expression is regulated by ATF6 and p53, and silencing AIFM2 ameliorates pathological changes in SAP (Tan2020ATF6).

## Interactions
AIFM2, also known as apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria-associated 2, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. AIFM2 affects the expression of PGC-1α, a major regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, at the protein level, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation. This interaction is crucial for promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells through the activation of SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling. AIFM2 influences the levels of NAD+ and SIRT1 activity, which in turn affects the acetylation status of PGC-1α (Guo2023AIFM2).

AIFM2, also referred to as AMID, interacts with DNA, forming complexes that suppress its redox activity. This interaction suggests a mechanistic link between DNA binding, redox activity, and apoptotic function. The presence of nicotinamide coenzyme negatively affects DNA binding, indicating a regulatory mechanism in its interaction with nucleic acids (Novo2020The).

AIFM2 is also known as FSP1 and interacts with small molecule inhibitors like iFSP1. The binding of iFSP1 to FSP1 is competitive with NADH, highlighting the role of specific residues in this interaction. This interaction is significant for understanding the inhibition mechanism of FSP1 and its role in preventing lipid peroxidation (Xavier2023Molecular).
