# ANKRD13A

## Overview
ANKRD13A is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 13A protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains and ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs). This protein functions primarily as a scaffold in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. The ankyrin repeat domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, while the UIMs are crucial for binding ubiquitinated proteins, playing a significant role in endocytic processes and lysosomal degradation of EGFR. ANKRD13A is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell death pathways and interaction with components of the TNFR1 complex-II, influencing apoptotic signaling. Its clinical significance is highlighted by its involvement in pathological conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia, where it is associated with poor prognosis, and its regulation by miR-204, which affects cell migration and adhesion (Mattioni2020Ring; Zhou2021LncRNA; Won2021ANKRD13a).

## Structure
ANKRD13A is a protein characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. The protein contains three ankyrin repeats at the N-terminal end, which facilitate these interactions (Mattioni2020Ring). In addition to the ankyrin repeats, ANKRD13A has four tandem ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) in the C-terminal region, which are crucial for its function in binding ubiquitinated proteins (Mattioni2020Ring). Specifically, UIM3 and UIM4 are essential for binding to RNF11, a RING E3 ligase, and these motifs are also involved in the interaction with ubiquitinated EGFR (Mattioni2020Ring).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, which is regulated by RNF11 and ITCH. This modification is crucial for ANKRD13A's recruitment to the plasma membrane and its role in sorting activated EGFR for lysosomal degradation (Mattioni2020Ring). ANKRD13A is also subject to phosphorylation, as indicated by the presence of putative Grb2 SH2 binding motifs, which align with the Grb2 consensus sequence and suggest potential post-translational modifications (Mattioni2020Ring). The protein's structure and modifications enable it to function as a scaffold in cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
ANKRD13A is a protein involved in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, playing a crucial role in the endocytic process. It forms a transient complex with EGFR and RNF11 during the early phases of endocytosis, which is essential for sorting EGFR to lysosomes for degradation. The ubiquitination of ANKRD13A, modulated by E3 ligases such as RNF11 and ITCH, is a key factor in this process. RNF11 acts as a negative regulator of ANKRD13A ubiquitination, potentially by inhibiting ITCH activity, which affects ANKRD13A's recruitment to the plasma membrane and its ability to bind ubiquitinated targets (Mattioni2020Ring).

ANKRD13A also acts as a molecular scaffold, linking RNF11 to activated EGFR during early receptor endocytosis and endosomal sorting. This interaction is mediated by ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) in ANKRD13A, which have specificity for Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains. The presence of tandem Ub-binding motifs suggests that ANKRD13A may associate with membrane receptors, coupling internalization machinery to signal transduction (Mattioni2020Ring).

In addition to its role in EGFR signaling, ANKRD13A is involved in the regulation of cell death pathways, specifically by interacting with components of the TNFR1 complex-II, thereby influencing apoptotic signaling pathways (Won2021ANKRD13a).

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD13A has been implicated in various pathological conditions due to its role in cellular processes. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ANKRD13A is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. It is involved in the internalization of receptor proteins, such as the EGF receptor, and may contribute to immune escape by inducing the internalization of HLA-I from the cell membrane, which is crucial for immune signaling (Zhou2021LncRNA). The lncRNA USP30-AS1 regulates ANKRD13A expression, promoting AML cell survival and potentially affecting cancer progression through epigenetic mechanisms (Zhou2021LncRNA).

ANKRD13A is also targeted by miR-204, which influences cell migration and adhesion. Alterations in ANKRD13A expression can affect cytoskeleton organization and focal adhesion, impacting cell motility. In the context of lens and neural crest cell migration, miR-204's regulation of ANKRD13A is crucial, and its dysregulation can lead to developmental abnormalities, such as lens herniation and misplacement of lens cells (Avellino2013miR204). These findings suggest that ANKRD13A plays a significant role in both cancer progression and developmental processes.

## Interactions
ANKRD13A is known to interact with several proteins, primarily through its ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs). It forms a ternary complex with valosin-containing protein (VCP) and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) on endosomes. This interaction is mediated by ubiquitinated proteins, as ANKRD13A preferentially binds to Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains. The interaction between ANKRD13A and VCP is indirect and requires the presence of ubiquitinated Cav-1, which undergoes Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination (Burana2016The).

ANKRD13A also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in a ubiquitination-dependent manner. It forms a transient complex with EGFR and the E3 ligase RNF11 during the early phases of endocytosis. The ubiquitination of ANKRD13A, modulated by RNF11 and ITCH, is crucial for the formation of this complex and for sorting EGFR to the lysosome for degradation (Mattioni2020Ring).

In the TNFR1 signaling pathway, ANKRD13A interacts with RIP1, a key component of complex-II, through its fourth UIM. This interaction is independent of caspase-8 or FADD and is crucial for suppressing the formation of complex-II, thereby regulating caspase-8 activation (Won2021ANKRD13a).
