# DISP2

## Overview
DISP2, or dispatched RND transporter family member 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is critical for embryonic development and cell differentiation. The protein encoded by DISP2 is a transporter-like membrane protein that facilitates the release of cholesterol-modified Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) proteins, essential for long-range SHH signaling. This signaling is particularly important in neural tissue development and patterning during embryogenesis (SinChan2020Exomewide; Heimke2023Localization). DISP2 is predominantly expressed in neuronal cells within the central and enteric nervous systems, with a higher expression in neurons compared to glial cells, indicating its specific role in neuronal development and cognitive functions (Heimke2023Localization). Additionally, DISP2 has been identified as a potential marker for islet cells in the pancreas, suggesting its involvement in endocrine cell development or function (Hald2011Pancreatic). The gene's association with neurocognitive disorders and its protective role against low-grade glioma further highlight its significance in neurological health (Khamse2023A; Khamse2022A).

## Function
The DISP2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the Dispatched homolog family, which plays a crucial role in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for embryonic development and cell differentiation. DISP2 functions as a transporter-like membrane protein involved in the release of cholesterol-modified Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) proteins, which are vital for long-range SHH signaling. This signaling is significant in early development and embryonic patterning, particularly in neural tissues (SinChan2020Exomewide; Heimke2023Localization).

DISP2 is predominantly expressed in neuronal cells within the central nervous system (CNS) and enteric nervous system (ENS), where it is localized in PGP9.5-positive neurons. Its expression is notably higher in neuronal cells compared to glial cells, suggesting a specific role in neuronal development and cognitive functions (Heimke2023Localization). In the pancreas, DISP2 is identified as a potential marker for islet cells, indicating its involvement in endocrine cell development or function (Hald2011Pancreatic).

Although the detailed functions of DISP2 in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, its role in the Hedgehog signaling pathway and its expression patterns suggest its importance in neural and pancreatic development (Hald2011Pancreatic; SinChan2020Exomewide).

## Clinical Significance
The DISP2 gene, also known as dispatched RND transporter family member 2, has been implicated in several neurocognitive disorders due to its role in the human brain. Mutations in the (CCG)-repeat region of DISP2 are associated with late-onset neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), including probable Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. In a study involving 448 Iranian individuals, unique genotypes with 5 and 6 repeats were found exclusively in those with NCDs, suggesting a potential link between these rare alleles and the pathogenesis of such disorders (Khamse2023A; Khamse2022A).

DISP2 is also noted for its protective role against low-grade glioma, highlighting its significance in neurological health (Khamse2022A). Genome-wide association studies have linked DISP2-associated risk loci to altered brain morphology, specifically in the transverse temporal gyrus, and impaired cognitive functions, suggesting its involvement in cognitive disorders (Heimke2023Localization).

While the DISP2 gene is primarily expressed in neuronal cells of the central and enteric nervous systems, its exact role in specific diseases remains under investigation. The gene's involvement in the regulation of hedgehog signaling, crucial for embryologic development, further underscores its potential impact on developmental disorders and cancers (Heimke2023Localization).
