# ROBO2

## Overview
ROBO2 is a gene that encodes the roundabout guidance receptor 2, a single-pass type I transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. This receptor plays a pivotal role in axon guidance and cell migration, particularly within the nervous system, where it influences neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. The protein's structure is characterized by five immunoglobulin-like domains and three fibronectin type III domains, which facilitate its interactions with SLIT proteins and other ligands, such as NELL proteins, to mediate repulsive guidance cues essential for neuronal development (Yamamoto2019Robo2; Bisiak2019Structure). Beyond the nervous system, ROBO2 is crucial in kidney and pancreatic development, where it regulates cellular dynamics and tissue integrity. Clinically, mutations in the ROBO2 gene have been linked to various conditions, including myelodysplastic syndromes and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, highlighting its significance in both developmental biology and disease pathology (Xu2015Wholeexome; Pinho2018ROBO2).

## Structure
ROBO2 is a single-pass type I transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. It features five immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and three fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains in its extracellular region (Yamamoto2019Robo2; Bisiak2019Structure). The protein adopts a unique hairpin-like architecture, with the Ig4 domain playing a crucial role in dimerization, which is essential for its signaling function (Barak2019Structural; Yamamoto2019Robo2). The Ig4 domain is intramolecularly blocked in an auto-inhibited conformation, preventing dimerization until activation occurs (Barak2019Structural).

The structure of ROBO2 includes a transmembrane helix and a large unstructured intracellular region with four conserved cytoplasmic motifs (Bisiak2019Structure). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are present, with the N426 glycosylation site on Ig5 being sequence conserved across species, indicating its functional relevance (Bisiak2019Structure). The protein can exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may influence its function and interactions (Yamamoto2019Robo2).

The quaternary structure involves dimerization, primarily mediated by the Ig4 domain, which is crucial for ROBO2's role in axon guidance and cell signaling (Barak2019Structural).

## Function
ROBO2, or roundabout guidance receptor 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various developmental processes, particularly in axon guidance and cell migration. In the nervous system, ROBO2 plays a crucial role in modulating the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. It influences the balance between neural progenitor self-renewal and the production of intermediate progenitor cells, which is essential for proper neurogenesis in the developing cerebral cortex (Borrell2012SlitRobo). ROBO2 is also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and stem cell dynamics in neurogenic niches, impacting the balance between progenitor cell maintenance and differentiation (Blockus2016SlitRobo).

In kidney development, ROBO2 is essential for the proper formation of the ureteric bud and the separation of the nephrogenic cord from the Wolffian duct, preventing hyperproliferation and ensuring normal kidney morphogenesis (Blockus2016SlitRobo). In the pancreas, ROBO2 acts as a stroma suppressor gene, regulating the stromal environment and immune response through the TGF-β signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining epithelial integrity and preventing mesenchymal transition (Pinho2018ROBO2). These roles highlight the importance of ROBO2 in maintaining cellular and structural integrity across various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ROBO2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), ROBO2 mutations are associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. These mutations disrupt the ROBO-SLIT2 signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining cell growth and apoptosis balance. Patients with ROBO2 mutations often exhibit reduced expression of ROBO1, and these genetic alterations are linked to shorter overall survival and higher rates of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Xu2015Wholeexome).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), ROBO2 acts as a stroma suppressor gene. Its expression is generally low in PDAC tumors, and this low expression is associated with poor prognosis. The loss of ROBO2 expression leads to increased activation of myofibroblasts and induction of TGF-β and Wnt pathways, contributing to tumor progression. ROBO2's role in restraining myofibroblast activation suggests its potential as a therapeutic target in PDAC (Pinho2018ROBO2; Ding2021ROBO2).

ROBO2 is also implicated in asthma, where it affects airway smooth muscle cell migration and is associated with response to inhaled corticosteroids. Its expression levels correlate with asthma phenotypes and treatment responses (HernandezPacheco2021Identification).

## Interactions
ROBO2, a member of the Roundabout receptor family, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for axon guidance and neuronal development. It primarily interacts with SLIT proteins, particularly SLIT2, to mediate repulsive guidance cues that are essential for the proper crossing of commissural axons at the midline in the vertebrate spinal cord (LópezBendito2007Robo1; Mambetisaeva2005Robo). This interaction is vital for maintaining axon guidance and preventing recrossing of the midline (Mambetisaeva2005Robo).

ROBO2 also interacts with neural epidermal growth factor-like (NELL) proteins, specifically NELL1 and NELL2. These interactions occur at a cryptic binding site within the first fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain of ROBO2, which becomes accessible under certain conditions, such as acidic environments or structural changes (Yamamoto2019Robo2). The binding of NELL1 to ROBO2 is influenced by the oligomeric state of ROBO2 and specific amino acid residues at the dimerization interface (Yamamoto2019Robo2).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving ROBO2 in axon guidance and other developmental processes, underscoring its role in neuronal development and function.
