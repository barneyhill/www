# CYGB

## Overview
Cytoglobin (CYGB) is a gene that encodes the cytoglobin protein, a member of the globin family, which is characterized by its role in oxygen transport and storage. Unlike other globins, cytoglobin is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, with a notable presence in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. The protein is involved in several physiological processes, including nitric oxide metabolism, antioxidative defense, and extracellular matrix production. Structurally, cytoglobin is distinguished by its globin domain and the ability to form dimers, which are stabilized by disulfide bonds. Functionally, it acts as a nitric oxide dioxygenase and plays a protective role against oxidative stress, particularly in the kidney and liver. CYGB's involvement in DNA repair and its interactions with nuclear proteins further underscore its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and disease prevention (Hanai2018Roles; Mathai2023Nuclear; Ascenzi2004Neuroglobin).

## Structure
Cytoglobin (CYGB) is a globin protein characterized by a typical globin domain with eight α-helices connected by loops, forming a three-over-three α-helical sandwich structure (Wu2015Molecular; Porto2024Transcriptomics). The primary structure of CYGB consists of 190 amino acids in mammals, which is longer than in other vertebrates due to distinctive N- and C-terminal extensions (Ascenzi2004Neuroglobin; Porto2024Transcriptomics). These extensions are involved in protein-protein interactions and contribute to the structural stability of the protein (Hanai2018Roles).

The tertiary structure of CYGB includes a heme-binding domain where the heme iron atom is hexacoordinated, with the distal HisE7 residue serving as the endogenous sixth ligand (Ascenzi2004Neuroglobin; de2003New). CYGB can form dimers, with a hydrophobic dimer interface stabilized by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions (Burmester2004Neuroglobin). The protein contains two cysteine residues that can form disulfide bonds, influencing its function and allowing it to exist in different oligomeric states (Hanai2018Roles; Porto2024Transcriptomics). These structural features suggest roles in oxygen metabolism and signal transduction.

## Function
Cytoglobin (CYGB) is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes. It is primarily expressed in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, where it plays a significant role in regulating blood pressure and vascular tone through nitric oxide (NO) metabolism. CYGB functions as a nitric oxide dioxygenase (NOD), metabolizing NO in an oxygen-dependent manner, which is crucial for maintaining vascular tone and blood pressure. The protein's activity is supported by cellular reducing systems, such as cytochrome b5 reductase, which facilitate its rapid NO consumption (Liu2017Cytoglobin).

CYGB is also involved in the production of extracellular matrix components, particularly collagen, and is upregulated in response to hypoxic conditions. This suggests a role in processes like osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and wound healing (HANKELN2005Neuroglobin). In the kidney, CYGB is expressed in podocytes, where it has antioxidative functions, protecting cells from oxidative stress and supporting mitochondrial bioenergetics. Knockdown of CYGB in podocytes leads to increased oxidative stress and cell death, indicating its protective role in maintaining cell viability and function (Randi2020The). Overall, CYGB is crucial for cellular respiration, metabolism, and protection against oxidative damage.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CYGB gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly liver diseases such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In these conditions, CYGB expression is reduced, which correlates with increased disease severity. Studies using Cygb-deficient mice have shown that the absence of CYGB leads to aggravated liver fibrosis and cancer development, especially under a choline-deficient amino acid diet. This is due to increased oxidative stress and early activation of hepatic stellate cells, which express high levels of fibroinflammatory genes (Thuy2015Cytoglobin).

CYGB also plays a role in chronic kidney disease (CKD), where its antioxidative function in podocytes is crucial. Alterations in CYGB expression are associated with increased oxidative stress and apoptosis in these cells, contributing to CKD progression. CYGB deficiency in podocytes leads to increased expression of redox-sensitive genes and higher ROS production, indicating its protective role against oxidative stress-induced cell damage (Randi2020The).

In cancer, reduced CYGB expression and promoter hypermethylation have been observed in various malignancies, including lung, head and neck, ovarian, and breast cancers. CYGB's tumor suppressor function is suggested by its ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species and regulate cell interactions in the tumor microenvironment (Hoang2022Cytoglobin).

## Interactions
Cytoglobin (CYGB) interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in DNA damage inhibition and repair pathways. One of the key interactions is with High Mobility Group Box 2 (HMGB2), a non-histone chromatin structural protein. CYGB forms heterodimers with HMGB2 in both the cytosol and nucleus, which is crucial for regulating DNA repair and gene expression. This interaction is particularly important in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, where it affects HMGB2's genome-wide binding and transcriptional regulation (Mathai2023Nuclear).

CYGB's nuclear localization is essential for its function in DNA repair, independent of its antioxidant activity. Experiments with deletion mutants in HEK293 cells demonstrated that nuclear localization is necessary for CYGB to inhibit DNA damage. The ΔC mutant, which is excluded from the nucleus, showed increased DNA damage, while the ΔC-NLS variant, forced into the nucleus, exhibited reduced DNA damage (Mathai2023Nuclear).

Interactome analysis identified 87 protein interactors of CYGB, with 31 being nuclear-associated proteins following hydrogen peroxide treatment. These interactions suggest that CYGB's role in DNA repair is distinct from its role in scavenging reactive oxygen species (Mathai2023Nuclear).
