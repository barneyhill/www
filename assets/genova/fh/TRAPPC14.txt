# TRAPPC14

## Overview
TRAPPC14, also known as C7orf43, is a gene that encodes the protein trafficking protein particle complex subunit 14, a crucial component of the TRAPPII complex. This protein is integral to cellular processes such as ciliogenesis and vesicle-mediated transport. In ciliogenesis, TRAPPC14 facilitates the tethering of preciliary vesicles to the mother centriole, a vital step in the formation of primary cilia, by interacting with proteins like Rabin8 and distal appendage proteins such as CEP83 and FBF1 (Cuenca2019The). Additionally, TRAPPC14 is involved in intracellular transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, contributing to essential cellular functions like secretion and organelle biogenesis (Cuenca2019The). Mutations in TRAPPC14 have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autosomal recessive primary microcephaly, and the gene has been associated with ovarian cancer survival, highlighting its clinical significance (Cuenca2019The; Li2023Transcriptomic).

## Function
TRAPPC14, also known as C7orf43, is a component of the TRAPPII complex, which plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation in human cells. This protein is essential for the tethering of preciliary vesicles to the mother centriole, a critical step in the assembly of primary cilia. TRAPPC14 interacts directly with Rabin8, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor necessary for activating Rab8, a small GTPase involved in ciliary growth. This interaction facilitates the accumulation of Rabin8 at the centrosome, which is necessary for the initiation of ciliogenesis (Cuenca2019The).

TRAPPC14 also interacts with distal appendage proteins such as CEP83 and FBF1, which are required for Rabin8's centrosomal accumulation. This suggests that TRAPPC14 plays a significant role in the regulation of preciliary trafficking by mediating the association of Rabin8 with the TRAPPII complex, thereby facilitating the tethering of preciliary vesicles to the mother centriole (Cuenca2019The).

In addition to its role in ciliogenesis, TRAPPC14 is involved in vesicle-mediated transport within cells, particularly between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, contributing to cellular processes like secretion, membrane trafficking, and organelle biogenesis (Cuenca2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRAPPC14 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders. Specifically, mutations in C7orf43, which encodes TRAPPC14, have been identified in patients with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH), a condition characterized by reduced brain size and intellectual disabilities. A particular truncating mutation in C7orf43 results in a fragment that cannot associate with TRAPPC10, potentially contributing to the disease phenotype (Cuenca2019The). These findings suggest that defects in neurogenesis and ciliary signaling pathways, crucial for cell patterning, proliferation, and survival during development, could be linked to mutations in TRAPPC14 and other TRAPPII complex components (Cuenca2019The).

In addition to its role in neurodevelopmental disorders, TRAPPC14 has been identified as a strong gene associated with ovarian cancer survival. Transcriptomic profiling studies have highlighted TRAPPC14's potential relevance in predicting 5-year survival in ovarian cancer, with significant expression patterns and network-adjusted differential expression values (Li2023Transcriptomic). These studies suggest that TRAPPC14 may play a role in cancer cell growth, self-renewal, drug resistance, and tumor cell proliferation, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2023Transcriptomic).

## Interactions
TRAPPC14, also known as C7orf43, is a component of the TRAPPII complex and plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis by mediating interactions with several proteins. It directly binds to Rabin8, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor essential for activating Rab8, which is critical for ciliary growth. This interaction is necessary for the association of Rabin8 with the TRAPPII complex, facilitating the tethering of preciliary vesicles to the mother centriole (Cuenca2019The).

TRAPPC14 also interacts with distal appendage proteins (DAPs) such as CEP83 and FBF1, which are essential for Rabin8 vesicular accumulation at the centrosome. These interactions are crucial for the docking and transport of preciliary vesicles to the distal appendages, aiding in the assembly of the ciliary membrane (Shakya2021Recent; Cuenca2019The).

While TRAPPC14 is not required for the integrity of the TRAPPII complex, it is essential for linking Rabin8 to the complex. It interacts with TRAPPC9 and TRAPPC10, although TRAPPC10 is not necessary for the TRAPPC14-Rabin8 interaction (Cuenca2019The). These interactions highlight TRAPPC14's role in regulating preciliary trafficking and ciliogenesis.
