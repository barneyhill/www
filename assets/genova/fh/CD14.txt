# CD14

## Overview
CD14 is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system as a pattern recognition receptor. The CD14 protein is primarily expressed on the surface of monocytes and macrophages and exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. It functions as a co-receptor, particularly in association with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and MD-2, to recognize and bind lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, thereby initiating immune responses (Zanoni2013Role; Kitchens1999Role). The protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeats, which form a structure essential for its ligand-binding capabilities (Kelley2012The). Beyond its role in innate immunity, CD14 is implicated in various physiological processes, including metabolism and inflammation, and has been studied for its involvement in diseases such as periodontitis, gastric cancer, and coronary heart disease (CastañoRodríguez2013The; Loo2012Clinical).

## Structure
The CD14 protein is a glycoprotein primarily expressed on monocytes and macrophages, existing in both membrane-bound (mCD14) and soluble (sCD14) forms. The primary structure of human CD14 consists of 375 amino acids, including a 19 amino acid signal peptide that is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum (Function; Stelter1999Structure&amp; sol). The protein is characterized by 10 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which form a bent solenoid structure typical of LRR-containing proteins (Kelley2012The). 

The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta strands, with five alpha helices on the convex side and eleven beta strands forming a parallel beta sheet on the concave side (Kelley2012The). The tertiary structure features a hydrophobic amino-terminal pocket, which is crucial for binding lipid chains of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and other acylated ligands (Kelley2012The). 

CD14 is anchored to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and contains four potential N-linked glycosylation sites, contributing to about 20% of its molecular mass (Function; Stelter1999Structure&amp; sol). The soluble form of CD14 lacks the C-terminal sequence required for GPI anchoring, which does not affect its LPS bioactivity (Kelley2012The). The protein's structure is essential for its role in the immune response, particularly in recognizing and binding LPS.

## Function
The CD14 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the immune response by acting as a co-receptor for the recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. CD14 is primarily expressed on the surface of monocytes and macrophages, where it enhances the sensitivity of these cells to LPS, facilitating the activation of immune responses (Zanoni2013Role; Kitchens1999Role). 

CD14 functions in conjunction with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and MD-2 to form a receptor complex that initiates signaling pathways leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This process is essential for the activation of the TLR4-TRAM-TRIF pathway, which is crucial for type-I interferon production and the full activation of the immune response (Zanoni2013Role). 

In addition to its role in innate immunity, CD14 is involved in the regulation of metabolism, insulin resistance, and obesity. It also has TLR4-independent signaling capabilities, activating NFAT transcription factors in myeloid cells, which are important for the production of cytokines like IL-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (Zanoni2013Role). 

CD14 exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with the soluble form (sCD14) playing a role in mediating responses to LPS in cells that do not express CD14 on their surface (Frey1992Soluble).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the CD14 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly those involving inflammatory responses. The CD14 -159C > T polymorphism has been studied in the context of periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the periodontal tissues. Some studies suggest that the 159T/T genotype is more prevalent in periodontitis patients, indicating a potential role in disease susceptibility (Loo2012Clinical). However, other research has found no significant association between this polymorphism and periodontitis across different populations, highlighting the complexity of genetic influences on this condition (Chen2019Association).

In the context of gastric cancer, the CD14 -260 C/T polymorphism has been investigated, with findings suggesting that the T allele may confer protection against non-cardia gastric cancer in certain populations (CastañoRodríguez2013The). This polymorphism may affect the expression of soluble CD14, influencing the host's immune response to Helicobacter pylori, a known risk factor for gastric cancer (CastañoRodríguez2013The).

The CD14 gene has also been examined in relation to coronary heart disease (CHD). While some studies suggest a potential association between CD14 polymorphisms and CHD, the evidence remains inconclusive, with no statistically significant links established (Pasqualini2012Association).

## Interactions
The CD14 molecule is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in immune signaling. CD14 binds to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, forming a complex with LPS-binding protein (LBP) that facilitates the transfer of LPS to the MD2-TLR4 complex, essential for immune response activation (Wright1990CD14; Wu2019CD14:). CD14 also interacts with TLR2 in LPS recognition and is necessary for certain signaling pathways, particularly at low LPS concentrations (Wu2019CD14:).

CD14 recruits TIRAP-MyD88 adaptors to TIR domains, leading to the assembly of the myddosome and activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways (Wu2019CD14:). It also recruits src family kinase (SFK) and phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) at lipid rafts, leading to Ca2+ influx and activation of calcineurin, which dephosphorylates NFAT, allowing it to migrate to the nucleus (Wu2019CD14:). CD14 stabilizes TLR4/MD2 heterodimerization, promoting TLR4 endocytosis and subsequent signaling through TRAM and TRIF, activating IRF3 and producing IFN-β and other genes (Wu2019CD14:).

CD14 also binds to viral nucleic acids, such as dsRNA and CpG-DNA, aiding in their recognition and internalization, which is crucial for TLR3 and TLR9 activation (Wu2019CD14:). It interacts with endogenous molecules like heat shock proteins (HSPs) and serum phosphatidylinositides, inhibiting LPS-induced responses (Wu2019CD14:). CD14 is involved in the activation of microglia by β-amyloid and other amyloid-forming proteins (Wu2019CD14:).
