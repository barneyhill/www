# BIN3

## Overview
BIN3, or bridging integrator 3, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a member of the BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain protein family. The BIN3 protein is characterized by its involvement in membrane dynamics and actin cytoskeleton organization, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as endocytosis, cell morphology, and myogenesis. It is ubiquitously expressed in most human tissues, with the notable exception of the brain, and is implicated in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions, including cancer and Parkinson's disease. BIN3's structural simplicity, consisting solely of the BAR domain, allows it to interact with small GTPases like Rac1 and Cdc42, influencing actin polymerization and cellular migration. Clinically, BIN3 is recognized as a tumor suppressor gene, with alterations in its expression linked to cancer progression and metastasis, particularly in breast cancer (Routhier2001Human; Chen2023BIN3rs2280104; marshall2014bin3).

## Structure
The BIN3 protein is characterized by the presence of a BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain, which is a conserved domain of approximately 250-280 amino acids. This domain forms banana-shaped dimers with positively charged concave faces, facilitating membrane binding and curvature sensing (marshall2014bin3; Ren2006The). The BAR domain's structure includes a tri-helical coiled-coil architecture, which is crucial for its function in membrane dynamics (Ren2006The).

BIN3 is composed solely of this BAR domain, distinguishing it from other proteins that may have additional domains. This structural simplicity allows BIN3 to participate in various cellular functions, including interactions with small GTPases and involvement in processes like cytokinesis and tumor suppression (marshall2014bin3; Ren2006The).

In terms of post-translational modifications and splice variants, the context does not provide specific details for BIN3. However, it is noted that unlike its homolog Bin1, which produces many distinct transcripts, BIN3 appears to have only a single major transcript expressed ubiquitously in most tissues except the brain (Ren2006The). The specific molecular interactions and modifications of BIN3 remain to be fully elucidated.

## Function
BIN3 (bridging integrator 3) is a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily related to actin cytoskeleton organization and membrane dynamics. In healthy human cells, BIN3 is ubiquitously expressed across most tissues, except the brain, and is involved in regulating actin-dependent processes such as endocytosis and cell morphology (Routhier2001Human). BIN3 plays a crucial role in the localization and regulation of F-actin, as demonstrated by its ability to rescue F-actin localization defects in yeast models lacking the hob3 gene, which is homologous to BIN3 (Routhier2001Human).

The protein is part of the BAR domain family, which is known for its involvement in membrane curvature and dynamics. BIN3's structural characteristics suggest it may interact with other proteins involved in endocytosis and vesiculation, influencing cellular processes like vesicle formation and transport (Routhier2001Human). Although its exact functions in human cells are not fully elucidated, BIN3's role in actin regulation and membrane dynamics indicates its importance in maintaining cell structure and communication. The protein's ubiquitous expression in both normal and tumor cell lines suggests a fundamental role in cellular homeostasis (Routhier2001Human).

## Clinical Significance
The BIN3 gene, located on chromosome 8p21, is identified as a tumor suppressor gene with significant implications in cancer biology, particularly breast cancer. Alterations in BIN3 expression, such as loss of the gene, are associated with increased resistance to anoikis, a form of programmed cell death, which facilitates tumorigenesis and metastasis. This resistance is linked to poor prognosis in breast cancer, including higher tumor grade, lymph node infiltration, and decreased survival (marshall2014bin3). Approximately 50% of breast cancers exhibit heterozygous or homozygous loss of the BIN3 locus, which is particularly enriched in metastatic cancers (marshall2014bin3).

BIN3's tumor suppressive function is mediated through its interaction with CDC42, a protein involved in cell signaling. Loss of BIN3 leads to mislocalization of TUBA, a CDC42-specific GEF, resulting in decreased CDC42 activation and attenuated P38α signaling, which are crucial for anoikis (marshall2014bin3). Restoration of BIN3 expression in cancer cells reduces anoikis resistance and tumorigenicity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (marshall2014bin3).

In Parkinson's disease, the BIN3 rs2280104 T allele is associated with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and altered brain network topology, indicating its role in non-motor symptoms of the disease (Chen2023BIN3rs2280104).

## Interactions
BIN3, a member of the BAR domain protein family, plays a significant role in myogenesis through its interactions with Rho GTPases, specifically Rac1 and Cdc42. These interactions are crucial for actin polymerization and the formation of lamellipodia, which are essential for muscle cell migration and myotube formation. BIN3 forms a complex with active Rac1 and Cdc42, enhancing their activity and promoting actin-dependent processes in muscle cells. The absence of BIN3 results in decreased levels of active Rac1 and Cdc42, leading to defects in lamellipodia formation and impaired cell migration (SimionescuBankston2013The).

Although BIN3 lacks a RhoGAP/GEF domain, it may recruit other proteins with such activity to modulate Rac1 and Cdc42. This suggests that BIN3 could interact with an unknown RhoGAP/GEF protein or heterodimerize with another BAR domain protein to influence RhoGAP/GEF activity (SimionescuBankston2013The). BIN3's role in muscle regeneration is highlighted by its impact on myofiber growth and branching, where its absence causes delays and abnormalities in these processes (SimionescuBankston2013The). These interactions underscore BIN3's importance in regulating cellular processes during muscle development and repair.
