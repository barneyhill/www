# GPR155

## Overview
GPR155 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 155, a lysosomal membrane protein that functions as a transceptor, integrating characteristics of both transporters and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The protein, also known as LYCHOS, is involved in critical cellular processes, including cholesterol homeostasis and lysosomal signaling pathways. Structurally, GPR155 features a complex architecture with 17 transmembrane helices, forming both a transporter-like domain and a GPCR domain, the latter resembling class B GPCRs. This unique configuration allows GPR155 to participate in cellular signaling by interacting with the GTPase-activating protein complex GATOR1, thereby influencing mTORC1 signaling. The protein's function and interactions are modulated by cholesterol, which stabilizes its dimeric assembly and affects its structural conformation. Clinically, GPR155 has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, where its downregulation is associated with more aggressive disease phenotypes and poorer survival outcomes (Umeda2017Downregulation; Sharma2024CryoEM).

## Structure
The GPR155 protein, also known as LYCHOS, is a lysosomal membrane transceptor that integrates a transporter domain and a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) domain. The transmembrane domain (TMD) of GPR155 consists of 17 transmembrane helices (TM1-17), with the first ten helices forming a transporter-like structure with a NhaA fold, similar to plant auxin efflux transporters and bacterial Na+/H+ antiporters (Sharma2024CryoEM). This transporter domain is divided into a scaffold subdomain (TM1-2 and TM6-7) and a transport subdomain (TM3-5 and TM8-10), with TM4 and TM9 forming an X-shaped crossover crucial for substrate coordination (Sharma2024CryoEM).

The C-terminal helices (TM11-17) form a 7TM domain structure resembling class B GPCRs, despite low sequence identity with other GPCR classes. This domain is stabilized by conserved motifs in TM14 and TM17 (Sharma2024CryoEM). Cholesterol plays a significant role in stabilizing the structure, with multiple binding sites influencing dimerization and regulation (Sharma2024CryoEM). The protein can exist in monomeric and dimeric forms, with dimerization modes modulated by cholesterol and phospholipids (Sharma2024CryoEM). The C-terminus includes a Disheveled, Egl-10, and Pleckstrin (DEP) domain, which may interact with Gβ5-γ subunits (Sharma2024CryoEM).

## Function
GPR155, also known as LYCHOS, is a lysosomal membrane protein that functions as a transceptor, integrating features of both transporters and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). It plays a significant role in lysosomal signaling pathways, particularly in cholesterol homeostasis and metabolism. GPR155 binds cholesterol through its transmembrane domain (TM1), which induces conformational changes that facilitate interaction with the GTPase-activating protein complex GATOR1. This interaction promotes Rag GTPase activation and mTORC1 localization at the lysosome, a process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating cholesterol-dependent mTORC1 signaling (Sharma2024CryoEM).

The protein's structure includes a transporter domain with similarities to the auxin transporter PIN family, suggesting a potential role in substrate transport, possibly involving indole-containing compounds. GPR155 exhibits a dimeric assembly stabilized by cholesterol, which influences its structural configuration and function (Sharma2024CryoEM). The GPCR domain of GPR155 is classified as a Class B receptor, with unique structural features that may keep it in an activated state, indicating a complex role in cellular signaling and lysosomal function (Sharma2024CryoEM).

## Clinical Significance
GPR155, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Research indicates that downregulation of GPR155 is associated with more aggressive HCC phenotypes and poorer postoperative survival outcomes. Specifically, decreased GPR155 mRNA expression was observed in 89% of HCC cell lines compared to non-tumorigenic controls, and similar patterns were found in clinical HCC samples (Umeda2017Downregulation). This downregulation correlates with high preoperative α-fetoprotein levels, poor differentiation, serosal infiltration, vascular invasion, and advanced disease stages, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker (Umeda2017Downregulation).

The study by Umeda et al. explored potential mechanisms for GPR155 downregulation, such as promoter hypermethylation and copy number alterations. While no methylation was detected in the promoter region, copy number alterations were present in 56% of HCC cell lines with reduced GPR155 expression (Umeda2017Downregulation). The expression levels of GPR155 were consistent in non-cancerous liver tissues, regardless of hepatitis virus infection status, indicating that its downregulation may be specific to HCC progression (Umeda2017Downregulation). These findings highlight the potential clinical utility of GPR155 as a prognostic marker for HCC, aiding in risk stratification and management of patients (Umeda2017Downregulation).

## Interactions
GPR155, also known as G protein-coupled receptor 155, is involved in several interactions that influence its function as a transceptor. It interacts with the GTPase-activating protein complex GATOR1 upon binding cholesterol, which promotes Rag GTPase activation and subsequent mTORC1 activation at the lysosome (Sharma2024CryoEM). The protein's dimeric assembly is sensitive to cholesterol levels, affecting its structural conformation and potentially its interactions with other proteins (Sharma2024CryoEM).

The GPCR domain of GPR155 includes a LYCHOS effector domain (LED) within a long intracellular loop (ICL8), which may interact with GATOR1 complexes (Sharma2024CryoEM). The C-terminus of the GPCR domain contains a DEP domain, commonly found in the RGS family of proteins, which interact with Gβ5-γ subunits, suggesting the possibility of GPR155 binding to Gβγ subunits (Sharma2024CryoEM).

While specific interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed, GPR155's involvement in cellular signaling pathways and its structural features suggest it may participate in complex regulatory networks within the cell. The protein's interactions are influenced by its structural conformation, which is modulated by cholesterol and phospholipids (Sharma2024CryoEM).
