# PIGK

## Overview
PIGK is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class K, a critical component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex. This complex is essential for the post-translational modification of proteins through the attachment of GPI anchors, which facilitate the anchoring of proteins to the cell membrane. The PIGK protein functions as a cysteine protease, specifically within the C13 family, and plays a pivotal role in cleaving precursor proteins to enable GPI anchoring, a process vital for cell signaling, adhesion, and protein sorting (Xu2022Molecular; Kinoshita2016Thematic). The structural integrity and function of PIGK are maintained through its interactions with other subunits of the GPI transamidase complex, including PIGT, PIGU, GPAA1, and PIGS, as well as through regulatory pathways such as the SEL1L-HRD1 ER-associated degradation pathway (Wei2024Proteomic; Xu2022Molecular). Alterations in the PIGK gene have been implicated in various diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (DASGUPTA2012A).

## Structure
The PIGK protein is a crucial component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex, which is responsible for attaching GPI anchors to proteins. Structurally, PIGK is a cysteine protease of the C13 family, sharing homology with legumains. It features a central 6-stranded β-sheet flanked by three α-helices on each side, forming its secondary structure (Xu2022Molecular). The protein's active site is involved in the transamidation process, cleaving proproteins at the ω-residue for GPI attachment (Xu2022Molecular).

PIGK's tertiary structure includes a protease domain positioned within a three-sided cavity formed by the PIGT/PIGU platform, GPAA1, and PIGS. This configuration allows PIGK to interact with PIGT and PIGS through multivalent interfaces, including hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions. A significant inter-subunit disulfide bond between PIGK C92 and PIGT C182 is crucial for maintaining GPI-T activity (Xu2022Molecular).

In terms of quaternary structure, PIGK is part of a heteropentameric assembly within the GPI-T complex, which includes PIGT, PIGU, PIGS, and GPAA1. This complex is essential for the biogenesis of GPI anchor proteins (Xu2022Molecular).

## Function
PIGK is a crucial component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex, which is responsible for the attachment of GPI anchors to proteins. This process occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and is essential for anchoring proteins to the cell membrane, influencing cell signaling, adhesion, and protein sorting (Xu2022Molecular; Kinoshita2016Thematic). PIGK functions as a cysteine protease within the GPI transamidase complex, cleaving the C-terminal GPI attachment signal peptide of precursor proteins and facilitating the formation of a thioester bond with the GPI anchor (Wei2024Proteomic; Xu2022Molecular).

The structural arrangement of PIGK within the complex involves interactions with other subunits such as PIGT and PIGS, which stabilize its position and ensure proper catalytic activity. These interactions include hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions, as well as a critical disulfide bond with PIGT (Xu2022Molecular). The catalytic dyad of PIGK is positioned to interact with the GPI substrate, facilitating the transamidation process necessary for GPI anchoring (Xu2022Molecular).

PIGK's activity is regulated by the SEL1L-HRD1 ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which targets misfolded PIGK proteins for degradation, preventing the accumulation of potentially pathogenic aggregates (Wei2024Proteomic). This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring the proper function of GPI-anchored proteins, which play significant roles in various physiological processes (Wei2024Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PIGK gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. A study identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs1048575, in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the PIGK gene, which is linked to reduced expression of the PIGK protein in colorectal cancer (CRC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients (DASGUPTA2012A). This SNP was found in 67% of CRC patients and was more prevalent among individuals of Jewish origin compared to Arabian patients (DASGUPTA2012A). The presence of altered alleles (C/G or G/G) was associated with significantly lower PIGK protein expression, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of these cancers (DASGUPTA2012A).

The study also explored the effects of forced overexpression of wild-type PIGK in liver cancer cell lines, revealing that exogenous PIGK protein expression was detectable in cells with ancestral alleles but not in those with altered alleles, indicating that the SNP may affect PIGK expression (DASGUPTA2012A). While no mutations were found in the coding regions of the PIGK gene, the role of PIGK in tumorigenesis remains largely unknown (DASGUPTA2012A).

## Interactions
PIGK is a catalytic subunit of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex, which is essential for the attachment of GPI anchors to proteins. Within this complex, PIGK interacts with several other subunits, including PIGT, PIGU, GPAA1, and PIGS. PIGK is positioned within a three-sided cavity formed by the PIGT/PIGU platform, with additional interactions from GPAA1 and PIGS. It interacts with PIGS through two grooves, involving hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions, which secure its position. The C-terminal portion of PIGK interacts with PIGT and PIGU, and an inter-subunit disulfide bond between PIGK C92 and PIGT C182 further stabilizes PIGK's position (Xu2022Molecular).

PIGK is also involved in the SEL1L-HRD1 ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it is targeted for proteasomal degradation. This interaction is specific to PIGK and does not extend to other subunits of the GPI-transamidase complex. The SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD pathway regulates the abundance of the GPI-transamidase complex by targeting misfolded PIGK proteins, thereby influencing the biogenesis of GPI-anchored proteins (Wei2024Proteomic).
