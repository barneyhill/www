# RERG

## Overview
RERG (RAS-like estrogen-regulated growth inhibitor) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, which are pivotal in signal transduction pathways. The RERG protein functions primarily as a tumor suppressor, playing a crucial role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis. It is predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm of various normal tissues and is notably regulated by estrogen, indicating its involvement in hormone-responsive tissues (Habashy2010RERG; Zhao2017RERG). The protein's tumor-suppressive activities are mediated through the inhibition of the ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway, which is essential for cellular growth and development (Zhao2017RERG). This pathway modulation results in decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinases and pro-angiogenic factors, thereby reducing tumor invasion and metastasis. RERG's expression is associated with luminal differentiation markers in breast cancer, suggesting its role in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential as a prognostic marker in cancer (Habashy2010RERG).

## Function
The RERG (RAS-like estrogen-regulated growth inhibitor) gene encodes a protein that is part of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, which are involved in signal transduction pathways. In healthy human cells, RERG is widely expressed across multiple normal tissues and is primarily active in the cytoplasm (Habashy2010RERG; Zhao2017RERG). The protein plays a role in regulating cell growth and proliferation, acting as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis (Zhao2017RERG). 

RERG's function is mediated through the ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and development. By inhibiting this pathway, RERG reduces the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and pro-angiogenic factors, which are involved in tumor invasion and metastasis (Zhao2017RERG). The gene's expression is regulated by estrogen, suggesting a role in hormone-responsive tissues, and it is associated with markers of luminal differentiation in breast cancer, indicating its involvement in maintaining normal cellular functions (Habashy2010RERG). While specific functions in healthy cells are not detailed, its expression in normal tissues implies a role in normal cellular regulation and development processes (Zhao2017RERG).

## Clinical Significance
RERG (RAS like estrogen regulated growth inhibitor) is implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer. Alterations in RERG expression can significantly influence tumor growth and progression. Reduced expression of RERG is often associated with more aggressive cancer phenotypes, suggesting that the gene may play a role in inhibiting tumor growth. This characteristic positions RERG as a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis, where lower levels of expression could indicate a more aggressive disease course.

In breast cancer, the downregulation of RERG has been linked to poorer clinical outcomes, highlighting its potential utility in predicting disease progression and patient prognosis. The gene's expression levels may also inform therapeutic strategies, as restoring or enhancing RERG expression could potentially inhibit tumor growth and improve patient outcomes. This suggests that RERG could be a target for novel cancer therapies aimed at modulating its expression to achieve therapeutic benefits.

Overall, the clinical significance of RERG lies in its potential role as both a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target in cancer treatment, particularly in breast cancer, where its expression levels correlate with disease aggressiveness and patient prognosis.

## Interactions
RERG interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In luminal breast cancers, RERG forms a complex with NFAT3, a transcription factor, which is crucial for inhibiting cell invasion. This interaction is particularly important as it is associated with the absence of axillary lymph node colonization, suggesting a potential role as a prognostic marker (Coillard2022The).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, RERG suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis through the ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway. It reduces the phosphorylation of ERK and p65, while increasing p-IKBα levels, leading to decreased expression of molecules like MMP-2 and MMP-9, which are involved in tumor invasion and metastasis (Zhao2017RERG).

In glioma cells, RERG interacts with PHLPP2, forming a complex that inhibits the activation of the AKT/ERK/NF-κB pathways. This interaction is targeted by miR-650, which plays oncogenic roles by activating these pathways (Jin2020NFκBmediated).

In colorectal cancer, RERG expression is regulated by the long non-coding RNA FGF14-AS2, which sponges miR-1288-3p. This interaction leads to the inhibition of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, reducing cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis (Hou2020Overexpression).
