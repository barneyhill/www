# FAM200A

## Overview
FAM200A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 200 member A. This protein is characterized by its potential involvement in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain largely undefined. FAM200A has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and cystic fibrosis, suggesting its role in disease mechanisms. The protein encoded by FAM200A has been identified as a potential interacting partner with the CASK_CAMK domain, although its binding affinity is relatively low due to structural limitations (Wang2022Crystal). Additionally, FAM200A has been noted for its hypermethylation in prostate adenocarcinoma, indicating a possible involvement in cancer-related pathways (Xu2019Identification). Despite these associations, further research is needed to fully elucidate the functional roles and interaction networks of the FAM200A protein.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
FAM200A has been implicated in various cancer-related studies, suggesting its potential role in tumorigenesis. In a systematic study of rare cancer variants, the FAM200A S481N allele was identified as having potential oncogenic properties, as it scored in a pooled screen designed to assess tumorigenic potential (Kim2016Systematic). This indicates that mutations in FAM200A may contribute to cancer development, although the specific mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.

In the context of pleomorphic dermal sarcomas (PDS), FAM200A was identified as one of the significantly mutated genes, alongside others like TP53 and CDKN2A/B. While the study did not provide detailed clinical implications for FAM200A, its mutation in PDS suggests a possible role in the disease's mutational landscape (Klein2020Integrative).

Additionally, FAM200A has been identified as a hypermethylated gene in prostate adenocarcinoma, indicating that alterations in its methylation status could be involved in cancer progression. This hypermethylation suggests that FAM200A might serve as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target in prostate cancer, although specific clinical applications are still under investigation (Xu2019Identification).

## Interactions
The FAM200A protein, encoded by the FAM200A gene, has been identified as a potential interacting partner with the CASK_CAMK domain through a proposed binding motif ζ-x-ψ-W-ψ-x-R. However, its binding affinity to the CASK_CAMK domain is lower compared to other proteins due to the inability of its C-terminal lysine to form cation-pi packing, which is crucial for stronger interactions (Wang2022Crystal). Despite this potential interaction, the specific physical interactions of FAM200A with other proteins or nucleic acids are not well-documented in the available literature. 

In the context of cystic fibrosis, FAM200A has been noted to be upregulated in patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting a possible role in the disease's pathology, although specific interaction partners in this context have not been detailed (Benabdelkamel2020SerumBased). Additionally, FAM200A has been identified as a hypermethylated gene in prostate adenocarcinoma, indicating its potential involvement in cancer-related pathways, but again, specific protein interactions have not been described (Xu2019Identification). Overall, while FAM200A is implicated in various conditions, its precise interaction network remains to be fully elucidated.
