# SLC27A1

## Overview
The SLC27A1 gene encodes the protein known as solute carrier family 27 member 1, commonly referred to as fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1). This protein is a transmembrane transporter that plays a pivotal role in the uptake and metabolism of long-chain and very long-chain fatty acids across cell membranes. FATP1 is characterized by its multiple membrane-spanning domains and an AMP-binding motif, which is crucial for its acyl-CoA synthetase activity (Stahl2004A; Martin2000The). It is primarily involved in the transport of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) across the blood-brain barrier, a function essential for cognitive health and neuroprotection (Ochiai2017The). Additionally, FATP1 interacts with other proteins and is subject to regulation by factors such as insulin and iron, which influence its localization and activity (Supti2024Iron; Ochiai2017The). The gene's expression and function have significant implications for metabolic and neurological health, with alterations linked to conditions such as obesity, insulin resistance, and neurodegenerative diseases (Stahl2004A; Ochiai2017The).

## Structure
The SLC27A1 gene encodes the fatty acid transport protein-1 (FATP-1), which is involved in the transport of long-chain and very long-chain fatty acids across cell membranes. The protein is approximately 71 kDa in size and is predicted to have multiple membrane-spanning domains, with models suggesting one to four transmembrane regions (Stahl2004A; Martin2000The). The amino-terminal 28 residues are predicted to form an α-helical structure, contributing to its membrane association (Ordovás2006Structural).

FATP-1 contains an AMP-binding motif, which is essential for its acyl-CoA synthetase activity, and a lipocalin structure involved in the transport of small hydrophobic molecules (Martin2000The; Ordovás2006Structural). The protein also has three potential N-linked glycosylation sites, which may play a role in its function and stability (Martin2000The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are suggested to influence the activity and localization of FATP-1. The protein can form homo-dimeric complexes, potentially through interactions in the cytoplasmic loop between amino acids 191 and 475 (Stahl2004A). An alternative splice variant of SLC27A1 results in a shorter isoform, which may have distinct functional roles (Ordovás2006Structural).

## Function
The SLC27A1 gene encodes the fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1), which plays a crucial role in the transport of long-chain fatty acids across cell membranes. In healthy human cells, FATP1 is primarily involved in the uptake and metabolism of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This protein is localized at the basal membrane of brain microvessel endothelial cells, facilitating the transport of DHA, taurine, and biotin into the brain (Ochiai2017The). 

FATP1 functions as a dual transporter, mediating both the influx and efflux of DHA, which is essential for maintaining adequate DHA levels in the brain, crucial for cognitive function and neuroprotection (Ochiai2017The; Ochiai2019Amyloid). The transport of DHA by FATP1 is enhanced by insulin, which promotes the translocation of FATP1 to the plasma membrane, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for DHA supply to the brain (Ochiai2017The). 

FATP1 is also involved in the transport of other molecules such as taurine and biotin, which are vital for brain function. The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining brain health and function, highlighting its significance in nutrient transport and homeostasis (Ochiai2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the SLC27A1 gene, which encodes the fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1), have been implicated in several metabolic and neurological conditions. A polymorphism in the FATP1 gene has been associated with increased plasma triglyceride levels, suggesting a potential link to metabolic disorders such as obesity and insulin resistance (Stahl2004A). Dysregulation of FATP1 may also contribute to cardiovascular disease risk due to its role in lipid metabolism (Stahl2004A).

In the context of neurological health, FATP1 is involved in the transport of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) across the blood-brain barrier, a process that is crucial for maintaining adequate DHA levels in the brain. Impaired insulin signaling, which affects FATP1 activity, could potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (Ochiai2017The). Additionally, FATP1's role in transporting taurine and biotin to the brain suggests that mutations or altered expression could impact brain health and contribute to conditions such as biotin-responsive basal ganglia disease (Ochiai2017The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SLC27A1 in both metabolic and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
SLC27A1, also known as fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1), is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its role in lipid metabolism. It forms a constitutive interaction with long-chain acyl coenzyme A synthetase 1 (ACSL1) in adipocytes. This interaction is essential for the process of vectorial acylation, where fatty acid transport is closely linked to esterification, facilitating efficient uptake and metabolism of long-chain fatty acids (Richards2006Fatty).

In the context of the blood-brain barrier, SLC27A1 is involved in the transport of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and interacts with other proteins such as FABP5 and FATP4, which also contribute to DHA transport. The presence of amyloid beta (Ab) 25-35 peptide can impair the expression and function of SLC27A1, affecting its ability to mediate DHA efflux (Ochiai2019Amyloid).

SLC27A1's function can be modulated by external factors such as iron, which reduces its protein abundance and affects fatty acid efflux in brain endothelial cells. This modulation is not transcriptionally driven but may be related to increased reactive oxygen species levels induced by iron (Supti2024Iron).
