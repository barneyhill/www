# SGSH

## Overview
The SGSH gene encodes the enzyme N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase, commonly referred to as sulfamidase, which is a critical lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan. This enzyme belongs to the sulfatase family and is characterized by its α/β-hydrolase fold, which is essential for its catalytic activity (Sidhu2014Structure). The SGSH protein functions as a homodimer and requires a divalent metal ion, likely calcium, for its enzymatic activity (Sidhu2014Structure). Mutations in the SGSH gene lead to Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA), a severe neurodegenerative disorder marked by the accumulation of heparan sulfate due to impaired enzymatic function (Yogalingam2001Molecular). Understanding the structure and function of SGSH is crucial for elucidating the pathogenesis of MPS IIIA and developing potential therapeutic strategies (Sidhu2014Structure).

## Structure
The SGSH protein, encoded by the SGSH gene, is crucial for the degradation of heparan sulfate. Its molecular structure has been elucidated through crystallography, revealing a characteristic sulfatase fold that is part of the α/β-hydrolase fold family (Sidhu2014Structure). The enzyme is composed of two domains, each centered on a β-sheet. The N-terminal domain is larger, featuring a mixed β-sheet with parallel strands and several α-helices, while the C-terminal domain contains an antiparallel β-sheet and additional α-helices (Sidhu2014Structure).

SGSH forms a homodimer, with each monomer having a molecular weight of approximately 55 kDa (Sidhu2014Structure). The active site is located in a narrow pocket in the N-terminal domain and involves coordination of a divalent metal ion, likely Ca2+, by several residues including Asp31, Asp32, Asp273, Asn274, and FGly70 (Sidhu2014Structure). The enzyme's active site architecture is highly conserved among its closest O-sulfatase homologues, with notable differences such as the replacement of a conserved lysine with arginine (Arg282) in SGSH, which is involved in substrate binding (Sidhu2014Structure).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at specific asparagine residues, contributing to the enzyme's stability (Sidhu2014Structure). The structure provides insights into the effects of pathogenic mutations on SGSH function, which are responsible for the clinical manifestations of Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (Sidhu2014Structure).

## Function
The SGSH gene encodes the enzyme N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase, also known as sulfamidase, which plays a critical role in the lysosomal degradation of heparan sulfate, a type of glycosaminoglycan. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the hydrolysis of sulfate groups from heparan sulfate, facilitating its breakdown within lysosomes (Sidhu2014Structure; Yogalingam2001Molecular). The enzyme functions by cleaving the S-N bond in N-sulfoglucosamine, a process known as desulfation, which is essential for the proper catabolism of heparan sulfate and prevents its accumulation in cells (Sidhu2014Structure; Yogalingam2001Molecular).

In healthy human cells, SGSH is synthesized as a precursor protein that is modified with mannose 6-phosphate residues, ensuring its transport to the lysosomes where it performs its function (Muschol2011Residual). The enzyme's active site is located in a narrow pocket at the bottom of a surface cleft and includes a divalent metal ion, likely Ca2+, which is crucial for its catalytic activity (Sidhu2014Structure). Proper function of SGSH is essential for cellular waste processing and recycling, impacting cellular homeostasis and overall organismal health (Sidhu2014Structure). Deficiency in this enzyme due to mutations in the SGSH gene leads to mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA, characterized by the accumulation of heparan sulfate and severe neurological symptoms (Yogalingam2001Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SGSH gene, which encodes the enzyme N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase, are responsible for Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA), also known as Sanfilippo syndrome type A. This is a severe neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of heparan sulfate due to deficient enzyme activity. The disease manifests with symptoms such as delayed speech development, behavioral abnormalities, and severe central nervous system degeneration (Bunge1997Identification; Sidhu2014Structure).

Over 100 mutations in the SGSH gene have been identified, leading to varying severities of MPS IIIA. These include missense mutations, nonsense mutations, splice site mutations, and small insertions or deletions. The R74C mutation is notably prevalent among Polish patients, while R245H is more common in German populations (Valstar2010Mucopolysaccharidosis; Bunge1997Identification). The genotype-phenotype correlation is complex, with certain mutations like p.S298P associated with a milder phenotype (Valstar2010Mucopolysaccharidosis).

Currently, there is no effective therapy for MPS IIIA, and enzyme-replacement therapy is limited by the enzyme's inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (Sidhu2014Structure). Understanding the structural implications of these mutations is crucial for developing targeted treatments (Sidhu2014Structure).

## Interactions
The SGSH protein, also known as N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase, is involved in the lysosomal degradation of heparan sulfate. Structurally, SGSH forms a homodimer through noncovalent interactions, which is crucial for its enzymatic function. This dimerization involves the burial of approximately 10.3% of the accessible surface area of each subunit, forming a 'butterfly-shaped' structure (Sidhu2014Structure). The active site of SGSH is located in a narrow pocket at the bottom of a surface cleft and involves several key residues, including Asp31, Asp32, Asp273, Asn274, and the phosphorylated FGly70, which coordinate a divalent metal ion, likely Ca2+ (Sidhu2014Structure).

Mutations in SGSH can disrupt these interactions, leading to a loss of function. For instance, the sgsh Δex5-6 mutant zebrafish model shows that the mutant protein lacks several conserved residues at the dimer interface, preventing dimerization and resulting in a complete loss of enzymatic activity (Douek2021An). This loss of function leads to the accumulation of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans, a hallmark of Sanfilippo Syndrome A (Douek2021An). The structural integrity and interactions of SGSH are essential for its role in lysosomal function and the degradation of glycosaminoglycans.
