# NOMO1

## Overview
NOMO1, or NODAL modulator 1, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology. The protein, also referred to as NOMO1, is characterized by its beta sheet-rich structure and immunoglobulin (Ig) fold-like domains, which contribute to its role in maintaining the structural integrity of the ER (Amaya2021Nodal). NOMO1 is integral to the Nodal signaling pathway, which is crucial for embryonic development and cell differentiation (Amaya2021Nodal). It interacts with other ER-shaping proteins, such as Atlastin2 and Climp63, to ensure proper ER function, which is essential for processes like protein folding and calcium homeostasis (Amaya2021Nodal). Beyond its structural role, NOMO1 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including muscle differentiation and the pathogenesis of congenital heart disease and preeclampsia (Zhang2015Silencing; Gao2012The; Naughton2024Nodal).

## Structure
NOMO1, or nodal modulator 1, is a type I transmembrane protein with a conserved structure across metazoans and plants. The primary structure of NOMO1 is rich in beta sheets, which contribute to its secondary structure, resembling immunoglobulin (Ig) fold proteins (Amaya2021Nodal). The tertiary structure of NOMO1 is described as a flexible, rod-shaped molecule with a 'beads on a string' morphology, consisting of at least eight consecutive Ig-like domains (Amaya2021Nodal). This configuration allows NOMO1 to maintain the intermembrane distance within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by forming an extended rod approximately 27 to 30 nm in length (Amaya2021Nodal).

In terms of quaternary structure, NOMO1 may form low-affinity dimers or oligomers, potentially requiring interaction partners to exert its sheet-shaping functions in the ER (Amaya2021Nodal). The protein's flexibility is crucial for adjusting ER morphology, ensuring that it does not impede the secretion of bulky cargo (Amaya2021Nodal). NOMO1's structure and its variants, such as engineered constructs with additional Ig folds, can modulate the spacing of ER membranes, highlighting its role in maintaining ER morphology (Amaya2021Nodal).

## Function
NOMO1 (NODAL modulator 1) is a type I transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in human cells. It is an abundant ER-luminal protein that supports the structural integrity of the ER by forming a beta sheet-rich structure, similar to bacterial Ig fold proteins, which may help in membrane spacing (Amaya2021Nodala; Amaya2021Nodal). Depletion of NOMO1 leads to significant alterations in ER morphology, characterized by large holes in the ER network, which can be rescued by a NOMO1 rescue construct, indicating its essential function in healthy cells (Amaya2021Nodal).

NOMO1 is also involved in the Nodal signaling pathway, which is crucial for embryonic development and cell differentiation. It interacts with other ER-shaping proteins, such as Atlastin2 and Climp63, to maintain ER structure, which is vital for the organelle's functions, including protein folding, lipid synthesis, and calcium homeostasis (Amaya2021Nodal). NOMO1's role extends to muscle differentiation, where it functions as a mechanosensor within the ER, experiencing forces essential for myogenesis (Naughton2024Nodal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NOMO1 gene have been implicated in several developmental disorders and conditions. In the context of congenital heart disease (CHD), NOMO1 is significantly downregulated in ventricular septal defect (VSD) myocardium, suggesting its critical role in heart development. This downregulation is associated with reduced expression of Nodal signaling mediators and cardiomyocyte-specific markers, indicating that NOMO1 is essential for cardiomyocyte differentiation (Zhang2015Silencing; Xing2020MiR33a5p). 

NOMO1 is also targeted by miR-33a-5p, which affects the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of human cardiomyocyte progenitor cells. Up-regulation of miR-33a-5p inhibits these processes, while NOMO1 overexpression can partially mitigate these effects, linking NOMO1 to the pathogenesis of CHD (Xing2020MiR33a5p).

In early-onset colorectal cancers, homozygous deletions in NOMO1 are associated with a microsatellite-stable feature and a better prognosis, although the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear (GarcíaTuñón2019Establishment). Additionally, NOMO1 is involved in placental development, with its expression being altered in preeclamptic placentas, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (Gao2012The).

## Interactions
NOMO1 (NODAL modulator 1) is involved in maintaining the morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through interactions with other ER-shaping proteins. It shares a similar domain architecture with Climp63, including a luminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytosolic tail, which facilitates its role in ER morphology (Amaya2021Nodala). NOMO1 interacts genetically with Atl2 and Climp63, as depletion of NOMO1 and Atl2 results in similar ER morphology defects, characterized by holes, while Climp63 depletion does not affect ER morphology. Overexpression of Atl2-FLAG in NOMO1-depleted cells rescues these defects, indicating the importance of Atl2's fusogenic activity (Amaya2021Nodala). Climp63-FLAG also rescues the hole phenotype in NOMO1-depleted cells, suggesting functional redundancy between NOMO1 and Climp63 (Amaya2021Nodal).

NOMO1 is proposed to form dimers or oligomers, potentially interacting with the ER membrane or other proteins to maintain ER structure. Its structure is described as a flexible, rod-shaped protein with a 'beads on a string' morphology, featuring Ig-like domains that may facilitate these interactions (Amaya2021Nodala). NOMO1's interactions are dynamic, involving multiple weak interactions essential for ER function and adaptability (Amaya2021Nodala).
