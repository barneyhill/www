# DUS2

## Overview
The DUS2 gene encodes the enzyme dihydrouridine synthase 2, a member of the dihydrouridine synthase family, which plays a critical role in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the reduction of uridine to dihydrouridine, a modification that enhances the conformational flexibility and stability of tRNA molecules, thereby facilitating efficient translation and protein synthesis (BouNader2015An; Lombard2022Evolutionary). Dihydrouridine synthase 2 is characterized by a complex molecular structure, including a TIM-barrel domain and a double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD), which are essential for its enzymatic activity and substrate specificity (Lombard2022Evolutionary; BouNader2019Molecular). The enzyme's activity is not only crucial for normal cellular function but also has implications in various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and certain cancers, where alterations in DUS2 expression have been observed (Patel2021SetBased; Das2021The).

## Structure
The human dihydrouridine synthase 2 (hDus2) protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of hDus2 is encoded by the DUS2 gene, and the protein is involved in the enzymatic reduction of uridine to dihydrouridine in tRNA, a modification that influences tRNA conformation and flexibility (Whelan2015From).

The secondary and tertiary structures of hDus2 feature a TIM-barrel domain and a helical domain (HD), which are common structural motifs in the dihydrouridine synthases family. The TIM-barrel domain is a canonical fold consisting of a central barrel of eight parallel beta strands surrounded by alpha helices, with an additional β-sheet that is strictly conserved among Dus2 enzymes (Lombard2022Evolutionary). The helical domain is connected to the TIM-barrel by a short linker, and these domains share a hydrophobic interaction surface stabilized by electrostatic contacts (Lombard2022Evolutionary).

A unique feature of hDus2 is the presence of a double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) with an N-terminal extension, which enhances its ability to bind tRNA. This extension provides additional residues for binding tRNA in a structure-specific manner, highlighting the importance of structural appendages in promoting functional diversity (BouNader2019Molecular). The dsRBD is a major binding site for tRNA, distinguishing hDus2 from other Dus enzymes (Lombard2022Evolutionary).

The quaternary structure of hDus2 has not been explicitly detailed in the provided context, and there is no mention of post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms. However, the structural adaptations and domain architecture of hDus2 suggest its evolved specificity for substrate recognition, which is significant in the context of its role in cell growth and potential involvement in cancer (Lombard2022Evolutionary).

## Function
The DUS2 gene encodes the enzyme dihydrouridine synthase 2, which is crucial for the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA in human cells. This enzyme catalyzes the reduction of uridine to dihydrouridine, a modification that enhances the conformational flexibility and stability of tRNA molecules, thereby supporting their proper folding and function (BouNader2015An). Dihydrouridine is located in the D-loop of tRNA and is essential for maintaining the L-shaped structure necessary for efficient translation and protein synthesis (Lombard2022Evolutionary).

DUS2 is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with components of the translation machinery, potentially influencing cell growth and apoptosis (BouNader2015An). The enzyme's activity is dependent on its modular structure, which includes a catalytic domain and a double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) that facilitates tRNA binding (BouNader2015An). The dsRBD is particularly important for recognizing and binding tRNA, ensuring the enzyme's catalytic function (BouNader2015An).

In addition to its role in tRNA modification, DUS2 has been implicated in the detoxification of β-amyloid peptides, suggesting a protective role in neural health (Lombard2022Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DUS2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and certain cancers. In the context of AD, overexpression of DUS2 has been shown to reduce amyloid-β (Aβ42) toxicity, which is a key pathological feature of the disease. This suggests a protective role for DUS2 against Aβ42 toxicity, potentially offering a therapeutic target for AD (Patel2021SetBased; Chen2020FMN). The mRNA expression levels of the human ortholog of DUS2 are significantly lower in the cerebellum, visual cortex, and prefrontal cortex of AD patients compared to controls, indicating a potential link between reduced DUS2 expression and AD pathology (Chen2020FMN).

In cancer, DUS2 is upregulated in some lung cancers, which may be associated with its role in tRNA modification and protein synthesis. This upregulation suggests a potential link between DUS2 expression and cancer progression (Das2021The). The interaction between DUS2 and EPRS1 has been noted to increase translation efficiency, correlating with pulmonary carcinogenesis and indicating a poorer prognosis for lung cancer patients (Lee2023Phosphocode-dependent). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DUS2 in both neurodegenerative and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
Human dihydrouridine synthase 2 (DUS2) interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. DUS2 is known to interact with the interferon-induced protein kinase PKR and PACT, a PKR activator. These interactions were identified using yeast two-hybrid screens and confirmed through various biochemical assays. DUS2 binds to PKR and PACT via its double-stranded RNA-binding motif (dsRBM), although it has a lower affinity for dsRNA due to the absence of a conserved lysine residue (Mittelstadt2007Interaction).

DUS2 inhibits PKR's kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo, reducing stress-induced apoptosis. This inhibition is mediated through direct protein-protein interactions rather than dsRNA, as mutations in PKR's dsRNA-binding domain do not significantly affect the interaction with DUS2 (Mittelstadt2007Interaction). Additionally, DUS2 interacts with glutamylprolyl tRNA synthetase, potentially influencing translation processes and promoting cell growth (BouNader2015An).

The dsRBD of DUS2 is crucial for its interaction with tRNA, forming stable protein-RNA complexes necessary for its enzymatic activity. This domain is larger than previously predicted and is essential for the proper orientation of tRNA during catalysis (BouNader2015An).
