# CFAP221

## Overview
CFAP221 is a gene that encodes the protein cilia and flagella associated protein 221, which plays a pivotal role in the function of motile cilia and flagella. This protein is categorized as a structural component of the axoneme, specifically contributing to the assembly and stability of the central pair apparatus (CPA) within cilia. CFAP221 is essential for maintaining normal ciliary beat frequency and waveform, which are crucial for effective ciliary motility and overall cellular function (Ito2024Primary; BustamanteMarin2019Identification). The gene's expression is particularly significant in respiratory epithelial cells and during spermatogenesis, where it ensures proper ciliary and flagellar function, respectively. Mutations in CFAP221 are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function, leading to respiratory complications and infertility (McKenzie2020Genetic; Ito2024Primary).

## Function
CFAP221, also known as cilia and flagella associated protein 221, is crucial for the proper functioning of motile cilia in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed during the differentiation of ciliated cells and is localized to the axoneme, a core structural component of cilia (BustamanteMarin2019Identification). CFAP221 is involved in the assembly and stability of the central pair apparatus (CPA) within the axoneme, specifically contributing to the C1d central pair projection. This structure is essential for maintaining normal ciliary beat frequency and waveform, which are critical for effective ciliary motility (Ito2024Primary).

In the context of respiratory epithelial cells, CFAP221 ensures the proper assembly of cilia, which is vital for mucociliary clearance and respiratory health. Its absence or dysfunction can lead to defective ciliary waveform and reduced ciliary beat frequency, resulting in impaired mucociliary clearance and associated respiratory issues (Ito2024Primary; BustamanteMarin2019Identification). Additionally, CFAP221 plays a role in spermatogenesis, as its dysfunction can lead to infertility due to impaired flagellar formation and function (Ito2024Primary). Overall, CFAP221 is integral to the motility and function of cilia and flagella, impacting both respiratory function and fertility.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP221 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired function of motile cilia. This impairment leads to reduced mucociliary clearance and chronic respiratory infections (BustamanteMarin2019Identification). PCD can also present with symptoms such as bronchiectasis, sinusitis, and obstructive azoospermia, which are similar to those observed in Young's syndrome. This similarity suggests that Young's syndrome may be a phenotype of PCD caused by CFAP221 variants (Ito2024Primary).

In mouse models, mutations in CFAP221, along with other central pair apparatus genes like CFAP54 and SPEF2, result in severe PCD phenotypes, including hydrocephalus, mucociliary clearance defects, and spermatogenesis abnormalities. These genetic interactions highlight the role of CFAP221 in ciliary function and its contribution to the severity of PCD symptoms (McKenzie2020Genetic). The absence of CFAP221 in affected individuals is likely due to nonsense-mediated decay of aberrant transcripts, leading to defective ciliary waveform and reduced ciliary beat frequency, which are critical factors in the PCD phenotype (BustamanteMarin2019Identification).

## Interactions
CFAP221, also known as primary ciliary dyskinesia protein 1 (PCDP1), is part of a complex in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that includes proteins such as FAP74, FAP54, FAP46, and C1d-87/WDR93. This complex is associated with the C1d projection of the central microtubule apparatus and plays a role in regulating dynein motor force in response to intracellular calcium changes through interaction with the calcium-binding protein calmodulin (McKenzie2015CFAP54). CFAP221 is also involved in the formation of a 32 nm periodic structure and serves as a scaffold for recruiting other proteins, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed (Zhu2024Incell).

In the context of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), CFAP221 is linked to the central pair apparatus (CPA) of motile cilia. Reduced expression of PCDP1 complex members in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii leads to failure in the assembly of the C1d central pair projection, affecting ciliary beat frequency and waveform (Ito2024Primary). Despite its critical role in ciliary function, specific interactions of CFAP221 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated.
