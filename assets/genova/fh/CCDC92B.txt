# CCDC92B

## Overview
CCDC92B is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 92B, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that CCDC92B may play a role in cellular processes that require such interactions. While the specific biological functions of the CCDC92B protein remain to be fully elucidated, its structural attributes imply potential involvement in various cellular pathways. Further research is necessary to determine its precise role and any implications it may have in health and disease.
