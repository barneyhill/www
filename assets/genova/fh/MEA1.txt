# MEA1

## Overview
The MEA1 gene encodes the male-enhanced antigen 1 protein, which is primarily expressed in the testes and plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis. This protein is categorized as a testis-specific protein and is involved in the regulation of sperm development and function. MEA1 is evolutionarily conserved across several species, indicating its essential role in male fertility. The protein's expression is upregulated during the late stages of spermatogenesis, suggesting its involvement in the maturation of spermatozoa. Although the precise molecular mechanisms of MEA1 are not fully understood, it is believed to interact with other proteins involved in the reproductive process, contributing to the structural and functional integrity of sperm cells. The study of MEA1 and its interactions is significant for understanding male infertility and developing potential therapeutic interventions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
