# CLSTN1

## Overview
The CLSTN1 gene encodes calsyntenin 1, a type I transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in neurons. Calsyntenin 1 is characterized by its involvement in synaptic adhesion and neural development, functioning as a calcium sensor or buffer at the postsynaptic membrane. It plays a crucial role in synaptic processes such as long-term potentiation and depression, and is integral to the axonal transport of the amyloid precursor protein, thereby influencing amyloid-beta production, which is significant in Alzheimer's disease pathology (Steuble2012Calsyntenin1; Vogt2001Calsyntenin1). The protein's structure includes cadherin-like domains and a Leu-Gly-Asn repeat-enriched domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in cellular processes (OrtizMedina2015Zebrafish). Calsyntenin 1's interactions with proteins such as E-cadherin and β-catenin also suggest its involvement in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal stability, with implications in cancer metastasis and synaptic plasticity (Li2023ESRP1driven; Cheng2019Calsyntenin1).

## Structure
Calsyntenin 1 (CLSTN1) is a type I transmembrane protein primarily expressed in neurons. Its molecular structure includes two N-terminal cadherin-like domains, which are crucial for mediating homophilic adhesion, as demonstrated in studies using zebrafish models (OrtizMedina2015Zebrafish). These cadherin domains are followed by a Leu-Gly-Asn repeat-enriched (LGN) domain, a single-pass transmembrane segment, and a short intracellular region (OrtizMedina2015Zebrafish).

The intracellular domain of CLSTN1 is highly acidic and interacts with Kinesin Light Chain, functioning as a vesicular cargo adapter, which is significant for its role in axonal transport (OrtizMedina2015Zebrafish). This domain also binds calcium, which may influence its interaction with other proteins and cellular functions (OrtizMedina2015Zebrafish).

CLSTN1 can form homodimers or heterodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, and is involved in synaptic adhesion and neuronal development (Cheng2019Calsyntenin1). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are common, and alternative splicing may result in different isoforms, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Liu2022Deletion).

## Function
Calsyntenin-1 (CLSTN1) is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in synaptic function and neural development. It is primarily involved in calcium-mediated signaling processes at the postsynaptic membrane, where it acts as a calcium sensor or buffer, crucial for synaptic processes such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) (Vogt2001Calsyntenin1). The protein's cytoplasmic domain binds calcium ions, modulating and prolonging calcium signals beneath the postsynaptic membrane, which is essential for synaptic plasticity and neural signaling (Vogt2001Calsyntenin1).

Calsyntenin-1 is also involved in the axonal transport of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), where it facilitates the anterograde transport of APP along axons, protecting it from premature proteolytic processing (Steuble2012Calsyntenin1). This function is crucial in maintaining APP integrity during transport, preventing its premature cleavage, which could lead to increased production of amyloid-beta, a peptide implicated in Alzheimer's disease (Steuble2012Calsyntenin1).

In the central nervous system, calsyntenin-1 is expressed by most neurons and is involved in excitatory synaptic transmission, suggesting a role in linking extracellular cell adhesion events to intracellular calcium signaling (Hintsch2002The). Its expression patterns and functional roles in different neuronal subpopulations contribute to the distinct ways neurons process excitatory inputs (Hintsch2002The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CLSTN1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Alzheimer's disease, reduced expression of calsyntenin-1 is associated with increased levels of amyloid-beta (Ab), a key factor in the disease's pathology. The loss of calsyntenin-1 disrupts the axonal transport of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to increased amyloidogenic processing and Ab production, which are critical in Alzheimer's disease progression (Vagnoni2012Calsyntenin1).

In the context of doxorubicin-induced dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), CLSTN1 expression is upregulated, exacerbating cardiac damage. Overexpression of CLSTN1 in heart tissue has been shown to impair cardiac function and promote DCM by affecting calcium signaling and the PI3K-Akt pathway, which are crucial for cardiac health. Conversely, knockdown of CLSTN1 reduces cardiomyocyte toxicity and apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in DCM (Zhu2022Calsyntenin1).

CLSTN1 is also involved in fragile X syndrome (FXS), where its reduced expression in Fmr1 knockout mice leads to impaired dendritic spine development and synaptic plasticity, contributing to abnormal learning behaviors. This highlights its role in neural circuit formation and cognitive function (Bai2024Synaptic).

## Interactions
Calsyntenin 1 (CLSTN1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. In the context of gastric cancer, the truncated form of CLSTN1, known as CLSTN1-S, interacts with E-cadherin and β-catenin. This interaction enhances the binding between E-cadherin and β-catenin, promoting cytoskeleton stability and cell adhesion, while also facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin, thereby inhibiting metastasis (Li2023ESRP1driven).

In neuronal cells, CLSTN1 co-localizes and co-transports with ICAM5 in dendrites, influencing dendritic spine maturation. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of ICAM5 distribution on the synaptic membrane, affecting synaptic development and plasticity (Cheng2019Calsyntenin1). CLSTN1 also interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is involved in the transport of vesicles by linking to Kinesin-1 motors, which is significant for synaptic function and axonal transport (Cheng2019Calsyntenin1).

In human neocortical development, a fusion transcript involving CLSTN1, known as CTNNBIP1-CLSTN1 (CTCL), is implicated in regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation (Ou2021The).
