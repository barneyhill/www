# RAN

## Overview
The RAN gene encodes a small GTPase protein that is a member of the Ras superfamily, playing a pivotal role in various cellular processes, particularly nucleocytoplasmic transport. The RAN protein functions as a molecular switch, cycling between GTP-bound and GDP-bound states, which is essential for the transport of RNA and proteins across the nuclear envelope. This protein is also involved in mitotic spindle assembly and nuclear envelope formation, highlighting its importance in cell division and structural organization within the cell. RAN's interactions with other proteins, such as importins and nuclear transport factors, facilitate its role in these processes. Additionally, the RAN gene has significant clinical implications, particularly in oncology, where its overexpression is associated with cancer progression and metastasis in several types of cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Stewart1998Structural; Boudhraa2020Ran; Ciciarello2007Spatial).

## Structure
The RAN protein, a member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases, is crucial for nucleocytoplasmic transport. Its primary structure is encoded by the RAN gene and includes a GTP-binding domain. The secondary structure of RAN consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a central six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, similar to other Ras-family GTPases (Stewart1998Structural). 

In its tertiary structure, RAN adopts a compact, globular shape. The protein undergoes significant conformational changes between its GDP-bound and GTP-bound states, particularly in the switch regions, which are critical for its function. The switch I (residues 30-47) and switch II (residues 65-80) regions undergo notable structural rearrangements, with the GTP-bound state showing similarities to the Ras protein (Chook1999Structure). 

RAN lacks a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. It contains a unique C-terminal extension not found in other Ras family members, which plays a role in its structural changes and interactions with other proteins (Chook1999Structure). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are also part of its regulatory mechanisms. The protein's interaction with nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) involves the switch II loop and a hydrophobic cavity, highlighting its role in nuclear import (Stewart1998Structural).

## Function
The RAN gene encodes a small GTPase protein that plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, mitotic spindle assembly, and nuclear envelope formation. RAN functions as a molecular switch, cycling between its GTP-bound and GDP-bound states, which are regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) like RCC1 and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) such as RanGAP (Ren1995Separate). In its GTP-bound form, RAN is involved in the transport of RNA and proteins through the nuclear pore complex, facilitating the import of proteins into the nucleus and the export of proteins and RNAs to the cytoplasm (Ciciarello2007Spatial).

During mitosis, RAN regulates spindle assembly and dynamics by generating a gradient of RanGTP around chromosomes, which is crucial for microtubule nucleation and stabilization. This gradient influences the release of nuclear localization signal (NLS) proteins from importins, essential for mitotic processes (Ciciarello2007Spatial). RAN also plays a role in centrosome duplication and spindle assembly, affecting microtubule organization and stability (Ciciarello2007Spatial). Its activity is spatially regulated, with RCC1 localized in the nucleus and RanGAP1 in the cytoplasm, ensuring precise control over these processes (Ciciarello2007Spatial).

## Clinical Significance
The RAN gene, a member of the RAS oncogene family, plays a significant role in cancer progression and metastasis. Overexpression of RAN is observed in various cancers, including breast, renal, gastric, colon, pancreatic, ovarian, and lung cancers, and is associated with higher grades and metastasis in renal, breast, and ovarian cancers (Boudhraa2020Ran). RAN contributes to cancer by promoting proliferative signaling, resisting apoptosis, and facilitating invasion and metastasis (Boudhraa2020Ran). It is involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer cell invasion, by influencing the nuclear import of EMT-associated transcription factors such as SNAIL, SLUG, and ZEB1/2 (Boudhraa2020Ran).

RAN's role in cancer is further highlighted by its involvement in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/MEK/ERK pathways, which are essential for cell growth and survival (Boudhraa2020Ran). The gene's overexpression is linked to increased cell invasion in breast and lung cancer cell lines, and its knockdown in pancreatic cancer models results in decreased liver metastases (Boudhraa2020Ran). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RAN in oncology, making it a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.

## Interactions
The RAN protein, a small GTPase, is involved in various interactions crucial for nuclear transport processes. In Xenopus laevis egg extracts, RAN interacts with several proteins, forming multiprotein complexes. It associates with nuclear pore proteins and soluble transport factors, including RanBP2/Nup358, Nupl53, Importin β, hsc70, RCC1, and RanBP1 (Saitoh1996Direct). RAN forms a stable complex with p92Importin in the presence of GMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, indicating its role in nuclear import (Saitoh1996Direct). 

RAN's interaction with Importin β is significant, as Importin β acts as a primary effector of GTP-RAN, and these complexes interact with p34ORanBP2 (Saitoh1996Direct). The study also highlights the interaction of RAN with p34ORanBP2, which may coordinate the translocation of protein import substrates with nucleotide hydrolysis by RAN (Saitoh1996Direct). 

In terms of structural interactions, RAN binds to nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) in its GDP-bound form. This interaction involves key residues and salt bridges, with the switch II loop of RAN playing a primary role in binding to NTF2 (Stewart1998Structural). These interactions are crucial for RAN's function in nucleocytoplasmic transport.
