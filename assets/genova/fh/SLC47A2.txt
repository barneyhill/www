# SLC47A2

## Overview
The SLC47A2 gene encodes the solute carrier family 47 member 2 (MATE2) protein, which is a member of the multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) family of transporters. This protein is primarily expressed in the kidney and liver, where it plays a critical role in the excretion of organic cations and xenobiotics, thereby influencing drug pharmacokinetics and response. MATE2 functions as an efflux transporter, utilizing a proton gradient to facilitate the transport of substances across cellular membranes. The gene exhibits several splice variants, contributing to its diverse functional roles in different tissues. SLC47A2 is implicated in various clinical contexts, including its potential as a biomarker in renal cell carcinoma and its influence on the efficacy of metformin treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (Damme2011Mammalian; Avsar2022Analysis; Chen2022Association).

## Structure
The SLC47A2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) family, primarily expressed in the kidney and liver. The protein consists of 602 amino acids in its full-length form, known as MATE2, and is predicted to have 13 transmembrane helices (TMHs) with an intracellular NH2 and an extracellular COOH terminus. However, experimental evidence suggests that there may be only 12 TMHs, with a hydrophobic tail potentially representing the 13th helix, which may increase the turnover of the substrate-transport complex (Damme2011Mammalian; Nies2016Structure).

The SLC47A2 gene has several splice variants, including hMATE2-K, which lacks part of exon 7, resulting in a shorter 566-amino acid protein predominantly expressed in the kidney. Another variant, hMATE2-B, is expressed in various organs but not the kidney and encodes a nonfunctional 220-amino acid protein (Damme2011Mammalian; Nies2016Structure).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are predicted for MATE2, although the functional consequences of these modifications are not fully understood (Nies2016Structure). The protein's structure and function are crucial for the excretion of organic cations and the elimination of xenobiotics.

## Function
The SLC47A2 gene encodes the MATE2 protein, which is primarily expressed in the renal proximal tubules and plays a crucial role in the pharmacokinetics of various drugs, including metformin, a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (Damme2011Mammalian; Avsar2022Analysis). MATE2 functions as an efflux transporter, facilitating the excretion of hydrophilic organic cations and xenobiotics into urine and bile, thus contributing to the renal and hepatic elimination of these substances (Damme2011Mammalian; Nies2016Structure).

The protein operates by exchanging organic cations across the luminal membrane of renal proximal tubule cells and the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes in exchange for protons, utilizing a proton gradient as a driving force (Damme2011Mammalian; Nies2016Structure). This process is essential for drug transport and can significantly affect drug pharmacokinetics and response, with implications for personalized medicine (Nies2016Structure).

MATE2 is also involved in the secretion of endogenous compounds such as carnitine and creatinine, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and detoxification processes (Gao2019A). The expression of SLC47A2 is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, ensuring proper function in healthy tissues (Gao2019A).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC47A2 gene has significant clinical implications, particularly in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In RCC, SLC47A2 is identified as a promising diagnostic biomarker, with its expression significantly repressed in patients. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that SLC47A2 may serve as a negative prognostic marker (Gao2019A). The repression of SLC47A2 in RCC is linked to the regulatory role of the long non-coding RNA SANT1, which affects the binding of the SFPQ/E2F1/HDAC1 complex to the gene's promoter, leading to decreased histone acetylation and gene expression (Gao2019A).

In the context of T2DM, polymorphisms in SLC47A2, such as rs12943590, have been associated with the efficacy of metformin treatment. Patients with certain genotypes, like the AG genotype of rs12943590, show improved insulin resistance, indicating that genetic variations in SLC47A2 can influence metformin response (Phani2018Implication; Chen2022Association). These findings highlight the gene's role in drug transport and its potential impact on pharmacotherapy outcomes. Understanding these genetic interactions is crucial for developing personalized treatment strategies for T2DM patients.

## Interactions
The SLC47A2 gene encodes the MATE2 protein, which is involved in the transport of organic cations. This protein participates in several interactions that are crucial for its function. SLC47A2 interacts with other solute carriers, such as SLC22A2, SLC22A1, SLC22A8, SLC22A4, SLC22A5, SLCO1B3, SLC29A4, SLC22A3, and SLCO1B1, as identified through protein-protein interaction studies using the STRING database. These interactions are important for the excretion of organic anions and therapeutic agents, impacting drug pharmacokinetics (Avsar2022Analysis).

In the context of renal cell carcinoma, the expression of SLC47A2 is regulated by the long non-coding RNA SANT1. SANT1 forms a complex with proteins SFPQ, E2F1, and HDAC1, which are involved in gene repression. SANT1 influences the binding of this complex to the promoter region of the SLC47A2 gene, thereby modulating its expression. This interaction highlights the role of SANT1 in the transcriptional regulation of SLC47A2, which may have implications for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Gao2019A). These interactions underscore the importance of SLC47A2 in drug metabolism and its potential impact on drug response and resistance.
