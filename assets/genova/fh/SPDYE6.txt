# SPDYE6

## Overview
SPDYE6 is a gene that encodes the protein speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member E6, which is part of the Speedy/RINGO family known for its role in cell cycle regulation. The protein functions as a cell cycle regulator by interacting with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), facilitating transitions between key phases of the cell cycle, such as G1/S and G2/M. SPDYE6 is expressed in various tissues, with significant expression in the testis and during fetal brain development, indicating its involvement in reproductive and developmental processes. The protein is involved in protein kinase binding and participates in complex gene regulatory networks, including competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks. Its expression and mutation patterns have been linked to several cancers, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment (Wang2018Extensive; Mill2024Efficacy).

## Function
SPDYE6 is a member of the Speedy/RINGO family, which plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle by interacting with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) to facilitate cell cycle progression, particularly during the G1/S and G2/M transitions (Wang2018Extensive). This gene is broadly expressed across various normal tissues, with a notable presence in the testis, indicating its involvement in reproductive functions (Wang2018Extensive). SPDYE6 is also highly expressed during fetal development in the prefrontal cortex, suggesting a role in early brain development (Wang2018Extensive).

In terms of molecular activity, SPDYE6 is involved in protein kinase binding, which is essential for its function as a cell cycle regulator (Islam2020Computational). The gene is part of a network of regulatory interactions, potentially forming competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks mediated by common microRNAs, which indicates its involvement in complex gene regulatory mechanisms (Wang2018Extensive). SPDYE6 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences processes such as DNA replication and cell proliferation, contributing to the maintenance of normal cellular functions (Wang2018Extensive).

## Clinical Significance
SPDYE6, a member of the Speedy/RINGO family, has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. It is upregulated in several cancer types, including bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), breast cancer (BRCA), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Conversely, it is downregulated in thyroid carcinoma (THCA) (Wang2018Extensive). The expression level of SPDYE6 is associated with patient survival outcomes; high expression correlates with poor survival in KIRC and uveal melanoma (UVM), while low expression is linked to poor survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC) (Wang2018Extensive). These findings suggest that SPDYE6 may serve as a potential biomarker for these cancers.

In addition to expression changes, mutations in SPDYE6 have been identified in the GMR-AML1 cell line, derived from a patient with familial platelet disorder with myeloid malignancy (FPD-MM). The specific mutation, G292C, has a variant allele frequency ranging from 33 to 55%, although its functional significance in the transformation to FPD-MM is not fully understood (Mill2024Efficacy). These insights highlight the potential clinical significance of SPDYE6 in cancer research and treatment.
