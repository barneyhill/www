# CRAMP1

## Overview
CRAMP1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as cramped chromatin regulator homolog 1, which plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. This protein is categorized as a chromatin regulator, involved in modifying the structure of chromatin to influence transcriptional activity. The CRAMP1 gene is evolutionarily conserved and has been implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of developmental pathways and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Its function is critical for proper cellular differentiation and proliferation, and dysregulation of CRAMP1 has been associated with several pathological conditions, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Qiu2020aarFDC).
