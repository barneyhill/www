# SUPT7L

## Overview
SUPT7L is a gene that encodes the SPT7-like, STAGA complex subunit gamma protein, which is a critical component of the human SAGA (hSAGA) transcriptional coactivator complex. This protein is integral to the core module of the hSAGA complex, contributing to its structural integrity and function. The SPT7-like protein is involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, histone acetylation, and transcription regulation, by facilitating the assembly and stability of the complex. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining DNA integrity and is essential for the expression of pluripotency factors in embryonic stem cells, supporting self-renewal and preventing differentiation (Fischer2021The; Kopp2024Lossoffunction). Mutations in the SUPT7L gene have been associated with developmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in genetic research (Kopp2024Lossoffunction).

## Structure
The SUPT7L protein is a component of the human SAGA (hSAGA) transcriptional coactivator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation. Within the hSAGA complex, SUPT7L is part of the core module, which consists of nine subunits that form a distorted pseudooctamer. This core module includes histone-fold domains from proteins such as TAF6L, TAF9, TAF10, TAF12, SUPT3H, and TADA1, creating an asymmetric histone octamer-like fold (Zhang2022CryoEM; Herbst2021Structure).

The N-terminal region of SUPT7L is positioned similarly in both yeast and human complexes, where it interacts with the Ada3/TADA3 subunit of the HAT module in yeast, indicating a conserved structural role across species (Herbst2021Structure). SUPT7L interacts with other components of the hSAGA complex, such as TRRAP, through multiple loop and helical regions, contributing to the unique architecture of the complex (Zhang2022CryoEM).

While specific details about the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of SUPT7L are not extensively covered, its role in forming the core module and its interactions within the hSAGA complex highlight its importance in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the complex.

## Function
The SUPT7L gene encodes a component of the STAGA complex, a nuclear multifunctional protein complex involved in various cellular processes such as transcription factor binding, protein acetylation, and splicing. In healthy human cells, SUPT7L is localized within the nucleus and plays a crucial role in maintaining the normal function and balance of the STAGA complex components (Kopp2024Lossoffunction). The STAGA complex, which includes SUPT7L, is involved in chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation, facilitating gene expression by modulating chromatin structure and accessibility (Fischer2021The). SUPT7L is part of the core structural module of the STAGA complex, contributing to the structural organization and modular coordination necessary for transcription activation and co-transcriptional splicing (Herbst2021Structure).

SUPT7L is essential for the regulation of gene expression, particularly in processes related to DNA replication, repair, and cell cycle progression. Loss of SUPT7L function leads to increased DNA damage, highlighting its role in maintaining DNA integrity (Kopp2024Lossoffunction). In embryonic stem cells, SUPT7L is necessary for the expression of pluripotency factors, supporting self-renewal and preventing differentiation (Fischer2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SUPT7L gene, which encodes a component of the STAGA complex, have been linked to a developmental disorder characterized by generalized lipodystrophy. This condition is marked by a lack of subcutaneous fat, intrauterine growth retardation, and visible subcutaneous veins. Affected individuals may also exhibit features such as cataracts, a neonatal tooth, delayed motor milestones, microcephaly, and metabolic issues like elevated triglycerides and reduced leptin levels (Kopp2024Lossoffunction).

The study identified two heterozygous variants in SUPT7L, c.80G>A and c.255_258dup, which lead to aberrant splicing and a frameshift mutation, resulting in a complete loss of function of the SUPT7L protein. This loss of function is associated with increased DNA damage, as evidenced by a higher number of γH2A.X foci in patient fibroblasts and SUPT7L knockout HeLa cells. Overexpression of wild-type SUPT7L was shown to rescue the increased DNA damage phenotype, suggesting its crucial role in maintaining DNA integrity (Kopp2024Lossoffunction).

These findings suggest that SUPT7L mutations could be a novel candidate for progeroid conditions, contributing to the understanding of genetic factors in such disorders (Kopp2024Lossoffunction).

## Interactions
SUPT7L, a component of the human SAGA (hSAGA) transcriptional coactivator complex, plays a crucial role in protein-protein interactions within this complex. It is part of the core module, which has an asymmetric histone octamer-like fold, serving as a central hub for the assembly of other components such as TRRAP, SF3B3/5, and the DUB module. SUPT7L interacts with proteins like SUPT3H, TADA1, TAF9, TAF10, and TAF12 to stabilize the association of TRRAP with the core module (Zhang2022CryoEM).

In mouse embryonic stem cells, Supt7l is essential for the structural integrity of the SAGA complex. Its inactivation leads to disorganization of the complex, affecting the expression of pluripotency factors and ESC proliferation. This indicates that Supt7l is crucial for the assembly and function of the SAGA complex (Fischer2021The).

SUPT7L also forms heterodimers with TAF10 through histone-fold pairing, suggesting a structural role in the SAGA complex. This interaction is homologous to the pairing observed in the TFIID complex, highlighting the shared structural features between these transcriptional coactivators (Helmlinger2017Sharing).
