# ZNF514

## Overview
ZNF514 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 514, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by their ability to bind DNA, RNA, or other proteins, often acting as transcription factors that regulate gene expression. ZNF514, in particular, is implicated in various biological processes and diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. The protein's involvement in transcription regulation suggests it may influence cellular processes by modulating the expression of target genes. Despite its recognized importance, the specific functions and mechanisms of ZNF514 remain an active area of research, with ongoing studies aiming to elucidate its role in health and disease (Diviney2019An; BergaŠvītiņa2024Identifying; Hill2023A; Ouyang2014Wholegenome).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF514 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression or mutations. In the context of cancer, ZNF514 mutations have been identified in metastatic samples of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), suggesting a role in transcription regulation and potential involvement in cancer progression (Ouyang2014Wholegenome). The gene has also been associated with breast cancer risk in BRCA1 pathogenic variant carriers, although its specific role in breast cancer onset and development remains unclear (BergaŠvītiņa2024Identifying).

In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), ZNF514 is identified as a high survival marker, indicating that its expression levels may correlate with better survival rates in younger patients (Diviney2019An). Additionally, ZNF514 has been highlighted in studies on alcohol use disorder (AUD), where rare variants of the gene show a significant association with the disorder, suggesting a potential role in transcription regulation related to AUD (Hill2023A).

Overall, while the precise mechanisms by which ZNF514 influences these conditions are not fully understood, its involvement in transcription regulation and potential interactions with other genetic factors suggest it may play a significant role in disease pathogenesis.
