# FADD

## Overview
FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain) is a gene that encodes a crucial adaptor protein involved in the regulation of apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death. The FADD protein is characterized by its death effector domain (DED) and death domain (DD), which facilitate interactions with death receptors such as Fas, leading to the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and subsequent activation of caspase-8. This process is essential for the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, which plays a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by eliminating damaged or potentially harmful cells (Lee2012The; Chinnaiyan1995FADD). Beyond apoptosis, FADD is implicated in various non-apoptotic processes, including cell cycle progression, autophagy, and inflammation, highlighting its multifunctional nature (Lee2012The). Dysregulation of FADD expression or function is associated with several diseases, particularly cancers, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncoprotein, depending on the context (He2023Upregulated; Liu2022FADD).

## Structure
The FADD protein is characterized by two distinct domains: the death effector domain (DED) at the N-terminus and the death domain (DD) at the C-terminus. The DED is involved in self-association and interaction with procaspase-8, which is crucial for the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (Sandu2006FADD; Kim2002Multifunctional). Specific residues in the DED, such as F25, L28, and K33, form a hydrophobic patch essential for FADD's function (Sandu2006FADD). The DD of FADD interacts with the death domain of Fas, facilitating apoptosis signaling (Chinnaiyan1995FADD).

The tertiary structure of the DED is stabilized by intra-domain contacts, as observed in related viral proteins (Sandu2006FADD). The quaternary structure involves the formation of oligomeric complexes, such as a tetrameric arrangement with Fas DDs, which is crucial for DISC assembly (Wang2010The; Scott2008The). FADD does not spontaneously form oligomers at physiological concentrations, indicating that its oligomerization is regulated and occurs in conjunction with receptor binding (Sandu2006FADD).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at serine 197, affect FADD's sensitivity to apoptosis (INOUE2007Molecular). The protein is constitutively expressed in many human tissues, and its interaction with Fas is crucial for initiating apoptosis (Chinnaiyan1995FADD).

## Function
FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain) is a critical adaptor protein involved in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, primarily through its interaction with death receptors such as Fas. It contains a death domain (DD) and a death effector domain (DED), which facilitate its binding to the Fas receptor and the recruitment of procaspase-8, forming the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). This complex is essential for the activation of caspase-8, which subsequently activates downstream effector caspases like caspase-3, leading to apoptosis (Wang2010The; Lee2012The).

FADD is constitutively expressed in many human tissues, indicating its widespread role in normal cellular functions (Chinnaiyan1995FADD). It is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating programmed cell death, which is crucial for eliminating damaged or potentially harmful cells (Chinnaiyan1995FADD). In addition to its role in apoptosis, FADD is implicated in non-apoptotic processes such as cell cycle progression, proliferation, autophagy, inflammation, and innate immunity (Lee2012The). FADD also plays a role in necroptosis, a form of programmed necrosis, by inhibiting RIP1-and RIP3-dependent necroptosis through caspase-8 activation (Lee2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the FADD gene are linked to various diseases, particularly cancers. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), FADD is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis, advanced tumor stages, and immune exhaustion. This overexpression is associated with cell cycle dysregulation, angiogenesis, and metabolic disturbances, as well as higher infiltration of suppressive immune cells (He2023Upregulated). In contrast, low or absent FADD expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a significant prognostic factor for poor response to chemotherapy and poor outcomes. This absence is not due to a lack of FADD mRNA, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation (Tourneur2004Absence).

FADD's role in cancer is complex, acting as a tumor suppressor in some cancers like thymic lymphoma and glioblastoma, while functioning as an oncoprotein in others such as pancreatic and laryngeal cancer (Liu2022FADD). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), FADD overexpression due to gene amplification is linked to poor prognosis and lymph node metastasis (Liu2022FADD). These findings highlight FADD's potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain) is a crucial adaptor protein involved in apoptosis signaling through its interactions with death receptors and other proteins. FADD interacts specifically with the death domain of Fas, a cell surface receptor, to initiate apoptosis. This interaction is mediated through a death domain to death domain interaction, which is essential for the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (Chinnaiyan1995FADD). FADD also interacts with the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), although this interaction is weaker compared to Fas (Chinnaiyan1995FADD).

The death effector domain (DED) of FADD is critical for recruiting procaspase-8 into the DISC, facilitating its activation and subsequent apoptotic signaling (Tourneur2010FADD:; Sandu2006FADD). FADD self-associates through a conserved RXDLL motif in the DED, which is necessary for its function as an adapter protein in apoptosis signaling (Muppidi2006Homotypic). Mutations in this motif disrupt FADD's ability to reconstitute apoptosis and recruit caspase-8, highlighting the importance of FADD self-association in apoptotic signaling (Muppidi2006Homotypic).

FADD also forms complexes with other proteins, such as RIP1 kinase, to induce necrosis, and Atg5, to lead to autophagy, indicating its involvement in non-apoptotic pathways (Tourneur2010FADD:).
