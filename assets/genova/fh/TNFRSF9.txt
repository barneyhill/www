# TNFRSF9

## Overview
TNFRSF9, also known as CD137 or 4-1BB, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The protein, TNF receptor superfamily member 9, functions as a costimulatory receptor predominantly expressed on activated T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and other immune cells. It plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses by enhancing T cell proliferation, survival, and cytokine production, which are vital for effective immune function (Rodriguez2019Concomitant; Fröhlich2020Comprehensive). The interaction of TNFRSF9 with its ligand, CD137L, on antigen-presenting cells initiates signaling pathways that promote the expression of anti-apoptotic genes, thereby supporting T cell longevity and function (Dostert2019The). Mutations in the TNFRSF9 gene have been linked to immune-related disorders, including immunodeficiency and lymphoproliferative diseases, highlighting its significance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Somekh2019CD137; Alosaimi2019Immunodeficiency). Additionally, TNFRSF9 expression levels have been associated with patient outcomes in cancer immunotherapy, underscoring its potential as a biomarker for therapeutic response (Fröhlich2020Comprehensive).

## Structure
TNFRSF9, also known as CD137 or 4-1BB, is a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The protein structure includes an extracellular domain characterized by cysteine-rich motifs, which are typical of this receptor family and are crucial for ligand binding (Rodriguez2019Concomitant). The transmembrane domain anchors the protein in the cell membrane, while the cytoplasmic tail is involved in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those that enhance T-cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, survival, and cytotoxicity (Tangye2020Primary).

The TNFRSF9 protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can affect its stability and function. The protein is expressed on activated T cells and interacts with its ligand, CD137L, to mediate costimulatory signals essential for effective immune responses (Rodriguez2019Concomitant). Mutations in the TNFRSF9 gene, such as the frameshift mutation resulting in a premature stop codon, can lead to the absence of CD137 expression and impair T cell responses (Rodriguez2019Concomitant). The absence of alternative spliced transcripts suggests that the gene primarily encodes a single isoform (Rodriguez2019Concomitant).

## Function
TNFRSF9, also known as CD137 or 4-1BB, is a costimulatory receptor that plays a significant role in the regulation of immune responses. It is primarily expressed on activated T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and other immune cells. Upon activation, TNFRSF9 enhances T cell proliferation, survival, and cytokine production, including interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which are crucial for effective immune responses (Fröhlich2020Comprehensive). The receptor is involved in promoting the expansion of antigen-specific T cells, thereby enhancing the immune system's ability to target and eliminate infected or malignant cells (Rodriguez2019Concomitant).

TNFRSF9 signaling is also associated with the upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, which protect T cells from activation-induced cell death, thus supporting their longevity and function (Fröhlich2020Comprehensive). In the context of immune cell activation, TNFRSF9 is expressed on the surface of T cells following T cell receptor (TCR) engagement, indicating its role in the adaptive immune response (Fröhlich2020Comprehensive).

In healthy human cells, TNFRSF9 is crucial for sustaining antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses, particularly during viral infections, by facilitating the expansion and function of these cells (Rodriguez2019Concomitant). This receptor's activity is essential for maintaining effective immune surveillance and response to pathogens.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TNFRSF9 gene, also known as CD137 or 4-1BB, have been linked to several immune-related disorders. A homozygous G109S mutation in TNFRSF9 has been associated with immunodeficiency and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced lymphoproliferation. This mutation results in the loss of 4-1BB expression, leading to impaired CD8+ T cell function, reduced IFN-gamma and perforin expression, and diminished cytotoxicity against EBV-transformed B cells (Alosaimi2019Immunodeficiency).

CD137 deficiency, resulting from TNFRSF9 mutations, can cause immune dysregulation and predispose individuals to lymphomagenesis, particularly EBV-associated lymphomas. Patients with these mutations often exhibit impaired T and B cell activation, reduced memory B cells, and decreased NK cell counts, contributing to immune system dysregulation (Somekh2019CD137).

In melanoma, TNFRSF9 expression levels have been correlated with immune cell infiltration and patient survival. Higher TNFRSF9 mRNA expression is associated with better outcomes in patients undergoing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, while increased methylation of TNFRSF9 correlates with poorer survival, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for immunotherapy response (Fröhlich2020Comprehensive).

## Interactions
TNFRSF9, also known as 4-1BB or CD137, is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily and primarily interacts with its ligand 4-1BBL (TNFSF9), which is expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This interaction is crucial for T-cell development, survival, proliferation, effector function, and memory T-cell formation (Dostert2019The). Upon ligation, TNFRSF9 activates several signaling pathways, including NF-κB, AKT, p38, and PI3K, which promote the expression of anti-apoptotic genes and inhibit pro-apoptotic factors like BIM (Dostert2019The).

TNFRSF9 is also involved in forming complexes with TRAF proteins, which are important for downstream signaling. In chronic infections, TNFRSF9 signaling may become desensitized due to the degradation of its downstream signaling molecule TRAF1 (Dostert2019The). Additionally, TNFRSF9 has been identified as a marker for tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (TI-Tregs) in lung cancer, where its expression is associated with immune suppressive activity within tumors (Cho2021Systems). The interaction between TNFRSF9 and CD47 has been suggested to influence CD8+ T cell exhaustion, indicating a potential role in immune escape mechanisms in cancer (Liang2024Pancancer).
