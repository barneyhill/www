# NELFCD

## Overview
The NELFCD gene encodes the proteins NELF-C and NELF-D, which are integral components of the Negative Elongation Factor (NELF) complex. This complex is pivotal in the regulation of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II), specifically by inducing promoter-proximal pausing, a critical step in controlling gene expression. The NELF complex, comprising NELF-C/D, NELF-A, NELF-B, and NELF-E, collaborates with the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) to modulate RNA Pol II activity, thereby influencing various biological processes such as the heat shock response, estrogen signaling, and early embryonic development (Nakayama2024NELF; Aoi2020NELF). NELF-C/D is essential for the stability and function of the NELF complex, and its dysregulation is associated with significant cellular and developmental consequences, including implications in cancer progression and genomic stability (Nakayama2024NELF).

## Function
The NELFCD gene encodes for the NELF-C and NELF-D proteins, which are part of the Negative Elongation Factor (NELF) complex. This complex plays a crucial role in regulating RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) pausing at promoter-proximal regions, a key step in controlling gene expression. The NELF complex, which includes NELF-C/D, NELF-A, NELF-B, and NELF-E, works to restrain RNA Pol II mobility, establishing a pause that allows for rapid transcriptional responses to environmental and developmental signals (Aoi2020NELF).

NELF-C/D is essential for the stability of the NELF complex, and its depletion can lead to severe growth defects, highlighting its importance in cellular function (Aoi2020NELF). The NELF complex is involved in various biological processes, including the heat shock response, estrogen signaling, and early embryonic development (Aoi2020NELF). In addition to its role in transcription regulation, NELF-C/D is implicated in coordinating RNA Pol II transcription termination and DNA replication initiation. Acute depletion of NELF-C leads to impaired DNA replication licensing and potential cell cycle arrest, indicating its role in cell proliferation and genomic stability (Nakayama2024NELF).

## Clinical Significance
The NELFCD gene, particularly its subunit NELF-C, plays a significant role in the regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription and is implicated in various diseases, notably colorectal cancer. In colorectal tumors, such as colorectal carcinoma (COAD) and rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), NELF-C expression is significantly up-regulated. This up-regulation is associated with increased transcription elongation rates and defects in transcription termination, leading to transcription-replication conflicts and genomic instability (Nakayama2024NELF). These disruptions can result in aberrant cell cycle transitions, particularly affecting the G1-S phase, which is crucial for cell proliferation and tumor growth (Nakayama2024NELF).

The loss of NELF-C in colorectal cancer cells leads to cell growth arrest and an increase in cell cycle inhibitors, indicating its critical role in cell cycle progression (Nakayama2024NELF). The NELF complex, including NELFCD, is also involved in maintaining colon cancer stemness by regulating the expression of cancer stem cell markers, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Aoki2024NELF). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NELFCD in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
The NELFCD gene encodes for the NELF-C and NELF-D isoforms, which are integral components of the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex. This complex interacts with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to regulate transcription elongation by inducing promoter-proximal pausing. NELFCD, along with other NELF subunits (NELF-A, NELF-B, and NELF-E), forms a stable complex with the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), composed of SPT4 and SPT5, to facilitate this pausing mechanism (Nakayama2024NELF; Aoi2020NELF).

NELF-C is crucial for stabilizing the nuclear NELF complex, as its depletion leads to the loss of other NELF subunits from the nucleus (Nakayama2024NELF). The NELF complex also interacts with the cap-binding complex (CBC), enhancing CBC recruitment to promoters and influencing RNA cap stability (Aoi2020NELF). This interaction is modulated by the presence of the 5' cap analog m7GTP, which strengthens the binding affinity between CBC and NELF (Aoi2020NELF).

In the context of DNA damage, NELF-E, a subunit of the NELF complex, is recruited to DNA double-strand break sites, where it plays a role in transcriptional repression and repair, highlighting the complex's involvement in the DNA damage response (Awwad2017NELF).
