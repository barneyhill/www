# DGKA

## Overview
Diacylglycerol kinase alpha (DGKA) is a gene that encodes the enzyme diacylglycerol kinase alpha (DGKα), a member of the kinase family involved in lipid signaling pathways. DGKα plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by catalyzing the conversion of diacylglycerol (DAG) to phosphatidic acid (PA), thereby modulating the levels of these critical lipid second messengers. This enzymatic activity is essential for regulating various signaling pathways, including those mediated by protein kinase C (PKC), which are involved in processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Mérida2007Diacylglycerol; Liu2020Diacylglycerol). DGKα is characterized by its structural domains, including a catalytic domain and regulatory motifs that facilitate its membrane translocation and activity modulation. The protein is expressed in diverse tissues, including the brain and immune cells, where it influences functions such as T-cell receptor signaling and myelin regeneration (Sim2020Beyond; Mérida2007Diacylglycerol). DGKA's expression and activity have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and immune regulation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Gravina2023Role; Mérida2007Diacylglycerol).

## Structure
Diacylglycerol kinase alpha (DGKα) is a protein involved in lipid signaling, characterized by several distinct structural domains. The protein contains a catalytic domain located in the C-terminal half, which is crucial for its kinase activity. This domain includes a conserved DAGKc motif with the sequence CGGDGT, essential for ATP binding and enzymatic function (Mérida2007Diacylglycerol). DGKα also features regulatory domains at the N-terminus, including Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs and a recoverin-like motif, which are important for its regulation and membrane translocation (Mérida2007Diacylglycerol).

The protein has C1-type motifs, homologous to protein kinase C (PKC) phorbol ester/DAG-binding regions, which are involved in membrane targeting rather than catalytic activity. Mutations in these motifs can impair the protein's ability to translocate to the plasma membrane in response to receptor activation (Mérida2007Diacylglycerol). DGKα is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and membrane localization (Mérida2007Diacylglycerol).

DGKα is expressed in various tissues, including oligodendrocytes, thymus, and peripheral T-cells, suggesting specific roles in these areas (Mérida2007Diacylglycerol). The protein's structure and function are further diversified by multiple splice variants, which may affect its localization and activity.

## Function
Diacylglycerol kinase alpha (DGKA) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular signaling by converting diacylglycerol (DAG) into phosphatidic acid (PA), thereby regulating the levels of these important lipid signaling molecules. This conversion is essential for modulating protein kinase C (PKC) activity and other signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Mérida2007Diacylglycerol; Liu2020Diacylglycerol).

In T-cells, DGKA acts as a negative regulator of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Upon TCR activation, DGKA translocates to the plasma membrane, where it phosphorylates DAG to produce PA, thus terminating DAG-derived signals. This activity serves as a 'switch-off' signal for Ras activation and negatively regulates PKCθ membrane localization, controlling the intensity and duration of the immune response (Mérida2007Diacylglycerol). DGKA is also involved in the regulation of T-cell anergy, a state of non-responsiveness crucial for maintaining immune tolerance (Sim2020Beyond).

DGKA is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and hematopoietic cells, and is active in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Its activity is modulated by calcium ions, which influence its localization and function (Sim2020Beyond). In the nervous system, DGKA is suggested to be involved in myelin-related processes, potentially participating in myelin regeneration (Mérida2007Diacylglycerol).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DGKA gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In the context of radiation-induced fibrosis, DGKA is epigenetically regulated, with DNA methylation differences at its locus associated with fibrosis development. This suggests that DGKA methylation status could serve as a marker for fibrosis risk. The gene's expression is inducible by radiation, and its interaction with the profibrotic regulator EGR1 is linked to persistent fibroblast activation and fibrosis (Weigel2016Epigenetic).

In cancer, DGKA plays a complex role. It is highly expressed in certain tumors, such as melanoma, hepatocarcinoma, and glioblastoma, where it is associated with cell growth and poor survival. However, in gastric cancer, high DGKA levels correlate with better survival, indicating its dual role in cancer biology (Liu2020Diacylglycerol). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high DGKA expression is linked to decreased survival, suggesting a negative prognostic significance (Gravina2023Role).

DGKA also impacts immune responses, acting as a negative regulator of T-cell receptor signaling. Its deficiency leads to increased RasGTP levels and enhanced T-cell proliferation, which could contribute to lymphoproliferative disorders (Mérida2007Diacylglycerol).

## Interactions
Diacylglycerol kinase alpha (DGKA) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. DGKA interacts with RasGRP1, a protein involved in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. This interaction is crucial for the negative regulation of TCR signaling, as DGKA translocates to the plasma membrane upon TCR activation, where it acts as a 'switch-off' signal for Ras activation by localizing RasGRP1 to the membrane (Mérida2007Diacylglycerol). 

DGKA also interacts with protein kinase C theta (PKCθ), negatively regulating its membrane localization. This interaction is part of DGKA's role in modulating protein localization and activity during T-cell signaling (Mérida2007Diacylglycerol). 

In the context of stress responses, DGKA interacts with mitogen-activated protein kinases 1 and 3 (MAPK1, MAPK3) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1). These interactions are significant in the signaling pathways related to radiation-induced fibrosis, where DGKA's modulation affects phosphatidic acids and lysophosphatidic acid levels, key components in profibrotic signaling (Weigel2016Epigenetic). 

These interactions highlight DGKA's role in various cellular processes, including immune response regulation and stress-induced signaling pathways.
