# CCND3

## Overview
The CCND3 gene encodes cyclin D3, a regulatory protein that plays a pivotal role in cell cycle control, particularly in the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. Cyclin D3 is a member of the D-type cyclins, which are characterized by their ability to bind and activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), specifically CDK4 and CDK6. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, facilitating the release of E2F transcription factors and promoting cell cycle progression. Beyond its role in cell cycle regulation, cyclin D3 is involved in various physiological processes, including erythropoiesis and immune response, where it influences erythrocyte size and number and supports the expansion of germinal center B cells, respectively. Mutations and dysregulation of CCND3 have been implicated in several hematological malignancies, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer biology (Hua2024Analysis; Sankaran2012Cyclin; Cato2011Cyclin).

## Structure
Cyclin D3, encoded by the CCND3 gene, is a regulatory protein involved in cell cycle control. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a protein of approximately 289 to 295 amino acids in length (Xiong1992Molecular). Cyclin D3 shares significant sequence identity with other D-type cyclins, particularly in the cyclin box domain, which is crucial for binding to cyclin-dependent kinases (Xiong1992Molecular).

The secondary structure of Cyclin D3 is rich in α-helices, comprising 39% of its structure, and also contains 15% β-strands, as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Coelho2020Overexpression). This structural composition is essential for its stability and function.

In terms of tertiary structure, molecular modeling has been used to complete the structure of Cyclin D3, achieving 100% sequential identity with the crystalline structure of the CDK4/Cyclin D3 complex (Coelho2020Overexpression). The quaternary structure involves its interaction with CDK4 and CDK6, forming a complex that regulates the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Coelho2020Overexpression).

Cyclin D3 does not contain the 'destruction box' found in A- and B-type cyclins, suggesting a different mechanism for its degradation or stability (Xiong1992Molecular).

## Function
Cyclin D3, encoded by the CCND3 gene, is a crucial regulator of the cell cycle, particularly in the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. It achieves this by binding to and activating cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, which leads to the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB1). This phosphorylation event releases E2F transcription factors, promoting cell cycle progression (Sankaran2012Cyclin).

In erythropoiesis, cyclin D3 plays a significant role in regulating the number of cell divisions that erythroid precursors undergo during terminal differentiation. This regulation affects erythrocyte size and number, with cyclin D3 levels influencing the balance between cell proliferation and maturation. A genetic variant affecting an erythroid-specific enhancer of CCND3 is associated with changes in erythrocyte traits, such as mean corpuscular volume and red blood cell count (Sankaran2012Cyclin).

Cyclin D3 is also essential in the immune system, particularly in the proliferative expansion of germinal center B cells during T-cell-dependent immune responses. It is selectively required for the expansion of mature germinal center B cells, which is critical for high-affinity antibody production (Peled2010Requirement; Cato2011Cyclin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCND3 gene, which encodes cyclin D3, have been implicated in various hematological malignancies. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly the MLL-rearranged subtype, CCND3 mutations are associated with resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. These mutations, such as T283A and S264R, affect cyclin D3 phosphorylation and stability, leading to increased cell proliferation and drug resistance (Smith2021Recurrent; Matsuo2018Recurrent). Although rare in AML, CCND3 mutations are more frequently observed in Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), where they contribute to increased cell cycle stimulation and poorer overall survival (Hua2024Analysis; Rohde2017Relevance).

In DLBCL, CCND3 mutations are often found in exon 5 and are associated with the EZB genetic subtype, indicating a potential prognostic value (Hua2024Analysis). These mutations can lead to heightened sensitivity to certain targeted therapies, suggesting a role in personalized treatment strategies (Hua2024Analysis). In mantle cell lymphoma, CCND3 rearrangements, often involving immunoglobulin light-chain enhancers, result in overexpression and contribute to tumorigenesis (MartínGarcia2019CCND2). Overall, CCND3 mutations and alterations play a significant role in the pathogenesis and treatment resistance of various lymphoid and myeloid malignancies.

## Interactions
Cyclin D3, encoded by the CCND3 gene, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular processes. Cyclin D3 forms a complex with CDK11 p58, which is significant in the repression of androgen receptor (AR) activity. This complex is involved in the phosphorylation of AR, particularly at Ser-308, which is essential for the repression of AR-mediated transcription (Zong2007Cyclin). Cyclin D3 interacts directly with AR, and this interaction is enhanced in the presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), indicating a ligand-dependent interaction. The full-length cyclin D3 is necessary for binding to AR, and the AR transactivation domain (TAD) is crucial for mediating this interaction (Zong2007Cyclin).

Cyclin D3 and CDK11 p58 form a ternary complex with AR in mammalian cells, which is present in male reproductive tissues such as the prostate and testis. The kinase activity of CDK11 p58, stimulated by DHT, is essential for AR phosphorylation and repression (Zong2007Cyclin). Cyclin D3 is also known to interact with histone acetyltransferase HBO1, contributing to the repression of AR transcriptional activity through mechanisms that are not yet fully understood (Zong2007Cyclin).
