# ZNF205

## Overview
ZNF205 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 205, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of multiple zinc-finger motifs and a KRAB domain. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a significant role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. The zinc finger protein 205 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, and is particularly active in the nucleus where it influences chromatin structure and DNA methylation. Its expression is notably high during critical stages of brain development, suggesting a role in the formation of the forebrain and hindbrain. Additionally, ZNF205 has been implicated in cancer biology, with its expression levels correlating with prognosis in different cancer types, and it may also be involved in the pathogenesis of certain genetic syndromes (Shen2021Conserved; Machnik2019The).

## Structure
ZNF205 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of seven zinc-finger motifs and a KRAB box, which includes both KRAB A and part of KRAB B domains (Centola1998Construction). The zinc fingers of ZNF205 show strong homology to those of ZNF213, indicating a conserved structure within this gene family (Centola1998Construction). The KRAB domain is a common feature in zinc finger proteins, known for its role in transcriptional repression. In ZNF205, the KRAB domain is relatively disordered, which allows the protein to interact with multiple proteins and perform diverse functions (Shen2021Conserved).

ZNF205 is considered an old zinc-finger-containing KRAB zinc-finger protein (KZFP), and its structural characteristics reflect its evolutionary age. The disordered nature of its KRAB domain and linker regions contributes to its functional versatility, particularly in brain development, where it is highly expressed during post-conception stages of the forebrain and hindbrain (Shen2021Conserved). The protein's structure and expression patterns suggest its involvement in complex regulatory networks, potentially influencing various biological processes through its interactions and transcriptional regulation capabilities. Specific details about post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of ZNF205 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ZNF205, a member of the zinc finger protein family, functions primarily as a transcription factor in healthy human cells. It is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which enable it to bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, by modulating the transcription of target genes (Shen2021Conserved).

ZNF205 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell. Its activity is associated with the regulation of chromatin structure and DNA methylation, contributing to the epigenetic control of gene expression (Machnik2019The). The protein's involvement in these processes suggests its participation in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating proper developmental pathways.

In the context of brain development, ZNF205, along with other KRAB zinc-finger proteins, is expressed at relatively high levels during critical stages, such as the post-conception stages of the forebrain and hindbrain. This expression pattern indicates its potential role in brain development through interactions with other proteins involved in these processes (Shen2021Conserved).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of ZNF205 have been associated with various cancer types. In breast cancer, ZNF205 expression is highest in methylation cluster 2 and is positively correlated with the luminal A subtype and PR+ tumors. High expression of ZNF205 is linked to better prognosis, suggesting it may act as a protective factor in breast cancer (Machnik2019The). In contrast, in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), high mRNA levels of ZNF205 are associated with poor prognosis, indicating that its expression may have different implications depending on the cancer type (Machnik2019The).

ZNF205 is also upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues compared to normal tissues, with a modest increase in expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and LUSC (Machnik2019The). This upregulation may play a role in cancer development through the TRIM28/KRAB complex, which is known to trigger epigenetic repression of target genes (Machnik2019The).

In the context of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, ZNF205 was identified near a chromosomal translocation breakpoint, although no direct mutations were found. The study suggested potential dysregulation of nearby genes, including ZNF205, in the proband (Williams2016A).
