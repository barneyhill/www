# RAB5IF

## Overview
RAB5IF is a gene that encodes the RAB5 interacting factor, a protein involved in critical cellular processes such as endocytosis and vesicle trafficking. The protein is categorized as a receptor, specifically interacting with rab5-GDP on endocytic vesicles, which suggests its involvement in the activation of RAB5A, a key regulator of the endocytic pathway (Attwood2020Classification). RAB5IF is also known to interact with TMCO1, a protein essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and this interaction is vital for the stability of TMCO1 protein levels (Rensvold2022Defining). The study of RAB5IF and its interactions is significant for understanding its role in cellular transport, communication, and potential implications in diseases such as cerebrofaciothoracic dysplasia.

## Interactions
RAB5IF, also known as C20orf24, is a protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes related to endocytosis and vesicle trafficking. One of the primary interactions of RAB5IF is with TMCO1, a protein involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis. The interaction between RAB5IF and TMCO1 is crucial, as the loss of RAB5IF leads to a significant decrease in TMCO1 protein levels. This relationship has been confirmed through various experimental approaches, including siRNA silencing and proteomic analysis, and is observed across multiple cell lines (Rensvold2022Defining).

RAB5IF also contains the Rab5 interacting protein Pfam domain, suggesting its role as a receptor for rab5-GDP on endocytic vesicles. This interaction may be involved in the activation of RAB5A, an important regulator of the endocytic pathway, indicating that RAB5IF plays a role in the dynamics of early endosomes (Attwood2020Classification). These interactions highlight the importance of RAB5IF in cellular transport and communication, potentially influencing various signaling pathways. The study of RAB5IF interactions provides insights into its functions and potential roles in disease, particularly in conditions like cerebrofaciothoracic dysplasia (Rensvold2022Defining).
