# ZNF772

## Overview
ZNF772 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 772, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are typically involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins play crucial roles in various cellular processes, including gene expression, cell differentiation, and development. The specific functions of zinc finger protein 772 remain to be fully elucidated, but it is implicated in transcriptional regulation due to its structural features. Alterations in the ZNF772 gene have been associated with certain diseases, highlighting its potential significance in clinical research and therapeutic development (Tchasovnikarova2017Hyperactivation; Arwood2019Transcriptomewide; Wu2017Wholeexome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZNF772 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of hypopharyngeal carcinoma, whole-exome sequencing has identified mutations in ZNF772 as potential contributors to tumorigenesis. These genetic alterations may serve as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of hypopharyngeal carcinoma (Wu2017Wholeexome). 

In the study of combined pre- and post-capillary pulmonary hypertension (CpcPH), ZNF772 was found to be significantly downregulated in patients compared to those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) without pulmonary hypertension. However, the study did not find significant associations for ZNF772 in the context of isolated post-capillary pulmonary hypertension (IpcPH) or CpcPH compared to no pulmonary hypertension (Arwood2019Transcriptomewide).

While the broader impact of MORC2 mutations on ZNF genes is noted, specific effects on ZNF772 were not detailed. The R252W mutation in MORC2, associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, leads to hyper-repression of HUSH target genes, including ZNF genes, suggesting potential indirect effects on ZNF772 (Tchasovnikarova2017Hyperactivation).
