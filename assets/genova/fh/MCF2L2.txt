# MCF2L2

## Overview
MCF2L2 is a gene that encodes the protein MCF.2 cell line derived transforming sequence-like 2, which is a member of the Sec14 superfamily. This protein is categorized as a Dbl family Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF), playing a crucial role in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal organization and dynamics through the modulation of small GTPases (Li2023Structure). The MCF2L2 gene is involved in various cellular signaling pathways and has been implicated in several diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus and certain cancers, due to its genetic polymorphisms and methylation patterns (Zhang2010Effects; Unknownauthors2007Computational). As a significant hub protein within the Sirt-1 interactome, MCF2L2 is essential for maintaining network connectivity and modular organization, highlighting its importance in cellular processes (Sharma2012Interactomic).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The MCF2L2 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), genetic polymorphisms in MCF2L2, particularly the rs7639705 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), have been associated with the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in female patients. The study found that female carriers of the GG genotype of this SNP showed a tendency for decreased creatinine and cystatin levels, suggesting a protective effect against DN (Zhang2010Effects).

In cancer, MCF2L2 has been identified as a gene with significant methylation-expression relationships in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and follicular lymphoma (FL), where it is hypermethylated and down-regulated (Unknownauthors2007Computational). Additionally, MCF2L2 is located in a region of chromosome 3q that is frequently amplified in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, which is associated with improved disease-specific survival and progression-free interval in patients (Rous2022Brief). In metastatic breast cancer, MCF2L2 is part of a panel of genes with significant hypermethylation, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for this disease (Legendre2015Whole-genome).

## Interactions
MCF2L2 is a member of the Sec14 superfamily, specifically within the SecSR sub-group, which includes proteins with an N-terminal CRAL_TRIO domain followed by spectrin repeats (SRs). These proteins, such as Kalirin, TRIO, MCF2, MCF2L, and MCF2L2, are Dbl family RhoGEFs involved in actin cytoskeletal organization and dynamics by modulating small GTPases. The SecSR domain in these proteins appears to inhibit GEF activity, with the catalytic activity of isolated GEF domains being higher than that of intact proteins. The SecSR domain might interact directly with small GTPases or their modified termini to regulate signaling cascades, although the specific nonprotein ligands for SecSR-containing proteins are unknown (Li2023Structure).

MCF2L2 has been identified as a significant hub protein in the Sirt-1 interactome, indicating its central role in a network with 136 nodes and 1503 edges. This network is characterized by a small-world property and a scale-free network property, suggesting robustness against failures. MCF2L2 is one of the top 10 hub proteins identified by various algorithms, highlighting its importance in the network's modular organization and global connectivity (Sharma2012Interactomic).
