# GLI4

## Overview
GLI4 is a gene that encodes the GLI family zinc finger 4 protein, which is a member of the GLI family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which enable them to bind DNA and regulate the expression of target genes. The GLI family zinc finger 4 protein plays a crucial role in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, a key regulator of embryonic development and cell differentiation. Aberrations in this pathway have been implicated in various developmental disorders and cancers. The GLI4 gene, through its encoded protein, is involved in modulating the transcriptional activity of genes that are essential for cellular growth and differentiation processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
