# SIDT1

## Overview
SIDT1, or SID1 transmembrane family member 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the transport of small non-coding RNAs and lipid metabolism. The protein, also referred to as SIDT1, is characterized by its complex structure, which includes 11 transmembrane helices and a signal peptide at the N-terminal region, forming a homodimeric structure (Zheng2023CryoEM). It is part of the cholesterol uptake (ChUP) family and is known for its role in cholesterol binding and transport, facilitated by a conserved cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus motif (CRAC) (Navratna2024Structure). SIDT1 is localized on the plasma membrane, endolysosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a crucial role in the uptake of exogenous dietary microRNAs, potentially regulating host gene expression (Liu2024Structural; Navratna2024Structure). The protein's interaction with double-stranded RNA and cholesterol, along with its intrinsic ceramidase activity, underscores its significance in RNA transport and lipid metabolism (Hirano2024CryoEM). SIDT1's clinical relevance is highlighted by its involvement in diseases such as triple-negative breast cancer and its potential impact on the efficacy of dietary microRNA-based therapies for viral infections (Integrated; Zhou2020Decreased; p&gt; Wang2019&lt).

## Structure
The human SIDT1 protein is a transmembrane protein involved in RNA transport and lipid metabolism. It forms a homodimeric structure with 11 transmembrane helices and a signal peptide at its N-terminal region (Zheng2023CryoEM). The extracellular domain (ECD) of SIDT1 is composed of two β-strand-rich subdomains, ECD1 and ECD2, connected by a flexible loop and reinforced by disulfide bonds, contributing to the stability of the homodimer (Zheng2023CryoEM). The ECD features a double jelly roll fold, which is a characteristic structural motif (Navratna2024Structure).

The transmembrane domain (TMD) of SIDT1 is approximately 500 amino acids long and consists of 11 helices, with the TMD core formed by TMs1-4, TM10, and TM11, while TMs5-9 constitute the lipid binding domain (LBD) (Navratna2024Structure). The TMD is stabilized by interactions such as disulfide bonds and a phenylalanine highway, which is similar to those found in cholesterol-binding proteins (Navratna2024Structure). The presence of conserved histidine and aspartate residues in the TMD suggests a zinc-binding site, although this was not confirmed for SIDT1 (Zheng2023CryoEM).

SIDT1 also contains N-glycosylation sites, which are important for its structural integrity and function (Zheng2023CryoEM). The protein's structure is highly symmetric, with a two-fold rotational symmetry axis perpendicular to the membrane surface (Zheng2023CryoEM). The dimer interface involves extensive interactions, including salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions, contributing to the stability of the SIDT1 dimer (Shimizu2023CryoEM).

## Function
The SIDT1 gene encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the transport of small non-coding RNAs, such as siRNA and miRNA, across cell membranes. In healthy human cells, SIDT1 plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including lipid homeostasis, glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, and the activation of innate immunity (Navratna2024Structure). It is localized on the plasma membrane, endolysosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the uptake of exogenous dietary miRNA in a pH-dependent manner, potentially regulating host gene expression (Liu2024Structural; Navratna2024Structure).

SIDT1 is part of the cholesterol uptake (ChUP) family and operates as a dimer, with its function and stability potentially regulated by cholesterol. It possesses a conserved cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus motif (CRAC), suggesting a role in cholesterol binding and transport (Navratna2024Structure). The protein also exhibits intrinsic ceramidase activity and is involved in cholesterol transport, sharing sequence similarity with the Caenorhabditis elegans cholesterol uptake protein 1 (CEL-CHUP-1) (Liu2024Structural).

The protein's structure includes a double jelly roll fold in its extra-cytosolic domain and a transmembrane domain with a flexible lipid binding domain and a rigid core, which may be relevant to its function in RNA transport and lipid metabolism (Liu2024Structural; Navratna2024Structure).

## Clinical Significance
The SIDT1 gene has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SIDT1 expression is significantly downregulated compared to non-TNBC tissues. This downregulation is associated with poorer recurrence-free survival (RFS) in TNBC patients. Higher levels of SIDT1 correlate with better RFS, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. Overexpression of SIDT1 in TNBC cell lines has been shown to reduce cell viability and tumor growth, indicating its role in cancer progression (Integrated; p&gt; Wang2019&lt).

In the context of viral infections, a polymorphism in the SIDT1 gene affects the absorption of dietary microRNAs, such as MIR2911, which are crucial for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication. Individuals with this polymorphism exhibit reduced absorption of MIR2911, leading to decreased efficacy of treatments like honeysuckle decoction, which is rich in MIR2911. This suggests that the SIDT1 polymorphism may influence the effectiveness of dietary microRNA-based therapies for COVID-19 (Zhou2020Decreased).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of SIDT1 in both cancer and viral infection contexts, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker.

## Interactions
SIDT1 interacts with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and cholesterol, playing a role in RNA transport and lipid metabolism. It has a dsRNA binding site on its extracellular region, which is influenced by pH levels, and another in the cytoplasmic region, with the latter being affected by cholesterol binding (Hirano2024CryoEM). The binding affinity of SIDT1 to dsRNA is lower compared to C. elegans SID-1, possibly due to differences in surface charge (Hirano2024CryoEM). SIDT1 also exhibits ceramidase activity, which is inhibited by cholesterol, suggesting that cholesterol acts as an allosteric regulator, influencing the protein's conformation and activity (Hirano2024CryoEM).

SIDT1 forms homodimers, with its extracellular domain (ECD) and transmembrane domain (TMD) being essential for these interactions (Zheng2023CryoEM). The ECD dimer interface involves hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions, with specific residues like S105 playing a role (Zheng2023CryoEM). SIDT1 also interacts with SIDT2, sharing a similar subcellular localization in late endosomes and lysosomes, and a significant interaction between SIDT1 and SIDT2 has been observed using FRET-FLIM analysis (Nguyen2019SIDT1). These interactions suggest a potential functional relationship between SIDT1 and SIDT2 in the endolysosomal pathway (Nguyen2019SIDT1).
