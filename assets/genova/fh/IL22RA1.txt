# IL22RA1

## Overview
The IL22RA1 gene encodes the interleukin 22 receptor subunit alpha 1 (IL-22R1), a transmembrane receptor protein that is a critical component of the IL-22 receptor complex. This complex, which also includes the interleukin 10 receptor subunit beta (IL-10R2), is primarily expressed on epithelial cells and plays a pivotal role in mediating the biological effects of the cytokine IL-22. The IL-22R1 protein is essential for the activation of signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT and MAP kinase, which are involved in processes like cell proliferation, survival, and antimicrobial defense. These pathways contribute to maintaining epithelial barrier integrity and regulating immune responses, particularly in mucosal tissues (Zenewicz2021IL22; Sabat2012IL22). The IL22RA1 gene is also implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, making it a significant focus of research in therapeutic development (Liu2020IL‑22IL‑22R1; McCuaig2020The).

## Function
The IL22RA1 gene encodes the IL-22R1 protein, a critical component of the IL-22 receptor complex, which also includes IL-10R2. This receptor complex is primarily expressed on epithelial cells, such as keratinocytes, hepatocytes, and enterocytes, and is not found on immune cells like monocytes or T cells (Zenewicz2021IL22; Sabat2012IL22). The IL-22R1 protein serves as the primary binding site for the cytokine IL-22, facilitating signal transduction through pathways such as JAK/STAT and, in some contexts, MAP kinase pathways (Sabat2012IL22).

Upon IL-22 binding, the receptor complex undergoes a conformational change that activates downstream signaling pathways, particularly the phosphorylation of STAT3, which is crucial for mediating the biological effects of IL-22 (Sabat2012IL22). These effects include promoting cell proliferation, survival, and antimicrobial defense, contributing to tissue protection and repair (Zenewicz2021IL22). The IL-22/IL-22R1 axis plays a significant role in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity and regulating immune responses, particularly in mucosal tissues (Lim2014The). This signaling pathway is essential for the organismal outcomes of tissue regeneration and immune defense against pathogens.

## Clinical Significance
The IL22RA1 gene, encoding the interleukin 22 receptor subunit alpha 1, is implicated in various cancers and inflammatory conditions due to its role in the IL-22 signaling pathway. In cancer, IL22RA1 expression is upregulated in multiple tumor types, including pancreatic, colorectal, and lung adenocarcinomas, and is associated with poor prognosis. In colorectal cancer, particularly in cases with KRAS mutations, high IL22RA1 expression correlates with enhanced tumor cell proliferation and poor survival outcomes, suggesting a synergistic effect between IL-22 signaling and oncogenic KRAS (McCuaig2020The). In uterine cancer and melanoma, IL22RA1 mutations lead to alterations in DNA repair and metabolic pathways, contributing to tumor progression (Zhang2022IL22RA1JAKSTAT).

Beyond cancer, IL22RA1 is involved in asthma pathogenesis. Elevated IL-22 levels in children with asthma promote fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, contributing to airway subepithelial fibrosis through the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway (Liu2020IL‑22IL‑22R1). These findings highlight IL22RA1 as a potential therapeutic target in both oncology and respiratory diseases.

## Interactions
IL22RA1, the interleukin 22 receptor subunit alpha 1, is a component of the IL-22 receptor complex, which forms a heterodimer with IL10RB (interleukin 10 receptor subunit beta) to mediate signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT. This receptor complex is crucial for the activation of the JAK1 kinase, which is a member of the Janus kinase family. The interaction between IL22RA1 and JAK1 is facilitated by specific motifs, including the box1 and box2 motifs, which are essential for stable complex formation and signal transduction (Ferrao2016The).

IL22RA1 is involved in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, interacting with proteins such as STAT1 and STAT3. These interactions are part of a broader network of 30 related genes, indicating a complex protein interaction network that includes physical interactions among these components (Zhang2022IL22RA1JAKSTAT). The IL-22/IL22RA1 signaling pathway is also implicated in various cellular processes, including proliferation and fibrosis, through its activation of the STAT3 pathway (Zhao2024IL22IL22RA1; Liu2020IL‑22IL‑22R1). These interactions highlight the role of IL22RA1 in mediating immune responses and cellular signaling.
