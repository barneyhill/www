# CSDE1

## Overview
CSDE1, or Cold Shock Domain Containing E1, is a gene that encodes an RNA-binding protein characterized by the presence of multiple cold shock domains (CSDs). These domains are integral to the protein's ability to bind nucleic acids, particularly single-stranded RNA, and play a significant role in post-transcriptional regulation. The CSDE1 protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is highly expressed in human embryonic stem cells, where it is crucial for maintaining their undifferentiated state. It is involved in various biological processes, including apoptosis, differentiation, and the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. CSDE1's interactions with other proteins and RNA molecules underscore its role as a versatile regulator of gene expression. Clinically, mutations in the CSDE1 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, as well as various cancers, where it may function as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor depending on the context (Heinemann2021ColdShock; Guo2020The; Guo2019Disruptive).

## Structure
CSDE1, also known as Upstream of N-Ras (UNR), is a protein characterized by the presence of multiple cold shock domains (CSDs), which are involved in nucleic acid binding. The protein contains five bona fide CSDs that exhibit high affinity for single-stranded DNA or RNA, but not for double-stranded DNA or structured RNA (Heinemann2021ColdShock). These domains do not have a distinct sequence preference, although they bind simple homopolymers with reduced affinity. Beyond these five RNA-binding CSDs, CSDE1 reportedly contains four additional, interspersed CSDs that do not bind RNA (Heinemann2021ColdShock).

The CSDs in CSDE1 are part of the larger family of oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold proteins, characterized by a five-stranded all-antiparallel β-barrel structure (Heinemann2021ColdShock). The NMR analyses of CSDE1 CSDs revealed a special arrangement of aromatic sidechains in the RNP motifs of CSD1, which is linked to enhanced RNA-binding affinity (Heinemann2021ColdShock).

CSDE1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is highly expressed in human embryonic stem cells, where it functions to maintain them in an undifferentiated state (Heinemann2021ColdShock). The protein's role in translational reprogramming and its involvement in human diseases suggest it may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Guo2020The). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The CSDE1 gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the undifferentiated state of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) by preventing their default neural differentiation. CSDE1 is highly expressed in hESCs and functions by post-transcriptionally modulating core components of multiple regulatory nodes involved in hESC identity, neuroectoderm commitment, and neurogenesis (Ju2017A). It binds to mRNAs such as fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) and vimentin (VIM), regulating their stability and translation (Ju2017A). CSDE1's versatile binding to mRNA targets and other RNA-binding proteins allows it to coordinate various biological processes, including apoptosis and differentiation, in a cell-type-specific manner (Ju2017A).

CSDE1 is involved in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and cell adhesion processes. It modulates the expression of specific target genes such as APCDD1 and CDH2, which are involved in these pathways. APCDD1 acts as an inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, while CDH2 regulates the availability of key factors in the signaling pathway (El2021Wntβcatenin). CSDE1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm of hESCs and is downregulated upon differentiation into neural progenitor cells (Ju2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CSDE1 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). Disruptive variants in CSDE1 have been linked to a new ASD-related syndrome characterized by autism, intellectual disability, language and motor delays, seizures, and macrocephaly (Guo2019Disruptive). These variants are often de novo but can also be inherited, with carrier parents typically exhibiting milder phenotypes (Guo2019Disruptive).

CSDE1 is involved in neuronal development and synaptic transmission, and its disruption can lead to abnormal neurite growth and impaired synaptic function (Guo2019Disruptive). The gene's role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is crucial for neurodevelopment, and mutations can lead to deregulation of this pathway, affecting cellular adhesion and contributing to neurological impairments (El2021Wntβcatenin).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, CSDE1 is implicated in various cancers. It often acts as an oncogene, with overexpression linked to poor prognosis in melanoma, colorectal cancer, and glioma, among others (Guo2020The). Conversely, CSDE1 may function as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts, such as pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (Guo2020The).

## Interactions
CSDE1, also known as UNR, is an RNA-binding protein that participates in various physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation. It forms complexes with other proteins, such as the cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABP1), enhancing the binding of PABP1 to mRNA and facilitating translation initiation (Ray2016Stimulation). CSDE1 also interacts with the serine/threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP), which relies on CSDE1 to bind RNAs like lncBC200 and HRV-2, facilitating their translation (Guo2020The; Booy2018Comprehensive).

CSDE1 acts as a 'protein-RNA connector', forming complexes that influence RNA fate through mechanisms such as mutual connection, facilitating connection, and sequential connection. For instance, it connects STRAP with target RNAs, enabling their translation (Guo2020The). CSDE1 also binds to BC200 RNA, a ribonucleoprotein, and this interaction is crucial for its function, with STRAP's interaction with BC200 being dependent on CSDE1 (Booy2018Comprehensive).

In Drosophila, CSDE1 forms a co-repressor complex with SXL to inhibit the translation of msl-2 mRNA, demonstrating its role in translational repression (Guo2020The). These interactions highlight CSDE1's multifaceted role in regulating gene expression through its interactions with proteins and RNA.
