# TSPY1

## Overview
The TSPY1 gene, located on the Y chromosome, encodes the testis-specific protein Y-linked 1, which is primarily involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its role in promoting the proliferation and differentiation of germ cells within the testes. TSPY1 is predominantly expressed in spermatogonia and plays a critical role in the mitotic division of early germ cells, thereby contributing to male fertility (Giachini2009TSPY1). Beyond its physiological role, TSPY1 has been implicated in oncogenesis, particularly in testicular germ cell tumors and prostate cancer, where it interacts with various signaling pathways and proteins, such as the androgen receptor and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A, to influence cell proliferation and survival (Lu2022Testisspecific; Kido2008The). The gene's amplification and expression patterns underscore its significance in both normal reproductive processes and pathological conditions (Shen2018TSPY1).

## Function
The TSPY1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis, primarily by promoting the proliferation and differentiation of germ cells in the testes. It is expressed predominantly in spermatogonia and at lower levels in primary spermatocytes, indicating its involvement in the mitotic division of early germ cells (Giachini2009TSPY1). TSPY1 interacts with TSPY-like 5 (TSPYL5) to enhance its binding to ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7), leading to increased ubiquitylation and degradation of p53. This process decreases p53 levels, facilitating the G2/M phase transition and reducing cell apoptosis, thereby promoting cell proliferation (Shen2018TSPY1). TSPY1 also enhances the phosphorylation activity of cyclin B1-cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) on histone H1, accelerating the G2/M phase transition, and interacts with eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A to increase protein synthesis and gene transcription (Shen2018TSPY1). The gene's amplification in the male-specific region of the Y chromosome suggests its vital function in spermatogenesis, and its role in suppressing USP7-mediated p53 function is crucial for inhibiting p53-dependent cell proliferation arrest (Shen2018TSPY1). These functions are essential for maintaining germline homeostasis and regulating human spermatogonial proliferation.

## Clinical Significance
The TSPY1 gene, located on the Y chromosome, is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression or interactions. TSPY1 is associated with testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), particularly in precursor lesions like carcinoma in situ (CIS) and seminomas, where it serves as a potential diagnostic marker (Lau2015Roles; Li2007The). Its expression is linked to the upregulation of oncogenes and pro-growth genes, contributing to tumor progression (Li2007The).

In prostate cancer, TSPY1 is frequently overexpressed and correlates with higher cancer grades. It interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), enhancing AR-targeted gene activation and promoting cancer cell proliferation (Leng2020Epigenetic). TSPY1's expression in prostate cancer is regulated by androgen stimulation and epigenetic modifications, suggesting its role as a novel AR-targeted gene (Leng2020Epigenetic).

TSPY1 is also involved in spermatogenesis, with variations in its copy number affecting sperm count and concentration. Lower TSPY1 copy numbers are associated with abnormal sperm parameters, potentially impacting male fertility (Giachini2009TSPY1). The gene's interaction with the USP7-mediated p53 signaling pathway further underscores its role in promoting spermatogonial proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis, which may increase the risk of tumor development when aberrantly expressed (Shen2018TSPY1).

## Interactions
TSPY1 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes. It has been shown to interact with the eukaryotic translation elongation factor eEF1A, a putative oncoprotein. This interaction enhances protein synthesis and gene transcription, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis by promoting cell proliferation and affecting transcriptional programs in germ cell tumors (Kido2008The). TSPY1 also influences the nuclear localization of eEF1A, which is typically cytoplasmic, suggesting a role in enhancing protein synthesis at both translational and transcriptional levels (Kido2008The).

In cancer progression, TSPY1 activates the PI3K/AKT and RAS signaling pathways by suppressing the expression of insulin growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). This suppression leads to increased activity in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/BCL2 and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK/JUN pathways, promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (Tu2019Testis‐specific). TSPY1 also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) in male hepatocellular carcinoma cells, enhancing AR expression through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (Lu2022Testisspecific). These interactions highlight TSPY1's role in regulating key signaling pathways and its potential impact on tumorigenesis.
