# SEC62

## Overview
The SEC62 gene encodes the SEC62 homolog, a preprotein translocation factor that plays a crucial role in the translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein is a key component of the Sec62/Sec63 complex, which is involved in both co-translational and posttranslational transport mechanisms. The SEC62 protein is characterized by its interaction with the Sec61 channel, facilitating the translocation of precursor proteins into the ER. It also plays a significant role in cellular calcium homeostasis and autophagy, particularly through its LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which is involved in the selective autophagy of ER components (Linxweiler2017Let’s; Jung2021Emerging). The gene's expression is linked to various cancers, where its overexpression is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Linxweiler2017Let’s; Greiner2010Silencing).

## Structure
The SEC62 protein is a component of the Sec complex involved in protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. It interacts with Sec61 and Sec63, forming a complex that facilitates the translocation of precursor proteins (Linxweiler2017Let’s). The protein has a conserved structure with two peptide domains at its cytosolic N terminus, which enable binding to the ribosome, crucial for its role in posttranslational transport (Linxweiler2017Let’s). The C-terminal domain of Sec62 interacts with the N-terminal domain of Sec61α and contains a LIR motif that allows binding with LC3, a protein involved in autophagy (Linxweiler2017Let’s).

Sec62 is involved in both co-translational and posttranslational transport mechanisms, with its interaction with Sec61 and Sec63 being essential for the translocation process (Linxweiler2017Let’s). The protein also plays a role in regulating calcium homeostasis, with a C-terminal EF hand domain crucial for limiting Ca2+ efflux from the ER (Linxweiler2017Let’s). The exact molecular structure, including primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, is not detailed in the available context.

## Function
The SEC62 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in human cells. SEC62 is a component of the Sec62/Sec63 complex, which facilitates the opening of the Sec61 channel, a critical step in the translocation of proteins into the ER. This complex is particularly important for the import of proteins with specific signal peptide features, such as low hydrophobicity and extended H-regions (Schorr2020Identification). SEC62 is involved in both co-translational and posttranslational transport mechanisms. In co-translational transport, SEC62 interacts with the ribosomal tunnel exit, a function that has evolved in vertebrates, allowing it to support cotranslational mechanisms (Müller2010Evolutionary). In posttranslational transport, SEC62, along with cytosolic chaperones, helps target fully synthesized precursor proteins to the Sec61 translocon (Linxweiler2017Let’s).

SEC62 also plays a role in cellular calcium homeostasis by regulating the passive efflux of Ca2+ ions from the ER to the cytosol, which is crucial for maintaining cellular processes such as cell migration and apoptosis (Linxweiler2017Let’s). Additionally, SEC62 is involved in the selective autophagy of ER components after an unfolded protein response, mediated by a conserved LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif in its C-terminus (Jung2021Emerging). This autophagy function is separate from its role in protein translocation and is not present in yeast Sec62 (Jung2021Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
The SEC62 gene is implicated in various human cancers, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. SEC62 is frequently amplified in cancers such as prostate, non-small cell lung, thyroid, and breast cancers, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Linxweiler2017Let’s; Zimmermann2022The; Radosa2023The). In prostate cancer, SEC62 copy-number gains are observed in 50% of cases, correlating with higher Gleason scores (Linxweiler2017Let’s). Overexpression of SEC62 is linked to increased cell migration and invasion, contributing to metastasis in cancers like breast, lung, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Takacs2019Identification; WEMMERT2016Initial).

SEC62's role in cancer is further highlighted by its involvement in cellular stress responses, such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress tolerance, which is a hallmark of cancer cells (Zimmermann2022The). Silencing SEC62 reduces the migratory and invasive potential of tumor cells, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Greiner2010Silencing). SEC62 overexpression also correlates with poor overall survival and progression-free survival in several cancers, making it a potential prognostic marker (Linxweiler2017Let’s; Müller2021Expression).

## Interactions
The SEC62 protein is involved in several critical interactions within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. It forms a complex with SEC63, SEC71, and SEC72, which is essential for the post-translational translocation of proteins in yeast. The interaction between SEC62 and SEC63 is particularly significant, with the N-terminal domain of SEC62 interacting with the C-terminal domain of SEC63. This interaction is crucial for the function of the Sec63 complex, which acts as a signal sequence receptor (Jung2021Emerging; Willer2002Identification).

In humans, SEC62 also interacts with ribosomes, specifically binding to the large ribosomal subunit near the ribosomal tunnel exit. This interaction is salt-sensitive and involves electrostatic interactions with ribosomal RNA (Müller2010Evolutionary). SEC62 competes with the SRP receptor α for binding to SEC61β, indicating a dynamic interaction with the SEC61 complex (Jung2021Emerging).

SEC62 is also involved in regulating calcium efflux from the ER and plays a role in autophagy. It interacts with the SEC61 channel to limit calcium efflux, mediated by its C-terminal EF hand motif, and participates in autophagy through its LC3-interacting region (Linxweiler2017Let’s).
