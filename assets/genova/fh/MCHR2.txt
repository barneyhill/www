# MCHR2

## Overview
The MCHR2 gene encodes the melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 2, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is primarily expressed in the human brain. This receptor is part of the GPCR superfamily, characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, which are crucial for its role in ligand binding and signal transduction. MCHR2 is involved in regulating energy homeostasis and feeding behavior, with its expression in brain regions such as the hippocampus and amygdala suggesting a role in mood and stress responses (MacNeil2013The; An2001Identification). The receptor interacts with the melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and predominantly couples with Gαq/11 proteins, facilitating intracellular signaling pathways that influence metabolic processes (He2024Mechanisms; Sailer2001Identification). Although its precise functions in humans are not fully understood, MCHR2 has been investigated for its potential role in obesity and related conditions, although current evidence suggests it is not a major contributor to these phenotypes (Geets2018DNA).

## Structure
The melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 2 (MCHR2) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, typical of the GPCR superfamily. The primary structure of MCHR2 includes specific amino acid sequences that facilitate its function in ligand binding and signal transduction. The secondary structure is dominated by these transmembrane helices, which form a helical bundle crucial for receptor activation and interaction with ligands (He2024Mechanisms; Vitale2004Structural).

In terms of tertiary structure, MCHR2 adopts a canonical GPCR architecture, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.009 Å over 226 Cα atoms, indicating a high degree of structural similarity to other GPCRs (He2024Mechanisms). The receptor's ligand-binding pocket is formed by transmembrane helices TM2, TM3, TM5-7, and three extracellular loops, which accommodate the melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) in a γ-shaped conformation (He2024Mechanisms).

Post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, are present in the extracellular N-terminal region, which may influence receptor stability and function (Takahashi2007The). MCHR2 is expressed specifically in the brain, with its expression pattern suggesting a role in energy homeostasis and feeding behavior (An2001Identification). The receptor's structure and function are further modulated by specific residues involved in ligand recognition and G protein coupling (He2024Mechanisms).

## Function
MCHR2 (melanin concentrating hormone receptor 2) is a G-protein coupled receptor that plays a role in energy homeostasis and feeding behavior. It is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, including regions such as the hippocampus and amygdala, which are associated with emotion and reward (MacNeil2013The). MCHR2 is involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels through Gq-protein coupling, which is a key signaling pathway for its function (Bencze2018The).

In humans, MCHR2 is coexpressed with MCHR1 in the central nervous system and is also found in peripheral tissues like adipocytes, pancreas, prostate, and intestine (MacNeil2013The). Although its precise role in human cells is not fully defined, MCHR2 is believed to influence mood and stress responses due to its expression in brain regions linked to these functions (MacNeil2013The). The receptor's involvement in energy homeostasis suggests it may play a part in regulating body weight and feeding behavior, although its absence in rodent models has limited the study of its specific functions (MacNeil2013The).

## Clinical Significance
The melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 2 (MCHR2) gene has been investigated for its potential role in obesity and related conditions. Although MCHR2 is not expressed in rodents, complicating functional studies, it is highly expressed in the human brain, particularly in regions involved in energy regulation such as the hypothalamus (Geets2018DNA). Some studies have identified variants in MCHR2 that may be associated with obesity. For instance, a rare nonsynonymous variant, p.T47A, was found in a patient with obesity and learning deficits, though its significance remains unclear due to limited family data (Geets2018DNA). Another variant, p.A76A, was found more frequently in Prader-Willi-like (PWL) patients compared to controls, but its association with obesity is uncertain (Geets2018DNA).

Despite these findings, the overall contribution of MCHR2 to obesity and PWL phenotypes appears limited. The study by Geets et al. concluded that MCHR2 is not a major contributor to human obesity or PWL, highlighting the heterogeneity of molecular mechanisms in these conditions (Geets2018DNA). Further research is needed to clarify the role of specific MCHR2 variants in obesity-related conditions.

## Interactions
MCHR2 interacts with the melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) to form a complex that predominantly couples with Gαq/11 proteins, facilitating intracellular signaling pathways (He2024Mechanisms; Sailer2001Identification). This interaction leads to inositol phosphate turnover and calcium mobilization, indicating its role in activating G-protein signaling pathways (Sailer2001Identification). MCHR2 does not couple with the Gαi/o pathway, as evidenced by its lack of effect on forskolin-induced cAMP production and insensitivity to pertussis toxin (Sailer2001Identification).

The binding of MCH to MCHR2 involves specific molecular interactions, such as the deep penetration of a central arginine from the LGRVY core motif into the receptor's transmembrane pocket, which is crucial for receptor activation (He2024Mechanisms). MCHR2 also forms additional polar interactions with MCH, including hydrogen bonds with specific residues like W93 and S295, which are not present in MCHR1, highlighting unique interaction patterns (He2024Mechanisms).

These interactions are essential for the receptor's function in energy homeostasis and appetite regulation, as they facilitate the transfer of chemical information from extracellular to cytosolic domains, influencing metabolic processes (Vitale2004Structural).
