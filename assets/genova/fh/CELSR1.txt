# CELSR1

## Overview
CELSR1 is a gene that encodes the cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 1, a transmembrane protein that belongs to the adhesion G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This protein is integral to the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, which is essential for the coordinated orientation of cells within the plane of a tissue. The CELSR1 protein is characterized by its complex structure, including nine extracellular cadherin repeats, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and laminin G (LamG) repeats, and a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, followed by seven transmembrane helices. These structural features enable CELSR1 to mediate homophilic cell adhesion and participate in critical signaling pathways that influence processes such as neural tube closure and angiogenesis (Basta2023Celsr1; Tamilselvan2020Elucidating). Mutations in the CELSR1 gene have been linked to various developmental disorders, including hereditary lymphedema and neural tube defects, highlighting its clinical significance (Chen2018Genetic; GonzalezGaray2016A).

## Structure
The CELSR1 protein is a member of the Cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor family, characterized by its atypical cadherin structure and role as an adhesion G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) (Basta2023Celsr1). It is a large protein, exceeding 300 kDa, and is composed of nine extracellular cadherin repeats, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and laminin G (LamG) repeats, a hormone receptor domain (HormD), and a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, followed by seven transmembrane helices and a long cytoplasmic tail (Basta2023Celsr1). The extracellular region facilitates homophilic adhesion through its cadherin repeats, which are crucial for stable junctional recruitment and planar cell polarity (PCP) complex organization (Basta2023Celsr1; Tamilselvan2020Elucidating).

The protein's structure allows it to engage in self-recognition across neighboring cells, supporting its function in the noncanonical Wnt/PCP pathway (Zhan2016CELSR1). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided, the protein's domain organization and interactions suggest a complex architecture essential for its role in cell adhesion and signaling. Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, and alternative splicing can result in different isoforms.

## Function
CELSR1, a member of the cadherin superfamily, plays a significant role in cell adhesion and signaling, particularly within the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. This pathway is crucial for the coordinated orientation of cells within the plane of a tissue, influencing processes such as neural tube closure and hair follicle orientation (Basta2023Celsr1; Hadjantonakis1997Celsr1). CELSR1 is a seven-pass transmembrane protein that functions as an adhesion G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), engaging in homophilic interactions through its cadherin repeats. These interactions are essential for transmitting polarization information across the apical plane of cells (Basta2023Celsr1; Tamilselvan2020Elucidating).

In endothelial cells, CELSR1 is a positive regulator of migration and angiogenesis. It is involved in endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, which are critical for angiogenesis. The protein's expression in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) supports these functions, as demonstrated by various assays showing that CELSR1 promotes these cellular behaviors (Zhan2016CELSR1). CELSR1's role in these processes highlights its importance in vascular biology and tissue development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CELSR1 gene are associated with several medical conditions, primarily involving the lymphatic and neural systems. Hereditary lymphedema, particularly affecting the lower extremities, has been linked to novel mutations in CELSR1. These mutations often follow an autosomal dominant pattern with variable penetrance, showing a higher prevalence in females (Alpaslan2023Ureteropelvic; GonzalezGaray2016A; Maltese2019Increasing). 

CELSR1 mutations are also implicated in neural tube defects (NTDs), such as spina bifida and craniorachischisis. These mutations are often found in combination with other genes in the Wnt/PCP pathway, suggesting a complex genetic interplay in the etiology of NTDs (Chen2018Genetic). 

Additionally, CELSR1 variants have been associated with ureteropelvic junction obstruction and other renal anomalies, particularly in the context of Phelan-McDermid syndrome, where CELSR1 is located within a critical deletion region (Alpaslan2023Ureteropelvic). The gene's role in planar cell polarity and tissue organization underscores its significance in these developmental disorders.

## Interactions
CELSR1 is a core component of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and interacts with several other proteins to facilitate its role in cell signaling and tissue organization. It forms homotypic adhesive interactions at basal cell junctions, particularly between anterior and posterior neighbors, which are crucial for its function in planar cell polarity (Basta2023Celsr1). CELSR1 physically interacts with other transmembrane PCP components, specifically Frizzled 6 (Fz6) and Vangl2, promoting their assembly into heterotypic, intercellular complexes (Basta2023Celsr1). These interactions are essential for the asymmetric localization of PCP proteins and the correct anterior-posterior orientation of hair follicles (Basta2023Celsr1).

The Crash mutant of CELSR1, which involves a D1040G amino acid substitution, disrupts its ability to form stable, clustered assemblies via lateral cis-interactions, affecting its asymmetric localization and hair follicle polarity. However, this mutation does not interfere with the association of CELSR1 with Fz6 or Vangl2 (Basta2023Celsr1). CELSR1 also engages in G protein coupling, specifically with GαsS, indicating its role in signal transduction pathways (Huong2023The). Despite being cleavage-deficient, CELSR1 can still induce G protein coupling, possibly through interactions involving its extracellular regions (Huong2023The).
