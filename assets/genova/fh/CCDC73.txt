# CCDC73

## Overview
CCDC73 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 73 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in cellular architecture or signaling pathways. Although the specific biological functions of the CCDC73 protein remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and reproductive health disorders. Research indicates that mutations in the CCDC73 gene may contribute to the development of certain cancers, such as ovarian and hepatocellular carcinoma, and it is part of a gene signature used for prognostic purposes in bladder carcinoma (Liu2020Identification; Gorlov2018Gene). Additionally, variants in CCDC73 have been studied in the context of globozoospermia, although their direct impact on infertility is still uncertain (Oud2020Exome). Further research is needed to fully understand the functional roles and clinical implications of CCDC73.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCDC73 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, CCDC73 has been associated with an excess of frameshift and/or nonsense mutations, suggesting a potential role in cancer development (Gorlov2018Gene). Specifically, CCDC73 is linked to ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and endometrial cancer, as part of a 17-gene signature that serves as a prognostic tool for early-stage bladder carcinoma (Liu2020Identification).

In the realm of reproductive health, a homozygous variant in CCDC73 (p.(Leu224Phefs*11)) was identified in a patient with globozoospermia, a condition characterized by abnormal sperm morphology. However, this variant is considered to have uncertain significance and is unlikely to be causative for infertility, indicating that while it may be present in individuals with globozoospermia, it does not directly contribute to the condition (Oud2020Exome).

Overall, while CCDC73 is associated with certain cancers and has been studied in the context of sperm abnormalities, its precise role in these conditions requires further investigation to clarify its clinical significance.
