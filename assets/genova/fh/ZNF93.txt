# ZNF93

## Overview
ZNF93 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 93, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of multiple Cys2-His2 zinc finger motifs. These motifs are essential for the protein's ability to bind DNA, particularly in the regulation of retrotransposon activity within human cells (Jacobs2014An). Zinc finger protein 93 plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by repressing the activity of specific retrotransposons, such as L1PA4 elements, through binding to their 5′ untranslated regions (Jacobs2014An). The protein functions predominantly in the nucleus and is involved in a complex network of interactions with other proteins, including KAP1 and TRIM28, which are crucial for its regulatory functions (Helleboid2019The; Chang2023AcetylationMimic). Evolutionary adaptations have shaped the structure and function of ZNF93, highlighting its importance in the evolutionary arms race between host genomes and retrotransposons (Jacobs2014An).

## Structure
ZNF93 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of multiple zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA binding capabilities. The primary structure of ZNF93 includes a series of Cys2-His2 zinc finger motifs, which are small protein motifs stabilized by zinc ions (Jacobs2014An). These motifs typically form part of the secondary structure, often involving alpha helices that facilitate DNA binding. The zinc fingers 8-13 are particularly important for the protein's DNA binding selectivity, as they mediate the interaction with specific sequences in retrotransposon elements (Jacobs2014An).

The tertiary structure of ZNF93 is defined by the folding of these zinc finger motifs, allowing the protein to effectively bind to DNA. Although the quaternary structure is less common in zinc finger proteins, ZNF93 functions primarily as a monomer. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions (Jacobs2014An).

Evolutionary changes have influenced the molecular structure of ZNF93, with specific zinc finger domains being deleted, duplicated, or restored through mutations. For example, domain 17 is present in humans due to a compensatory deletion that restored it, making human ZNF93 distinct from other apes (Jacobs2014An).

## Function
ZNF93 is a KRAB zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in regulating retrotransposon activity in human cells. It functions primarily by binding to specific DNA sequences in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of certain retrotransposons, such as L1PA4 elements, thereby repressing their activity. This repression is mediated by zinc fingers 8-13 of ZNF93, which are essential for DNA binding (Jacobs2014An). The protein's ability to bind and repress these elements is part of an evolutionary arms race between the host genome and retrotransposons, where ZNF93 has evolved to protect genome integrity by limiting retrotransposon activity (Jacobs2014An).

In human embryonic stem cells, ZNF93 is active in the nucleus, where it modulates the activity of retrotransposons, contributing to genome stability. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies have shown that ZNF93 binds to the 5′ UTR of L1PA4 elements, suggesting its role in transcriptional regulation and repression of these elements (Jacobs2014An). This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing genomic instability that could arise from unchecked retrotransposon activity.

## Interactions
ZNF93 is a KRAB zinc finger protein that interacts with various genomic elements and proteins, playing a role in transcriptional regulation and retrotransposon inhibition. It binds to the 5′ end of L1PA4, L1PA5, and L1PA6 retrotransposon elements, but not to the more recent L1PA2 and L1Hs subtypes due to a 129 bp deletion in their 5′UTR, which allows these elements to evade ZNF93-mediated repression (Jacobs2014An). ZNF93's zinc fingers 8-13 are crucial for recognizing the 129 bp element, and modifications in these fingers can abolish DNA binding selectivity (Jacobs2014An).

ZNF93 is predominantly nuclear and is part of a high-density connectivity map of interactions centered on KAP1, a frequent interactor, along with other proteins like HP1a, HP1c, SIRT1, and SMARCAD1 (Helleboid2019The). It is involved in a complex network of interactions with KRAB domain-containing proteins, and its interaction with TRIM28 is affected by the acetylation-mimic mutation K304Q in TRIM28, which alters gene expression (Chang2023AcetylationMimic). ZNF93 is also associated with the repression of transcription without preventing the spread of retroelements, indicating a shift in its function over time (Helleboid2019The).
