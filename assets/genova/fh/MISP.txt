# MISP

## Overview
MISP (Mitotic Spindle Positioning) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of mitotic spindle orientation during cell division. The MISP protein is a crucial component of the cellular machinery that ensures accurate chromosome segregation by stabilizing the attachment of astral microtubules to the cell cortex. It functions as a substrate for Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), which phosphorylates MISP to facilitate its role in mitotic progression. MISP is associated with the actin cytoskeleton and interacts with several proteins, including the dynein-dynactin complex and Ezrin, to maintain proper spindle orientation and cortical protein distribution. These interactions are vital for the correct positioning of the mitotic spindle and the onset of anaphase. Dysregulation of MISP expression has been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Vodicska2018MISP; Zhu2013MISP; Kschonsak2018Activated).

## Function
MISP (Mitotic Spindle Positioning) is a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of mitotic spindle orientation during cell division. It is a substrate of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and is phosphorylated by Plk1, which is essential for its function in mitotic progression and spindle orientation (Zhu2013MISP). MISP is associated with the actin cytoskeleton and localizes at the cell cortex throughout the cell cycle, contributing to the proper cortical distribution of proteins such as p150 glued, which is part of the dynein-dynactin complex (Zhu2013MISP; Kschonsak2018Activated).

MISP interacts with astral microtubules, stabilizing their attachment to the cell cortex, which is crucial for correct spindle orientation and the onset of anaphase during cell division (Zhu2013MISP). It does not directly bind to microtubules but regulates their stability through interactions with other proteins, such as the dynein-dynactin complex (Zhu2013MISP). MISP also interacts with Ezrin, an ERM family protein, which regulates its cortical levels by competing for actin-binding sites, ensuring proper spindle orientation and NuMA polarization (Kschonsak2018Activated).

The proper function of MISP is essential for accurate chromosome segregation and cell division, and its depletion can lead to mitotic defects such as spindle misorientation and delays in the metaphase-to-anaphase transition (Zhu2013MISP).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MISP gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), MISP is upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis and increased tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion. This upregulation is also associated with a higher tumor mutational burden and altered immune infiltration, suggesting MISP as a potential biomarker for PDAC prognosis and a target for therapeutic intervention (Huang2022UpRegulated).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), MISP is overexpressed and contributes to cancer progression by interacting with opa interacting protein 5 (OIP5) and activating the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. This interaction promotes cell proliferation and tumor growth, indicating that targeting the MISP-OIP5 complex could be a therapeutic strategy for CRC (Hiura2024Mitotic).

MISP is also overexpressed in gastric cancer, where it is linked to tumor progression and poor clinical outcomes. Its expression is significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal gastric mucosa, suggesting its role as a biomarker for gastric cancer (Vilarinho2024MISP).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of MISP in cancer development and progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions across various cancer types.

## Interactions
MISP (Mitotic Spindle Positioning) is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in mitotic progression and spindle orientation. MISP interacts with the dynein-dynactin complex, specifically binding to the p150 glued subunit, which is essential for spindle orientation and positioning (Zhu2013MISP; Maier2013The). This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of astral microtubules and their attachment to the cell cortex (Zhu2013MISP).

MISP also interacts with IQGAP1, a scaffolding protein, and through IQGAP1, it binds to the active form of Cdc42, a small GTPase involved in spindle orientation (Vodicska2018MISP). This interaction is important for maintaining active Cdc42 levels, which are necessary for proper mitotic progression (Vodicska2018MISP). MISP's interaction with IQGAP1 is not affected by its phosphorylation status, indicating a stable association (Vodicska2018MISP).

Additionally, MISP forms a complex with Opa Interacting Protein 5 (OIP5) in the cytoplasm, which may play a role in colorectal cancer progression (Hiura2024Mitotic). These interactions highlight MISP's role in linking the actin cytoskeleton to microtubule dynamics, ensuring accurate spindle positioning during cell division.
