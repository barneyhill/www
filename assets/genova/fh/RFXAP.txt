# RFXAP

## Overview
The RFXAP gene encodes the regulatory factor X-associated protein, a crucial component of the RFX complex involved in the transcriptional regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) genes. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by facilitating the presentation of exogenous antigens to CD4+ T helper lymphocytes, thereby initiating antigen-specific immune responses. RFXAP is characterized by its interaction with other subunits of the RFX complex, such as RFX5 and RFXB, forming a heterotrimeric complex essential for the binding to MHC-II promoters. The protein's C-terminal domain, although unstructured in isolation, adopts a structured form upon interaction with RFX5, underscoring its importance in the stability and function of the RFX complex (Laird2010Solution; Durand1997RFXAP). Mutations in the RFXAP gene can lead to MHC-II deficiency, a severe immunodeficiency disorder, highlighting its critical role in immune regulation (Durand1997RFXAP). Additionally, altered expression of RFXAP has been implicated in certain cancers, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with disease progression and prognosis (Ding2020Fisetin).

## Structure
The RFXAP protein is a component of the RFX complex, essential for the regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) genes. It is a 272 amino acid protein with a critical C-terminal domain (RFXAP C) necessary for the formation of the RFX complex (Laird2010Solution). The C-terminal domain of RFXAP is unstructured on its own but forms a structured configuration when bound to the oligomerization domain of RFX5, consisting of two α-helices, Helix-C1 and Helix-C2, connected by a short loop (Laird2010Solution). Helix-C1 extends from Leu 226 through Leu 238, and Helix-C2 extends from Pro 242 to Glu 261, with hydrophobic interactions stabilizing the structure (Laird2010Solution).

The interaction between RFXAP and RFX5 is crucial for the stability of the RFX complex, with specific leucine residues in RFX5 forming a hydrophobic interface with RFXAP (Laird2010Solution). The RFX5 N2•RFXAP C complex structure reveals that RFXAP C fits within the RFX5 N2 dimer, which is shaped like a staple, and this interaction is stabilized by leucine residues in the leucine-rich region of RFX5 (Laird2010Solution). The RFXAP protein does not contain the characteristic RFX DNA binding motif, indicating its unique role in the RFX complex (Durand1997RFXAP).

## Function
The RFXAP gene encodes a subunit of the RFX DNA binding complex, which is essential for the transcription of Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II (MHC-II) genes. These genes are crucial for the immune system as they present exogenous antigenic peptides to CD4+ T helper lymphocytes, triggering antigen-specific T cell activation (Durand1997RFXAP). RFXAP is necessary for the proper binding activity of the RFX complex to the X box of MHC-II promoters, facilitating the transcription of MHC-II genes (Durand1997RFXAP). 

In healthy human cells, RFXAP interacts with other subunits of the RFX complex, such as RFX5, to form a functional complex that binds to specific DNA sequences in the promoter regions of MHC-II genes (Durand1997RFXAP). This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activation of MHC-II genes, which is vital for immune function (Durand1997RFXAP). The RFXAP protein is active in the nucleus, where it participates in transcriptional regulation, ensuring the proper expression of MHC-II molecules (Durand1997RFXAP). Mutations in RFXAP can lead to MHC-II deficiency, highlighting its importance in immune regulation (Durand1997RFXAP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RFXAP gene are associated with major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) deficiency, a severe immunodeficiency syndrome. This condition is characterized by the absence of MHC-II expression, which is crucial for presenting antigenic peptides to CD4+ T helper lymphocytes, leading to impaired immune responses (Masternak1998A; Durand1997RFXAP). MHC-II deficiency is categorized into different complementation groups, with group D specifically linked to mutations in the RFXAP gene (Durand1997RFXAP). 

Patients with mutations in RFXAP often present with recurrent infections, failure to thrive, and increased susceptibility to opportunistic microorganisms due to the lack of MHC-II expression (Aluri2018Clinical). Specific mutations, such as a homozygous single base pair insertion in exon 1 and a splice site variation in intron 2, have been identified in patients, leading to frameshifts and premature truncation of the RFXAP protein (Cai2020A; Aluri2018Clinical). 

In addition to its role in immunodeficiency, altered expression of RFXAP has been observed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where lower levels of RFXAP are associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages (Ding2020Fisetin).

## Interactions
RFXAP is a critical component of the RFX complex, which is essential for the regulation of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) gene expression. RFXAP interacts with RFX5 and RFXB to form a heterotrimeric complex. The interaction between RFXAP and RFX5 is particularly important, as RFXAP cannot form a stable tertiary structure without RFX5. The C-terminal domain of RFXAP, which is unstructured on its own, adopts a structured form when bound to the oligomerization domain of RFX5. This interaction is crucial for the assembly and function of the RFX complex (Laird2010Solution; Briggs2009Formation).

The RFX5 protein forms a dimer that interacts with RFXAP, and this complex has a high affinity for RFXB. The presence of RFX5 enhances the affinity of RFXAP for RFXB by reducing the entropic cost of stabilizing RFXAP's flexible C-terminal domain. This structural change is essential for the formation of the RFX complex, which is important for the gene regulatory functions of these proteins (Laird2010Solution; Briggs2009Formation).

RFXAP also plays a role in bridging interactions between RFX5 and RFXB, facilitating the assembly of the transcriptional machinery necessary for MHCII gene expression (DeSandro2000Associations).
