# CT47A6

## Overview
CT47A6 is a gene that encodes the protein cancer/testis antigen family 47 member A6, which is part of a group of proteins known as cancer/testis antigens. These proteins are typically expressed in the testis and various cancer types, but not in most normal tissues, making them of particular interest in cancer research and therapy. The CT47A6 protein is implicated in the regulation of the mitotic cell cycle and immune tolerance mechanisms, which are critical in the progression and immune evasion of certain cancers (Mathews2020Functional; Ye2020Detecting). Its expression is notably elevated in cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, where it serves as a potential biomarker and target for immunotherapy (Haase2021IGF2BP1).

## Clinical Significance
CT47A6, a member of the cancer/testis antigen family, is implicated in various cancer types due to its altered expression levels. In cancer subtype 3, CT47A6 is part of a gene group involved in the mitotic cell cycle, suggesting that its dysregulation may contribute to disruptions in cell cycle regulation, a critical factor in cancer development (Ye2020Detecting). This gene is also associated with immune tolerance mechanisms in cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma, breast, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, and colon adenocarcinoma. The overexpression of CT47A6, along with other cancer/testis antigens, is linked to poor prognosis in these cancers, potentially due to its role in mediating immune tolerance, which allows tumors to evade immune detection (Mathews2020Functional).

In anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), CT47A6 is listed among the top 20 ATC-exclusive markers, indicating its potential relevance in the diagnosis or treatment of this aggressive cancer type (Haase2021IGF2BP1). The presence of CT47A6 in these contexts highlights its significance as a biomarker and potential target for cancer immunotherapy, given its restricted expression in normal tissues and overexpression in various malignancies.
