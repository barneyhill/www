# TTLL11

## Overview
The TTLL11 gene encodes the enzyme tubulin tyrosine ligase-like 11, which is a member of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family of proteins. This enzyme is primarily involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin through polyglutamylation, a process that is crucial for the regulation of microtubule dynamics. Polyglutamylation by TTLL11 is essential for the proper functioning of spindle microtubules during mitosis, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and maintaining genome stability (Zadra2022Chromosome). Additionally, TTLL11 plays a significant role in the integrity and function of primary cilia, which are important for various cellular signaling pathways, including those related to bone development and neuronal processes (Mathieu2021Genetic). Mutations in TTLL11 have been associated with several medical conditions, including idiopathic scoliosis and neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Fullston2011Inherited; Mathieu2021Genetic).

## Function
The TTLL11 gene encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of tubulin through polyglutamylation, a process essential for maintaining microtubule dynamics in healthy human cells. This modification is crucial for the proper functioning of spindle microtubules during mitosis, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and maintaining genome stability (Zadra2022Chromosome). TTLL11's activity involves the elongation of glutamate chains on tubulin, which regulates the recruitment and activity of microtubule-associated proteins, severing enzymes, and molecular motors, thereby fine-tuning microtubule dynamics (Zadra2022Chromosome).

In addition to its role in mitosis, TTLL11 is implicated in the integrity of primary cilia, which are essential for various cellular functions. It modifies α-tubulin by extending the glutamate chain, crucial for the proper elongation of cilia. Mutations in TTLL11 can lead to mislocalization and shorter or absent cilia, affecting ciliary structure and function (Mathieu2021Genetic). TTLL11 is also involved in pathways such as Hedgehog signaling, which is important for spine development and other signaling pathways related to bone development (Mathieu2021Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TTLL11 gene have been implicated in several medical conditions, primarily due to their impact on ciliary function. In a study involving a five-generation UK family, a rare variant in TTLL11 was associated with idiopathic scoliosis (IS). This variant leads to a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein that affects ciliary integrity and function, contributing to skeletal deformities like scoliosis (Mathieu2021Genetic). Zebrafish models with TTLL11 mutations exhibited spine curvature and vertebral rotation, further supporting the gene's role in skeletal development (Mathieu2021Genetic).

TTLL11 mutations have also been linked to neuropsychiatric conditions. A study identified a balanced translocation involving TTLL11 in a patient with schizophrenia, suggesting that disruptions in TTLL11 expression may contribute to the disorder by affecting neuronal processes (Fullston2011Inherited). Additionally, TTLL11 has been proposed as a candidate gene for VATER/VACTERL association, a condition characterized by congenital anomalies, based on the identification of potentially pathogenic variants in affected individuals (Kolvenbach2021Exome).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of TTLL11 mutations in various disorders, emphasizing the need for further research to understand their full impact.

## Interactions
TTLL11 interacts with various proteins to regulate microtubule dynamics through polyglutamylation. It is known to interact with CSAP, a regulator of TTLL-mediated microtubule glutamylation. This interaction enhances the glutamylation activity of TTLL11, increasing both initiation and elongation activities, which suggests that CSAP plays a critical role in modulating TTLL11's function in microtubule dynamics (Bompard2018CSAP).

TTLL11 is also involved in maintaining ciliary integrity and function. In C. elegans, TTLL11, along with TTLL-4 and TTLL-5, participates in the regulation of microtubule glutamylation, which is crucial for neuronal survival and axoneme stability. These interactions are part of a broader mechanism that includes the modulation of ciliary kinesins and is influenced by NEKL-4 activity (Power2020Mutation; Power2020Mutationa).

In the context of chromosome segregation, TTLL11 is essential for maintaining the dynamic properties of spindle microtubules during mitosis. Its activity is crucial for accurate chromosome segregation, and its downregulation is associated with increased microtubule stability and chromosome segregation errors (Zadra2022Chromosome). These interactions highlight TTLL11's role in both microtubule dynamics and cellular processes such as ciliogenesis and mitosis.
