# CPXCR1

## Overview
The CPXCR1 gene, located on the X chromosome at Xq21.3, encodes the CPX chromosome region candidate 1 protein, which is characterized by a zinc-finger motif indicative of potential DNA-binding or transcriptional regulatory functions. This gene is primarily associated with X-linked cleft palate and ankyloglossia (CPX), although current evidence suggests that variants in CPXCR1 are likely polymorphisms rather than direct causative factors of the CPX phenotype (Skare2017A; Braybrook2001Physical). The CPXCR1 protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it may interact with other nuclear proteins to influence chromosomal dynamics (Stevenson2007Rapid). Despite its expression in various fetal tissues relevant to craniofacial development, the precise biological role of CPXCR1 in normal human physiology remains to be fully elucidated (Braybrook2001Physical).

## Structure


## Function
The CPXCR1 gene is located on the X chromosome at Xq21.3 and is implicated in the development of X-linked cleft palate and ankyloglossia (CPX) (Braybrook2001Physical). The gene encodes a protein that contains a zinc-finger motif, suggesting a potential role in DNA binding or transcriptional regulation (Braybrook2001Physical). Despite its association with CPX, mutation screening has indicated that variants in CPXCR1 are likely polymorphisms and not causative of the CPX phenotype (Skare2017A).

CPXCR1 is expressed in various fetal tissues, including the tongue, mandible, and palate, which are relevant to the CPX phenotype (Braybrook2001Physical). The gene is also expressed in the fetal adrenal gland, kidney, lung, mandible, stomach, and tongue, but not in the brain, eye, heart, or liver (Braybrook2001Physical). The presence of a zinc-finger motif in the protein suggests a role in DNA binding, although the specific function in healthy human cells remains unclear (Braybrook2001Physical). The protein's activity is primarily observed in the nucleus, where it may interact with other nuclear proteins to modulate chromosomal dynamics (Stevenson2007Rapid).

## Clinical Significance
The CPXCR1 gene, located in the Xq21.3 region, has been implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily related to craniofacial development and obesity. It is associated with X-linked cleft palate and ankyloglossia (CPX), a condition characterized by cleft palate and tongue-tie. However, mutation screening has shown that variants in CPXCR1 are unlikely to be the sole cause of CPX, as these variants are also found in unaffected individuals, suggesting a complex genetic basis for the condition (Braybrook2001Physical).

In addition to craniofacial anomalies, alterations in the CPXCR1 gene have been linked to obesity-related conditions. Copy number variations (CNVs) in the CPXCR1 region have been associated with an increased risk of abdominal obesity, higher body mass index (BMI), and increased waist circumference in certain populations (AntúnezOrtiz2017Copy). These findings suggest that CNVs in CPXCR1 may contribute to the development of obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, in affected individuals.

Furthermore, deletions in the Xq21 region, which includes CPXCR1, have been associated with choroideremia, deafness, and mental retardation syndrome, although the specific role of CPXCR1 in these conditions remains unclear (Liang2017A).
