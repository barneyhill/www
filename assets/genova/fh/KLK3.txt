# KLK3

## Overview
KLK3, also known as the gene encoding prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is a member of the kallikrein-related peptidase family, which is characterized by its serine protease activity. The protein product, kallikrein-related peptidase 3, is predominantly expressed in the prostate gland and plays a vital role in the male reproductive system by facilitating the liquefaction of semen, thereby enhancing sperm motility and fertility (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated; Yu2014Putative). Beyond its physiological functions, KLK3 is clinically significant as a biomarker for prostate cancer, with its expression levels being closely monitored for diagnostic and prognostic purposes (Lawrence2010Kallikreins). The gene's expression is regulated by androgens and can be influenced by genetic polymorphisms, which may affect prostate cancer risk and PSA levels (Batra2012Genetic; Motamedi2019Kallikarein‐related). As a serine protease, KLK3 is involved in various protein interactions and signaling pathways, contributing to its multifaceted role in both normal physiology and disease states (Mavridis2014Targeting; Réhault2001Insulin‐like).

## Structure
KLK3, also known as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is a serine protease with a well-characterized molecular structure. The primary structure of KLK3 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, which includes a catalytic triad composed of His57, Asp102, and Ser195, essential for its enzymatic activity (Ménez2008Crystal; Härkönen2011The). The secondary structure features two six-stranded beta-barrel domains with a 'Greek key' topology, typical of kallikrein-related peptidases (Lawrence2010Kallikreins; Härkönen2011The).

The tertiary structure of KLK3 is stabilized by disulfide bonds and includes a unique kallikrein loop that influences substrate access to the active site (Ménez2008Crystal; Härkönen2011The). This loop undergoes conformational changes upon substrate binding, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Ménez2008Crystal). KLK3 can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure, with specific interactions stabilizing the dimer interface (Ménez2008Crystal).

Post-translational modifications of KLK3 include glycosylation, which contributes to its structural heterogeneity (Ménez2008Crystal). KLK3 also exists in multiple isoforms due to splice variants, which result in differences in glycosylation and peptide bond cleavages (Mattsson2008Structural). These structural features are critical for KLK3's role in physiological processes and its function as a biomarker in prostate cancer.

## Function
KLK3, also known as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is a serine protease primarily produced by the prostate gland. In healthy human cells, KLK3 plays a crucial role in the male reproductive system, particularly in the liquefaction of semen. This process is essential for sperm motility and fertility, as KLK3 cleaves semenogelins, proteins that form a gel-like structure in semen, facilitating its liquefaction (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated; Yu2014Putative).

KLK3 is secreted into seminal fluid in its active form, where it degrades semenogelin I, II, and fibronectin, leading to semen liquefaction and enabling sperm mobility (Yu2014Putative). The enzyme is synthesized as a zymogen and requires proteolytic activation, which may occur in the prostate before ejaculation (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated). The activity of KLK3 is regulated by protease inhibitors, such as protein C inhibitor (PCI), although only a small fraction of KLK3 is inhibited by PCI (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated).

KLK3 also has potential roles in cell signaling and tissue remodeling, as it can cleave latent transforming growth factor-beta (hTGF-β) into its mature form, suggesting broader roles beyond reproductive physiology (Yu2014Putative).

## Clinical Significance
The KLK3 gene, encoding prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is clinically significant primarily in the context of prostate cancer. Alterations in KLK3 expression levels, often regulated by androgens and influenced by genetic polymorphisms, are used as biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis and monitoring (Lawrence2010Kallikreins). Elevated PSA levels in the serum can indicate the presence of prostate cancer, and specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the KLK3 gene have been associated with increased prostate cancer risk. For instance, the rs266882 SNP affects androgen receptor binding, leading to increased PSA levels and a higher risk of prostate cancer (Batra2012Genetic).

Other SNPs, such as rs2735839, have shown associations with PSA levels and prostate cancer risk, although the direct link to cancer is debated (Ahn2008Variation; Motamedi2019Kallikarein‐related). The rs61752561 SNP results in an amino acid substitution that affects PSA stability and function, potentially impacting PSA-based clinical assays (Srinivasan2019Prostate). Large deletions in the KLK3 gene can lead to very low PSA levels, complicating prostate cancer screening and diagnosis (Rodriguez2013Very). These genetic variations highlight the complex role of KLK3 in prostate cancer susceptibility and the challenges in using PSA as a reliable biomarker.

## Interactions
KLK3, also known as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function and regulation. KLK3 interacts with insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs), specifically degrading IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-4, which can increase the bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and promote cell proliferation in the prostate cancer microenvironment (Réhault2001Insulin‐like; Koistinen2008Development). This interaction is modulated by glycosaminoglycans such as heparin, which enhances KLK3's proteolytic activity towards IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-4 (Réhault2001Insulin‐like).

KLK3 also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) co-activator ARA70, enhancing AR transactivation and promoting cell growth in AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines (Mavridis2014Targeting). This interaction underscores KLK3's role in maintaining AR signaling, particularly in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (Mavridis2014Targeting).

In addition to protein interactions, KLK3 is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It is part of a complex network involving histone modifications, such as acetylation of histone H2A.Z, which facilitates AR recruitment to the KLK3 gene locus, promoting its expression (Ito2018MRGBP). These interactions highlight KLK3's multifaceted role in prostate cancer biology.
