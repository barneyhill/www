# AOC3

## Overview
The AOC3 gene encodes the enzyme amine oxidase copper containing 3, also known as vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1), which is a type II transmembrane protein primarily expressed in the vascular endothelium, smooth muscle cells, and adipocytes. This enzyme is categorized as a copper-containing amine oxidase and plays a crucial role in the oxidative deamination of primary amines, producing aldehydes, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide. These reactions are significant for regulating amine levels in tissues, particularly in inflamed areas, and are involved in processes such as leukocyte trafficking and inflammation (Smith1998Cloning; Jargaud2020Obesity). VAP-1's enzymatic activity is linked to metabolic processes, including glucose uptake and lipid metabolism, and it exhibits insulin-like effects, influencing body weight and fat deposition (Bour2007Adipogenesisrelated; Jargaud2020Obesity). The protein's interactions with leukocyte ligands, such as Siglec-9, further underscore its role in immune function and inflammation (Lopes2018Mapping; Elovaara2016Multivalent). Given its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, AOC3 is a significant focus of research in the context of inflammatory diseases, obesity, and atherosclerosis (Filip2022Increased; ÖZCAN2024Amine).

## Structure
The AOC3 gene encodes the enzyme amine oxidase copper containing 3, also known as vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1). This enzyme is a copper-containing amine oxidase that forms a homodimer, with each monomer having a molecular weight of approximately 94 kDa (Elovaara2011Identification). The protein structure includes three domains: D2, D3, and D4, which are typical of the amine oxidase fold (Elovaara2011Identification). The D4 domain is particularly important as it contains the active site, which is deeply buried and involves a topaquinone (TPQ) cofactor and a copper ion coordinated by three conserved histidine residues (Vakal2020Human).

The secondary structure of AOC3 includes multiple beta-strands and alpha-helices, with the D4 domain consisting of 25 beta-strands and seven alpha-helices (Airenne2005Crystal). The quaternary structure is a tight dimer, stabilized by long β-hairpin arms that contribute to ligand binding (Vakal2020Human).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, with six predicted N-linked glycosylation sites, which are crucial for the protein's enzymatic activity and stability (Finney2014Human). The glycosylation sites are confirmed through mutagenesis studies and X-ray crystallography (Airenne2005Crystal).

## Function
The AOC3 gene encodes vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1), a multifunctional enzyme involved in the oxidative deamination of primary amines, producing aldehydes, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide. This enzymatic activity is crucial for regulating amine levels in tissues, particularly in inflamed areas, and may influence lymphocyte homing and inflammation (Smith1998Cloning). VAP-1 is a type II transmembrane protein primarily expressed in the vascular endothelium, smooth muscle cells, and adipocytes, where it plays a significant role in leukocyte trafficking by facilitating the adhesion and transmigration of white blood cells across the endothelium (Jargaud2020Obesity).

In adipocytes, VAP-1/SSAO activity is linked to metabolic processes, including glucose uptake and lipid metabolism. It exhibits insulin-like effects, influencing triacylglycerol assembly and breakdown, and is involved in the regulation of body weight and fat deposition (Bour2007Adipogenesisrelated; Jargaud2020Obesity). The protein's activity is also associated with oxidative stress, as it generates reactive products like hydrogen peroxide, which can contribute to protein cross-linking and tissue remodeling (Jargaud2020Obesity). VAP-1's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and immune function.

## Clinical Significance
The AOC3 gene, encoding amine oxidase copper containing 3, is implicated in several diseases due to its role in leukocyte trafficking and inflammation. Alterations in AOC3 expression or function have been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and colorectal cancer (CRC). AOC3 knockout mice exhibit increased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis and develop more colonic tumors, particularly invasive adenocarcinomas, suggesting a protective role of AOC3 against these conditions (ÖZCAN2024Amine).

In pulmonary fibrosis, AOC3 is expressed in myofibroblasts and contributes to fibrotic lung diseases by supporting inflammatory cell accumulation and myofibroblast differentiation. AOC3-deficient mice show reduced fibrosis, indicating its significant role in lung fibrosis pathogenesis (Marttila‐Ichihara2017Amine).

AOC3 is also involved in obesity and cholesterol metabolism. Mice lacking AOC3 or expressing a mutated form of the gene exhibit increased adiposity and altered cholesterol profiles, suggesting that AOC3 influences fat storage and inflammation (Jargaud2020Obesity).

In atherosclerosis, AOC3 is associated with increased plaque development and vascular smooth muscle cell dedifferentiation. Its expression is linked to inflammation and foam cell presence in atherosclerotic lesions, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Filip2022Increased).

## Interactions
The human gene AOC3 encodes the enzyme amine oxidase copper containing 3, also known as vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1). AOC3 is involved in interactions with the leukocyte ligand Siglec-9, which plays a role in leukocyte trafficking during inflammation. The interaction between AOC3 and Siglec-9 is characterized by the binding of the Siglec-9 peptide to the active site of AOC3, forming extensive intermolecular interactions with specific residues and glycans on AOC3. This binding enhances the amine oxidase activity of AOC3 towards substrates like benzylamine (Lopes2018Mapping).

The interaction involves specific residues in the Siglec-9 peptide, such as R3 and R9, which interact with the catalytic region and a pocket formed by the N2 glycan on AOC3, respectively (Lopes2018Mapping). The V and C2 domains of Siglec-9 are crucial for binding, with the V domain interacting with sialic acids on AOC3 and the C2 domain modulating enzymatic activity (Elovaara2016Multivalent). Mutations in Siglec-9, such as R284S and R290S, have been shown to enhance binding to AOC3, indicating the importance of these residues in the interaction (Elovaara2016Multivalent). These interactions do not involve nucleic acids (Elovaara2016Multivalent).
