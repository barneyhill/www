# DUSP26

## Overview
DUSP26, or dual specificity phosphatase 26, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the dual-specificity phosphatase family, which is involved in the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways. The protein, also named DUSP26, is characterized by its ability to dephosphorylate both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues, thereby modulating key signaling molecules such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), Akt kinase, and the tumor suppressor p53. This phosphatase plays a significant role in cellular processes including cell growth, stress response, and apoptosis, and is predominantly localized in the nucleus with some presence in the cytoplasm. DUSP26 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, indicating its tissue-specific functions. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as Heat shock transcription factor 4 isoform B (HSF4b) and SCRIB, further influence its regulatory roles in signaling pathways. DUSP26's involvement in both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive activities, as well as its association with non-cancerous conditions, highlights its complex and context-dependent functions in human health and disease (Thompson2021A; Panni2017DUSP26).

## Structure
DUSP26 is a dual-specificity phosphatase consisting of 211 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 23.945 kDa (Panni2017DUSP26). The protein is structured with a non-catalytic N-terminal domain (NTD) spanning residues 1-60 and a catalytic C-terminal domain (CTD) from residues 61-211 (Thompson2021A). The CTD contains a conserved HCX5R motif and an AYLM motif, typical of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (MKPs) (Thompson2021A).

The secondary structure of DUSP26 includes a central twisted five-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices, forming a shallow catalytic site pocket (Won2016Structural; Panni2017DUSP26). The N-terminal region, particularly residues 39-60, plays a critical role in stabilizing the PTP-loop conformation, enhancing catalytic activity (Won2016Structural). The tertiary structure of DUSP26-N (C152S) reveals a three-helix bundle on one side of the β-sheet and a four-helix bundle on the other, with the N-terminal α1-helix forming a dimeric interface (Won2016Structural).

DUSP26 exists as a mixture of monomer and dimer in solution, with dimerization potentially influenced by interactions with binding partners (Thompson2021A). The protein has three splice variant isoforms, with the longest isoform comprising four exons (Panni2017DUSP26). DUSP26 is localized predominantly in the nucleus, with weak cytoplasmic staining (Thompson2021A).

## Function
DUSP26, also known as dual specificity phosphatase 26, is an enzyme that plays a role in regulating intracellular signaling pathways, particularly the MAP kinase (MAPK) cascades, which are crucial for various physiological processes (Thompson2021A). It dephosphorylates both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues, influencing proteins such as MAPKs, Akt kinase, and the tumor suppressor p53 (Panni2017DUSP26). DUSP26 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates signaling pathways involved in cell growth, stress responses, and apoptosis (Thompson2021A).

In healthy human cells, DUSP26 is expressed in tissues such as the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, suggesting a tissue-specific function (Thompson2021A). It interacts with proteins like Heat shock transcription factor 4 isoform B (HSF4b) and SCRIB, which influence its function by facilitating the dephosphorylation of ERK, a key component of the MAPK pathway (Thompson2021A). These interactions suggest that DUSP26 may play a role in cell signaling pathways and potentially in tumor suppression, although its exact functions in healthy cells remain complex and context-dependent (Thompson2021A).

## Clinical Significance
DUSP26 is implicated in various cancers and conditions through mutations, expression level changes, or interaction alterations. In neuroblastoma, DUSP26 is overexpressed, contributing to chemoresistance by inhibiting apoptosis through p53 dephosphorylation. Knockdown of DUSP26 in neuroblastoma enhances apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Thompson2021A; Panni2017DUSP26). In anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), DUSP26 is overexpressed and promotes tumor growth by inhibiting p38 MAPK-mediated apoptosis, highlighting its oncogenic role (Yu2006A).

Conversely, DUSP26 downregulation is observed in ovarian cancer, medulloblastoma, and glioblastoma, where it may act as a tumor suppressor. In glioblastoma, reduced DUSP26 expression is linked to higher-grade tumors and decreased survival probability (Thompson2021A; Panni2017DUSP26). In ovarian cancer, DUSP26 deletion correlates with increased resistance to decitabine (Thompson2021A).

DUSP26 is also involved in non-cancerous conditions. In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, DUSP26 is linked to lipid metabolism and insulin resistance, with knockout mice showing increased lipid accumulation (Thompson2021A). In Alzheimer's disease, DUSP26 is overexpressed in the hippocampus and involved in amyloid-β protein generation (Thompson2021A). These diverse roles underscore the complexity of DUSP26's involvement in human diseases.

## Interactions
DUSP26 interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It binds to the Scribble PDZ-4 domain, with the interaction mediated by an unconventional ligand. This binding involves specific residues within DUSP26, notably the tyrosine residue Y166, which is crucial for the interaction. Mutations in this residue significantly reduce binding affinity (Gallo2022An). DUSP26 also interacts with adenylate kinase 2 (AK2), which enhances its phosphatase activity. This interaction is particularly important for the dephosphorylation of FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain), a process that is crucial for regulating cell growth and apoptosis (Kim2014The).

DUSP26 is involved in the dephosphorylation of ERK, a process facilitated by its interaction with SCRIB, an adaptor protein. SCRIB acts as a molecular bridge, directing DUSP26's phosphatase activity towards ERK, thereby modulating ERK signaling pathways (Sacco2014Combining). In neuroblastoma cells, DUSP26 interacts with proteins such as N-cadherin and β-catenin, enhancing cell-cell adhesion and influencing cellular transport mechanisms (Thompson2021A). These interactions highlight DUSP26's role in various cellular processes, including protein transport, phosphorylation regulation, and cell adhesion.
