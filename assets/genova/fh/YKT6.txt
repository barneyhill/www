# YKT6

## Overview
YKT6 is a gene that encodes the YKT6 v-SNARE homolog, a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein involved in intracellular membrane trafficking. The YKT6 protein is unique among SNAREs due to its ability to exist in both a soluble cytosolic form and a membrane-bound form, facilitated by lipid modifications such as farnesylation and palmitoylation. These modifications allow YKT6 to participate in various membrane fusion events, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport, intra-Golgi transport, and endosome-vacuole fusion. The protein's structure is characterized by a longin domain and a coiled-coil domain, which are crucial for its function in SNARE complex assembly and membrane fusion. YKT6 plays a significant role in maintaining lysosomal function and protein trafficking, impacting cellular homeostasis and stress response. Its dysregulation has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and cancers, highlighting its importance as a potential therapeutic target (Zhang2024Comprehensive; Daste2015Structure; Cuddy2019Stress-Induced; Fukasawa2004Localization).

## Structure
YKT6 is a member of the SNARE protein family, characterized by a longin domain and a coiled-coil domain. The longin domain is an α-β-α sandwich architecture, consisting of five antiparallel β-strands and three α-helices, which is crucial for regulating the assembly of the trans-SNARE complex and membrane fusion (Daste2015Structure). The coiled-coil domain of YKT6 consists of four α-helices and one β-sheet that wrap around the longin domain, interacting through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Daste2015Structure).

YKT6 lacks a transmembrane domain, which is typical for SNARE proteins, and instead uses lipid modifications for membrane association. It undergoes post-translational modifications such as farnesylation and palmitoylation. Farnesylation stabilizes the closed conformation of YKT6 by preventing membrane insertion, while palmitoylation is reversible and facilitates membrane anchorage, leading to an open, active conformation (Kriegenburg2019The; Daste2015Structure).

The protein can exist in a soluble cytosolic form or be targeted to membranes through lipid anchors. The longin domain also plays a role in intracellular trafficking and may act as an 'on/off' switch for fusogenic activity (Daste2015Structure).

## Function
YKT6 is a SNARE protein involved in various intracellular trafficking processes, playing a crucial role in membrane fusion events. It is unique among SNARE proteins due to its ability to exist in both an inactive cytosolic form and an active membrane-bound form, facilitated by lipid modifications such as farnesylation and palmitoylation (Fukasawa2004Localization). YKT6 is involved in multiple transport steps, including ER to Golgi transport, intra-Golgi transport, and endosome-vacuole fusion (McNew1997Ykt6p; Gordon2017VAMP3Syb).

In healthy human cells, YKT6 is essential for maintaining lysosomal function and protein trafficking, which are critical for cellular homeostasis and stress response (Cuddy2019Stress-Induced). It plays a role in the regulation of epithelial adherens and tight junctions, impacting cell polarity and barrier functions (Naydenov2018A). YKT6 is also involved in the late secretory pathway, forming specific SNARE complexes necessary for vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane (Gordon2017VAMP3Syb).

The protein's activity is regulated by its conformational state, which influences its interaction with lipids and membranes, thereby controlling its localization and function in SNARE-mediated membrane fusion processes (Wen2010LipidInduced).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the YKT6 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, YKT6 plays a crucial role in lysosomal function and protein homeostasis. Its dysregulation is associated with the accumulation of misfolded proteins, such as α-synuclein, which is characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Enhancing YKT6 activity through farnesyltransferase inhibitors has been shown to improve lysosomal function and reduce α-synuclein levels in PD models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cuddy2019Stress-Induced).

In cancer, YKT6 is overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and is associated with poor prognosis, advanced clinical stages, and smoking history. Its expression correlates with overall survival and recurrence-free survival, making it a potential prognostic and diagnostic biomarker. YKT6 influences cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and its knockdown has been shown to inhibit these processes while promoting apoptosis (Zhang2024Comprehensive). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), YKT6 is targeted by miR-584-5p, which inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion, highlighting its role in smoking-related carcinogenesis (Lee2021Tumor).

## Interactions
YKT6 is a versatile SNARE protein involved in various protein interactions essential for membrane fusion processes. In yeast, YKT6 forms complexes with SNARE proteins such as Vam3, Vam7, and Vti1, which are crucial for autophagosome-vacuole fusion (Kriegenburg2019The). It also interacts with Sed5p, Sec22p, Bet1p, Bos1p, Sft1p, and Gos1p at the cis-Golgi, participating in retrograde transport and vesicle fusion (Dilcher2001Genetic; Kweon2003Ykt6p). 

In mammals, YKT6 is part of a secondary SNARE complex with STX7 and SNAP29, which operates alongside the primary complex of STX17, SNAP29, and VAMP8, facilitating autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Matsui2018Autophagosomal). YKT6's interaction with SNAP29 and STX7 is enhanced by SNAP29, indicating a complex interplay in the autophagy pathway (Kriegenburg2019The). 

YKT6's conformational state, influenced by lipidation and phosphorylation, affects its binding capacity to other SNAREs like Bet1, but not to Sec22b or syntaxin 4, highlighting its specificity in SNARE complex formation (Wen2010LipidInduced). These interactions underscore YKT6's critical role in vesicular trafficking and membrane fusion.
