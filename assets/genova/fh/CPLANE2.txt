# CPLANE2

## Overview
CPLANE2 is a gene that encodes the protein known as ciliogenesis and planar polarity effector complex subunit 2, which plays a pivotal role in the formation and function of primary cilia. This protein is a key component of the CPLANE complex, which is essential for ciliogenesis and the maintenance of planar cell polarity. The CPLANE2 protein is involved in critical cellular signaling pathways, including Wnt, FGF, and hedgehog, which are vital for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. As a structural protein, it is active in the basal body and ciliary axoneme, contributing to the proper orientation and function of cilia. Disruptions in CPLANE2 can lead to ciliopathies, a group of disorders characterized by defects in ciliary structure or function, underscoring its importance in normal cellular and developmental processes (Singh2024Biallelic).

## Function
CPLANE2, also known as ciliogenesis and planar polarity effector complex subunit 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the formation and function of primary cilia, which are essential for various cellular signaling pathways and developmental processes. The protein is a component of the CPLANE complex, which includes other proteins such as INTU, FUZ, and WDPCP. This complex is crucial for ciliogenesis, the process by which cilia are formed, and for maintaining planar cell polarity, which is the coordinated orientation of cells within the plane of a tissue (Singh2024Biallelic).

CPLANE2 is active in the basal body and ciliary axoneme, structures that are integral to the proper orientation and function of cilia. These hair-like structures on cell surfaces play significant roles in signaling pathways, such as Wnt, FGF, and hedgehog, which are vital for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis (Singh2024Biallelic). The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in ensuring normal cellular function and organismal development. Disruptions in the function of CPLANE2 can lead to defects in ciliary signaling, which may result in developmental disorders and diseases related to ciliopathies.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation in the CPLANE2 gene are associated with a group of disorders known as ciliopathies, which are characterized by defects in the structure or function of cilia. These conditions can lead to significant developmental disorders affecting multiple organ systems. Notably, CPLANE2 has been linked to Joubert syndrome and Meckel-Gruber syndrome. Joubert syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the cerebellum, leading to symptoms such as ataxia, hypotonia, and developmental delays. Meckel-Gruber syndrome is a more severe condition, often resulting in perinatal lethality, and is characterized by renal cystic dysplasia, polydactyly, and central nervous system malformations. The role of CPLANE2 in ciliogenesis and planar cell polarity is crucial for normal cellular function, and its disruption can lead to the aforementioned syndromes, highlighting its clinical significance in human health.
