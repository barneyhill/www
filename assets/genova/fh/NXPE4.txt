# NXPE4

## Overview
The NXPE4 gene encodes the protein neurexophilin and PC-esterase domain family member 4, which is part of a family of proteins involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its involvement in the gut-brain-microbiota axis and has been studied for its potential roles in several diseases, including colorectal cancer and Hirschsprung disease. The protein encoded by NXPE4 is implicated in cellular interactions and signaling pathways that may influence disease progression and prognosis, particularly in gastrointestinal and hematological contexts (Duek2018Exploring; Kumari2021Prognostic; Jiang2020Deviation). Despite its associations with these conditions, the specific biological functions and mechanisms of action of the NXPE4 protein remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to clarify its role in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
The NXPE4 gene has been implicated in several diseases, particularly those affecting the colon. It has a significant rare mutation burden in patients with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), although its exact role in this condition is not fully understood (Jiang2020Deviation). NXPE4 is also associated with colorectal cancer and ulcerative colitis, with high expression levels linked to improved prognosis in colorectal cancer, especially regarding overall survival (Jiang2020Deviation). 

In the context of the gut-brain-microbiota axis, NXPE4 shows increased expression in the gut of mice exposed to intestinal bacteria and in models of multiple intestinal neoplasia, suggesting a potential role in gut-related conditions (Duek2018Exploring). However, the clinical significance of NXPE4 gene mutations or expression alterations in these contexts remains to be fully elucidated (Duek2018Exploring).

In multiple myeloma, NXPE4 was identified as having a potential role in disease prognosis in a validation dataset, though it was not highlighted as prognostic in the primary dataset, indicating the need for further investigation (Kumari2021Prognostic). Overall, while NXPE4 is associated with various conditions, its precise clinical implications require additional research.
