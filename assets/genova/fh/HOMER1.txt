# HOMER1

## Overview
HOMER1 is a gene that encodes the homer scaffold protein 1, a crucial component in the regulation of synaptic signaling and plasticity within the central nervous system. This protein belongs to the family of scaffold proteins, characterized by its ability to form complexes with other proteins, thereby facilitating intracellular signaling pathways. The protein is predominantly located in the postsynaptic density of neurons, where it interacts with various synaptic proteins, including metabotropic glutamate receptors and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors, to modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity (Tu1998Homer; Clifton2019Regulation). HOMER1 exists in multiple isoforms, with the long isoforms, such as Homer1b/c, playing a role in multimerization and synaptic complex formation, while the short isoform, Homer1a, acts as a dominant-negative regulator, influencing synaptic strength and plasticity (Reshetnikov2021The; Clifton2019Regulation). Alterations in HOMER1 expression and function have been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and depression, highlighting its significance in maintaining synaptic integrity and function (Spellmann2011Homer1; Luo2012Scaffold).

## Structure
HOMER1, a member of the Homer protein family, is characterized by a basic structure that includes an EVH1 domain and a coiled-coil tail. The EVH1 domain serves as a ligand-binding site for the PPXXF motif, facilitating interactions with various proteins such as metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) and ankyrin-G (Yoon2021Homer1; Stillman2022Activity). The coiled-coil tail allows for tetramerization, forming an X-shaped complex with four exposed EVH1 domains (Stillman2022Activity).

HOMER1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by CamKII at SER117, which reduces its binding affinity to mGlu5 (Stillman2022Activity). The protein exists in multiple isoforms, such as Homer1a, which lacks the coiled-coil domain and acts in a dominant-negative manner to release binding partners from the scaffold (Stillman2022Activity).

The protein's structure supports its role in synaptic signaling and plasticity, with its ability to form a scaffold with Shank proteins and coordinate glutamate receptor activity (Stillman2022Activity). The interaction with ankyrin-G is crucial for regulating dendritic spine morphology and maintaining synaptic proteome homeostasis (Yoon2021Homer1).

## Function
HOMER1, a scaffold protein, plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity and signaling in neurons. It is primarily active in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of neurons, where it interacts with various synaptic proteins to facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes. The HOMER1 gene produces both long and short isoforms through alternative splicing. Long isoforms, such as Homer1b/c, contain a coiled-coil domain that allows them to form multimers and link postsynaptic density proteins, facilitating signal transduction (Hayashi2006Tetrameric; Clifton2019Regulation).

Short isoforms, like Homer1a, lack the coiled-coil domain and act as dominant negative regulators, disrupting the function of long Homers by preventing their interaction with target proteins. Homer1a is induced by neuronal activity and is involved in the trafficking of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) to the cell surface, which is crucial for synaptic plasticity (Clifton2019Regulation). It modulates synaptic strength by affecting the trafficking and phosphorylation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic membrane (Clifton2019Regulation).

Homer1a also plays a role in calcium signaling by enhancing neuronal excitability and increasing calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), which is vital for synaptic plasticity (Clifton2019Regulation). These processes are essential for learning and memory, as they influence synaptic strength and plasticity (Clifton2019Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the HOMER1 gene are implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In Alzheimer's disease, the accumulation of amyloid beta protein disrupts Homer 1b/c synaptic clusters, affecting synaptic structure and function. Reduced expression of Homer 1a is linked to neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer's, as it is suggested to regulate amyloid beta toxicity (Luo2012Scaffold).

In schizophrenia, polymorphisms in the HOMER1 gene are associated with the disorder, and Homer1-knockout mice exhibit schizophrenia-like behaviors. These behaviors can be reversed by expressing Homer 1a or Homer 1b/c, and antipsychotic drugs modulate the expression of these isoforms (Spellmann2011Homer1; Luo2012Scaffold). The rs2290639 polymorphism is notably linked to baseline psychopathology and treatment response in schizophrenia (Spellmann2011Homer1).

HOMER1 is also involved in stress susceptibility and depression. Changes in its expression, particularly the Homer1a isoform, are linked to stress-induced alterations in synaptic plasticity and are associated with depression and other mental disorders (Reshetnikov2021The). Antidepressant treatments have been shown to increase Homer1a levels, suggesting its role in mediating antidepressant effects (Serchov2016Signaling). 

In bipolar disorder, the rs7713917 variant of HOMER1 is associated with structural and functional brain changes, influencing treatment response (Benedetti2018A).

## Interactions
HOMER1 (homer scaffold protein 1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for synaptic signaling and plasticity. It binds to group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1a and mGluR5) through its EVH1 domain, facilitating the formation of complexes with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and Shank proteins (Tu1999Coupling; Tu1998Homer). These interactions are essential for linking mGluRs to intracellular calcium signaling pathways (Luo2012Scaffold).

HOMER1 can form homo- and heterodimers with other Homer family members, which is significant for its function in cross-linking proteins (Tu1998Homer). The long isoforms, HOMER1b and HOMER1c, contain a coiled-coil domain that allows them to multimerize and interact with other proteins, such as syntaxin-13 and TRPC channels, contributing to synaptic transmission regulation (ShiraishiYamaguchi2007TheHomerfamilyproteins; Luo2012Scaffold).

HOMER1a, a short isoform, acts as a dominant-negative regulator by disrupting the complexes formed by HOMER1b/c, affecting calcium signaling and synaptic plasticity (Reshetnikov2021The; Luo2012Scaffold). This isoform competes with HOMER1b/c for binding to mGluRs, leading to the dissociation of protein complexes and modulation of synaptic signaling pathways (Reshetnikov2021The).
