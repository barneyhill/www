# EVI5L

## Overview
EVI5L, or ecotropic viral integration site 5 like, is a gene that encodes a Rab GTPase-activating protein (RabGAP) involved in various cellular processes, including ciliogenesis and intracellular signaling. The protein encoded by EVI5L plays a critical role in modulating the number of cells with primary cilia, which are essential for proper cellular signaling and development. It functions downstream of TGIF1 and TGIF2, which regulate its expression to maintain normal cilium numbers and ensure the correct activation of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, a key pathway in developmental biology (Anderson2017Tgif1). EVI5L shares significant sequence identity with EVI5, a protein known for its involvement in cell cycle regulation and membrane trafficking, suggesting a potential role in cell proliferation and differentiation (Lu2023Identification). The gene has also been implicated in various diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary hypertension and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Lu2023Identification; Patel2013Identification).

## Function
EVI5L encodes a RabGAP protein involved in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, by modulating the number of cells with primary cilia. In healthy cells, EVI5L functions downstream of TGIF1 and TGIF2, which repress its expression to maintain normal cilium numbers and proper activation of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, crucial for various developmental processes (Anderson2017Tgif1). EVI5L is a direct target of TGIF proteins, and its overexpression can lead to defects in ciliogenesis, affecting cellular signaling and function (Anderson2017Tgif1).

EVI5L is also involved in intracellular signaling and may play a role in modulating cell proliferation and differentiation. It shares about 70% identity with EVI5, a protein known for its regulatory roles in cell cycle progression, cytokinesis, and cell membrane trafficking (Lu2023Identification). The protein is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it may influence cellular homeostasis and organismal development. The exact functions of EVI5L beyond its role in ciliogenesis and potential regulation of Rab23 remain to be fully elucidated (Anderson2017Tgif1).

## Clinical Significance
EVI5L has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In the context of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (IPAH) with metabolic syndrome (MS), EVI5L has been identified as a potential diagnostic biomarker. The gene is part of a group of 11 genes with high diagnostic value for IPAH and MS, as determined through bioinformatics and machine learning approaches. EVI5L was among the top genes with the highest area under the curve (AUC) values, indicating its strong diagnostic potential (Lu2023Identification).

In mouse models, increased expression of EVI5L has been associated with defects in ciliogenesis, which can lead to conditions such as holoprosencephaly and left-right asymmetry defects. These phenotypes are linked to the regulation of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, suggesting that EVI5L plays a role in ciliary function and related developmental processes (Anderson2017Tgif1).

Additionally, EVI5L expression is upregulated in horn cancer in Zebu cattle, suggesting a potential role in oncogenic processes. Its structural similarity to the EVI5 oncogene implies that EVI5L may influence cell proliferation, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Patel2013Identification).
