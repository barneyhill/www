# GPD1

## Overview
The GPD1 gene encodes the enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1, a crucial component in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as an oxidoreductase and is responsible for the NADH-dependent reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol-3-phosphate, a key step in glycolysis and lipid biosynthesis. Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 is a dimeric protein that operates in the cytosol and plays a significant role in the glycerol phosphate shuttle, facilitating the transfer of reducing equivalents from the cytosol to the mitochondria, thereby impacting cellular energy production and redox balance. The enzyme's activity is regulated by metal ions such as zinc, which can inhibit its function in a pH-dependent manner. Mutations in the GPD1 gene are linked to metabolic disorders, including transient infantile hypertriglyceridemia, highlighting its clinical significance (Ou2006Crystal; Lin2021Case; Dionisi‐Vici2016Expanding).

## Structure
The human glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPD1) enzyme is a dimeric protein crucial for lipid biosynthesis, catalyzing the NADH-dependent reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol-3-phosphate. The enzyme's structure includes a flexible loop (292-LNGQKL-297) that undergoes a ligand-gated conformational change, transitioning from an inactive open form to a catalytically active closed form. This loop closure is essential for sequestering the active site from solvent and correctly positioning catalytic residues (Mhashal2020Modeling).

The enzyme's active site features highly conserved amino acid side chains, such as R269 and N270, which interact with the substrate phosphodianion. The side chain of R269 is particularly important, interacting with both the substrate and the Q295 side chain on the catalytic loop, playing a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and catalytic efficiency of the enzyme (Cristobal2020The; Mhashal2020Modeling).

GPD1's structure includes an NAD+-binding domain and a catalytic domain, with the enzyme forming a homodimer. The enzyme's conformational stability and catalytic function are influenced by specific residues, such as K204, which is part of a hydrogen-bonded network crucial for enzyme activity (Pallapati2021Lysine245).

## Function
The GPD1 gene encodes the enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1, which plays a crucial role in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and NADH to L-a-glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) and NAD+, a key step in the glycolysis pathway (Ou2006Crystal; Joshi2014A). This reaction is essential for maintaining the balance of DHAP and preventing its accumulation, which could lead to the formation of toxic compounds (Ou2006Crystal).

GPD1 is active in the cytosol and is involved in the glycerol phosphate shuttle, which is important for transferring reducing equivalents from the cytosol to the mitochondria. This process is significant for energy production and lipid biosynthesis, as it facilitates the re-oxidation of NADH to NAD+, which is then reused in glycolysis (Ou2006Crystal; Gao2010Molecular). The enzyme works in conjunction with mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase to regulate the flow of carbon sources and reducing equivalents into mitochondria, impacting cellular redox balance and metabolic homeostasis (Ou2006Crystal).

The activity of GPD1 is known to be inhibited by zinc and sulfate ions, with zinc showing a strong and reversible inhibition that is pH-dependent (Ou2006Crystal). This regulation by metal ions is relevant for understanding its role in healthy human cells (Ou2006Crystal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GPD1 gene, which encodes glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1, are associated with several metabolic disorders. One of the primary conditions linked to GPD1 mutations is transient infantile hypertriglyceridemia (HTGTI), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by early-onset hypertriglyceridemia, elevated liver enzymes, hepatomegaly, hepatic steatosis, and fibrosis. The disorder manifests in infancy and is generally nonprogressive, with triglyceride levels often normalizing with age (Lin2021Case; Li2018A; Polchar2022Case).

GPD1 mutations can lead to increased triglyceride synthesis and secretion, potentially due to increased availability of hepatic glycerol-3-phosphate for triglyceride synthesis (Lin2021Case). Despite the risk of hypertriglyceridemia for coronary disease and acute pancreatitis, affected individuals typically have a good medium-term prognosis (Lin2021Case).

The phenotypic spectrum of GPD1 deficiency is broad, with some patients experiencing poor weight gain, while others may present with obesity and insulin resistance (Polchar2022Case). The variability in clinical presentation underscores the complexity of the disorder and the need for further research to fully understand the mechanisms involved (Dionisi‐Vici2016Expanding).

## Interactions
GPD1, or glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function and localization. GPD1 can form homodimers, which is essential for its interaction with the nicotinamidase Pnc1. This interaction facilitates the piggy-back import of Pnc1 into peroxisomes, a process dependent on GPD1's ability to dimerize. Mutations that disrupt GPD1 dimerization, such as R270E, prevent this co-import, while suppressor mutations that restore dimerization can also restore Pnc1 import (Saryi2017Pnc1).

GPD1 also interacts with the cytosolic PTS2 receptor Pex7 and its coreceptor Pex21, which are necessary for its import into peroxisomes. However, Pnc1 does not interact with these proteins directly, indicating that its import is solely reliant on its interaction with GPD1 (Saryi2017Pnc1).

In the context of cellular stress responses, GPD1 expression is regulated by the HOG MAPK pathway, which involves interactions with transcription factors such as Hot1p and Rap1p. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of glycerol synthesis in response to osmotic stress (Lin2002Phospholipase).
