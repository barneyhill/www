# ZNF552

## Overview
ZNF552 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 552, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its role as a transcriptional repressor. The protein is composed of 407 amino acids and features a KRAB domain at the amino terminus and seven C2H2 zinc finger motifs at the carboxyl terminus, which are essential for its DNA-binding capabilities and transcriptional repression functions (Deng2010ZNF552). ZNF552 is expressed in various human tissues, with particularly high expression in the lung and testis, and plays a significant role in inhibiting transcriptional activities mediated by AP-1 and SRE, components of the MAPK signaling pathways (Deng2010ZNF552). Through these interactions, ZNF552 contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cellular processes, potentially influencing developmental pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Deng2010ZNF552).

## Structure
The ZNF552 protein is a novel C2H2 zinc finger protein composed of 407 amino acids, with a theoretical molecular mass of 46 kDa (Deng2010ZNF552). Its primary structure includes an amino-terminal KRAB domain and seven carboxyl-terminal C2H2 zinc finger motifs (Deng2010ZNF552). The KRAB domain, spanning amino acids 14-67, consists of about 41 amino acid residues and is crucial for transcriptional repression, interacting with TIF1h (Deng2010ZNF552). The C2H2 zinc finger motifs are located at the C-terminal portion, each conforming to a consensus sequence with conserved cysteine and histidine residues that bind zinc ions, suggesting a role in DNA binding (Deng2010ZNF552).

The secondary structure likely involves the formation of alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of zinc finger proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure is stabilized by zinc ions, which are essential for maintaining the protein's conformation. There is no information on quaternary structure or post-translational modifications in the provided context. ZNF552 is expressed in various human tissues, with higher levels in the lung and testis, and functions as a transcriptional repressor, particularly inhibiting AP-1 and SRE-mediated transcriptional activities (Deng2010ZNF552).

## Function
ZNF552 is a transcriptional repressor involved in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It functions by inhibiting the transcriptional activities of AP-1 and SRE, which are crucial components of the MAPK signaling pathways. This repression is primarily mediated through its KRAB domain, which significantly reduces AP-1-luciferase activity by approximately 72% and SRE transcription by 58% (Deng2010ZNF552). The KRAB domain, along with the C2H2 zinc finger motifs, facilitates DNA binding and protein-protein interactions necessary for its repressive function (Deng2010ZNF552).

ZNF552 is expressed in various adult tissues, with higher levels in the lung and testis, and moderate expression in the liver, spleen, and kidney. In embryonic tissues, it is expressed in all tested tissues, with notable expression in the heart and testis, suggesting a potential role in early heart development (Deng2010ZNF552). The protein predominantly localizes in the nuclei of cells, where it interacts with other molecular components to modulate gene expression (Deng2010ZNF552). Through these activities, ZNF552 plays a role in transcriptional repression, contributing to the regulation of cellular processes and development.

## Interactions
ZNF552 is a KRAB/C2H2 zinc finger protein that primarily functions as a transcriptional repressor. It interacts with DNA to inhibit transcriptional activities mediated by AP-1 and SRE, which are components of the MAPK signaling pathways (Deng2010ZNF552). The KRAB domain of ZNF552, located at amino acids 14-67, is crucial for its role in transcriptional repression, likely through protein-protein interactions (Deng2010ZNF552). This domain is known for facilitating interactions that lead to transcriptional repression in other zinc finger proteins as well.

The study suggests that ZNF552 may participate in transcriptional repression by interacting with proteins or nucleic acids involved in the MAPK signaling pathway (Deng2010ZNF552). The protein's ability to suppress AP-1 and SRE-mediated transcriptional activation indicates that it may form complexes with other proteins or directly bind to DNA to exert its repressive effects (Deng2010ZNF552). These interactions are essential for its function as a negative transcriptional regulator, impacting gene expression in various tissues where ZNF552 is expressed (Deng2010ZNF552).
