# EFR3A

## Overview
EFR3A is a gene that encodes the EFR3 homolog A protein, which is a crucial component in phosphoinositide metabolism and cellular signaling. The EFR3A protein functions as an adapter protein, primarily involved in recruiting phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase alpha (PI4KA) to the plasma membrane, thereby playing a significant role in maintaining phosphoinositide levels, such as phosphoinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) (Trybus2023EFR3A:). This protein is characterized by its α-helical structure and contains domains that facilitate its anchoring to the plasma membrane and interactions with other proteins (Adhikari2021Oncogenic). EFR3A is implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and membrane organization, and has been associated with both neurological disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, and cancer, particularly through its interactions with oncogenic KRAS (Gupta2014Rare; Adhikari2021Oncogenic).

## Structure
The EFR3A protein is an adapter protein involved in phosphoinositide metabolism and signaling, primarily through its role in recruiting PI4KA kinase to the plasma membrane (Trybus2023EFR3A:). The protein consists of 821 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 92.9 kDa (Trybus2023EFR3A:). The yeast homolog, EFR3N, provides structural insights, revealing an α-helical structure with a loop region between residues 217 and 232, forming a rod-like shape composed of 27 short α-helices (Trybus2023EFR3A:). The N-terminus of EFR3A includes a Vps27p, Hrs, STAM (VHS) domain, a 153 amino acid motif involved in tyrosine kinase receptor signaling (Trybus2023EFR3A:).

EFR3A contains an N-terminal cysteine-rich region with palmitoylation sites, crucial for plasma membrane anchoring, followed by armadillo-like repeats that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Adhikari2021Oncogenic). The protein is part of a complex with PI4KA and other proteins, such as FAM126A and TTC7A/B, which stabilize PI4KA at the plasma membrane (Adhikari2021Oncogenic). The protein's structure and interactions suggest a scaffold function, with a significant portion comprising alpha-helical HEAT repeats (Gupta2014Rare).

## Function
The EFR3A gene encodes a membrane-localized protein that plays a critical role in maintaining the levels of phosphoinositides, specifically phosphoinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) and PI 4,5 P, at the plasma membrane. These phosphoinositides are involved in various cellular functions, including signal transduction, exocytosis, endocytosis, and the regulation of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors (Hu2017Efr3a). EFR3A is essential for the proper localization and function of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4KA), which is crucial for the synthesis of PI4P. This process supports the spatial organization of proteins like KRAS at the plasma membrane, which is vital for effective signaling pathways (Adhikari2021Oncogenic).

In mammalian cells, EFR3A is important for controlling G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signaling by influencing GPCR phosphorylation (Hu2017Efr3a). The protein is primarily active at the plasma membrane, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis and various signaling pathways. EFR3A's role in maintaining the plasma membrane's lipid composition is essential for the recruitment and function of signaling molecules, thereby influencing cellular processes and organismal outcomes (Adhikari2021Oncogenic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EFR3A gene have been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Studies have identified rare deleterious mutations in EFR3A that are more prevalent in individuals with ASD compared to controls, suggesting a potential link between these mutations and the disorder (Gupta2014Rare). These mutations are often found at conserved positions within the gene, indicating their potential impact on protein function (Gupta2014Rare). EFR3A is involved in synaptic phosphoinositide metabolism, which is crucial for synaptic function and neuronal development, processes that are often disrupted in ASD (Gupta2014Rare).

In addition to its role in ASD, EFR3A has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. EFR3A gene amplification is associated with reduced survival and disease progression in patients with this cancer type. The gene's interaction with oncogenic KRAS signaling is critical for tumorigenic activity, and alterations in EFR3A can affect KRAS localization and clustering at the plasma membrane, impacting its oncogenic functions (Adhikari2021Oncogenic). These findings suggest that EFR3A plays a significant role in both neurological disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
EFR3A is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with flotillin-2, a protein associated with membrane raft organization, suggesting a role in stabilizing protein-lipid complexes and affecting EGFR-dependent cellular processes (Trybus2023EFR3A:). EFR3A also binds to active KRAS, particularly the oncogenic KRAS G12V and G12D mutants, facilitating KRAS localization to the plasma membrane, which is essential for its signaling functions (Adhikari2021Oncogenic). This interaction is crucial for maintaining KRAS's nanoclustering and oncogenic activity, as EFR3A recruits PI4KA to the plasma membrane, affecting the levels of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (Adhikari2021Oncogenic).

EFR3A forms a complex with PI4KA, FAM126A, and TTC7A or TTC7B, which stabilizes PI4KA at the plasma membrane, crucial for phosphoinositide signaling (Adhikari2021Oncogenic). The interaction with PI4KA is part of a positive-feedback circuit that enhances KRAS signaling and tumorigenesis (Adhikari2021Oncogenic). EFR3A's role in these interactions highlights its importance in the spatial regulation of KRAS and its potential impact on cancer biology.
