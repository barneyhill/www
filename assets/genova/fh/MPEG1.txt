# MPEG1

## Overview
MPEG1, or macrophage-expressed gene 1, encodes a protein known as Perforin-2, which is a crucial component of the immune system. This gene is part of the Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin (MACPF) superfamily, which is characterized by its ability to form transmembrane pores. The MPEG1 protein is primarily expressed in macrophages and other immune cells, where it plays a vital role in the intracellular destruction of pathogens by forming pores in the membranes of phagosomes and lysosomes. This pore-forming activity is essential for the breakdown of engulfed microbes, thereby contributing to cellular immunity and the regulation of inflammation (BaylyJones2020Ancient). The protein's function is modulated by proinflammatory signals and is activated by the acidification of endosomal vesicles, highlighting its role in immune defense mechanisms (BaylyJones2020Ancient).

## Structure
The MPEG1 protein, also known as Perforin-2, is a member of the membrane attack complex/perforin-like (MACPF) superfamily. It is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of MPEG1 includes an N-terminal MACPF/CDC domain, a central multi-vesicular body of 12 kDa (MVB12)-associated β-prism (MABP) domain, and a C-terminal L-domain (Pang2019The; BaylyJones2020Ancient). The MACPF domain is crucial for its pore-forming activity, forming a 64-stranded β-barrel that is central to the assembly (Pang2019The).

The secondary structure of MPEG1 involves a contorted four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet with an L-shaped bend, flanked by two clusters of alpha-helices (BaylyJones2020Ancient). The MABP domain, despite low sequence similarity to other homologues, is involved in lipid binding and is characterized by a hyper-extended β-hairpin motif (Pang2019The; BaylyJones2020Ancient).

In terms of quaternary structure, MPEG1 forms hexadecameric rings that stack in a head-to-head arrangement, creating a double ring structure (Pang2019The). The protein can transition from a prepore to a pore state, forming oligomers that insert into lipid membranes to create large aqueous channels (BaylyJones2020Ancient). MPEG1 also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as monoubiquitination, which are crucial for its trafficking and function (BaylyJones2020Ancient). Splice variants, such as MPEG1b, result in different isoforms that affect its function and localization (BaylyJones2020Ancient).

## Function
MPEG1, also known as macrophage-expressed gene 1, encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the immune response by forming pores in target membranes, facilitating the destruction of pathogens. This protein is part of the Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin (MACPF) superfamily, which is known for its ability to form transmembrane pores that allow the passive diffusion of molecules across membranes (BaylyJones2020Ancient). MPEG1 is primarily active in phagolysosomes, where it contributes to the breakdown of engulfed microbes, aiding in cellular immunity and inflammation regulation (BaylyJones2020Ancient).

MPEG1 functions as an intracellular pore-forming immune effector, forming oligomers that create pores in the membranes of phagosomes and lysosomes, which are crucial for its antimicrobial activity (BaylyJones2020Ancient). The protein's activity is regulated by proinflammatory signals and is dependent on acidification, which triggers its pore-forming capability within endosomal vesicles and phagolysosomes (BaylyJones2020Ancient). MPEG1's role in immune defense is underscored by its involvement in type I interferon signaling and its ability to regulate excessive immune responses, such as those seen in septic shock (BaylyJones2020Ancient).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MPEG1 gene, also known as perforin-2, have been associated with various clinical conditions. Germline mutations in MPEG1 have been linked to recurrent pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections in humans, suggesting a role in susceptibility to these infections (Merselis2021Breaching; BaylyJones2020Ancient). Specific mutations, such as T73A, P316S, Q398*, and P405T, have been identified in patients with these infections, indicating a reduced ability to kill Mycobacterium avium (Merselis2021Breaching).

In a clinical case, a heterozygous nonsense mutation in codon Tyr430* of MPEG1 was associated with recurrent polymicrobial skin infections, likely due to impaired phagocyte function (Merselis2021Breaching). This mutation reduces the availability of Perforin-2 in endo/phagosomes, correlating with the patient's symptoms.

MPEG1 expression levels also play a critical role in immune responses. Alterations in its expression can affect susceptibility to infections by various pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Listeria monocytogenes, as seen in animal models (Merselis2021Breaching). These findings highlight the importance of MPEG1 in maintaining effective immune defense and its potential implications in infectious and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
MPEG1, also known as macrophage expressed 1, is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function as an immune effector. The protein is known to form oligomeric complexes, specifically hexadecameric rings, which are essential for its pore-forming activity. These complexes are assembled in a head-to-head arrangement, with each monomer contributing to a 64-stranded β-barrel structure that is central to the assembly (Pang2019The).

MPEG1 interacts with lipid bilayers through its MABP domain, which binds negatively charged lipids such as POPS, PIPs, and cardiolipin. This interaction is facilitated by a β-hairpin structure, allowing MPEG1 to localize to target membranes and potentially form pores in bacterial membranes within phagolysosomal compartments (Pang2019The).

The protein is also implicated in Type I IFN signaling, where it is suggested to form complexes with IFN receptors IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. However, the necessity of MPEG1 for this signaling pathway is debated, as some studies indicate that Type I IFN signaling remains functional in MPEG1-deficient cells (Merselis2021Breaching).

MPEG1's interactions are regulated by proteolytic processing, which is crucial for its oligomerization and function. The ectodomain of MPEG1 is released during its antimicrobial activity, while the transmembrane and cytosolic tail remain anchored in the host membrane (BaylyJones2020Ancient).
