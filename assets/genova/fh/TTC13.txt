# TTC13

## Overview
TTC13, or tetratricopeptide repeat domain 13, is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are integral to facilitating protein-protein interactions. These interactions are essential for the assembly of multiprotein complexes that play significant roles in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and protein folding. The TTC13 protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis and organismal development by ensuring the fidelity of cellular processes and responses to environmental changes (Feinberg2010Personalized). While specific details about its function in healthy cells remain limited, TTC13's involvement in maintaining normal physiological functions underscores its importance. Additionally, alterations in the expression of circTTC13, a circular RNA derived from the TTC13 gene, have been implicated in diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2024CircTTC13; Liu2019Key).

## Structure


## Function
TTC13, or tetratricopeptide repeat domain 13, encodes a protein characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These interactions are crucial for the assembly of multiprotein complexes, which play significant roles in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, TTC13 is involved in cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and protein folding, contributing to cellular homeostasis and organismal development. The protein is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it influences these processes (Feinberg2010Personalized).

The TPR domains of TTC13 allow it to participate in the formation of complexes that are essential for maintaining the proper function and regulation of cellular activities. This involvement in multiprotein complexes suggests that TTC13 may have a role in ensuring the fidelity of cellular processes and responses to environmental changes. Although specific details about its function in healthy cells are limited, the protein's general role in cellular homeostasis and development highlights its importance in maintaining normal physiological functions (Feinberg2010Personalized).

## Clinical Significance
The TTC13 gene, encoding the tetratricopeptide repeat domain 13 protein, has been implicated in various diseases, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Alterations in the expression of circTTC13, a circular RNA derived from the TTC13 gene, are associated with the progression and poor prognosis of HCC. CircTTC13 is overexpressed in HCC tissues and is linked to advanced disease stages and grades. It promotes malignancy by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Zhang2024CircTTC13).

CircTTC13 also plays a significant role in drug resistance, specifically resistance to sorafenib, a treatment for advanced liver cancer. It achieves this by inhibiting ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, through the miR-513a-5p/SLC7A11 axis. This inhibition leads to increased tumor growth and metastasis, contributing to treatment resistance. Silencing circTTC13 has been shown to reverse sorafenib resistance by promoting ferroptosis, suggesting that targeting circTTC13 could be a therapeutic strategy in HCC (Zhang2024CircTTC13).

In addition to its role in HCC, TTC13 has been identified as upregulated in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), although specific implications in T2DM are not detailed (Liu2019Key).
