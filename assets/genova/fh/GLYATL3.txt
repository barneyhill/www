# GLYATL3

## Overview
GLYATL3 is a gene that encodes the protein glycine-N-acyltransferase like 3, which is part of the glycine-N-acyltransferase family. This protein is involved in the transfer of acyl groups to glycine, a process that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of various acyl-CoA substrates. The glycine-N-acyltransferase like 3 protein is categorized as an enzyme, specifically functioning as an acyltransferase. It is implicated in several metabolic pathways and may have a role in detoxification processes by facilitating the conjugation of acyl groups to glycine, thereby aiding in the excretion of potentially harmful compounds. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their specific functions and potential implications in human health and disease.
