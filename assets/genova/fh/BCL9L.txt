# BCL9L

## Overview
BCL9L is a gene that encodes the BCL9-like protein, a transcriptional coactivator involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression related to cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, which are crucial processes in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis (Sustmann2008CellTypeSpecific). BCL9L interacts with β-catenin and Pygopus proteins, facilitating the transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes (Vafaizadeh2021The). Beyond its nuclear functions, BCL9L also participates in cytoplasmic processes, such as enamel formation, indicating its diverse roles in cellular activities (Cantù2017A). The gene's involvement in various cancers, including colorectal, breast, and hepatocellular carcinoma, underscores its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target (Huge2019Wnt; Vafaizadeh2021The; Gay2019Loss).

## Function
BCL9L is a crucial component of the Wnt signaling pathway, primarily acting as a co-activator that enhances the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. This interaction is essential for the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. BCL9L operates mainly in the nucleus, where it influences the expression of Wnt target genes, thereby playing a significant role in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis (Sustmann2008CellTypeSpecific).

In the context of the colon epithelium, BCL9L, along with its homolog BCL9, is vital for maintaining stem cell traits and regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The ablation of BCL9/BCL9L in mice results in decreased expression of intestinal stem cell markers and impaired epithelial regeneration, highlighting their importance in Wnt-mediated regulation of stem cell properties (Deka2010Bcl9Bcl9l).

BCL9L also plays a role in tooth enamel formation, where it functions independently of β-catenin. It is involved in the structural organization of enamel, indicating a non-transcriptional role in this process. This suggests that BCL9L may have broader roles in other mineralized tissues (Cantù2017A).

## Clinical Significance
BCL9L plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In colorectal cancer (CRC), BCL9L is crucial for the expression of Wnt target genes that facilitate tumorigenesis following APC loss. Deletion of BCL9L in CRC models has been shown to suppress tumor growth by reducing the expression of genes such as Axin2, Cd44, and c-Myc, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in CRC, particularly in cases with specific APC mutations (Gay2019Loss).

In breast cancer, BCL9L is implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. Its interactions with β-catenin and Pygopus are critical for maintaining Wnt signaling, which promotes cancer cell migration and invasion. Alterations in BCL9L expression correlate with poor disease outcomes, highlighting its role in breast carcinogenesis (Vafaizadeh2021The).

BCL9L is also overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it is associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes and poor overall survival. Its expression is linked to tumor dedifferentiation and size, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in HCC (Huge2019Wnt).

## Interactions
BCL9L is a transcriptional coactivator that interacts with β-catenin and Pygopus (Pygo) proteins, playing a significant role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. BCL9L binds to the N-terminus of β-catenin through its HD2 domain and to the C-terminus of Pygopus through its HD1 domain. These interactions are crucial for the transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes, which are involved in processes such as tumor progression and metastasis in breast cancer (Vafaizadeh2021The).

In addition to its nuclear role, BCL9L has been shown to have a cytoplasmic function in ameloblasts, the cells responsible for enamel formation. In this context, BCL9L interacts with proteins involved in exocytosis and vesicular trafficking, such as Amelogenin, a key protein in enamel development. This interaction suggests a role for BCL9L in the trafficking and secretion of enamel-specific proteins, independent of its transcriptional activity (Cantù2017A).

BCL9L's interaction with β-catenin is also subject to regulation by LATS2, which can disrupt the β-catenin/BCL9L complex, thereby inhibiting Wnt signaling and affecting the recruitment of BCL9L to Wnt target gene promoters (Li2013LATS2).
