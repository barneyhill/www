# ZC4H2

## Overview
ZC4H2 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger C4H2-type containing protein, which is a nuclear protein characterized by its zinc-finger domain. This domain is integral to the protein's function, facilitating DNA binding and protein-protein interactions. The ZC4H2 protein plays a crucial role in neural development and function, acting as a co-factor in various signaling pathways, including those involving RNF220 and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling. It is predominantly expressed in the brain and spinal cord during embryonic development, underscoring its importance in neural patterning and differentiation. Mutations in the ZC4H2 gene are linked to significant neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Wieacker-Wolff syndrome and Miles-Carpenter syndrome, which manifest in a range of phenotypes including intellectual disability and muscle weakness (Hirata2013ZC4H2; Frints2019Deleterious).

## Structure
The ZC4H2 protein is characterized by a zinc-finger domain, which includes four cysteine residues and two histidine residues, forming a C-terminal zinc-finger motif crucial for its function (Ma2017ZC4H2; May2015ZC4H2). This domain is involved in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions. The protein also contains a coiled-coil domain, which is a structural motif that facilitates the formation of protein oligomers (May2015ZC4H2).

The primary structure of ZC4H2 includes a 110-amino-acid-long helix, which is retained even in some truncated forms of the protein due to mutations (Sun2022Loss). The secondary structure involves alpha helices, as indicated by the presence of the coiled-coil domain (May2015ZC4H2).

ZC4H2 is known to shuttle between the nucleus and cytosol, suggesting a dynamic role in cellular processes (Vangeel2020The). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and spinal cord during the embryonic stage, indicating its involvement in neural development (Vangeel2020The). There are two isoforms of ZC4H2, which exhibit different expression levels in tissues and brain sections, potentially contributing to clinical variability in conditions associated with ZC4H2 mutations (May2015ZC4H2).

## Function
The ZC4H2 gene encodes a zinc-finger nuclear protein that plays a critical role in neural development and function. It is primarily involved in the modulation of signaling pathways crucial for neural patterning and differentiation. In healthy human cells, ZC4H2 acts as a co-factor for RNF220, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, stabilizing it to ensure proper Gli signaling, which is essential for ventral spinal cord patterning (Ma2019ZC4H2). This interaction is vital for the correct specification of neuronal domains and the development of various neuron types in the spinal cord (Ma2019ZC4H2).

ZC4H2 also influences the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway by stabilizing Smad1 and Smad5 proteins, reducing their polyubiquitination and enhancing their stability. This stabilization is crucial for proper BMP signaling, which is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and embryonic development (Ma2017ZC4H2). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, contributing to the maintenance of normal cellular functions and organismal development (Ma2017ZC4H2).

Mutations in ZC4H2 can lead to significant neurological and developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal neural development and function (May2015ZC4H2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZC4H2 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably Wieacker-Wolff syndrome (WWS) and Miles-Carpenter syndrome (MCS). These conditions are characterized by intellectual disability, muscle weakness, and joint contractures, often presenting as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) (Hirata2013ZC4H2; Frints2019Deleterious). ZC4H2 mutations can lead to a broad spectrum of phenotypes, including developmental delay, spasticity, and seizures, due to their impact on neural development and synaptic plasticity (Hirata2013ZC4H2; Ma2019ZC4H2).

Specific mutations such as p.L66H, p.R18K, p.R213W, and p.V75in15aa have been identified in families with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID), contributing to the clinical features observed in MCS (May2015ZC4H2). These mutations are believed to destabilize the protein, affecting the development of GABAergic interneurons and leading to altered brain and spinal cord connectivity (May2015ZC4H2).

In females, ZC4H2 mutations can result in a variable phenotype due to X-inactivation, with some exhibiting mild to severe symptoms (Frints2019Deleterious). The gene's involvement in neural development makes it a candidate for early genetic testing in cases of fetal hypo-/akinesia or neurogenic AMC (Frints2019Deleterious).

## Interactions
ZC4H2 is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It interacts with the TRPV4 channel, a Ca2+-permeable ion channel, enhancing its activity and turnover at the plasma membrane. This interaction is specific to TRPV4, as ZC4H2 does not affect TRPV3-expressing cells. The interaction was identified using a mammalian protein-protein interaction trap (MAPPIT) screen and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays (Vangeel2020The).

ZC4H2 also interacts with Smad proteins, specifically Smad1 and Smad5, stabilizing them by reducing their polyubiquitination. This stabilization enhances BMP signaling, which is crucial for neural development. The interaction occurs through the MH2 domain of Smad1 and Smad5, and ZC4H2 reduces their association with Smurf ubiquitin ligases (Ma2017ZC4H2).

Additionally, ZC4H2 cooperates with RNF220, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in the degradation of transcription factors such as Dbx1 and Dbx2, which are involved in spinal progenitor domain specification. This interaction is crucial for the proper patterning of the ventral spinal cord and involves the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Kim2018Rnf220).
