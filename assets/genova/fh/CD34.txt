# CD34

## Overview
CD34 is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, known as the CD34 protein, which is predominantly expressed on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, as well as on endothelial cells. The CD34 protein is characterized by its heavily glycosylated extracellular domain, which plays a crucial role in cell adhesion, migration, and homing, particularly within the hematopoietic system. Functionally, CD34 is involved in the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix and interacts with selectins, facilitating the migration and homing of hematopoietic cells to the bone marrow and other sites of hematopoiesis (Radu2023CD34—Structure; Sidney2014Concise). The gene's expression is clinically significant, as alterations in CD34 levels are associated with various hematological disorders, including myelodysplastic syndromes and leukemias, where it serves as a marker for disease progression and prognosis (Abdellateif2020&lt; Sridhar2009Relationship; p&gt; Combined).

## Structure
The CD34 protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 110-120 kDa. It features an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Fehse2000CD34; Deterding2011CD34). The extracellular region is characterized by a mucin-like domain that is heavily glycosylated with sialylated O-linked carbohydrates, contributing to its rodlike structure and high negative charge (Sassetti2000Identification; Hughes2020A). This domain is crucial for its function in cell adhesion and interaction with selectins (Hughes2020A).

The cytoplasmic domain of CD34 is relatively short, containing sequences for serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation, which are involved in signal transduction (Deterding2011CD34; Hughes2020A). Specific phosphorylation sites have been identified, including Ser-313, Ser-343, Ser-337/338, and Ser-371, which are phosphorylated by various kinases such as PKCα and AKT2 (Deterding2011CD34). These modifications suggest a role in cellular signaling pathways, although the precise biological functions are not fully understood (Deterding2011CD34).

CD34 also exists in splice variant forms, including a truncated version known as tCD34, which lacks most of the cytoplasmic tail but retains a serine phosphorylation motif (Fehse2000CD34). This variant is used as a marker for selecting gene-modified cells due to its stable expression (Fehse2000CD34).

## Function
The CD34 protein is a transmembrane phosphoglycoprotein that plays a significant role in cell adhesion, migration, and homing, particularly in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. It facilitates the attachment of these cells to the extracellular matrix in the bone marrow, aiding in their migration and homing to hematopoietic sites (Radu2023CD34—Structure; Sidney2014Concise). CD34 is involved in enhancing cellular proliferation, blocking differentiation, and improving cell migration, which are essential for maintaining a pool of immature cells capable of differentiating into specialized cells as needed (Radu2023CD34—Structure).

In endothelial cells, CD34 is expressed on vascular endothelial progenitor cells and is involved in angiogenesis, particularly at the tips of vascular sprouts (Sidney2014Concise). It is also known to bind with L-selectin, facilitating the homing of hematopoietic cells to the bone marrow and other sites of hematopoiesis (Radu2023CD34—Structure). The protein's role in cell adhesion is further highlighted by its involvement in the adhesion of lymphocytes to blood vessel walls, which is crucial for immune system regulation (Radu2023CD34—Structure). CD34's expression is crucial for progenitor cell activity, emphasizing its functional role in healthy human cells (Sidney2014Concise).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CD34 gene are associated with various hematological disorders. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), differential gene expression profiles in CD34+ marrow cells have been identified, with significant differences observed between healthy individuals and MDS patients. A specific 'poor risk' gene signature, including CD34, is linked to the progression of MDS to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Sridhar2009Relationship).

In acute myeloid leukemia, the combined expression of CD34 and the FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutation is associated with poor treatment outcomes. Patients exhibiting both markers tend to have shorter disease-free survival and overall survival rates, indicating a poor prognosis (Abdellateif2020&lt; p&gt; Combined). CD34 expression alone, however, does not significantly correlate with disease relapse or survival rates, suggesting that its prognostic value is enhanced when combined with other markers like FLT3-ITD (Abdellateif2020&lt; p&gt; Combined).

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), CD34 is overexpressed during the blast phase compared to the chronic phase, indicating its role in disease progression. This overexpression is part of a molecular signature that distinguishes the blast crisis from the chronic phase (Zheng2006Gene).

## Interactions
CD34 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that participates in various interactions with other proteins, influencing cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. It is part of a family of sialomucins, which includes podocalyxin and endoglycan, and is characterized by a highly negatively charged extracellular mucin domain due to sialylation and sulfation (Hughes2020A). CD34 interacts with the Crk-like adapter protein, CrkL, which is involved in cell migration, adhesion, and shape regulation. This interaction is unique as CD34 is the only known partner for CrkL's C-terminal SH3 domain, despite lacking a canonical SH3 binding motif (Nielsen2008Novel; Hughes2020A).

CD34 also functions as a ligand for selectins, including E-selectin and P-selectin, which are crucial for the migration and homing of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) to the bone marrow. The binding to E-selectin is dependent on sialofucosylated O-glycans, while P-selectin binding requires O-glycans and tyrosine sulfation (AbuSamra2017Not). These interactions facilitate leukocyte tethering and rolling on endothelial cells, playing a significant role in cell migration and adhesion (AbuSamra2017Not). CD34's interaction with selectins is comparable in affinity and function to other known selectin ligands, such as PSGL-1 and CD44 (AbuSamra2017Not).
