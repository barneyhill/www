# TMEM43

## Overview
TMEM43 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 43, also known as LUMA, which is primarily associated with the nuclear envelope. This protein is characterized by its four transmembrane domains and is a component of the 'linkers of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton complex' (LINC), playing a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope by connecting the nuclear lamina with the cytoskeleton (Milting2014The). TMEM43 is also involved in modulating gap junction networks, particularly in the brain and heart, where it influences electrical coupling and cellular communication (Jang2022Astrocytic). Mutations in TMEM43, such as the p.S358L mutation, are clinically significant as they are linked to arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 5 (ARVC5), a condition associated with severe cardiac arrhythmias and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (Siragam2014TMEM43; Merner2008Arrhythmogenic).

## Structure
The TMEM43 gene encodes a transmembrane protein known as LUMA, which is associated with the nuclear envelope. The protein is predicted to have four transmembrane domains, localizing it to the inner nuclear membrane (Milting2014The). The TMEM43 protein is part of the 'linkers of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton complex' (LINC), which connects the nuclear lamina with the cytoskeleton (Milting2014The). The S358L mutation is located within the third transmembrane domain and is highly conserved across various species, indicating its structural and functional importance (Merner2008Arrhythmogenic).

TMEM43 is a cytoplasmic membrane protein with several potential posttranslational modification sites, including phosphorylation, transactivation, SUMO attachment, and O-glycosylation sites (Merner2008Arrhythmogenic). These modifications may influence the protein's function and interactions. The protein does not contain a cadherin domain and shows less than 10% identity with desmocollin and desmoglein, which are other transmembrane proteins of the desmosome (Merner2008Arrhythmogenic).

Mutations in TMEM43, such as p.E85K and p.I91V, are found in the N-terminal portion of the protein, which resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, affecting the shape of the nucleus when transfected into cells (Milting2014The).

## Function
TMEM43, also known as Gapjinc, is a transmembrane protein primarily located in the inner nuclear membrane, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope. It is part of the 'linkers of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton complex' (LINC), which connects the nuclear lamina with the cytoskeleton, contributing to the structural stability of the nucleus (Milting2014The). TMEM43 is also characterized as an acid-sensing cation channel that modulates gap junction networks by facilitating transjunctional potentials, enhancing electrical couplings between cells (Jang2022Astrocytic). 

In astrocytes, TMEM43 is involved in mediating gap junction couplings, particularly in the brain, where it is expressed alongside connexin 43 (Cx43). Its absence leads to altered astrocyte morphology and reduced gap junction coupling, affecting neuronal excitability and memory functions (Jang2022Astrocytic). TMEM43 also plays a role in ionic movements and membrane potential regulation, conducting sodium, potassium, and cesium ions, which are crucial for cellular communication and homeostasis (Jang2022Astrocytic). These functions highlight TMEM43's importance in maintaining normal cellular processes and organismal outcomes, such as memory retrieval and neuronal excitability (Jang2022Astrocytic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM43 gene, particularly the p.S358L missense mutation, are associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 5 (ARVC5), a severe form of cardiomyopathy characterized by life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and a high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) (Siragam2014TMEM43; Merner2008Arrhythmogenic). This mutation is fully penetrant and exhibits a sex-influenced, autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern, with males experiencing more severe symptoms and a higher incidence of SCD compared to females (Hodgkinson2013The; Merner2008Arrhythmogenic).

The p.S358L mutation affects the expression and distribution of intercalated disc proteins, such as Zonula Occludens (ZO-1), Junctional Plakoglobin (JUP), and Connexin-43 (Cx43), which are crucial for cardiac conduction (Siragam2014TMEM43). These alterations lead to reduced conduction velocity and contribute to the pathogenesis of ARVC5 (Siragam2014TMEM43). The mutation also results in fibro-fatty replacement of the myocardium, particularly in the right ventricular free wall, further exacerbating the risk of arrhythmias (Siragam2014TMEM43).

The clinical presentation of ARVC5 includes structural and functional abnormalities in both the right and left ventricles, with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes such as lower voltages and prolonged QRS duration being common diagnostic features (Dominguez2020Clinical). The condition is particularly prevalent in a founder population from Newfoundland, Canada, but has also been identified in other populations, indicating its widespread clinical significance (Hodgkinson2013The; Dominguez2020Clinical).

## Interactions
TMEM43, also known as transmembrane protein 43, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In the cochlea, TMEM43 interacts with the TASK-1 (KCNK3) two-pore domain potassium channel. This interaction was demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation assays, which showed a positive band for TMEM43 when pulled down with a TASK-1 antibody, indicating a direct interaction between these proteins (Jang2021A). TMEM43 also interacts with connexin proteins, specifically Connexin 26 (Cx26) and Connexin 30 (Cx30), in the cochlea, where it plays a role in mediating potassium conductance in cochlear supporting cells (Jang2022Astrocytic).

In the brain, TMEM43 is expressed in astrocytes and interacts with Connexin 43 (Cx43), a predominant connexin in the brain. This interaction is important for modulating gap junction networks and facilitating transjunctional potentials, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays (Jang2022Astrocytic). TMEM43's interaction with Cx43 is crucial for maintaining electrical coupling and gap junction function in astrocytic networks (Jang2022Astrocytic).

In cardiac cells, the TMEM43 p.S358L mutation affects the expression and distribution of intercalated disc proteins, including ZO-1, a-catenin, and JUP, and alters the phosphorylation of Cx43, impacting gap junction function and conduction velocity (Siragam2014TMEM43).
