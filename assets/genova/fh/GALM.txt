# GALM

## Overview
The GALM gene encodes the enzyme galactose mutarotase, a critical component of the Leloir pathway involved in galactose metabolism. Galactose mutarotase is a cytoplasmic enzyme that facilitates the conversion between the α and β anomers of galactose, ensuring efficient utilization of this sugar in human cells (Wada2019Biallelic; Conte2021Galactose). This enzyme is essential for normal metabolic processes, particularly during periods of high lactose intake, such as lactation, where it prevents the accumulation of toxic intermediates (Wada2019Biallelic; Pai2007Galactomutarotase). Mutations in the GALM gene can lead to type IV galactosemia, a condition characterized by elevated blood galactose levels and associated clinical symptoms (Kikuchi2021The; Wada2019Biallelic).

## Function
The GALM gene encodes the enzyme galactose mutarotase, which plays a crucial role in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of β-D-galactose to α-D-galactose, facilitating the interconversion of galactose anomers, a necessary step for the proper utilization of galactose in human cells (Wada2019Biallelic; Conte2021Galactose). The GALM enzyme is active in the cytoplasm, where it supports efficient galactose metabolism and prevents the accumulation of toxic intermediates (Pai2007Galactomutarotase).

In healthy human cells, GALM's activity is essential for normal cell growth and energy production, as it allows galactose to be further processed by other enzymes in the Leloir pathway, such as galactokinase (GALK1), galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT), and UDP-galactose-4'-epimerase (GALE) (Wada2019Biallelic). This process is particularly important during periods of high lactose consumption, such as lactation, where efficient galactose metabolism is critical (Wada2019Biallelic).

GALM also plays a role in the biosynthesis of complex oligosaccharides, which are important for cell motility, adhesion, and functional properties, indicating its broader significance in cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Pai2007Galactomutarotase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GALM gene, which encodes the enzyme galactose mutarotase, are associated with a novel form of galactosemia known as type IV galactosemia. This condition is characterized by elevated blood galactose levels due to the inability to properly metabolize galactose, a sugar derived from lactose. Patients with GALM deficiency often present with symptoms such as bilateral congenital cataracts, which can resolve with a galactose-restricted diet. Unlike other forms of galactosemia, severe complications like liver or neurological issues have not been observed in GALM deficiency (Kikuchi2021The; Wada2019Biallelic).

The pathogenic variants in GALM include missense mutations such as p.Gly142Arg and p.Arg267Gly, which affect protein stability and lead to reduced enzyme activity. These mutations do not directly impact the enzyme's active site but may alter its structure, resulting in a loss of function (Timson2019Type; Wada2019Biallelic). The estimated global incidence of GALM deficiency is approximately 1 in 228,411, with a higher prevalence in Japanese and African populations (Iwasawa2019The; Kikuchi2021The). The long-term effects of GALM deficiency remain unclear due to early dietary interventions and the young age of diagnosed patients (Conte2021Galactose).
