# ZNF766

## Overview
ZNF766 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 766, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains. These domains enable the protein to bind to specific DNA sequences, functioning primarily as a transcription factor within the nucleus. Zinc finger protein 766 plays a significant role in regulating gene expression, influencing cellular processes such as DNA transcription, cell differentiation, and development. As a KRAB-zinc finger protein, it interacts with specific DNA motifs to modulate recombination processes, recruiting proteins like TRIM28 to affect chromatin states. The gene's involvement in various cellular pathways underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions. Additionally, ZNF766 has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric conditions, suggesting its potential clinical significance in complex traits and diseases (Bruno2019The; giri2019genetic; Altemose2017Human).

## Structure
ZNF766 (zinc finger protein 766) is a member of the zinc finger protein family, characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains. These domains are small protein motifs that coordinate zinc ions, which help stabilize their folds and facilitate binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. The primary structure of ZNF766 consists of specific amino acid sequences that form the basis for its function and interaction capabilities.

The secondary structure of ZNF766 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure refers to the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein, which is crucial for its interaction with other molecules and its biological activity. While the quaternary structure involves the assembly of multiple protein subunits, specific details about ZNF766's quaternary structure are not provided in the available context.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination may influence the function of ZNF766, potentially altering its activity or interactions. Additionally, splice variants of ZNF766 can lead to different isoforms, each with distinct functions, which may contribute to the protein's versatility in cellular processes. These structural features and modifications are essential for the diverse roles that ZNF766 plays in the cell.

## Function
ZNF766, a member of the zinc finger protein family, plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression in healthy human cells. This protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which enable it to bind to specific DNA sequences. As a transcription factor, ZNF766 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional activity of target genes. Through its DNA-binding capability, ZNF766 regulates various cellular processes, including DNA transcription regulation, cell differentiation, and development. By modulating the expression of specific genes, ZNF766 impacts cellular functions and contributes to the overall organismal development and function. Its activity in the nucleus underscores its importance in maintaining proper cellular function and ensuring the correct expression of genes necessary for normal cellular and organismal processes.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF766 has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric conditions. In Parkinson's disease, ZNF766 is co-expressed with the PARK2 gene within a gene module that is negatively correlated with the disease trait. This module is enriched for pathways related to synaptic plasticity and macroautophagy, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (giri2019genetic). In schizophrenia, ZNF766 has been identified as a significant gene with larger log-fold changes in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer compared to the bulk hippocampus, indicating a stronger association in specific cell types (Jaffe2019Cell).

ZNF766 is also associated with cannabis use initiation, although it does not reach genome-wide significance. It is one of the genes on chromosome 19 showing a relatively strong association with this trait (Minică2015Heritability). Additionally, ZNF766 is involved in genetic networks related to plasma protein levels, although no direct functional connection to specific proteins like GDF-15 has been established (Kalnapenkis2023Genetic). These findings suggest that alterations in ZNF766 expression or function may contribute to various complex traits and diseases, highlighting its potential clinical significance.

## Interactions
ZNF766 is a KRAB-zinc finger protein that interacts with specific DNA motifs to regulate recombination processes. It binds to motifs within THE1B repeat elements, which are associated with decreased recombination rates. This binding leads to the recruitment of TRIM28, a protein that influences histone modifications such as H3K9me3 and H3K4me3, thereby affecting chromatin states and recombination (Altemose2017A; Altemose2017Human). 

The interaction between ZNF766 and TRIM28 is crucial for its function in recombination suppression. TRIM28 acts as a scaffold for recruiting other proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression, which is facilitated by the KRAB domain of ZNF766 (Bruno2019The). This interaction does not prevent PRDM9 binding or H3K4me3 deposition but rather modulates recombination by altering chromatin states (Altemose2017Human).

In leukemic K562 cells, ZNF766 is among the zinc finger proteins that interact with wild-type TRIM28. However, the specific interactions of ZNF766 with proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).
