# PRPH2

## Overview
The PRPH2 gene encodes the peripherin 2 protein, a tetraspanin glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the structural integrity and function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. This protein is essential for the formation and maintenance of photoreceptor outer segments (OSs), which are crucial for vision. Peripherin 2 is involved in the initiation and maturation of OSs, forming oligomeric complexes with its homolog ROM1 to ensure proper OS growth and stability (Conley2018Prph2; Zulliger2018Oligomerization). The protein's structure, characterized by four transmembrane domains and two intradiscal loops, facilitates its interactions and oligomerization, which are vital for the photoreceptor's disc and lamella formation (Tebbe2020The; Zulliger2018Oligomerization). Mutations in the PRPH2 gene are associated with various inherited retinal dystrophies, highlighting its clinical significance in visual health (Wang2023New; FernándezCaballero2024PRPH2Related).

## Structure
The PRPH2 (peripherin 2) protein is a tetraspanin glycoprotein essential for the formation and maintenance of photoreceptor outer segments (OSs) in the retina. Structurally, PRPH2 is characterized by a short cytoplasmic N-terminus, four transmembrane domains, and two intradiscal loops, D1 and D2, with the D2 loop being crucial for its interactions and oligomerization (Tebbe2020The; Conley2018Prph2). PRPH2 forms non-covalent homomeric and heteromeric tetramers with its homolog ROM1, which are further stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bonds (Zulliger2018Oligomerization). A unique cysteine residue, C150, in PRPH2 is responsible for forming intermolecular disulfide bonds, facilitating the assembly of tetramers into higher-order covalently linked complexes (Loewen2000Disulfidemediated; Lewis2021Photoreceptor).

These complexes are vital for the structural integrity of the disc rim region in rod and cone photoreceptors, promoting membrane curvature, flattening, and fusion necessary for OS disc and lamella formation (Tebbe2020The). Mutations in PRPH2, such as C150S, disrupt these processes by preventing the formation of higher-order oligomers, leading to defects in OS structure and function (Zulliger2018Oligomerization; Lewis2021Photoreceptor).

## Function
The PRPH2 gene encodes a tetraspanin glycoprotein crucial for the formation and maintenance of photoreceptor outer segments (OSs) in the retina. This protein is essential for the structural integrity and function of photoreceptor cells, which are vital for vision. PRPH2 is involved in the initiation and maturation of OSs, with its C-terminus playing a significant role in initiating OS structures and disc morphogenesis (Conley2018Prph2). The protein forms oligomers with its homologue ROM1, and these complexes are necessary for proper OS growth and maturation. The D2 loops in PRPH2 and ROM1 are critical for their oligomerization into tetramers and larger complexes, which are required for OS maturation (Conley2018Prph2; Zulliger2018Oligomerization).

PRPH2 is located at the disc/lamellae rim of photoreceptors, where it co-localizes with ROM1. It is involved in maintaining the stability and elongation of OSs, which are crucial for photoreceptor function (Conley2018Prph2). The protein also plays a role in the trafficking of proteins to the OS, utilizing both conventional and unconventional secretory pathways (Conley2018Prph2). Proper assembly of PRPH2/ROM1 oligomers is critical for the formation of rod and cone OSs, with cones being particularly sensitive to changes in these complexes (Zulliger2018Oligomerization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRPH2 gene are linked to a variety of inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs), which can lead to severe visual impairment or blindness. These conditions include retinitis pigmentosa (RP), cone-rod dystrophy (CRD), macular dystrophy (MD), pattern dystrophy (PD), vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD), and central areolar choroidal dystrophy (CACD) (Wang2023New; FernándezCaballero2024PRPH2Related; Peeters2021PRPH2). PRPH2-related retinopathies are typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, though rare cases of autosomal recessive inheritance or digenic inheritance with ROM1 have been reported, leading to more severe conditions like Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and early-onset RP (Wang2023New).

The phenotypic expression of PRPH2 mutations is highly variable, even among patients from the same family, complicating the establishment of clear genotype-phenotype correlations (FernándezCaballero2024PRPH2Related). Missense variants, particularly those located in the D2-loop protein domain, are prevalent and have been associated with more severe phenotypes and earlier onset of disease (Wang2023New; Peeters2021PRPH2). Ethnic differences in the prevalence and phenotypic expression of PRPH2 variants have been noted, with RP being more common in Asian populations and macular degeneration more prevalent in Caucasian populations (Wang2023New).

## Interactions
The PRPH2 protein, also known as peripherin 2, is involved in several critical interactions within photoreceptor cells. It forms complexes with its homolog ROM1, which are essential for the structural integrity and function of photoreceptor outer segments. These complexes are primarily mediated by the second intradiscal loop and involve both non-covalent and covalent interactions, with intermolecular disulfide bonds playing a crucial role in higher-order oligomer formation (Tebbe2020The; Zulliger2018Oligomerization).

PRPH2 also interacts with cone opsins, specifically S-opsin and M-opsin, in cone photoreceptors. The binding to M-opsin is stronger than to S-opsin, and mutations in PRPH2 can selectively affect these interactions, as seen with the V268I mutation, which reduces binding to M-opsin (Nguyen2016Peripherin2).

In rod photoreceptors, PRPH2 acts as a molecular linker between rhodopsin and the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel, facilitating their interaction and contributing to the structural organization of rod outer segments. This interaction is crucial for disk morphogenesis and stability, and specific mutations in PRPH2, such as G266D, can disrupt this binding, leading to retinal degenerative diseases (Becirovic2014Peripherin2).
