# TMEM174

## Overview
TMEM174 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 174, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein plays a crucial role in phosphate homeostasis, particularly through its interactions with the NaPi2a/NHERF1 complex in the kidneys, which is essential for phosphate transport and regulation (Sasaki2022Tmem174). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in renal physiology and pathology, including its involvement in renal cancers and phosphate metabolism disorders. TMEM174's regulatory role in phosphate transport and its potential as a prognostic marker in renal cell carcinoma underscore its clinical relevance (ZHANG2014Analysis; Xin2024Identification). Additionally, disruptions in TMEM174 function can lead to conditions such as hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification, highlighting its importance in maintaining cardiovascular and renal health (MiyazakiAnzai2022Targeted).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TMEM174 has been implicated in various renal cancers and phosphate metabolism disorders. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), TMEM174 is differentially expressed across subtypes, with high expression observed in squamous cell carcinoma and low expression in clear cell RCC. This differential expression suggests a role in the proliferation and progression of certain RCC subtypes, potentially serving as a marker for these cancers (ZHANG2014Analysis; Xin2024Identification). High expression of TMEM174 is associated with a good prognosis in RCC, indicating its potential as a protective gene (Xin2024Identification).

In phosphate metabolism, TMEM174 is involved in regulating phosphate transporters in the kidney. Disruption of TMEM174 in mice leads to hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification, conditions that can contribute to cardiovascular diseases (MiyazakiAnzai2022Targeted). TMEM174 knockout mice exhibit increased serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels and altered phosphate homeostasis, indicating its role in preventing hyperphosphatemia (Sasaki2022Tmem174). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TMEM174 in managing phosphate levels and its potential implications in renal and cardiovascular health.

## Interactions
TMEM174, also known as transmembrane protein 174, is involved in interactions with other proteins that play a role in phosphate regulation. In mice, TMEM174 interacts with the NaPi2a/NHERF1 complex, which is crucial for phosphate transport in the kidneys. This interaction is specific to the presence of NaPi2a, as TMEM174 binds to NHERF1 only when NaPi2a is present, indicating a dependency on NaPi2a for this interaction (Sasaki2022Tmem174). 

The absence of TMEM174 in knockout mice leads to increased expression of NHERF1 protein, suggesting that TMEM174 may have a regulatory role in maintaining the balance of this protein complex (Sasaki2022Tmem174). TMEM174 is also implicated in the internalization of NaPi2a, which is essential for phosphate excretion and regulation of plasma phosphate levels (Sasaki2022Tmem174). 

These interactions highlight the role of TMEM174 in phosphate homeostasis, particularly in its involvement with the NaPi2a/NHERF1 complex, which is significant for the regulation of phosphate transport and prevention of hyperphosphatemia (Sasaki2022Tmem174).
