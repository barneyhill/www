# APOBEC3D

## Overview
APOBEC3D is a gene that encodes the protein apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3D, which is a member of the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases. This protein is involved in the innate immune response, primarily through its ability to edit RNA and DNA, thereby playing a significant role in restricting viral replication, particularly in the context of HIV-1 (Sadeghpour2021Human; Hultquist2011Human). APOBEC3D is characterized by its two cytidine deaminase domains, which are crucial for its function in nucleic acid binding and catalysis (Takei2020Alternative). Although it exhibits weaker catalytic activity compared to other APOBEC3 proteins, APOBEC3D is under strong positive selection, underscoring its importance in immune defense (Hultquist2011Human). The protein is expressed in various human tissues, including B lymphocytes and CD4+ T lymphocytes, and is known to undergo alternative splicing, resulting in multiple transcript variants with distinct functional properties (Refsland2010Quantitative; Takei2020Alternative). Additionally, APOBEC3D has been implicated in cancer development due to its role in DNA mutagenesis, highlighting its dual role in both antiviral defense and oncogenesis (Takei2020Alternative).

## Structure
The APOBEC3D (A3D) protein is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 22q13.1 and consists of 7 exons. It features two cytidine deaminase domains, CD1 and CD2, encoded by exon 3 and exon 6, respectively. These domains are essential for the protein's function in nucleic acid binding and catalysis (Takei2020Alternative). The primary structure of A3D involves the sequence of amino acids encoded by its exons, while the secondary structure includes folding patterns like alpha-helices and beta-sheets (Takei2020Alternative). The tertiary structure refers to the overall 3D shape of the protein, although specific details on this structure are not provided in the available context.

A3D is expressed in B lymphocytes and exhibits anti-HIV-1 activity, albeit with weaker catalytic activity compared to other APOBEC3 proteins (Takei2020Alternative). The protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple transcript variants with different functional properties. These variants include A3Dv1, a full-length form, and truncated forms such as A3Dv2, A3Dv6, and A3Dv7, each with distinct subcellular localizations and roles in DNA mutagenesis (Takei2020Alternative). The specific molecular structure of A3D, including its quaternary structure, has not been experimentally determined (Chen2021Insights).

## Function
APOBEC3D is a member of the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases, which are involved in the innate immune response by editing RNA and DNA. This protein plays a crucial role in restricting viral replication, particularly in the context of HIV-1. APOBEC3D is capable of inducing cytosine to uracil (C > U) hypermutations in viral genomes, which can lead to the inhibition of viral replication (Sadeghpour2021Human; Hultquist2011Human). It is expressed in various human tissues, including primary leukocytes and CD4+ T lymphocytes, which are major targets of HIV-1 (Refsland2010Quantitative).

In healthy human cells, APOBEC3D is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to antiviral defense and genomic stability (Sadeghpour2021Human). The protein is packaged into viral particles and can restrict the replication of Vif-deficient HIV-1 by causing G-to-A hypermutations in the viral genome, leading to nonfunctional proviruses (Hultquist2011Human). Despite its weaker restrictive activity compared to other APOBEC3 proteins like APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G, APOBEC3D is under strong positive selection, indicating its significant role in the immune defense against viral infections (Hultquist2011Human).

## Clinical Significance
APOBEC3D has been implicated in cancer development due to its role in DNA mutagenesis. Variants of APOBEC3D, such as A3Dv6, are expressed in leukemia cell lines and can induce mutations in critical genes like TP53, a tumor suppressor, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Takei2020Alternative). The upregulation of APOBEC3D in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with poorer overall survival, indicating its significance in cancer prognosis (Takei2020Alternative). APOBEC3D variants can cause both base-pair changes and deletions in DNA, which may affect genomic stability and contribute to cancer development (Takei2020Alternative).

In the context of viral infections, APOBEC3D is part of the innate immune response against viruses like HIV-1. It can induce hypermutation in the viral genome, although its deaminase activity is weaker compared to other APOBEC3 enzymes (Sadeghpour2021Human). Specific variants of APOBEC3D, such as R97C and R248K, have reduced antiviral activity and are more sensitive to the HIV-1 Vif protein, potentially influencing susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and its progression (Sadeghpour2021Human). These findings highlight the dual role of APOBEC3D in both cancer and viral infections.

## Interactions
APOBEC3D (A3D) interacts with other proteins and nucleic acids primarily through RNA-mediated mechanisms. A3D is known to bind to HIV genomic RNA, which inhibits the progression of reverse transcriptase and prevents proviral DNA integration. This binding is a deamination-independent mechanism that allows A3D to effectively exclude APOBEC3F (A3F) from HIV-1 virions by competing for RNA binding sites during encapsidation (Bhattacharjee2024APOBEC3D).

A3D interacts with A3F and APOBEC3G (A3G) through an RNA intermediate, rather than direct protein-protein interactions. This interaction is sensitive to RNAse A treatment, indicating the crucial role of RNA in these interactions. A3D's higher affinity for RNA compared to A3F results in the competitive exclusion of A3F from HIV virions, particularly in the 5'UTR region of the HIV RNA (Bhattacharjee2024APOBEC3D).

A3D also forms large ribonucleoprotein complexes in the cytoplasm, which may influence its interactions with other APOBEC proteins and its role in viral restriction. These interactions highlight A3D's ability to modulate the encapsidation and restriction activities of co-expressed proteins like A3F and A3G (Bhattacharjee2024APOBEC3D).
