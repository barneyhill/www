# MYL11

## Overview
MYL11 is a gene that encodes the myosin light chain 11 protein, which is a crucial component of the myosin complex involved in muscle contraction. This protein plays a significant role in the actin-myosin filament sliding mechanism, which is essential for muscle contraction and cytoskeletal organization (Jackson2024Actinnucleation). As a part of the myosin complex, myosin light chain 11 is integral to the structural and functional dynamics of muscle cells. The gene's expression is particularly relevant in the context of muscle-related diseases, such as Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD), where it is notably down-regulated (Sayad2023Assessing). Understanding the function and regulation of MYL11 is critical for elucidating its role in muscle physiology and its potential implications in various myopathies and cardiac conditions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the MYL11 gene can significantly impact muscle function and are associated with various myopathies and cardiac conditions. Disruptions in the normal interactions of the MYL11 protein may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases, affecting both muscle strength and heart function. The MYL11 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in muscle contraction, and any deviations from its normal expression or function can lead to clinical manifestations. These alterations can result in compromised muscle performance, which may manifest as muscle weakness or other related symptoms. In the context of cardiac conditions, changes in MYL11 expression or function can affect heart muscle contraction, potentially leading to cardiac dysfunction. Understanding the specific mutations and their effects on MYL11 interactions is essential for developing targeted therapies for conditions associated with this gene. The study of MYL11 and its role in muscle and cardiac health continues to be an important area of research, as it holds potential for improving the diagnosis and treatment of related diseases.

## Interactions
MYL11, or myosin light chain 11, is involved in muscle contraction through its interaction with myosin heavy chains, forming part of the myosin complex essential for muscle function. This protein is associated with actin-myosin filament sliding, a critical process in muscle contraction and cytoskeletal organization (Jackson2024Actinnucleation). In the context of Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD), MYL11 is identified as one of the top down-regulated genes in single-cell transcriptome analyses, highlighting its role in muscle-related functions and emphasizing the precision of gene regulation in muscle tissues (Sayad2023Assessing).

While specific interactions of MYL11 with other proteins are not extensively detailed, it is mentioned alongside other proteins related to the cytoskeleton and actin-binding, such as MYH2, MYH4, MYH7, MYH8, and TPM1, which are involved in actin-myosin filament sliding (Jackson2024Actinnucleation). These interactions suggest a role for MYL11 in the structural and functional dynamics of muscle cells, although further research is needed to elucidate the precise molecular interactions and pathways involving MYL11.
