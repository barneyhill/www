# RHOJ

## Overview
RHOJ is a gene that encodes the protein ras homolog family member J, which is a member of the Rho GTPase family. This protein plays a pivotal role in endothelial cell biology, particularly in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cellular shape, movement, and angiogenesis (Leszczynska2011The). As a GTPase, RHOJ is involved in modulating the formation and disassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions, processes critical for cell migration and motility (Leszczynska2011The). The protein also influences integrin trafficking and interacts with various signaling pathways, including those mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorin 3E (Sema3E), to regulate endothelial cell migration and vascular patterning (Fukushima2020RhoJ; Leszczynska2011The). RHOJ's involvement in these cellular processes underscores its significance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, such as cancer, where it has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis (Ma2023RHOJ; Lu2023Elucidating).

## Function
RHOJ, a member of the Rho GTPase family, plays a crucial role in endothelial cell biology and angiogenesis. It is involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cellular shape and movement, influencing processes such as endothelial motility, tubulogenesis, and lumen formation (Leszczynska2011The). RHOJ modulates the formation and disassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions, which are critical for cell migration. Knockdown of RHOJ leads to increased stress fibers and focal adhesions, while overexpression results in the opposite effect, indicating its role in regulating actomyosin contractility (Leszczynska2011The).

RHOJ also regulates the trafficking of integrins, particularly α5β1 integrin, in endothelial cells. It is involved in the internalization and recycling of active α5β1 integrin, which is crucial for fibronectin remodeling during angiogenesis (Sundararaman2020A; Sundararaman2020RhoJ). RHOJ interacts with the GIT-PIX complex, affecting focal adhesion disassembly and cell motility (Wilson2014RhoJ). Additionally, RHOJ integrates signals from vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorin 3E (Sema3E), influencing endothelial cell migration and vascular patterning (Fukushima2020RhoJ; Leszczynska2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RHOJ gene have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance. In gastric cancer, RHOJ is significantly upregulated in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) subtype, which is associated with high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. RHOJ promotes EMT through the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway, facilitating invasion and metastasis, and its expression is linked to poor patient outcomes (Ma2023RHOJ).

In urothelial carcinoma, high RHOJ expression correlates with poor prognosis, advanced disease stages, and increased monocyte populations in the tumor microenvironment. This suggests a role in immune-related pathways and potential resistance to immunotherapy (Lu2023Elucidating). RHOJ is also associated with cancer metastasis and disease progression due to its involvement in cell migration and angiogenesis (Lu2023Elucidating).

In skin squamous cell carcinoma, RHOJ is a key regulator of EMT-associated chemoresistance, aiding DNA repair and replication, which enhances tumor cell survival during chemotherapy. Targeting RHOJ could potentially overcome chemoresistance, although developing effective inhibitors remains challenging (Liu2023Ras).

These findings underscore the potential of RHOJ as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
RHOJ, a member of the Rho GTPase family, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. It interacts with the GIT-PIX complex, which includes GIT1, GIT2, and b-PIX, playing a crucial role in focal adhesion disassembly. RHOJ's interaction with GIT1 is confirmed through yeast two-hybrid experiments, and it is essential for the recruitment of these proteins to focal adhesions (Wilson2014RhoJ). RHOJ also influences the phosphorylation of GIT2, which is necessary for its recruitment to focal adhesions (Wilson2014RhoJ).

RHOJ interacts with PAK3, a shared effector with Cdc42, and this interaction is significant in regulating fibronectin remodeling during angiogenesis. RHOJ-PAK3 complexes inhibit fibrillogenesis, contrasting with the Cdc42-PAK3 complex, which promotes it (Sundararaman2020A; Sundararaman2020RhoJ). RHOJ also interacts with moesin in glioblastoma multiforme, promoting cell proliferation and migration through the Rac1/PAK pathway (Wang2020Rhoj).

RHOJ is activated by the ITSN1-DH-PH module, which promotes endothelial cell sprouting, indicating a role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling (ColorAparicio2020Endothelial). Additionally, RHOJ is activated by the PDZ-RhoGEF module, which is involved in tumor-induced angiogenesis and metastatic dissemination (CervantesVillagrana2023Oncogenic).
