# CLP1

## Overview
The CLP1 gene encodes the protein cleavage factor polyribonucleotide kinase subunit 1, which is a multifunctional kinase involved in RNA processing. This protein plays a critical role in the maturation of tRNA, mRNA, and siRNA, acting as a component of the tRNA splicing endonuclease (TSEN) complex and participating in mRNA 3' end processing as part of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex. CLP1's enzymatic activity is essential for the phosphorylation of RNA substrates, facilitating their proper processing and maturation. Structurally, CLP1 is characterized by a central polynucleotide kinase domain flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal domains, which are crucial for its function and interactions with other proteins (Weitzer2014CLP1; dikfidan2013structural). Mutations in the CLP1 gene have been linked to neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal neuronal function and preventing neurodegenerative diseases (Karaca2014Human; Schaffer2014CLP1).

## Structure
The CLP1 protein is a multi-domain protein involved in RNA processing, specifically as a polynucleotide kinase. Its structure includes a central polynucleotide kinase (PNK) domain flanked by N-terminal (NtD) and C-terminal (CtD) domains. The NtD is a beta-sheet sandwich that contributes to ATP binding and is involved in regulatory functions (dikfidan2013structural). The PNK domain contains conserved motifs such as the P-loop and Walker B motif, which are crucial for ATP binding and catalysis (dikfidan2013structural). The CtD is a mix of alpha-helices and beta-strands, playing a role in protein-protein interactions and enzyme specificity (dikfidan2013structural).

The ATP-binding site is obstructed by the NtD, which differentiates CLP1 from other PNKs with an open ATP-binding site (dikfidan2013structural). The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by a complex arrangement of these domains, with the NtD and CtD being essential for its enzymatic activity (dikfidan2013structural). CLP1's structure is distinct from other PNKs, with unique features such as the LID module and clasp motif, which are involved in RNA binding and enzymatic activity (dikfidan2013structural). The protein can phosphorylate both single and double-stranded RNAs, with structural models explaining its selectivity (dikfidan2013structural).

## Function
The CLP1 gene encodes a multifunctional kinase involved in the maturation of tRNA, mRNA, and siRNA in healthy human cells. CLP1 is a component of the tRNA splicing endonuclease (TSEN) complex, which is responsible for recognizing and cleaving pre-tRNA molecules at exon-intron boundaries, a crucial step in tRNA maturation. CLP1 specifically phosphorylates the 5' end of tRNA exons, facilitating the subsequent ligation of tRNA halves, which is essential for maintaining the balance of mature tRNAs and preventing the accumulation of unspliced pre-tRNAs (Weitzer2014CLP1; Schaffer2014CLP1).

In addition to its role in tRNA processing, CLP1 is involved in mRNA 3' end processing as part of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex. It participates in the cleavage of pre-mRNAs and is essential for mRNA 3' end cleavage, although not for polyadenylation. CLP1 interacts with various components of the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery, forming the mRNA cleavage factor II m (CF II m) complex and bridging CF I m with CPSF (Weitzer2014CLP1).

CLP1's activity is crucial for proper cellular function and organismal development, particularly in maintaining normal neuronal function and preventing neurodegenerative disorders (Karaca2014Human; Schaffer2014CLP1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLP1 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, most notably pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 10 (PCH10). This condition is characterized by developmental delays, motor dysfunction, and neurodegeneration. The R140H mutation in CLP1, identified as a founder mutation in several consanguineous Turkish families, leads to progressive brain atrophy, microcephaly, and cerebellar volume loss. Patients exhibit symptoms such as failure to develop motor skills, delayed speech, progressive spasticity, and epileptic seizures (Schaffer2014CLP1).

The R140H mutation impairs the interaction of CLP1 with the tRNA splicing endonuclease (TSEN) complex, reducing pre-tRNA cleavage activity and leading to the accumulation of unspliced pre-tRNAs. This defect is linked to cortical dysgenesis and microcephaly, affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems (Karaca2014Human). In addition, the mutation results in heightened sensitivity to oxidative stress, which may contribute to the observed neurodegenerative phenotypes (Schaffer2014CLP1).

Animal models, including mice and zebrafish, with similar CLP1 mutations exhibit neurodegenerative symptoms, such as motor neuron loss and cerebellar defects, further supporting the role of CLP1 in neurological health (Hanada2013CLP1; Schaffer2014CLP1).

## Interactions
The human CLP1 protein is involved in several critical interactions within the mRNA 3' end processing complex. It forms part of the mRNA cleavage factor II m (CF II m) complex by associating with the PCF11 subunit and interacts with other components such as CF I m and the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), effectively bridging these complexes (Weitzer2014CLP1). CLP1's interaction with Pcf11 is characterized by both polar and apolar interactions, with a significant amount of buried surface area at the interface, indicating a stable interaction (Noble2006Structure). The Clp1-binding domain of Pcf11 consists of a region of around 25 amino acids, and the interaction is conserved across species, suggesting its importance in 3' end processing complexes (Noble2006Structure).

CLP1 also interacts with the cap-binding complex (CBC) via ARS2, promoting 3' end processing events (Weitzer2014CLP1). In addition to its role in mRNA processing, CLP1 is associated with the TSEN complex, which is involved in tRNA splicing. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the TSEN complex, necessary for efficient pre-tRNA cleavage (Weitzer2014CLP1).
