# CDC42

## Overview
CDC42 is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein belonging to the Rho family, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes. The protein, known as cell division cycle 42, functions as a molecular switch, cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states, thereby regulating the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and influencing cell shape and motility (Nobes1995Rho). As a key regulator of cell polarity, CDC42 is involved in epithelial morphogenesis, immune cell signaling, and neuronal development (Pichaud2019Regulation; Melendez2011Signaling). Structurally, CDC42 is characterized by a classical G-domain fold typical of the Ras superfamily, and it undergoes post-translational modifications such as prenylation, which are essential for its membrane association and function (Hakoshima2003Structural; Nassar1998Structures). Mutations in the CDC42 gene have been implicated in several human diseases, including Takenouchi-Kosaki syndrome and NOCARH syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance in developmental and immune-related disorders (Bucciol2020Systemic; Lam2019A).

## Structure
The CDC42 protein is a small GTPase of the Rho family, characterized by a classical G-domain fold typical of the Ras superfamily, which includes a six-stranded beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices (Hakoshima2003Structural; Nassar1998Structures). The primary structure of CDC42 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains crucial for its function, such as the GTP-binding domain. This domain is involved in the protein's role as a molecular switch, cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states (Hakoshima2003Structural).

The tertiary structure of CDC42 is compact and globular, allowing it to interact with various effector proteins. Notably, the protein interacts with the GTPase-binding domain of the cell polarity protein Par6, forming a complex that involves the semi-CRIB motif and the PDZ domain of Par6, which acts as a structural scaffold (Garrard2003Structure). The quaternary structure involves interactions with other proteins, such as Cdc42GAP, which stabilizes the switch I and II regions of CDC42 (Nassar1998Structures).

Post-translational modifications, such as prenylation at the C-terminal CAAX box, are crucial for CDC42's membrane association and function (Nassar1998Structures). These structural features and modifications enable CDC42 to play a vital role in cell signaling and polarity.

## Function
The CDC42 gene encodes a small GTPase of the Rho family, which functions as a molecular switch in various cellular processes. In its active GTP-bound state, CDC42 regulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, promoting the formation of filopodia, which are essential for cell motility and shape (Nobes1995Rho). CDC42 is involved in epithelial morphogenesis, influencing apical membrane morphogenesis, lumen formation, and junction maturation, which are crucial for maintaining cell polarity and tissue integrity (Pichaud2019Regulation).

In the immune system, CDC42 transduces signals to the cytoskeleton, affecting the formation of dendritic spines and synapses in neurons, and is involved in T cell homeostasis and B cell precursor differentiation (Melendez2011Signaling). It also plays a role in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell quiescence and differentiation, influencing transcriptional programs critical for blood development (Melendez2011Signaling).

CDC42 is active at the plasma membrane, where it coordinates endocytosis and exocytosis, impacting cellular trafficking and membrane dynamics (EtienneManneville2004Cdc42). It interacts with various proteins, including PAR-6 and aPKC, to regulate cell junctions and polarity, contributing to the spatial organization of cells (Pichaud2019Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDC42 gene are associated with a range of human diseases, primarily due to its role in cell signaling and cytoskeletal organization. Takenouchi-Kosaki syndrome is one such condition, characterized by developmental delay, macrothrombocytopenia, and distinctive facial features. This syndrome is linked to various CDC42 mutations, including the p.Tyr64Cys variant (Bucciol2020Systemic; Kashani2021Progressive). 

Another significant disorder associated with CDC42 mutations is NOCARH syndrome, which involves neonatal-onset cytopenia, autoinflammation, rash, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). This condition is linked to the p.Arg186Cys mutation, which affects immune cell function and actin cytoskeleton remodeling (Lam2019A). 

CDC42 mutations can also lead to severe autoinflammatory responses, as seen in patients with C-terminal variants of the gene. These patients often present with symptoms like cytopenias and rashes, and treatment with IL-1β inhibitors has shown clinical improvement (Gernez2019Severe). 

The p.Cys81Tyr mutation in CDC42 has been associated with syndromic immunodeficiency, autoinflammation, and malignancy, highlighting the gene's role in immune regulation and its potential link to cancer (SzczawinskaPoplonyk2020A).

## Interactions
CDC42, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate the actin cytoskeleton and cell signaling pathways. It interacts with several proteins containing the CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) motif, such as PAK, WASP, and IQGAP1, which are crucial for its role in cytoskeletal reorganization and activation of the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway (Burbelo1995A; Aspenström1997A). 

CDC42 also binds to the GTPase-binding domain of ACK, leading to significant conformational changes that stabilize the switch I and II regions of CDC42, which are flexible in its free state (Mott1999Structure). The interaction with ACK involves specific hydrophobic contacts, such as between Leu174 in CDC42 and Leu505 in ACK (Mott1999Structure).

Another interaction involves the cell polarity protein Par6, which uses a semi-CRIB motif and an adjacent PDZ domain to bind CDC42. This interaction induces conformational changes in Par6, affecting its function in cell polarity (Garrard2003Structure). 

CDC42 also interacts with CIP4, a protein that influences actin cytoskeleton organization. This interaction is GTP-dependent and does not affect the intrinsic GTPase activity of CDC42 (Aspenström1997A).
