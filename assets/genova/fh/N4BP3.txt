# N4BP3

## Overview
N4BP3 (NEDD4 binding protein 3) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a member of the Fezzin family. The N4BP3 protein is characterized by its central coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal Fez1 domain, and it plays a significant role in cellular signaling, particularly in neural development and antiviral responses. Unlike other proteins in its family, N4BP3 lacks a classic PDZ domain-binding motif, which suggests a unique functional role. It acts as an adaptor protein, interacting with the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, and is involved in axonal and dendritic branching, crucial for neuronal network formation. Additionally, N4BP3 is a positive regulator of the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, enhancing the antiviral response by promoting the polyubiquitination of MAVS. Mutations in the N4BP3 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and ocular defects, highlighting its clinical significance (Schmeisser2013The; Kiem2017The; Wang2021N4BP3).

## Structure
N4BP3 (NEDD4 binding protein 3) is a protein consisting of 537 amino acids and is a member of the Fezzin family. It features a central coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal Fez1 domain, which is the least conserved among its family members (Schmeisser2013The). The protein also contains a highly conserved PY domain, characterized by a PPxY consensus sequence, which mediates interaction with the WW domains of the Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase (Murillas2002Identification; Schmeisser2013The). This interaction is crucial for the protein's role in cellular signaling and localization, as N4BP3 is known to colocalize with Nedd4 in cytoplasmic vesicles (Léon2009Ubiquitin).

Unlike other Fezzin family members, N4BP3 lacks a classic PDZ domain-binding motif at the C-terminus, possessing instead a rudimentary motif (-SSKI) (Schmeisser2013The). N4BP3 is not a substrate for ubiquitylation by Nedd4, indicating a unique functional role compared to other Nedd4-binding proteins (Murillas2002Identification). The protein's structure and domain composition suggest its involvement in neuronal development, particularly in axonal and dendritic branching (Schmeisser2013The). The molecular structure of N4BP3, including its specific domains, plays a significant role in its interaction with other proteins and its function in cellular processes.

## Function
N4BP3 (NEDD4 binding protein 3) is involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in neural development and antiviral signaling. In the context of neural development, N4BP3 plays a significant role in axonal and dendritic branching, which is essential for the formation of neuronal networks. It acts as an adaptor protein interacting with the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4, facilitating the proper wiring and synaptic strength of neuronal circuits. N4BP3 is enriched in growth cones, axons, and dendrites, and is present at a significant percentage of axonal and dendritic branching points, indicating its importance in neurite branching and circuit formation (Schmeisser2013The).

In antiviral signaling, N4BP3 functions as a positive regulator of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway. It enhances the polyubiquitination of MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein), a key component in the virus-induced innate immune response. N4BP3 strengthens the interaction between MAVS and TRAF2, promoting the activation of NF-κB and the production of downstream antiviral factors. This activity underscores its role in stabilizing the MAVS and TRAF2 complex, thereby enhancing the antiviral response (Wang2021N4BP3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the N4BP3 gene have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. A potentially pathogenic missense mutation in N4BP3 has been linked to a developmental disorder in humans characterized by thoracolumbar scoliosis, seizures, somnolence, abnormal neuronal migration, and profound intellectual disability (Kiem2017The). The gene's role in neural development, particularly in axonal and dendritic branching, suggests that disruptions in its function could impact neuronal circuit formation, potentially leading to neurodevelopmental issues (Schmeisser2013The).

N4BP3 is also implicated in ocular defects and other developmental abnormalities. Its depletion affects the expression of eye and brain marker genes such as pax6 and rax, which are associated with eye abnormalities in humans (Kiem2017The). The gene's involvement in neural crest cell migration and cranial cartilage development further supports its potential link to conditions like DiGeorge syndrome and Treacher-Collins syndrome, which are related to neural crest dysfunctions (Kiem2017The).

Additionally, N4BP3 plays a role in the RIG-I-like receptor antiviral signaling pathway, and its alteration could affect immune responses to viral infections, although specific clinical implications of this function are not detailed (Wang2021N4BP3).

## Interactions
N4BP3 (NEDD4 binding protein 3) is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in both antiviral signaling and neuronal development. In the context of antiviral signaling, N4BP3 interacts with the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and enhances its K63-linked polyubiquitination, a process that is crucial for the activation of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway. This interaction is further strengthened by the presence of the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, forming a complex that shows a stronger interaction with MAVS compared to NEDD4 or N4BP3 alone. N4BP3 also facilitates the interaction between MAVS and TRAF2, promoting the polyubiquitination of TRAF2 and stabilizing the MAVS-TRAF2 complex, which positively regulates the RIG-I-MAVS antiviral signal (Wang2021N4BP3).

In neuronal development, N4BP3 interacts with the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 through a PY domain, acting as an adaptor protein rather than a ubiquitylation substrate. This interaction is crucial for axonal and dendritic branching in developing neurons. N4BP3 is localized in early neurites, growth cones, axons, and dendrites, and its knockdown results in reduced axonal and dendritic complexity, highlighting its essential role in nerve cell development (Schmeisser2013The).
