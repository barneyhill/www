# NME2

## Overview
NME2, also known as NM23-H2, is a gene that encodes the protein NME/NM23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2, a member of the nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) family. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular nucleotide metabolism by catalyzing the transfer of phosphate groups from nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside diphosphates, thereby maintaining nucleotide balance within cells (Steeg2011A). NME2 is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction, and it functions as a transcription factor and a kinase (Prunier2023Mechanisms; Desvignes2009Nme). The protein is known for its ability to form hexameric structures, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and interactions with other proteins (Radić2020The). NME2 is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including cancer metastasis suppression, cardiovascular function, and congenital disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Hsu2015Progress; Thakur2014Nonmetastatic).

## Structure
NME2, also known as NM23-H2, is a member of the nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular nucleotide pools. The primary structure of NME2 consists of a sequence of 152 amino acids, with 18 differences compared to its homolog NME1, resulting in NME2 being a basic protein (Radić2020The). The secondary structure of NME2 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of NDPK family proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

NME2 forms hexameric structures, which are essential for its function as an NDP kinase. These hexamers can be homohexamers or heterohexamers when combined with NME1, with heterohexamers being more common (Radić2020The). The quaternary structure of NME2 is crucial for its enzymatic activity and interaction with other proteins, such as the Gβ subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins and the K Ca 3.1 potassium channel (Radić2020The).

NME2 is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and transcriptional regulation, and it may undergo post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions (Schlattner2021The).

## Function
NME2, also known as NME/NM23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2, is involved in several critical cellular processes. It encodes a nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) that plays a role in nucleotide metabolism by transferring phosphate groups from nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside diphosphates, maintaining nucleotide balance within cells (Steeg2011A). NME2 is widely expressed in adult tissues and is involved in cell differentiation and proliferation. It acts as a transcription factor, initially identified as the PuF transcription factor, which recognizes a nuclease hypersensitive site (NHE) motif in the c-myc promoter, stimulating transcription (Desvignes2009Nme).

NME2 is also implicated in signal transduction pathways, including G-protein signaling, where it associates with Gβγ dimers of heterotrimeric G proteins (Steeg2011A). It provides GTP to dynamins at the plasma membrane, crucial for endocytosis, suggesting a role in attenuating signaling by receptors on the cell surface (Prunier2023Mechanisms). NME2 is involved in various physiological functions such as bioenergetics, cytoskeleton and membrane dynamics, and development (Prunier2023Mechanisms). It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and development (Thakur2011Mechanisms).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NME2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and congenital disorders. In the context of cleft lip and palate (CLP), disruptions in the interaction between IRF6 and NME2, due to mutations such as the G71V variant in NME2, have been associated with the condition. This variant is rare and not found in major genetic databases, suggesting a pathogenic role in CLP (ParadaSanchez2017Disrupted).

In cancer, NME2 is recognized for its role in metastasis suppression. Reduced expression of NME2 is linked to advanced stages of lung cancer and poorer patient outcomes. Studies have shown that higher NME2 expression correlates with enhanced survival rates in lung cancer patients, indicating its critical role in suppressing metastasis (Thakur2014Nonmetastatic). NME2 also interacts with telomerase, inhibiting its activity and potentially contributing to metastasis suppression by modulating telomere length (Kar2014Inhibition).

Furthermore, NME2's involvement in cardiovascular diseases is noted, where it regulates cardiac contractility and angiogenesis. Deficiencies in NME2 can lead to impaired heart function and angiogenesis defects (Hsu2015Progress). These findings underscore the clinical significance of NME2 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
NME2, also known as NM23-H2, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in cellular processes. NME2 binds to DNA, particularly guanine-rich sequences, and is involved in the transcriptional activation of the c-myc gene through specific electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds with guanine nucleobases (Dexheimer2009NM23H2). It also associates with telomere ends and telomerase, reducing telomerase activity and potentially influencing telomere maintenance (Kar2011Metastases).

NME2 interacts with telomeric repeat binding factors such as TRF1 and TRF2, and the catalytic subunit of telomerase, TERT, suggesting a role in telomere biology and suppression of telomerase activity (Vlatković2014Janusfaces). It forms complexes with βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins, contributing to G protein activation (Adam2020NME/NM23/NDPK). NME2 also interacts with the CFTR chloride channel, influencing chloride secretion in epithelial cells (Attwood2018The).

In cancer biology, NME2 is secreted by metastatic breast carcinoma cells and is involved in promoting endothelial cell migration and proliferation, impacting tumor growth and metastasis (Romani2018Extracellular). It also interacts with the MDM2 oncoprotein, affecting cell motility and invasion (Vlatković2014Janusfaces).
