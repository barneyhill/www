# ZNF337

## Overview
ZNF337 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 337, which functions primarily as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its binding to DNA and enable it to regulate the expression of various genes. As a transcription factor, zinc finger protein 337 is involved in complex regulatory networks that influence gene expression and cellular processes, including RNA splicing and transcription regulation (Zhang2024Comprehensive). The gene has been implicated in several diseases, notably in cancer, where it serves as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, and in neurological disorders such as focal cortical dysplasia type II (Zhang2020Somatic; Zhang2024Comprehensive). The study of ZNF337 and its encoded protein continues to provide insights into its role in health and disease, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF337 has been implicated in various diseases due to mutations and alterations in its expression levels. In the context of cancer, ZNF337 is identified as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. It is highly expressed in several tumor types, including kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), where its high expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor proliferation and migration (Zhang2024Comprehensive). The study highlights that ZNF337 expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint gene expression, suggesting its involvement in the tumor immune environment (Zhang2024Comprehensive).

In addition to its role in cancer, ZNF337 has been associated with focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII), a malformation of cortical development linked to drug-resistant epilepsy in children. Somatic variants in ZNF337 were identified in FCDII lesions, although its specific role in the pathogenesis of this condition requires further investigation (Zhang2020Somatic). These findings suggest that ZNF337 may play a significant role in both oncological and neurological disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ZNF337, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a transcription factor. The study by Zhang et al. utilized the STRING and GEPIA databases to predict proteins that interact with ZNF337, constructing a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network with a focus on low confidence interaction scores and a maximum of 50 interactors in the first shell. This network was visualized using Cytoscape, and the interactions were supported by evidence from experiments, text mining, and databases (Zhang2024Comprehensive).

The PPI network analysis identified several proteins that are correlated with ZNF337, including NPIPA1, NEURL4, ZNF767P, EZH1, and NRF1. These proteins are involved in processes such as RNA splicing and transcription regulation, indicating that ZNF337 may play a role in these biological pathways (Zhang2024Comprehensive). The study also highlighted the involvement of ZNF337 in substrate-specific channel activity and serine-type peptidase activity, as revealed by functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes associated with ZNF337 in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (Zhang2024Comprehensive). These interactions suggest that ZNF337 participates in complex regulatory networks that influence gene expression and cellular processes.
