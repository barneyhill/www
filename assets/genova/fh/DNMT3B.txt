# DNMT3B

## Overview
DNMT3B is a gene that encodes the protein DNA methyltransferase 3 beta, a member of the DNA methyltransferase family responsible for de novo DNA methylation. This protein plays a pivotal role in establishing and maintaining DNA methylation patterns, which are crucial for regulating gene expression, genomic stability, and cellular differentiation. DNA methyltransferase 3 beta is characterized by its ability to add methyl groups to cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides, a process essential during early embryonic development and in somatic cells. The protein is involved in the methylation of centromeric and pericentromeric regions, as well as gene bodies, contributing to gene silencing and chromatin structure regulation. DNMT3B's activity is modulated through interactions with other proteins, chromatin remodeling complexes, and histone modifications, highlighting its complex regulatory mechanisms (Gagliardi2018DNMT3B; Gao2020Comprehensive). Mutations in DNMT3B are linked to various diseases, including Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability, and Facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome, and its dysregulation is implicated in cancer pathogenesis (Walton2014Dnmt3b; Ehrlich2008ICF).

## Structure
DNMT3B is a de novo DNA methyltransferase involved in establishing DNA methylation patterns. The protein consists of several domains, including a PWWP domain, an ADD (ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L) domain, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The PWWP domain is part of the 'Royal' superfamily and is responsible for recognizing the histone H3K36me3 mark through an aromatic cage formed by residues such as Phe236, Trp239, and Trp263 (Rondelet2016Structural). This domain has an anti-parallel β-barrel-like fold with five β-strands and a short 3_10 helix (Rondelet2016Structural).

The catalytic domain of DNMT3B contains several conserved motifs crucial for its enzymatic activity, including motifs I, IV, VI, VIII, IX, and X, which are involved in DNA binding and S-adenosylmethionine cofactor binding (Weisenberger2004Role). The protein forms homo-oligomers and heterotetramers with DNMT3L, with the latter involving more extensive intermolecular contacts and structural ordering of the catalytic loop (Gao2022Structure).

DNMT3B is expressed in multiple splice variants, some of which are catalytically inactive, such as DNMT3B3, which lacks certain motifs and may act as a regulator of DNA methylation (Zeng2020The). These structural features and variants contribute to DNMT3B's role in DNA methylation and its regulation.

## Function
DNMT3B is a de novo DNA methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in establishing DNA methylation patterns during early embryonic development and in somatic cells. It is responsible for adding methyl groups to the C-5 position of cytosine within CpG dinucleotides, influencing gene expression, genomic stability, and cell differentiation (Gao2020Comprehensive). DNMT3B is particularly important for methylating centromeric, pericentromeric, and subtelomeric repeats, as well as intragenic regions of active genes, contributing to long-term gene silencing and the repression of alternative promoters and transcription factor binding sites (Gagliardi2018DNMT3B).

In somatic cells, DNMT3B functions as both a methyltransferase and an accessory protein, interacting with DNMT3A to maintain DNA methylation patterns in gene bodies (Duymich2016DNMT3B). It is recruited to genomic targets through interactions with chromatin remodeling complexes, histone modifications, and transcription factors, which regulate its binding specificity (Gagliardi2018DNMT3B). DNMT3B's activity is also associated with the regulation of alternative splicing and the repression of spurious transcription within genes, maintaining genomic stability and proper gene expression patterns (Gagliardi2018DNMT3B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNMT3B gene are primarily associated with Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability, and Facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by immune defects, chromosomal instability, facial abnormalities, and mental retardation. DNMT3B mutations, often missense mutations, lead to hypomethylation of satellite DNA in specific chromosomal regions, contributing to gene dysregulation and the clinical features of ICF syndrome (Hansen1999The; Jin2007DNA; Ehrlich2008ICF).

In cancer, DNMT3B is frequently over-expressed or present in splice variants, leading to abnormal gene regulation. These alterations are linked to hypomethylation of germ line genes and centromeric regions, contributing to chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis (Walton2014Dnmt3b). The reduced activity of DNMT3B in cancer is associated with accelerated tumorigenesis, and some splice variants may act as dominant-negative isoforms, affecting methylation patterns (Walton2014Dnmt3b).

DNMT3B mutations also result in the loss of repressive histone modifications and gains in transcriptionally active histone marks, affecting the expression of genes critical for immune function, development, and neurogenesis (Jin2007DNA). These epigenetic changes underscore the gene's role in various diseases characterized by methylation defects.

## Interactions
DNMT3B interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in DNA methylation and chromatin structure regulation. It forms complexes with DNMT3L, enhancing its methyltransferase activity, and interacts with the NFkB-p65 transcription factor, forming a multiprotein complex that targets specific DNA sequences for methylation (Pacaud2014DNMT3L). DNMT3B also associates with components of the mitotic chromosome condensation machinery, including KIF4A, hSNF2H, hCAP-C, and hCAP-G, suggesting a role in chromosomal condensation during mitosis (Geiman2004Isolation).

The protein interacts with CENP-C at centromeres, influencing DNA methylation and histone modification at these regions, which is crucial for chromosomal stability (Gopalakrishnan2009DNMT3B). DNMT3B's recruitment to genomic targets is regulated by interactions with chromatin remodeling complexes and histone modifications, such as H3K36me3, which recruits DNMT3B to gene bodies (Gagliardi2018DNMT3B). It also interacts with transcription factors like E2F6, which positively regulate its recruitment, while CTCF and SP1 act as negative regulators (Gagliardi2018DNMT3B). Non-coding RNAs, such as pRNA, influence DNMT3B activity by forming DNA:RNA triplexes that stabilize its binding, while RNAs with high GC skew form R-loops that inhibit DNMT3B binding (Gagliardi2018DNMT3B).
