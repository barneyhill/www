# ABRA

## Overview
ABRA, or actin-binding Rho activating protein, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component for maintaining cellular structure and facilitating movement. The protein encoded by ABRA is categorized as an actin-binding protein, which plays a pivotal role in muscle tissue, particularly in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells. It functions by binding to actin filaments, thereby stabilizing the cytoskeleton and influencing muscle-specific gene transcription through the myocardin-related transcription factor A/serum response factor (MRTF-A/SRF) pathway (Arai2002STARS; Wallace2012The). This pathway is essential for muscle cell proliferation, differentiation, and growth. Additionally, ABRA is implicated in vascular remodeling and arteriogenesis, particularly in response to fluid shear stress, by activating Rho signaling and promoting actin polymerization (Troidl2009ActinBinding).

## Function
ABRA, also known as actin-binding Rho activating protein, plays a significant role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape and facilitating motility. It is highly expressed in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle tissues, where it binds to actin filaments and stabilizes the actin cytoskeleton (Arai2002STARS; Wallace2012The). ABRA influences muscle-specific gene transcription by modulating actin dynamics through the myocardin-related transcription factor A/serum response factor (MRTF-A/SRF) pathway, which is essential for muscle cell proliferation, differentiation, and growth (Wallace2012The; Lamon2014The).

In muscle cells, ABRA is localized to the sarcomere, particularly around the Z-disk and M-line, where it enhances actin polymerization by promoting the binding of G-actin to F-actin. This process facilitates the translocation of MRTF-A to the nucleus, where it associates with SRF to activate transcription of target genes (Wallace2012The). ABRA's activity is regulated by actin-binding LIM (ABLIM) protein family members, which enhance its SRF activation (Wallace2012The).

ABRA is also involved in arteriogenesis, particularly in response to fluid shear stress, where it is upregulated in growing collateral arteries. It stimulates SRF-dependent transcription through RhoA and actin polymerization, contributing to vascular remodeling and smooth muscle cell proliferation (Troidl2009ActinBinding).

## Interactions
ABRA, also known as actin binding Rho activating protein, interacts with several proteins to mediate its effects on actin dynamics and signaling pathways. It binds to actin, which is crucial for its role in the nuclear translocation of MAL-GFP during Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infection. This interaction is necessary for the activation of serum response factor (SRF) and the transcription of SRF target genes involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation (Heath2011Bacterial).

ABRA also interacts with FLRT3, a novel activator of SRF. The knockdown of FLRT3 significantly reduces ABRA-induced nuclear accumulation of MAL-GFP, indicating that FLRT3 functions downstream of ABRA in the signaling pathway. This suggests a model where ABRA and FLRT3 are part of a signaling cascade that links bacterial infection to changes in host cell actin dynamics and transcriptional responses (Heath2011Bacterial).

In the context of arteriogenesis, ABRA is involved in activating Rho signaling, which influences actin dynamics and initiates SRF-dependent gene transcription. This interaction is crucial for smooth muscle cell proliferation and collateral growth in response to fluid shear stress (Troidl2009ActinBinding).
