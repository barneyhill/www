# TMEM237

## Overview
TMEM237 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 237, which is a member of the tetraspanin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its four transmembrane domains and is primarily associated with the primary cilium, a critical cellular organelle involved in signal transduction. TMEM237 plays a significant role in the functionality and stability of the intestinal riboflavin transporter-3 (hRFVT-3), enhancing riboflavin uptake in human intestinal epithelial cells. It is also a component of the ciliary transition zone, interacting with other proteins to maintain ciliary structure and function. Mutations in the TMEM237 gene are linked to ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome and Meckel-Gruber syndrome, highlighting its importance in ciliary biology and its impact on human health (BenSalem2014Mutation; Lambacher2015TMEM107; Sabui2019Identification).

## Structure
The TMEM237 protein, encoded by the ALS2CR4 gene, is a 408 amino acid long protein characterized by a long amino (NH2)-terminal domain, four transmembrane domains, and a short carboxy (COOH)-terminal tail (Sabui2019Identification). These transmembrane domains are integral to its role in cellular signaling and structure, particularly in the context of its interaction with the intestinal riboflavin transporter-3 (hRFVT-3) (Sabui2019Identification). The protein is abundantly expressed in the human native small and large intestine and in various human-derived intestinal epithelial cell lines (Sabui2019Identification).

TMEM237 is associated with the primary cilium, a cellular organelle important for signal transduction, suggesting its involvement in ciliary function (Sabui20191095). While the context does not provide specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of TMEM237, it is noted that the protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could influence its function and interactions (Sabui20191095). Variants or isoforms of TMEM237 may exist due to alternative splicing, potentially affecting its structure and role in cellular processes (Sabui20191095).

## Function
TMEM237 is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the functionality and stability of the intestinal riboflavin transporter-3 (hRFVT-3) in human intestinal epithelial cells. It enhances riboflavin uptake by co-localizing and interacting with hRFVT-3, as demonstrated by increased riboflavin uptake in cells co-expressing both proteins. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a direct interaction between TMEM237 and hRFVT-3 (Sabui2019Identification). TMEM237 stabilizes hRFVT-3, increasing its half-life and presence at the cell surface, which supports its role in enhancing riboflavin uptake (Sabui2019Identification).

TMEM237 expression is modulated by inflammatory and metabolic factors; it decreases with TNF-α treatment, which inhibits riboflavin uptake, and increases with butyrate treatment, which enhances riboflavin uptake (Sabui2019Identification). This suggests that TMEM237 is involved in maintaining riboflavin absorption and transporter stability, highlighting its importance in cellular physiology. The protein is also part of the tetraspanin superfamily, which is involved in regulating signaling pathways related to cell adhesion, migration, and fusion (BenSalem2014Mutation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM237 gene are linked to ciliopathies, a group of disorders caused by defects in ciliary function. Notably, TMEM237 mutations are associated with Joubert syndrome and Meckel-Gruber syndrome. These conditions are characterized by a range of developmental abnormalities due to disrupted ciliary signaling pathways. Joubert syndrome is primarily identified by neurological symptoms, including hypotonia, ataxia, and developmental delays, often accompanied by distinctive facial features and eye movement abnormalities. In some cases, renal and hepatic symptoms may also be present, reflecting the gene's role in ciliary function across multiple organ systems.

Meckel-Gruber syndrome, another ciliopathy associated with TMEM237 mutations, is a more severe condition that often results in perinatal lethality. It is characterized by a triad of symptoms: occipital encephalocele, polycystic kidneys, and polydactyly. The involvement of TMEM237 in these syndromes underscores its critical role in maintaining normal ciliary function and signaling. Disruptions in these pathways due to TMEM237 mutations lead to the diverse and severe phenotypic manifestations observed in these ciliopathies. The study of TMEM237 and its associated conditions continues to provide insights into the complex mechanisms of ciliary biology and its impact on human health.

## Interactions
TMEM237 is known to interact with the intestinal riboflavin transporter-3 (hRFVT-3), as identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal imaging studies. This interaction enhances riboflavin uptake in human intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting a functional role in riboflavin transport (Sabui2019Identification). TMEM237 also stabilizes hRFVT-3, increasing its half-life and functionality (Sabui2019Identification).

In the context of ciliary biology, TMEM237 is a component of the transition zone (TZ) in primary cilia and interacts with other proteins within this complex. It is associated with the MKS module proteins, including TMEM107, TMEM216, TMEM231, and MKS1, as part of the ciliary transition zone architecture (Lambacher2015TMEM107; Van2021TMEM218). These interactions are crucial for organizing the ciliary transition zone and maintaining ciliary function. TMEM237's role in the TZ is significant for ciliary signaling and structure, contributing to the assembly and stability of the ciliary complex (Lambacher2015TMEM107).
