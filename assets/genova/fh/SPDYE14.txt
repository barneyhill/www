# SPDYE14

## Overview
SPDYE14 is a gene that encodes the protein known as speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member E14. This protein is part of the speedy/RINGO family, which is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. Members of this family are known to play crucial roles in cell cycle progression by interacting with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), thereby influencing various cellular processes such as cell division and proliferation. The SPDYE14 gene, through its encoded protein, may have implications in understanding cell cycle dynamics and its dysregulation in diseases such as cancer. Further research into SPDYE14 could provide insights into its specific functions and potential as a therapeutic target.
