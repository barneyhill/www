# SMIM42

## Overview
SMIM42 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 42, a protein characterized by its small size and presence of a transmembrane helix. This protein is encoded by a small open reading frame (smORF) and consists of 70 amino acids, with a sequence that is conserved across many placental mammals, although it has been lost in some lineages. The predicted transmembrane helix suggests that SMIM42 functions as an integral membrane protein, a classification supported by its structural features, despite the lack of mass spectrometry evidence for its translation (Whited2024Biophysical). The precise biological function and clinical significance of SMIM42 remain to be elucidated, as current research has not yet detailed its role in cellular processes or its interactions with other proteins.

## Structure
The SMIM42 protein is a small human protein encoded by a small open reading frame (smORF) and consists of 70 amino acids. Its primary structure is characterized by a sequence that is conserved in many placental mammals, although it has been lost in several lineages (Whited2024Biophysical). The secondary structure of SMIM42 includes a predicted transmembrane helix that is 21 amino acids in length, as identified by DeepTMHMM. This feature suggests that SMIM42 is likely an integral membrane protein, supporting its annotation as protein-coding despite the ambiguous PhyloCSF score (Whited2024Biophysical).

The presence of a transmembrane helix is a significant structural feature, as it is common among non-random small proteins (NR-SEPs) and is absent in negative or random controls, indicating a potential functional role for SMIM42 (Whited2024Biophysical). However, there is no mass spectrometry evidence of translation, which adds to the uncertainty regarding its functional status (Whited2024Biophysical). The tertiary and quaternary structures, as well as any post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, have not been detailed in the available literature.
