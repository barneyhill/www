# ACSS2

## Overview
The ACSS2 gene encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 2, which plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism by converting acetate into acetyl-CoA. This enzyme is categorized as a synthetase and is integral to various metabolic pathways, including lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. ACSS2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences gene expression and chromatin remodeling through histone acetylation. The protein's ability to translocate to the nucleus under stress conditions allows it to provide acetyl-CoA for transcriptional regulation, impacting processes such as autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. ACSS2's interactions with transcription factors and coactivators further underscore its role as a metabolic integrator, transitioning between cytoplasmic and nuclear functions. Its involvement in cancer metabolism, particularly under hypoxic conditions, highlights its potential as a therapeutic target (Moffett2020Acetate; Schug2015AcetylCoA; Vasudevan2023Acss2).

## Structure
The ACSS2 protein, also known as acetate-dependent acetyl-CoA synthetase 2, is involved in the conversion of acetate into acetyl-CoA. Structurally, ACSS2 contains multiple domains that contribute to its function and stability. The protein includes a highly conserved Acss2 basic conserved (ABC) domain, which plays a crucial role in maintaining protein stability through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (Nagati2021Mammalian). The ABC domain is part of the carboxy terminal hinge region, which is essential for enzymatic function and subcellular localization (Nagati2019A).

ACSS2 also contains protein destabilization elements (PDEs) such as the degron homology region (DHR) and the β-E2 region, which are involved in regulating protein stability and degradation (Nagati2021Mammalian). These PDEs are characterized by their short length and lack of clearly defining features, similar to degrons recognized by the anaphase-promoting complex (Nagati2021Mammalian).

Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, are known to affect the stability and function of ACSS2. These modifications can influence the protein's enzymatic activity and its ability to translocate to the nucleus under stress conditions (Nagati2021Mammalian). The presence of multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing has been suggested, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
The ACSS2 gene encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in cellular metabolism by converting acetate into acetyl-CoA, a key molecule involved in various metabolic pathways. In healthy human cells, ACSS2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences lipid metabolism, gene expression regulation, and energy homeostasis (Moffett2020Acetate). 

In the nucleus, ACSS2 provides acetyl-CoA on-demand for histone acetylation, which is crucial for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. This process facilitates the opening of chromatin, allowing transcriptional enzyme complexes access to DNA, and is essential for the acetylation of transcription factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha (HIF-2α) (Vasudevan2023Acss2; Moffett2020Acetate). ACSS2 also interacts with transcriptional coactivators like p300 and CREB binding protein (CBP), supporting their activity in histone and transcription factor acetylation (Vasudevan2023Acss2).

ACSS2's role extends to the regulation of autophagy by associating with lysosomal and autophagosomal gene promoter regions, promoting autophagic gene expression through histone acetylation (Vasudevan2023Acss2). It acts as a metabolic integrator, transitioning from roles in cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA formation and lipid synthesis to nuclear transcriptional regulation, highlighting its versatility in various cellular functions (Vasudevan2023Acss2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the ACSS2 gene have significant implications in various cancers. In breast and prostate cancers, ACSS2 is upregulated, particularly under metabolic stress conditions such as hypoxia, promoting acetate utilization crucial for cancer cell growth and survival. This upregulation is associated with disease progression and poor survival rates in patients (Schug2015AcetylCoA). In breast cancer, ACSS2 shows a high frequency of DNA copy-number gain, especially in invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas, correlating with decreased survival rates (Schug2015AcetylCoA). In prostate cancer, increased ACSS2 expression is observed in metastatic sites, suggesting its role in more aggressive disease forms (Schug2015AcetylCoA).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, ACSS2 is linked to tumor malignancy and immune escape by facilitating regulatory T cell function through acetylation processes (Liu2022AcetylCoA). In glioblastomas, ACSS2 enhances autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, supporting tumor cell nutrition and growth (Liu2022AcetylCoA). ACSS2's role in lipid metabolism is crucial for tumor proliferation in various cancers, including renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma, where it supports acetate uptake and lipid synthesis under hypoxic conditions (Moffett2020Acetate; Liu2022AcetylCoA). These findings suggest that ACSS2 is a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment due to its involvement in tumor metabolism and progression.

## Interactions
ACSS2 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as gene transcription, lysosomal biogenesis, and autophagy. One key interaction is with importin a5, which is crucial for the nuclear translocation of ACSS2. This interaction is facilitated by the phosphorylation of ACSS2 at serine 659 (S659) by AMPK, exposing its nuclear localization signal (NLS) and allowing binding to importin a5, particularly under glucose deprivation conditions (Li2017NucleusTranslocated).

In the nucleus, ACSS2 interacts with transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. This interaction is independent of S659 phosphorylation and is specific to TFEB, as ACSS2 does not form complexes with other TFE family members. The binding of ACSS2 to TFEB is crucial for the transcriptional activation of lysosomal and autophagy-related genes (Li2017NucleusTranslocated).

ACSS2 also forms complexes with HIF-2α and Cbp in cancer cells, where it generates acetyl-CoA necessary for the acetylation of HIF-2α. This acetylation is crucial for the formation of stable complexes with Cbp, which are important for HIF-2 signaling and tumor growth (Chen2017Coordinate). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, ACSS2 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase MUL1, mediating the degradation of HIF-2α, which affects its stability and function (Bacigalupa2022ACSS2).
