# HSPA12A

## Overview
HSPA12A is a gene that encodes the heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 12A, a protein belonging to the Hsp70 family, which is known for its role in protein folding and cellular stress responses. Unlike typical Hsp70 proteins, Hsp70 member 12A exhibits unique structural features, including an atypical ATP-binding domain and a lack of certain domains common in other Hsp70 proteins, such as the TPR1 domain-binding site and the ubiquitin-binding peptide (Brocchieri2008hsp70). This protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a critical role in maintaining cerebral lactate homeostasis, influencing adult hippocampal neurogenesis and mood stabilization (Wang2023HSPA12A). HSPA12A is also implicated in various cellular interactions and signaling pathways, including those involved in cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Cheng2020Heat‐Shock; Min2020HSPA12A).

## Structure
HSPA12A is a member of the Hsp70 protein family, characterized by its unique structural features. It possesses an atypical ATP-binding domain (ABD) that is more divergent compared to other Hsp70 proteins, with scattered conserved regions (Brocchieri2008hsp70). Unlike typical Hsp70 proteins, HSPA12A does not share similarity with the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of other Hsp70s, indicating a significant structural divergence (Brocchieri2008hsp70). The ABD of HSPA12A is split into two parts by spacer amino acids, which is atypical for Hsp70 proteins (Han2003Two).

HSPA12A lacks the TPR1 domain-binding site, which is involved in interactions with Hsp90 proteins, suggesting it does not participate in these interactions (Brocchieri2008hsp70). It also does not have the ubiquitin-binding peptide (UBP) conserved in other Hsp70s, indicating a potential difference in its role in the ubiquitin proteasome system (Brocchieri2008hsp70). The protein is encoded by a gene with 12 exons and a long 3' untranslated region (UTR), and it shares a 60% amino acid identity with its closely related gene HSPA12B (Han2003Two). Specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of HSPA12A are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The HSPA12A gene encodes a protein that is a member of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family, which is involved in various cellular processes, including protein folding and protection against stress. In healthy human cells, HSPA12A is abundantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cerebral lactate homeostasis. This function is essential for adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) and mood stabilization, as lactate is a key product of glycolysis that influences these processes (Wang2023HSPA12A).

HSPA12A regulates glycolysis in hippocampal neurons by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), which promotes lactate production and supports AHN and mood stability. The protein's activity is linked to increased phosphorylation of GSK3β, enhancing glycolysis-related gene expression and lactate production (Wang2023HSPA12A). HSPA12A is also involved in maintaining dendritic structure, which is vital for normal stress response and mood regulation (Wang2023HSPA12A). Its role in these molecular processes highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for mood disorders, given its influence on mood stability and neurogenesis (Wang2023HSPA12A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HSPA12A gene have been associated with various cancers. In lung adenocarcinoma, mutations in HSPA12A can lead to down-regulation of its expression, which is linked to poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for this type of cancer (Yan2021Comprehensive). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HSPA12A is overexpressed in tumor tissues, correlating with poor survival outcomes. This overexpression is significant in HBV-related early-stage HCC, indicating that HSPA12A could serve as a biomarker for disease progression and prognosis (Yang2015Upregulation).

In breast cancer, HSPA12A is generally downregulated across all molecular subtypes, which may have implications for understanding the molecular characteristics of these subtypes (Zoppino2018Comprehensive). Additionally, increased copy number variations of HSPA12A in breast cancer have been associated with improved clinical outcomes, highlighting its potential significance in prognosis (FernandezMuñoz2024Mutational).

In gastric cancer, a specific polymorphism in HSPA12A, the 'A/G' genotype of rs1665650, is associated with a decreased risk, suggesting a protective role in this population (Su2015Polymorphisms). These findings underscore the diverse roles of HSPA12A in cancer biology and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
HSPA12A is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HSPA12A binds to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a protein essential for DNA replication and repair. This interaction promotes the trimerization of PCNA, enhancing its function in cell proliferation and tumor growth (Cheng2020Heat‐Shock). HSPA12A also interacts with the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, increasing beta-catenin expression and nuclear translocation, which in turn elevates the expression of cyclin D1, c-Myc, Bcl-2, and VEGF, proteins involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis (Cheng2020Heat‐Shock).

In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), HSPA12A interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1, facilitating the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of CD147. This interaction reduces CD147 protein stability, affecting lactate export and cell migration (Min2020HSPA12A). HSPA12A also binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the amyloid precursor protein receptor SorLA, affecting its endocytosis and subcellular localization. This interaction is specific to SorLA and is influenced by ADP/ATP concentrations (Madsen2019HSPA12A). These interactions highlight HSPA12A's role in modulating protein stability and cellular signaling pathways.
