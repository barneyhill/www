# NIT2

## Overview
NIT2 is a gene that encodes the protein nitrilase family member 2, which is part of the nitrilase superfamily. This protein functions as an ω-amidase, playing a critical role in nitrogen and sulfur metabolism by hydrolyzing α-keto acid analogues of glutamine and asparagine. The enzymatic activity of NIT2 is essential for the methionine salvage pathway and the glutaminase II pathway, contributing to cellular homeostasis and energy production. Structurally, the NIT2 protein is characterized by a conserved catalytic domain and forms a dimeric structure, which is crucial for its stability and function. NIT2 has been implicated in tumor suppression, as its overexpression can inhibit cell growth and induce cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase. This suggests a potential role in cancer biology, with alterations in NIT2 expression linked to various cancers (Krasnikov2009Identification; Jaisson2009Molecular; Lin2007Growth).

## Structure
The NIT2 protein, encoded by the human NIT2 gene, is a member of the nitrilase superfamily, characterized by a conserved catalytic domain. The primary structure of NIT2 consists of 276 amino acid residues, with a predicted subunit molecular mass of approximately 30.6 kDa (Jaisson2009Molecular). The catalytic triad of NIT2 includes glutamate (Glu43), lysine (Lys112), and cysteine (Cys153), which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Jaisson2009Molecular).

The secondary structure of NIT2 includes α-helices and β-strands, forming an α-β-β-α architecture typical of the nitrilase superfamily (Jin2021Crystal). The tertiary structure involves a three-dimensional fold that supports its enzymatic function, with the active site located in a deep pocket (Jin2021Crystal). The quaternary structure of NIT2 is dimeric, with dimerization mediated by specific helices and strands, contributing to its stability and function (Jin2021Crystal).

NIT2 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions. The protein may also exist in splice variant isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing of its mRNA, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The NIT2 gene encodes a protein that functions as an ω-amidase, primarily involved in the hydrolysis of α-keto acid analogues of glutamine and asparagine, such as α-ketoglutaramate and α-ketosuccinamate, to produce α-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate (Krasnikov2009Identification; Jaisson2009Molecular). This enzymatic activity is crucial for nitrogen and sulfur metabolism and is part of the methionine salvage pathway, which is important for recycling methyl and sulfur groups in methionine (Krasnikov2009Identification). NIT2 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by removing potentially toxic intermediates and contributing to the regulation of nitrogen balance (Krasnikov2009Assay; Lin2007Growth).

In healthy human cells, NIT2 is involved in the glutaminase II pathway, converting glutamine to α-ketoglutarate and ammonia, which supports energy production and biosynthesis (Epova2021A). The protein's activity is linked to cell cycle regulation, as its overexpression in HeLa cells leads to growth inhibition by arresting cells in the G2 phase (Lin2007Growth). This suggests a potential role in tumor suppression, although its function may vary depending on the cellular context (Epova2021A).

## Clinical Significance
The NIT2 gene, identified as a putative tumor suppressor, has been implicated in various cancers due to its growth inhibitory effects and allelic imbalance in tumor tissues. Overexpression of NIT2 in HeLa cells has been shown to suppress cell growth and induce G2 arrest, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. This effect is potentially mediated through the modulation of 14-3-3 proteins, with an increase in 14-3-3r, associated with tumor suppression, and a decrease in 14-3-3b, which has oncogenic potential (Lin2007Growth). 

Significant allelic imbalance at the NIT2 locus has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer, indicating that loss of NIT2 function might contribute to malignancy (Lin2007Growth). The enzyme encoded by NIT2, ω-amidase, is involved in the deamidation of α-keto acid analogues of glutamine and asparagine, playing a role in nitrogen metabolism and potentially in tumor biology (Krasnikov2009Assay). Reduced expression of NIT2 has been noted in certain cancer cells, and its genomic locus shows allelic imbalance in some tumors, suggesting a link between NIT2 expression and cancer progression (Krasnikov2009Identification).

## Interactions
NIT2, a member of the nitrilase superfamily, is involved in various protein interactions that may influence its function and role in cellular processes. The protein forms a dimeric structure, as observed in the crystal structure of NIT2 from Kluyveromyces lactis, which is mediated by specific helices and involves extensive interactions at the dimeric interface (Jin2021Crystal). This dimerization is crucial for its enzymatic activity and stability.

In the context of its interaction with other proteins, NIT2 has been studied for its potential role in tumor suppression. It is suggested to induce G2 arrest in HeLa cells, which implies a regulatory interaction with cell cycle proteins (Jin2021Crystal). Additionally, the structural analysis of NIT2 reveals a catalytic triad involving conserved residues, which may facilitate interactions with substrates and other proteins involved in metabolic pathways (Jin2021Crystal).

The interaction of NIT2 with other proteins is also highlighted by its structural similarity to other nitrilase family members, suggesting that it may share common interaction partners or mechanisms with these proteins (Jin2021Crystal). These interactions are essential for its function in metabolic processes and potential tumor suppressor activity.
