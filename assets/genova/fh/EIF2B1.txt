# EIF2B1

## Overview
The EIF2B1 gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B subunit alpha (eIF2Bα), which is a critical component of the eIF2B complex, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) involved in the regulation of protein synthesis. As part of the eIF2B complex, eIF2Bα plays a pivotal role in the initiation of mRNA translation by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2, a process essential for the formation of the ternary complex required for protein synthesis. The eIF2B complex is a decameric enzyme composed of five different subunits, including eIF2Bα, and is integral to the cellular response to stress through its involvement in the integrated stress response (ISR). Mutations in the EIF2B1 gene are linked to vanishing white matter (VWM) disease, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining central nervous system integrity (Schoof2021eIF2B; van2006Vanishing).

## Function
The EIF2B1 gene encodes the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis. eIF2B facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2, a key step in the initiation of mRNA translation. This process is essential for the formation of the ternary complex, which is necessary for the initiation of protein synthesis (Schoof2021eIF2B).

In healthy human cells, eIF2B is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in regulating the integrated stress response (ISR). Under stress conditions, eIF2 is phosphorylated, which inhibits eIF2B's GEF activity, leading to a reduction in global protein synthesis and activation of the ISR (Schoof2021eIF2B). This mechanism allows cells to adapt to stress by reprogramming translation, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Schoof2021eIF2B).

The eIF2B complex is a large decameric enzyme composed of two copies each of five different subunits, including eIF2B1. Its assembly into a decamer enhances its GEF activity, which is necessary for efficient protein synthesis (Schoof2021eIF2B). The activity of eIF2B is modulated by ISRIB, a small molecule that can stabilize the active conformation of eIF2B, counteracting the inhibitory effects of phosphorylated eIF2α (Schoof2021eIF2B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EIF2B1 gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2Bα), are associated with vanishing white matter (VWM) disease, a rare genetic disorder affecting the central nervous system. VWM is characterized by the progressive degradation of white matter in the brain, leading to symptoms such as cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, and cognitive impairment (Wortham2015Biochemical; van2006Vanishing). The severity of VWM can vary significantly, with some patients experiencing mild symptoms and others facing severe congenital forms (Wortham2015Biochemical).

Mutations in EIF2B1 can lead to a reduction in guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity, which is crucial for protein synthesis initiation. This reduction in activity is linked to the severity of the disease, with more severe mutations correlating with earlier onset and more rapid progression (Horzinski2009Eukaryotic; Fogli2004Decreased). Specific mutations, such as Val183Phe, Asn208Tyr, and Tyr275Cys, have been studied for their effects on the stability and function of eIF2Bα, impacting its ability to incorporate into the eIF2B complex and maintain normal cellular processes (Wortham2015Biochemical).

## Interactions
EIF2B1, a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) complex, plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2. This interaction is essential for the initiation of translation. EIF2B1 is part of the regulatory sub-complex of eIF2B, which is composed of five different subunits organized into catalytic and regulatory sub-complexes. The regulatory sub-complex, including EIF2B1, is characterized by highly homologous Rossman folds that bind nucleotides (Sidrauski2015Pharmacological).

ISRIB, a small molecule, enhances the stability of the eIF2B complex by promoting the dimerization of eIF2B, including EIF2B1. This stabilization is achieved through the formation of additional interfaces between homologous regions of eIF2B subunits, such as eIF2B4, which ISRIB protects from thermal denaturation (Sidrauski2015Pharmacological). Mass spectrometry analysis has confirmed the enrichment of all five eIF2B subunits, including EIF2B1, in the presence of ISRIB, indicating its role in stabilizing the eIF2B complex (Sidrauski2015Pharmacological).

The interaction of EIF2B1 with other eIF2B subunits is crucial for the stability and function of the eIF2B complex, which is vital for the regulation of protein synthesis and the integrated stress response.
