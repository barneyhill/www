# MBD3

## Overview
MBD3 is a gene that encodes the methyl-CpG binding domain protein 3, a key component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. This protein is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, playing a crucial role in modulating gene expression. Unlike other members of the methyl-CpG-binding domain family, MBD3 has a reduced affinity for methylated DNA due to specific amino acid substitutions, which allows it to interact with unmethylated CpG islands and influence nucleosome positioning (Maurici2024Uncovering; Wade2001Methyl). MBD3 is essential for embryonic development and stem cell pluripotency, highlighting its importance in maintaining the active state of certain genes (Hainer2016DNA; Brown2008DNA). Additionally, MBD3's interactions within the NuRD complex and its involvement in various biological processes underscore its significance in both normal cellular function and disease contexts, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders (Shimbo2013MBD3; Cukier2009Novel).

## Structure
MBD3 is a protein that belongs to the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family and is involved in chromatin remodeling as part of the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase) complex. The primary structure of MBD3 includes a methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) and a coiled-coil (CC) domain, both of which are crucial for its function. The MBD domain is responsible for recognizing methylated DNA, although MBD3 itself has a reduced affinity for methylated CpG sites due to two amino acid substitutions (Maurici2024Uncovering; Wade2001Methyl).

The secondary structure of MBD3 features a coiled-coil domain that forms anti-parallel interactions, which are nearly identical to those in MBD2, with a 93% identity. This domain is important for the protein's interaction with other components of the NuRD complex, such as GATAD2A/p66α (Walavalkar2013Unique).

MBD3's tertiary structure is characterized by a distinct charge patterning, with negatively charged residues clustering along the C-terminal end and positively charged residues dispersed on the MBD and the N-terminal region of the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) (Maurici2024Uncovering).

MBD3 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, such as MBD3D and MBD3 Long Form, which do not bind methylated DNA substrates (Wade2001Methyl). The protein's interactions and functions are influenced by its acidic C-terminal tail, which plays a role in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (Maurici2024Uncovering).

## Function
MBD3 is a critical component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, which plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation in healthy human cells. MBD3 is involved in modulating chromatin structure by localizing at promoters, gene bodies, and enhancers of active genes, suggesting its role in regulating gene expression (Shimbo2013MBD3). Despite its association with the NuRD complex, which is traditionally linked to transcriptional repression, MBD3 is unexpectedly found at active promoters marked by H3K4me3, indicating a more dynamic role in gene regulation (Shimbo2013MBD3).

MBD3 does not bind methylated DNA directly due to the absence of certain conserved amino acids in its methyl-CpG binding domain, but it is associated with unmethylated CpG islands and can influence nucleosome positioning and density (Leighton2020The; Menafra2014MBD2). It is involved in DNA demethylation processes, particularly affecting promoter regions with intermediate CpG density, which can lead to changes in gene expression (Brown2008DNA).

MBD3 is essential for embryonic development and differentiation, maintaining the demethylated and active state of rRNA genes, and is crucial for embryonic stem cell pluripotency (Hainer2016DNA; Brown2008DNA). Its role in nucleosome organization and chromatin remodeling highlights its importance in modulating epigenetic features and gene expression in healthy human cells (Leighton2020The; Shimbo2013MBD3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MBD3 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of autism, a specific variant, c.68G>T (R23M), was identified in two affected half-brothers, suggesting a potential link to autism spectrum disorders. This variant alters a charged arginine to a nonpolar methionine within the methyl-CpG-binding domain, potentially interfering with protein function and contributing to the etiology of autism (Cukier2009Novel).

In cancer biology, MBD3 is associated with the NuRD complex and plays a role in gene expression regulation. In glioma, MBD3 influences the expression of the miR-17-92 cluster and the lncRNA Gomafu, affecting cell cycle regulation and glioma progression. High levels of MBD3 are correlated with better survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Cui2016Regulatory). MBD3's role in chromatin regulation is also noted in breast cancer, where its localization patterns differ between cancer subtypes, indicating a role in subtype specification (Shimbo2013MBD3).

Overall, MBD3's involvement in chromatin remodeling and gene expression highlights its clinical significance in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
MBD3 is a component of the NuRD complex, a multiprotein assembly involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Within this complex, MBD3 interacts with several core subunits, including HDAC1/2, GATAD2A/B, and CHD4, facilitating gene repression (Kloet2014Towards). MBD3 forms a heterodimer with MBD2, which is crucial for targeting the NuRD complex to specific genomic regions marked by distinct epigenetic signatures (Gigek2015Methyl‐CpG‐Binding).

MBD3 does not bind directly to methylated DNA but interacts with unmethylated promoters through transcription factor UBF, which is essential for normal cell function and embryonic development (Gigek2015Methyl‐CpG‐Binding). It also binds to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, an intermediate in cytosine demethylation, acting as a regulatory mark for gene expression (Gigek2015Methyl‐CpG‐Binding).

MBD3's interactions extend to cancer biology, where it binds to the oncoprotein JUN, recruiting the NuRD complex to regulate gene expression, such as the silencing of the p21 gene in leukemia (Gigek2015Methyl‐CpG‐Binding). In acute myeloid leukemia, a significant loss of MBD3 expression is observed, affecting the formation and function of the NuRD complex (Biswas2019MBD3NuRD).
