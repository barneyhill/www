# RAMP2

## Overview
RAMP2 (receptor activity modifying protein 2) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the modulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The protein product of RAMP2 is essential for the formation of functional receptor complexes, particularly with the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CALCRL), to create a high-affinity receptor for the peptide hormone adrenomedullin. This interaction is crucial for various physiological processes, including vascular development, endothelial cell function, and angiogenesis. RAMP2's role extends to influencing receptor signaling pathways and modulating the internalization and trafficking of GPCRs, thereby impacting cardiovascular homeostasis and offering potential therapeutic targets for vascular-related diseases (IchikawaShindo2008The; Kotliar2022Elucidating).

## Structure
RAMP2 (receptor activity modifying protein 2) is characterized by a single transmembrane helix and an extracellular N-terminal domain approximately 102 residues long, which is longer than those of RAMP1 and RAMP3 (Kusano2011Structural; Kotliar2022Elucidating). The extracellular domain (ECD) of RAMP2 adopts a three-helix bundle structure, stabilized by two disulfide bonds: Cys68-Cys99 and Cys84-Cys131 (Kusano2011Structural). These bonds contribute to the protein's stability by connecting different parts of the structure, such as the a1 helix with a2 and loop 1 with the C-terminal tail (Kusano2011Structural).

RAMP2 forms a heterodimer with the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR), creating a complex that is crucial for adrenomedullin-specific binding (Kusano2011Structural). The interface between CRLR and RAMP2 involves both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, with specific residues from RAMP2, such as Tyr93, Arg97, and Ser94, interacting with CRLR residues (Kusano2011Structural). The CRLR-RAMP2 complex buries 924 Å² of surface area, corresponding to 13.9% and 17.0% of the total surface areas of CRLR and RAMP2, respectively (Kusano2011Structural).

RAMP2 also contains a WXXW motif, a consensus sequence for C-mannosylation, a rare post-translational modification that enhances protein stability, although this modification was not analyzed in the referenced study (Kotliar2022Elucidating).

## Function
RAMP2 (receptor activity modifying protein 2) is a critical component in the modulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CALCRL), forming a high-affinity receptor for adrenomedullin (AM) (Kotliar2022Elucidating). This interaction is essential for vascular development and integrity, as RAMP2 is involved in maintaining endothelial cell viability and vascular structure (IchikawaShindo2008The). In endothelial cells, RAMP2 enhances the endothelial barrier function by upregulating cAMP and activating Rac1, which strengthens cortical actin rings, thereby maintaining vascular homeostasis (Shindo2022Receptor).

RAMP2 is also involved in angiogenesis, as its absence leads to severe vascular abnormalities, including poorly developed vitelline arteries and systemic edema (IchikawaShindo2008The). In adult mice, reduced RAMP2 expression results in increased vascular permeability and impaired neovascularization, indicating its ongoing role in vascular function (IchikawaShindo2008The). RAMP2's role extends to modulating receptor signaling and expression, influencing the internalization and trafficking of GPCRs, which affects receptor function and signaling pathways (Kotliar2022Elucidating). These molecular processes underscore RAMP2's importance in cardiovascular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target for vascular-related conditions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RAMP2 gene have significant clinical implications. In lung cancer, RAMP2 is frequently inactivated through promoter hypermethylation, leading to its down-regulation. This inactivation is associated with higher tumor grades and contributes to tumor progression by reducing RAMP2's tumor-suppressive effects, such as inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis (Yue2007Frequent). 

In the context of vascular health, RAMP2 is crucial for maintaining vascular integrity and angiogenesis. RAMP2 knockout mice exhibit severe vascular abnormalities, including vascular fragility, hemorrhage, and edema, highlighting its role in vascular development (IchikawaShindo2008The). Reduced RAMP2 expression in heterozygous mice leads to increased vascular permeability and higher blood pressure, suggesting its involvement in conditions like hypertension and edema (IchikawaShindo2008The).

RAMP2 also plays a protective role in cerebral ischemia. Mice with reduced RAMP2 expression show delayed recovery of cerebral blood flow and increased neural damage, indicating that RAMP2 is vital for protecting nerve cells and maintaining cerebral blood flow during ischemic events (Igarashi2014Pathophysiological).

## Interactions
RAMP2 (receptor activity-modifying protein 2) is known for its interactions with various G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), significantly influencing their function and expression. One of the primary interactions of RAMP2 is with the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CALCRL), forming a complex that responds to the peptide adrenomedullin, which plays a role in vasodilation and regulatory functions (Kotliar2022Elucidating).

RAMP2 also interacts with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor subtypes, specifically CRFR1α and CRFR1β, enhancing their delivery to the cell surface and influencing CRF-stimulated ACTH release. This interaction does not occur with CRFR2β, suggesting specificity in RAMP2's interactions with CRF receptor subtypes (Bailey2019Interactions).

In addition, RAMP2 has been shown to interact with the parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R), promoting a preactivated conformation and affecting G-protein activation and β-arrestin2 recruitment, which may have implications for bone density regulation (Kotliar2022Elucidating).

RAMP2's interactions extend to other GPCRs, including PTH1R, GPR182, GPR4, and CXCR3, as validated by proximity ligation assays and suspension bead array methods, highlighting its role in modulating a wide range of receptor functions (Lorenzen2019Multiplexed).
