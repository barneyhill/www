# BTNL8

## Overview
BTNL8, or butyrophilin-like 8, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein belonging to the butyrophilin family, which is structurally related to the B7 family of immune regulatory proteins. The BTNL8 protein plays a significant role in the immune system by modulating T-cell activity, particularly through its interactions with resting T lymphocytes. It is expressed in various human tissues, including the colon, lung, and testis, and is notably present in the epithelial cells of the gut. The protein is involved in the regulation of immune responses, acting as a positive regulator of T-cell activation and influencing cytokine production. BTNL8's interaction with T cells is crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and immune surveillance, especially in the gut, where it works in conjunction with BTNL3 to modulate TCR expression on specific γδ T cell subsets (Chapoval2013BTNL8; Di2016Epithelia; Blazquez2018New).

## Structure
The BTNL8 gene encodes a butyrophilin-like molecule that is part of the B7 family of costimulatory ligands. It is located on human chromosome 5 at position 5q35.3 and contains 8 exons spanning approximately 52 kb. BTNL8 is predicted to encode two isoforms of a type I transmembrane protein: a long form and a short form. Both isoforms have identical signal peptides and extracellular portions composed of IgV- and IgC-like domains, as well as hydrophobic transmembrane regions. The long form of BTNL8 includes a B30.2-like intracellular domain, while the short form results from an alternatively spliced 4th exon that introduces a frame shift and an early stop codon, leading to a shorter protein (Chapoval2013BTNL8).

The extracellular portion of BTNL8 shares 22-27% identity with known B7 molecules and 30-40% identity with BTN family members. The conserved cysteine residues in the IgV- and IgC-like domains are similar to those in other B7 molecules, suggesting structural similarities (Chapoval2013BTNL8). BTNL8 can bind to resting T lymphocytes and costimulate their proliferation and cytokine production, indicating its role in immune response regulation (Chapoval2013BTNL8). The molecular structure of BTNL8, including its specific domains and potential post-translational modifications, is not fully detailed in the available excerpts.

## Function
BTNL8 (butyrophilin-like 8) is a protein involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly in the modulation of T-cell activity. It is part of the butyrophilin family, which shares structural similarities with the B7 family of immune regulatory proteins. BTNL8 is expressed in various human tissues, including the colon, lung, and testis, and is notably present in epithelial cells of the gut (Chapoval2013BTNL8; Di2016Epithelia).

BTNL8 functions as a positive regulator of T-cell activation, particularly influencing the proliferation and cytokine production of T cells. It has been shown to augment T-cell proliferation and enhance cytokine production, such as IFN-γ and IL-10, when T cells are sub-optimally stimulated (Chapoval2013BTNL8). BTNL8 interacts with resting T lymphocytes, suggesting its role in the priming of naïve T cells and the primary immune response (Chapoval2013BTNL8).

In the gut, BTNL8, in conjunction with BTNL3, modulates the immune response by affecting TCR expression on specific γδ T cell subsets, particularly Vγ4+ T cells. This interaction is crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and immune surveillance in the colon (Kabelitz2023The; Blazquez2018New).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the BTNL8 gene have been implicated in several immune-related conditions, particularly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A specific genetic polymorphism involving a copy number variation (CNV) results in an in-frame fusion of the BTNL8 N-terminus to the BTNL3 C-terminus, creating a hypomorphic allele known as BTNL8*3. This allele is associated with poor cell surface expression and lacks the BTNL3 N-terminal V-region necessary for engaging human Vγ4 T cells. Individuals homozygous for this allele exhibit reduced frequencies of Vγ4+ gut T cells and altered phenotypes, similar to changes observed in IBD patients (Dart2023Conserved).

The BTNL8*3 allele is linked to the severity of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, suggesting that BTNL8 mutations may influence disease progression. The study indicates that assessing the status of CD103+ Vγ4+ cells could serve as a prognostic indicator for IBD, as patients with renormalized γδ cell compartments showed higher remission rates (Dart2023Conserved). Additionally, the inflammatory environment in IBD can alter the phenotype of these T cells, potentially contributing to disease progression, with reduced expression of BTNL3 and BTNL8 noted in IBD (Dart2023Conserved).

## Interactions
BTNL8, a butyrophilin-like molecule, is involved in immune regulation through its interactions with T lymphocytes. The protein has been shown to bind specifically to resting primary T cells and the Jurkat T cell line using a BTNL8Ig fusion protein, which combines the extracellular portion of BTNL8 with the Fc domain of human IgG1. This binding is lost upon T cell activation but can be restored after a resting period, indicating a unique interaction with a receptor on resting T lymphocytes (Chapoval2013BTNL8). 

BTNL8 does not bind to known B7 family receptors such as CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, and PD-1, suggesting it interacts with an unidentified receptor (Chapoval2013BTNL8). Functionally, BTNL8 enhances T cell proliferation and cytokine production when combined with suboptimal doses of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies, indicating a costimulatory role in T cell activation (Chapoval2013BTNL8). 

In vivo studies have demonstrated that BTNL8Ig injections increase serum levels of antigen-specific IgG during the primary immune response, although they do not enhance the recall response upon secondary challenge (Chapoval2013BTNL8). These findings highlight BTNL8's role in modulating immune responses through its interactions with T cells.
