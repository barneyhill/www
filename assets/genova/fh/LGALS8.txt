# LGALS8

## Overview
LGALS8 is a gene that encodes the protein galectin-8, a member of the galectin family known for its carbohydrate-binding properties. Galectin-8 is a tandem-repeat type galectin, characterized by two distinct carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) connected by a linker peptide, which allows it to interact with a variety of glycan structures. This protein plays a significant role in numerous biological processes, including cell adhesion, immune response modulation, and tissue remodeling. It is involved in critical cellular interactions, such as binding to integrins and influencing neutrophil function, as well as participating in matrix remodeling and autophagy. Galectin-8's diverse functions are reflected in its involvement in various pathological conditions, including cancer, psoriasis, and immune-related diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Nishi2003Galectin8; Cagnoni2020Fulllength; Pardo2019GALECTIN8).

## Structure
Galectin-8, encoded by the LGALS8 gene, is a tandem-repeat type galectin characterized by two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs), the N-terminal (Gal-8N) and C-terminal (Gal-8C), connected by a linker peptide (Cagnoni2020Fulllength). These domains exhibit 35% homology but differ in glycan ligand specificity, with Gal-8N showing a strong affinity for α(2-3)-sialylated oligosaccharides and Gal-8C preferring non-sialylated oligosaccharides such as poly-N-acetyllactosamine (GómezRedondo2021The; Cagnoni2020Fulllength).

The primary structure of Galectin-8 includes specific amino acids critical for binding, such as Arg 45, Gln 47, and Arg 59, which are essential for the recognition of sialylated and sulfated glycans (Ideo2011Galectin8Ndomain). The secondary structure is organized into a β-sandwich arrangement, with the N-domain forming a dimer distinct from other galectins (Ideo2011Galectin8Ndomain).

Galectin-8 can form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure, and its full-length form can bind a broader range of glycoconjugates than the isolated domains (Cagnoni2020Fulllength). The protein is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in six isoforms, with three being tandem-repeat types named Gal-8S, Gal-8M, and Gal-8L, based on the linker peptide length (Cagnoni2020Fulllength). These structural features are crucial for understanding the diverse biological roles of Galectin-8.

## Function
Galectin-8 (LGALS8) is a glycan-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, immune response modulation, and tissue remodeling. It interacts with integrins, particularly integrin aM (Mac-1), to promote neutrophil adhesion and modulate their function. This interaction is crucial for processes like transendothelial migration and microbial killing, as galectin-8 induces firm and reversible adhesion of neutrophils in a lactose-sensitive manner (Nishi2003Galectin8).

Galectin-8 also plays a role in matrix remodeling by accelerating the processing of proMMP-9 by MMP-3, enhancing the reaction in a dose-dependent manner. This activity is specific to galectin-8 and is not replicated by other galectins like galectin-1 and -3 (Nishi2003Galectin8). In addition, galectin-8 induces superoxide production in neutrophils, a key response in immune defense, with effects comparable to the chemotactic factor fMLP but with a longer duration (Nishi2003Galectin8).

In the brain, galectin-8 exhibits neuroprotective properties by binding to β1-integrins and activating ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, which are crucial for neuroprotection. It is involved in the autophagic removal of damaged endosomes and lysosomes, linking luminal glycans to the NDP52 autophagy adaptor and inhibiting mTOR in the lysosomal membrane (Pardo2019GALECTIN8).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of LGALS8, or galectin-8, have been implicated in various pathological conditions. In the context of lymphangiogenesis, galectin-8 promotes lymphatic endothelial cell sprouting, which is crucial in pathological conditions such as corneal graft rejection and herpes simplex virus keratitis. Inhibition of galectin-8 has been shown to reduce lymphangiogenesis and improve graft survival, suggesting its role in graft rejection (Chen2016Pathological).

Galectin-8 is also involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease. It is upregulated in keratinocytes by IL-17A, promoting keratinocyte proliferation and contributing to the thickened epidermis characteristic of psoriasis (Lo2021Galectin8).

In colorectal cancer, galectin-8 suppresses tumor progression and metastasis by interacting with TGF-β receptor II, thereby modulating TGF-β-mediated signaling pathways. Its expression reduces liver metastases and improves survival in mouse models, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer (Hsu2024B4GALT1dependent).

Galectin-8 also plays a role in the immune response and inflammation, influencing leukocyte adhesion, endothelial cell function, and platelet activation. Its expression is associated with disease progression in conditions like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis (Tribulatti2019Galectin8).

## Interactions
Galectin-8, encoded by the LGALS8 gene, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular functions. It interacts with integrin aM/CD11b, a key component in neutrophil adhesion and migration. The C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of galectin-8 binds to integrin aM, facilitating neutrophil adhesion, which can be inhibited by anti-integrin aM antibodies (Nishi2003Galectin8). Galectin-8 also binds to promatrix metalloproteinase-9 (proMMP-9) through its N-terminal CRD, playing a role in the processing of proMMP-9 by MMP-3, which is essential for neutrophil function (Nishi2003Galectin8).

In the context of immune responses, galectin-8 interacts with the autophagy adaptor NDP52, recruiting it to damaged vacuoles containing bacteria, thereby initiating autophagy and restricting bacterial proliferation (Thurston2012Galectin). In osteoclasts, galectin-8 modulates activity through isoform-specific interactions, affecting proteins such as CLCN7, LAMP1, and LAMP2, which are associated with bone resorption (Roy2024Galectin8). These interactions highlight galectin-8's role in modulating immune responses and cellular adhesion processes.
