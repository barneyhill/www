# LCE1A

## Overview
The LCE1A gene encodes the late cornified envelope 1A protein, which is a crucial component of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) involved in skin barrier formation. This protein is categorized as a structural protein, playing a significant role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis. LCE1A contributes to the formation of the cornified envelope, a protective layer that enhances the skin's defense against environmental factors. The gene is part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene family, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the skin barrier. The evolutionary conservation of LCE1A across species underscores its importance in skin physiology. Additionally, LCE1A has been implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, highlighting its clinical significance in skin-related disorders (Singh2019Genomic; oh2016role; Leśniak2024Dynamics).

## Function
The LCE1A gene is part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene family, which plays a crucial role in the formation of the cornified envelope, a key component of the skin barrier. LCE1A, along with other LCE genes, is involved in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis, contributing to the structural integrity of the skin barrier (oh2016role; Leśniak2024Dynamics). The proteins encoded by LCE1A are believed to function as cross-bridging proteins, linking other components of the cornified envelope, thereby enhancing the skin's protective function against environmental factors (Leśniak2024Dynamics).

In keratinocyte cultures, LCE1A shows high expression levels, particularly during the later stages of differentiation, indicating its role in the maturation of the epidermis (Niehues2016Late). The expression of LCE1A, along with other LCE genes, is highest in differentiated cells, suggesting its involvement in the final stages of epidermal differentiation and the maintenance of the skin barrier (Leśniak2024Dynamics). The evolutionary conservation of LCE1A across species underscores its importance in skin barrier function (Leśniak2024Dynamics).

## Clinical Significance
The LCE1A gene, part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene family, is associated with the pathogenesis of psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition. Mutations in the LCE1A gene, located within the PSORS4 locus, have been reported to have a high probability of triggering psoriasis vulgaris. This locus is involved in the keratinization process, and the LCE1A gene is expressed in the upper strata of the epidermis, playing a role in skin barrier function (Singh2019Genomic).

While the specific clinical significance of LCE1A gene mutations is not detailed extensively, its association with psoriasis suggests that alterations in its expression or function could contribute to the impaired skin barrier and immune response observed in the disease. The PSORS4 locus, which includes LCE1A, is implicated in the keratinization process, and mutations here may disrupt normal skin barrier formation, leading to increased susceptibility to psoriasis (Singh2019Genomic).

Overall, the LCE1A gene's role in skin barrier integrity and its association with psoriasis highlight its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring normal skin function and mitigating disease symptoms.

## Interactions
LCE1A (late cornified envelope 1A) is a protein that plays a role in the formation of the cornified envelope in the epidermis. It is part of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) located on chromosome 1, which includes several gene families involved in skin barrier function. The spatial organization of the EDC facilitates interactions between enhancers and gene promoters, influencing transcriptional activity during keratinocyte differentiation (Leśniak2024Dynamics).

LCE1A is involved in protein-protein interactions within the epidermis, potentially serving as a cross-bridging protein for cornified envelope components, similar to other LCE proteins (Leśniak2024Dynamics). Although specific interaction partners for LCE1A are not detailed, the protein is part of a network of interactions that contribute to the structural integrity of the skin barrier.

In the context of coronary heart disease (CHD), LCE1A has been identified as a hub gene in a protein-protein interaction network, suggesting its involvement in broader regulatory networks. The study highlights its potential role in CHD, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Li2022m6A). The downregulation of LCE1A in CHD patients further suggests its involvement in disease progression (Li2022m6A).
