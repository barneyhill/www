# NPTN

## Overview
Neuroplastin (NPTN) is a gene that encodes the neuroplastin protein, a transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) domain-containing family. This protein plays a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity and calcium homeostasis, primarily through its function as an auxiliary subunit of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs). Neuroplastin exists in two main isoforms, Np65 and Np55, which are involved in various physiological processes, including synaptic function and auditory system maintenance. The Np65 isoform is particularly significant in the nervous system, where it regulates synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation, while Np55 is crucial for cochlear hair cell function and hearing. Alterations in the NPTN gene have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and auditory impairments, highlighting its clinical significance (Beesley2014The; Schmidt2017Neuroplastin; Newton2022Neuroplastin).

## Structure
Neuroplastin (NPTN) is a synaptic glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin (Ig) domain-containing family of proteins, which includes basigin and embigin. It exists in two splice variants, Np65 and Np55, which differ by a single Ig domain at the extracellular N terminus (Schmidt2017Neuroplastin). The protein features transmembrane segments and adjacent N-terminal and C-terminal domains, which are crucial for its function, while the Ig domains are not involved in PMCA stabilization (Schmidt2017Neuroplastin).

The structure of neuroplastin includes a transmembrane domain that interacts with plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs), playing a critical role in the stability and function of PMCA complexes (Schmidt2017Neuroplastin). The interaction between neuroplastin and PMCAs is sensitive to solubilization conditions, suggesting the involvement of the transmembrane domain and adjacent residues (Schmidt2017Neuroplastin). Neuroplastin's transmembrane domain and adjacent residues are essential for PMCA-neuroplastin interaction, which is critical for the surface delivery and function of PMCA complexes (Schmidt2017Neuroplastin).

Post-translational modifications of neuroplastin may include glycosylation, which influences its function and stability. The protein's structure and interactions are vital for maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis and are implicated in various physiological processes, including synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Schmidt2017Neuroplastin).

## Function
Neuroplastin (NPTN) is a gene that encodes proteins involved in crucial cellular processes, particularly in maintaining calcium homeostasis and synaptic plasticity. Neuroplastin functions as an obligatory subunit of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs), which are essential for extruding excess calcium from the cytoplasm, thereby maintaining a steep gradient between intracellular and extracellular calcium concentrations. This role is vital for the efficient control of calcium clearance by PMCAs, highlighting its physiological significance in maintaining calcium homeostasis (Gong2018Structure).

In the nervous system, Neuroplastin, particularly the Np65 isoform, is a critical regulator of synaptic plasticity and function in the hippocampus. It influences the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses and plays a significant role in long-term potentiation (LTP) by activating p38MAPK, which leads to the internalization of GluR1 receptors, affecting synaptic strength. Np65's trans-homophilic binding is crucial for linking pre- and postsynaptic membranes, thereby influencing synaptic plasticity (Beesley2014The).

In the auditory system, Neuroplastin is essential for cochlear hair cell function and hearing. The isoform np55 is sufficient for cochlear hair cell function, ensuring proper localization of PMCA2, which is critical for maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis in hair cells (Newton2022Neuroplastin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NPTN gene have been linked to several neuropsychiatric and auditory conditions. In the auditory system, loss-of-function mutations in NPTN can lead to profound deafness due to the disruption of cochlear hair cell function. The isoform Np55 is crucial for this function, and its absence results in significant hearing impairments (Zeng2016Neuroplastin; Newton2022Neuroplastin). Heterozygous mutations in NPTN can also cause high-frequency hearing loss, suggesting that even partial loss of function can affect auditory capabilities (Newton2022Neuroplastin).

In the context of neuropsychiatric disorders, variations in NPTN have been associated with schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disabilities. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NPTN gene are linked to reduced cortical thickness and impaired intellectual ability, which may contribute to the risk of schizophrenia and other cognitive impairments (Beesley2014The; Ilic2021Neuroplastin). NPTN is also implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, where its expression is initially upregulated in early stages but decreases as the disease progresses, potentially affecting cognitive functions (Lin2021Neuroplastina).

## Interactions
Neuroplastin (NPTN) is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence neuronal and synaptic functions. It acts as an essential auxiliary subunit of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs), forming stable complexes with PMCA isoforms in brain and kidney tissues. This interaction is crucial for Ca2+ clearance, as neuroplastin enhances PMCA efficiency and is necessary for the structural and functional integrity of these complexes (Gong2018Structure; Schmidt2017Neuroplastin). Neuroplastin interacts specifically with PMCA1 and PMCA4, stabilizing these proteins at the post-transcriptional level, which is vital for maintaining calcium homeostasis in T cells (Korthals2017A).

Neuroplastin also binds to the fibroblast growth factor receptor, engages in trans-homophilic binding that activates p38 MAPK, and affects glutamate receptor subunit internalization, impacting synaptic plasticity and neuronal signaling pathways (Beesley2014The). It interacts with GABA A receptor subunits, influencing receptor composition and localization (Beesley2014The). Additionally, neuroplastin forms complexes with basigin, another protein in the same family, although basigin predominantly associates with monocarboxylate transporters (Schmidt2017Neuroplastin). These interactions highlight neuroplastin's role in multiprotein complexes and its impact on synaptic function and plasticity.
