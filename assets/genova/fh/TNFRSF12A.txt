# TNFRSF12A

## Overview
TNFRSF12A is a gene that encodes the protein TNF receptor superfamily member 12A, commonly referred to as Fn14. This protein is a type I transmembrane receptor and the smallest member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), characterized by its single cysteine-rich domain and a cytoplasmic domain that facilitates interactions with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) (Wiley2003TWEAK; BROWN2003The). Fn14 is primarily involved in the TWEAK/Fn14 signaling pathway, which plays a significant role in regulating inflammation, cell survival, and proliferation through the activation of both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways (Frejo2017Regulation). The TNFRSF12A gene and its encoded protein are implicated in various pathological conditions, including pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and liver diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Guo2024Communication; Li2022Inhibition).

## Structure
The TNFRSF12A gene encodes the TWEAK receptor, also known as Fn14, which is a type I transmembrane protein. This protein consists of 129 amino acids with a molecular mass of 13,911 Da and an isoelectric point of 9.37 (Wiley2003TWEAK). The primary structure includes a 27-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide and a 21-amino acid transmembrane domain. The mature protein, after proteolytic cleavage, is 102 amino acids long, making it the smallest member of the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) (Wiley2003TWEAK).

The extracellular domain of Fn14 contains a single cysteine-rich subdomain, a characteristic feature of some TNFRSF members (Wiley2003TWEAK). The cytoplasmic domain is 29 amino acids long and includes a putative TRAF-binding site, flanked by two conserved threonine residues, which are potential phosphorylation sites (Wiley2003TWEAK). This domain is crucial for binding to tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) 1, 2, 3, and 5, mediating nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) activation (BROWN2003The).

Fn14 may form oligomers, including monomers, dimers, and trimers, as part of its quaternary structure (BROWN2003The). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in signaling pathways related to cell survival and proliferation.

## Function
The TNFRSF12A gene encodes the Fn14 receptor, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including inflammation, cell survival, and proliferation. In healthy human cells, the Fn14 receptor is primarily involved in the TWEAK/Fn14 signaling pathway, which activates both the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways. The canonical pathway is associated with acute immune responses, while the non-canonical pathway is involved in prolonged immune responses (Frejo2017Regulation).

The Fn14 receptor is implicated in the regulation of cell adhesion and proliferation through the expression of adhesion molecules like LFA-1 and ICAM-1, particularly in lymphoblastoid cells (Frejo2017Regulation). It is also involved in the phosphorylation of the NF-κB p65 subunit, although certain genetic variants do not affect this process (Frejo2017Regulation).

Fn14 is highly expressed in epithelial cells and is involved in maintaining the integrity of barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and potentially the blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB) in the inner ear, suggesting its role in regulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Frejo2017Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
The TNFRSF12A gene, also known as FN14, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression and function. In thyroid carcinoma (THCA), TNFRSF12A is highly expressed and associated with immune cell infiltration, including B cells, CD8+ T cells, and macrophages. Mutations in TNFRSF12A occur in approximately 5% of THCA cases, with low mRNA expression being the most common mutation type. These alterations are linked to poorer overall survival, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression and as a target for immunotherapy (Zheng2023TNFRSF12A).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TNFRSF12A is part of a prognostic model where its hypomethylation correlates with poorer survival outcomes. The gene's expression is inversely related to its methylation status, indicating that epigenetic modifications may influence its role in tumorigenesis (Fang2020TNFRSF12A).

TNFRSF12A is also involved in cholestatic liver injury, where its expression is upregulated, promoting hepatocyte pyroptosis through the NFκB/Caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway. This process contributes to liver damage in conditions like primary biliary cholangitis and obstructive cholestasis, highlighting TNFRSF12A as a potential therapeutic target (Liao2023Hepatic).

## Interactions
TNFRSF12A, also known as FN14, is a receptor that interacts with the cytokine TWEAK (TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis). This interaction is crucial in various cellular processes, including inflammation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The TNFRSF12A-TWEAK axis is involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute liver failure (ALF).

In the context of pulmonary fibrosis, particularly in severe COVID-19 patients, TNFRSF12A interacts with TWEAK secreted by alveolar macrophages. This interaction promotes fibroblast proliferation and the expression of fibrosis-related factors, contributing to the development of pulmonary fibrosis (Guo2024Communication). In COPD, TNFRSF12A is associated with the HMGB1 protein, influencing the balance between senescence and apoptosis, and perpetuating inflammation (Dong2020TNFRSF12A).

In ALF, the TNFRSF12A-TWEAK axis activates receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), leading to RIPK1-dependent apoptosis of hepatocytes, which contributes to liver injury. Inhibiting this axis has been shown to reduce liver damage, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2022Inhibition). These interactions underscore the significant role of TNFRSF12A in mediating cellular responses through its engagement with TWEAK and other signaling molecules.
