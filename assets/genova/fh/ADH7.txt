# ADH7

## Overview
ADH7 is a gene that encodes the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 7 (class IV), mu or sigma polypeptide, which is a member of the alcohol dehydrogenase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of alcohols, particularly ethanol, by catalyzing their oxidation to acetaldehyde, a crucial step in alcohol detoxification. Unlike other alcohol dehydrogenases, ADH7 is predominantly expressed in the stomach and esophagus, where it is adapted to handle high concentrations of ethanol. Additionally, ADH7 exhibits activity with retinol, implicating it in the conversion to retinal, which is vital for epithelial tissue maintenance and development. The gene's expression during embryonic development suggests a role in retinoic acid synthesis, influencing cell differentiation and development. Beyond its metabolic functions, ADH7 has been linked to various neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, including alcohol dependence, major depression, and Parkinson's disease, underscoring its clinical significance (Crabb2004Overview; Zuo2013Association; Zuo2012Rare).

## Function
ADH7, or alcohol dehydrogenase 7, is an enzyme primarily expressed in the stomach and esophagus, as well as other mucosal tissues. It plays a significant role in the first-pass metabolism of alcohol, particularly ethanol, by catalyzing its oxidation to acetaldehyde. This process is crucial for detoxifying alcohols before they enter systemic circulation (Crabb2004Overview).

ADH7 is structurally distinct from other classes of alcohol dehydrogenases and has a high K_m for ethanol, indicating its adaptation to the high concentrations of ethanol present in the gastric mucosa following alcohol consumption. This enzyme is also highly active with retinol as a substrate, suggesting a role in the conversion of retinol to retinal, which is important for maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues (Crabb2004Overview).

In addition to its role in alcohol metabolism, ADH7 is the first alcohol dehydrogenase expressed during embryonic development in mice, with expression sites correlating with the production of retinoic acid. This suggests a potential role in developmental processes, possibly through its involvement in retinol metabolism and the synthesis of retinoic acid, which is essential for epithelial cell differentiation and development (Crabb2004Overview).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADH7 gene have been associated with several neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Rare variants in ADH7 are linked to alcohol dependence, particularly in European Americans, where a significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1596180 shows a higher minor allele frequency in affected individuals compared to unaffected ones (Zuo2012Rare). This association is supported by findings that suggest rare ADH7 variants play a specific role in alcohol dependence rather than other disorders (Zuo2012Rare). 

ADH7 is also implicated in major depression, with SNP rs7690269 showing a higher minor allele frequency in affected Caucasian individuals (Zuo2012Rare). The gene's involvement in the metabolism of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine suggests its potential role in neuropsychiatric disorders (Zuo2013Association).

In addition to alcohol dependence and major depression, common variants in ADH7 have been associated with Parkinson's disease, indicating that ADH7 may be linked to diseases beyond alcohol-related disorders (Zuo2013Association). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ADH7 in various conditions, emphasizing the need for further research to understand its role in disease mechanisms.
