# TMEM217

## Overview
TMEM217 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 217, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including those related to angiogenesis and inflammation. TMEM217 has been studied for its potential role in the pathogenesis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, particularly in specific populations such as African American patients with type 2 diabetes. The gene's involvement in the MAPK pathway suggests its participation in critical cellular signaling mechanisms. Additionally, TMEM217 has been identified as a candidate gene in breast cancer research, indicating its possible broader implications in oncological and other disease processes (Ung2017Whole; Panahi2021Integration).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM217 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), particularly in African American patients with type 2 diabetes. Whole exome sequencing studies have identified rare and novel variants of TMEM217 in PDR cases, suggesting a potential role in the disease's development (Ung2017Whole). TMEM217 is involved in the MAPK pathway, which is related to angiogenesis, a key process in diabetic retinopathy. Although no variants reached statistical significance after Bonferroni correction, its expression was found to increase two-fold in vascular endothelial cells treated with DMU-212, indicating a possible role in inflammation and apoptosis pathways associated with diabetic retinopathy (Ung2017Whole).

In addition to its association with diabetic retinopathy, TMEM217 has been identified as a candidate gene in breast cancer studies. It was listed among the top meta-genes in a study using machine learning to analyze epigenetic data, although specific diseases or conditions directly associated with TMEM217 mutations or expression alterations in breast cancer were not detailed (Panahi2021Integration). These findings suggest that TMEM217 may have broader implications in disease processes beyond diabetic retinopathy.
