# NSDHL

## Overview
The NSDHL gene encodes the enzyme NAD(P) dependent steroid dehydrogenase-like, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway by catalyzing the removal of C-4 methyl groups from sterol intermediates, a critical step in the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol (Cunningham2005Changes; K�nig2000Mutations). The NSDHL protein is predominantly localized to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets, where it contributes to cholesterol homeostasis, essential for maintaining cell membrane integrity and facilitating various cellular functions (Cunningham2009Developmental). Mutations in the NSDHL gene are linked to several congenital disorders, including CHILD syndrome and CK syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance (Preiksaitiene2015A; K�nig2000Mutations). The enzyme's structural and functional characteristics make it a potential target for therapeutic interventions, particularly in conditions involving dysregulated cholesterol metabolism and EGFR-driven cancers (Kim2020Crystal).

## Structure
The NSDHL protein is characterized by a single domain architecture with an α/β doubly wound scaffold typical of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family fold. Its structure includes a seven-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked by two arrays of α-helices, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions (Kim2020Crystal). The coenzyme-binding site is located within two Rossmann folds, and the dimeric interfaces are composed of antiparallel β-sheets (Kim2020Crystal). The NAD+ binding site involves 11 hydrogen bonds and various hydrophobic interactions, with key residues such as Asp84, Leu85, and Ile69 playing significant roles (Kim2020Crystal). 

NSDHL undergoes conformational changes upon NAD+ binding, transitioning from a closed to an open form, which facilitates substrate binding. This is particularly evident in the loop region (His201-Leu211), which is crucial for the conformational change and stability of the protein (Kim2020Crystal). The protein shows a preference for binding NAD(H) over NADP(H), with a higher affinity for NADH, influenced by the presence of the acidic residue Asp68 (Kim2020Crystal). The structural insights into NSDHL are essential for designing inhibitors targeting this protein, with potential therapeutic applications in EGFR-driven cancers (Kim2020Crystal).

## Function
The NSDHL gene encodes a 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme that plays a critical role in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. This enzyme is involved in the removal of C-4 methyl groups from sterol intermediates, a crucial step in the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol (Cunningham2005Changes; K�nig2000Mutations). NSDHL is localized to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and the surface of lipid droplets, where it participates in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis, essential for cell membrane fluidity and the formation of lipid rafts and caveolae (Cunningham2009Developmental).

Cholesterol synthesized by NSDHL is vital for various cellular functions, including the integrity of cell membranes, signaling, and as a precursor for steroid hormones and neurosteroids (Cunningham2009Developmental). The enzyme's activity is particularly important in tissues with high cholesterol demands, such as the central nervous system, where it supports neuronal development and function (Cunningham2009Developmental). NSDHL expression is observed in several human peripheral tissues, including the liver, adrenal gland, and gonads, indicating its widespread role in cholesterol and steroid biosynthesis (Preiksaitiene2015A; Morimoto2011Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NSDHL gene are associated with several congenital disorders, most notably CHILD syndrome and CK syndrome. CHILD syndrome, an X-linked dominant disorder, is characterized by congenital hemidysplasia, ichthyosiform erythroderma, and limb defects. It is lethal in males and presents with unilateral skin lesions and ipsilateral limb defects in females (Hummel2003Left‐sided; K�nig2000Mutations). The syndrome is linked to mutations that disrupt cholesterol biosynthesis, leading to defects in cell membranes and myelin sheaths (K�nig2000Mutations).

CK syndrome, an X-linked recessive disorder, primarily affects males and is characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, microcephaly, and skeletal anomalies. A novel missense mutation, p.Gly152Asp, in the NSDHL gene has been identified as a cause of CK syndrome, affecting protein stability and function (Preiksaitiene2015A).

NSDHL mutations also contribute to the pathogenesis of oral verruciform xanthoma (VX), with studies indicating that these mutations may increase the risk of epithelial barrier defects, promoting recurrent oral VX lesions (Getz2019Identification). The gene's role in cholesterol biosynthesis is crucial, and its mutations can lead to a spectrum of disorders with varying clinical manifestations.

## Interactions
NSDHL, a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is known to interact with proteins involved in lipid metabolism and signaling pathways. NSDHL's role in the cholesterol synthesis pathway is crucial, as it catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of C4 methyl groups of 4α-carboxysterols, a process essential for cholesterol production (Kim2020Crystal). 

The enzyme is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and lipid droplets, suggesting its involvement in multiprotein complexes associated with these cellular structures (Kim2020Crystal). NSDHL's interaction with NAD+ is significant, as it involves 11 hydrogen bonds and various hydrophobic interactions, with specific residues like Asp84, Leu85, and Ile69 playing key roles in this binding (Kim2020Crystal). 

NSDHL also plays a role in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways. Its inhibition can accelerate EGFR degradation, thereby suppressing EGFR-dependent signaling, which is crucial in cancer cell proliferation (Kim2020Crystal). This interaction highlights NSDHL's potential as a therapeutic target in EGFR-driven cancers, where its inhibitors can enhance the efficacy of EGFR-targeted therapies (Kim2020Crystal).
