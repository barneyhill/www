# LIAT1

## Overview
The LIAT1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a ligand for ATE1, an enzyme involved in the post-translational modification process known as arginylation. This modification is crucial for regulating protein stability and function through the Arg N-degron pathway, which links protein half-life to their N-terminal amino acid (Van2020ATE1Mediated; Chen2021Post-translational). LIAT1 enhances the activity of ATE1 by facilitating the transfer of arginine to target proteins, thereby influencing cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility (Chen2021Post-translational). The protein encoded by LIAT1 interacts with specific isoforms of ATE1 and other cellular proteins, suggesting its involvement in a wide range of cellular functions (wadas2016biochemical). Although the precise mechanisms of LIAT1's action are not fully understood, its role in modulating ATE1 activity highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein regulation.

## Structure


## Function
The LIAT1 gene encodes a protein that interacts with ATE1, an enzyme responsible for post-translational arginylation, a modification that influences protein function and stability. LIAT1 modulates the activity of ATE1 by binding to it and enhancing its ability to transfer arginine to the N-terminus of target proteins, a process that is part of the Arg N-degron pathway (Van2020ATE1Mediated; Chen2021Post-translational). This pathway links the half-life of proteins to their N-terminal amino acid, affecting their degradation and function.

In healthy human cells, LIAT1 is involved in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility. It influences the arginylation of non-degradatory targets such as calreticulin and β-actin, which are crucial for maintaining the cytoskeleton and facilitating cell movement (Chen2021Post-translational). Although the specific function of LIAT1 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its role in modulating ATE1 activity suggests it plays a significant part in cellular homeostasis and protein regulation (Van2020ATE1Mediated). The gene is expressed in various cellular compartments, indicating its broad involvement in cellular processes.

## Interactions
LIAT1, also known as the ligand of ATE1, is involved in several protein interactions. It specifically interacts with certain isoforms of the Ate1 R-transferase, a key enzyme in the N-end rule pathway. The Ate1 1B7A isoform shows a strong interaction with LIAT1, while Ate1 1A7A also interacts but less efficiently. Other isoforms like Ate1 1A7B and Ate1 1B7B do not interact with LIAT1 (wadas2016biochemical). 

LIAT1 enhances the Nt-arginylation of substrates by Ate1, increasing the efficacy by 1.3-fold to 2.3-fold, although the exact mechanism remains unknown (wadas2016biochemical). Despite its interaction with Ate1, LIAT1 is not an arginylation target itself (Van2020ATE1Mediated).

In addition to Ate1, LIAT1 interacts with other proteins. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified approximately 40 mouse proteins that interact with LIAT1, including the human Jmjd6 methyltransferase. GST-pulldown assays also identified ribosomal proteins S14 and S19 as LIAT1-interacting proteins (wadas2016biochemical). These interactions suggest a broader role for LIAT1 in cellular processes beyond its interaction with Ate1.
