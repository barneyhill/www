# ZNF74

## Overview
ZNF74 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 74, a transcriptional regulator characterized by its zinc finger domains and a KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) domain. The protein is involved in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing, playing a crucial role in gene expression. Zinc finger protein 74 contains multiple Cys2-His2 zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its binding to nucleic acids, and a KRAB domain that contributes to its function as a transcriptional repressor. The protein is associated with the nuclear matrix and interacts with the hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II, indicating its involvement in RNA synthesis and maturation. ZNF74 is known to produce multiple isoforms through alternative splicing, which may have distinct roles in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Clinically, ZNF74 is implicated in developmental disorders such as DiGeorge syndrome and has been associated with schizophrenia, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Grondin1997Direct; Grondin1996The; Aubry1993Isolation).

## Structure
The ZNF74 protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, specifically 12 Kruppel C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which are involved in nucleic acid binding (Côté2001Alternative; Grondin1996The). These motifs are flanked by non-zinc finger regions at both the N-terminal and C-terminal ends (Aubry1993Isolation). The protein also contains a KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) domain, which is divided into A and B boxes and is crucial for its transcriptional repressor activity (Côté2001Alternative; Grondin1996The). The KRAB domain is encoded by a 223-base pair exon, while the zinc finger motifs and the 3' untranslated region are encoded by a longer exon (Grondin1996The).

ZNF74 is known to produce multiple isoforms through alternative promoter usage and splicing, which differ in the presence or absence of the KRAB A and B boxes. The ZNF74-I isoform has a truncated KRAB A box, while ZNF74-II contains full KRAB A and B boxes, leading to differences in transcriptional repression abilities and nuclear localization (LADOMERY2002Multifunctional; Côté2001Alternative). The protein is associated with the nuclear matrix and exhibits RNA-binding activity, specifically binding to poly(U) and poly(G) RNA homopolymers (LADOMERY2002Multifunctional; Grondin1996The).

## Function
ZNF74 is a zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing in healthy human cells. It contains a KRAB domain and multiple Cys2-His2 zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its function as a transcriptional regulator and RNA-binding protein (LADOMERY2002Multifunctional; Grondin1997Direct). ZNF74 is tightly associated with the nuclear matrix and interacts specifically with the hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II (pol IIo), a key player in pre-mRNA elongation and processing (Grondin1997Direct). This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, indicating a regulatory role in transcription processes (Grondin1997Direct).

ZNF74 is involved in the formation of subnuclear domains enriched with splicing factors, suggesting its participation in RNA synthesis and maturation (Grondin1997Direct). The protein can produce multiple isoforms through alternative promoter usage and splicing, which differ in their transcriptional repression abilities and nuclear localization. For instance, the ZNF74-I isoform localizes to splicing speckle domains, while ZNF74-II shows strong transcriptional repression and a diffuse nuclear distribution (LADOMERY2002Multifunctional; Côté2001Alternative). These isoforms may have distinct or complementary roles in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, contributing to the regulation of gene expression in human cells (Côté2001Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF74 is implicated in several developmental and neurological disorders due to its role in transcriptional regulation. In DiGeorge syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by thymus and parathyroid hypoplasia, heart defects, and craniofacial dysmorphism, ZNF74 is consistently deleted in patients. This deletion suggests that ZNF74 may contribute to the syndrome's pathophysiology, potentially affecting the dosage of transcription factors critical for early development (Aubry1993Isolation). The gene's expression in neural crest-derived tissues and foregut endoderm epithelia during development further supports its involvement in the clinical manifestations of DiGeorge syndrome, such as cardiac defects and craniofacial abnormalities (Ravassard1999ZNF74).

ZNF74 is also associated with schizophrenia, particularly concerning the age-at-onset of the disease. Certain polymorphisms in the ZNF74 gene have been linked to variations in the age at which schizophrenia symptoms manifest, suggesting that ZNF74 may act as a modifying factor for the disorder (Takase2001Association). These findings highlight the gene's potential role in modifying susceptibility to schizophrenia, possibly through its involvement in RNA metabolism and gene expression regulation (Grondin1997Direct).

## Interactions
ZNF74 is known to interact with the hyperphosphorylated form of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, known as pol IIo. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, as it is abolished when pol IIo is treated with phosphatase, indicating that the phosphorylation state is crucial for binding. ZNF74 does not interact with the hypophosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II (pol IIa) (Grondin1997Direct). The interaction with pol IIo suggests a role in RNA processing and maturation, as ZNF74 colocalizes with pol IIo and the SC35 splicing factor in subnuclear domains enriched in pre-mRNA maturating factors (LADOMERY2002Multifunctional; Grondin1997Direct).

ZNF74 is also associated with the nuclear matrix, a subnuclear structure involved in nucleic acid metabolism. Its zinc finger domain is responsible for nuclear targeting and remains associated with the nuclear matrix even after treatments that typically release proteins, indicating a strong and specific interaction (Grondin1996The). The protein's RNA-binding activity is facilitated by its zinc finger domain, which can bind to RNA, specifically poly(U) and poly(G) sequences (LADOMERY2002Multifunctional).
