# MYH6

## Overview
The MYH6 gene encodes the alpha-myosin heavy chain, a critical protein component of the cardiac muscle's contractile machinery. This protein is categorized as a motor protein due to its role in muscle contraction, where it interacts with actin filaments to facilitate the conversion of chemical energy into mechanical force. Predominantly expressed in the atrial tissues of the heart, the alpha-myosin heavy chain is essential for the proper assembly and function of myofibrils, which are the fundamental units of muscle contraction (Anfinson2022Significance; GranadosRiveron2010αCardiac). The MYH6 gene is particularly significant in cardiac physiology, as it is involved in the ATPase cycle, mediating the interaction between nucleotide binding and actin affinity, which is crucial for effective muscle contraction (GranadosRiveron2010αCardiac). Mutations in MYH6 have been linked to various cardiac conditions, including congenital heart diseases and cardiomyopathies, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal heart function (TomitaMitchell2016Impact; Anfinson2022Significance).

## Structure
The MYH6 gene encodes the alpha-myosin heavy chain, a crucial component of cardiac muscle contraction. The protein is structured with three main domains: the head, neck, and rod. The head domain is responsible for actin binding and contains the ATP-binding pocket, which is essential for its motor function (Posch2011Cardiac; England2012Heavy). The neck domain includes a helical structure that interacts with myosin light chains, stabilizing the protein's configuration (England2012Heavy). The rod domain forms a coiled-coil structure, facilitating the assembly of myosin molecules into thick filaments within the sarcomere (England2012Heavy).

Mutations in MYH6 can affect these domains, leading to structural and functional alterations. For example, mutations like P830L and A1004S occur in the rod domain, potentially disrupting the heptad repeat motif of the alpha-helical coiled-coil (Carniel2005αMyosin). The protein's structure is further influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can modulate its activity and interactions (England2012Heavy). While the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not detailed in the context, the described domains and mutations highlight the complexity and functional importance of the MYH6 protein.

## Function
The MYH6 gene encodes the α-cardiac myosin heavy chain, a crucial component of the cardiac muscle's contractile apparatus. This protein is primarily expressed in the atrial tissues of the heart and plays a significant role in the formation of myofibrils, which are essential for muscle contraction (Anfinson2022Significance; GranadosRiveron2010αCardiac). In healthy human cells, MYH6 is involved in the assembly of myosin molecules into higher-order structures that form functional sarcomeres, the basic units of muscle fibers (GranadosRiveron2010αCardiac). The α-cardiac myosin heavy chain is involved in the ATPase cycle, mediating the kinetic coupling between nucleotide binding and the variation of affinity for actin, which is critical for muscle contraction (GranadosRiveron2010αCardiac).

MYH6 is predominantly expressed in atrial tissues postnatally, with its expression decreasing in the ventricles as development proceeds, where it is replaced by MYH7 (β-MHC) (Anfinson2022Significance). The protein's role in cardiac muscle contraction is vital for maintaining normal heart function and effective blood circulation, highlighting its importance in cardiac physiology (GranadosRiveron2010αCardiac).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYH6 gene are associated with a range of congenital heart diseases (CHDs) and cardiomyopathies. Notably, MYH6 variants are linked to hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), a severe CHD characterized by underdevelopment of the left heart structures. These variants are present in over 10% of HLHS patients and are associated with decreased transplant-free survival (TomitaMitchell2016Impact; Anfinson2022Significance). MYH6 mutations are also implicated in other left ventricular outflow tract malformations, such as bicuspid aortic valve and atrial septal defect (ASD), which often occur in family members of HLHS patients (Anfinson2022Significance).

In addition to CHDs, MYH6 mutations are linked to various cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) (Anfinson2022Significance; GranadosRiveron2010αCardiac). Specific mutations, such as the R1279X mutation, have been associated with congenital heart disease in familial cases, affecting the coiled-coil structure of the myosin tail domain (Razmara2018Wholeexome). MYH6 variants can lead to structural and functional cardiac abnormalities, contributing to conditions like HLHS and cardiac conduction diseases (Anfinson2022Significance). The gene's role in these diseases is supported by studies in animal models, which show that MYH6 mutations can lead to impaired cardiac contractility and abnormal heart morphology (Anfinson2022Significance).

## Interactions
MYH6, or myosin heavy chain 6, is involved in several critical protein interactions that are essential for cardiac function. One of the primary interactions of MYH6 is with the myosin essential light chain (RLC). A specific mutation in MYH6, I820N, significantly reduces its binding affinity to RLC, as demonstrated by GST pull-down assays and surface plasmon resonance studies (Ching2005Mutation). This interaction is crucial for the proper function of the myosin complex in cardiac muscle cells.

MYH6 also interacts with actin, forming part of the contractile apparatus in heart muscle cells. Mutations in the MYH6 gene, such as R17H, C539R, and K543R, are located in the head domain of the alpha-myosin, which is responsible for actin-binding. These mutations may disrupt actin-myosin assembly, leading to atrial septal morphogenesis failure (Posch2011Cardiac).

Additionally, MYH6 interacts with transcription factors such as TBX5, which regulates its expression. Mutations in TBX5, associated with Holt-Oram syndrome, result in lower transcriptional activation of MYH6, affecting its expression and contributing to congenital heart defects (Ching2005Mutation). These interactions highlight the importance of MYH6 in cardiac development and function.
