# FAM43B

## Overview
FAM43B is a gene located on chromosome 1p36.12 that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 43 member B. This protein is characterized by the presence of a Pleckstrin homology-like (PH-like) domain, which suggests its involvement in cellular signaling pathways. The FAM43B gene is evolutionarily conserved across multiple species, including humans, indicating its potential significance in essential biological processes (Xu2011Expression). The protein encoded by FAM43B is selectively expressed in various human tissues, such as the brain, heart, kidney, pancreas, and liver, and is believed to play a role in regulating cell proliferation, possibly acting as a tumor suppressor (Xu2011Expression). Its expression is notably downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting a potential role in tumor suppression and epigenetic regulation (Xu2011Expression). The gene's involvement in diseases such as Eosinophilic Esophagitis and its potential role in microglial homeostasis further underscore its clinical significance (Sinha2024A; Arreola2021Microglial).

## Structure


## Function
FAM43B is a gene located on chromosome 1p36.12 that encodes a protein with a Pleckstrin homology-like (PH-like) domain. This gene is evolutionarily conserved across various species, including humans, chimpanzees, mice, and rats, indicating its potential importance in fundamental biological processes (Xu2011Expression). FAM43B is selectively expressed in several human tissues, such as the brain, heart, kidney, pancreas, and liver, with lower expression in the testis and minimal expression in other tissues like the lung, spleen, and stomach (Xu2011Expression).

In healthy cells, FAM43B is believed to play a role in regulating cell proliferation, potentially acting as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, suggesting that it may be involved in tumor suppression (Xu2011Expression). The gene's expression is regulated by DNA methylation, and its downregulation in cancerous tissues indicates that it may be epigenetically silenced in HCC (Xu2011Expression). FAM43B is localized in the nucleus of HCC cells, which suggests it may influence gene expression and cellular growth by acting within the nucleus (Xu2011Expression). Further research is needed to fully elucidate its precise molecular activities and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
The FAM43B gene has been implicated in various diseases through its altered expression or mutations. In the context of Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE), the Differential Gene Expression Based Simulated Annealing (DGESA) algorithm identified FAM43B as one of the genes associated with this condition, highlighting its potential role in gastrointestinal diseases (Sinha2024A). Additionally, in a study involving a mouse model of adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), FAM43B was identified among the top differentially expressed genes following treatment with CSF1R inhibitors, suggesting its involvement in microglial homeostasis and neuronal gene expression (Arreola2021Microglial).

While the specific clinical significance of FAM43B mutations or dysregulation in human diseases remains under investigation, these findings indicate its potential relevance in certain pathological conditions. The gene's expression and interaction with other biological pathways may contribute to disease mechanisms, warranting further research to elucidate its role in health and disease. Current studies emphasize the need for continued exploration of FAM43B's biological functions and its implications in various disorders.
