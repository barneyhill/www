# DGKK

## Overview
The DGKK gene encodes the enzyme diacylglycerol kinase kappa, which is a member of the diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) family, specifically classified as a Class II isozyme. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in lipid signaling by catalyzing the conversion of diacylglycerol (DAG) to phosphatidic acid (PA), a process integral to various intracellular signaling pathways, including those in T cells (Joshi2013Diacylglycerol; Goto2008Lipid). The protein is characterized by structural features such as an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and EPAP repeats, which facilitate its interactions with lipids and proteins, thereby influencing its subcellular localization and function (Goto2008Lipid). DGKK is involved in critical cellular processes, including membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal reorganization, and has been implicated in the regulation of the DAG/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, particularly in pathological contexts such as sepsis-induced lung injury (Tu2023Extracellular). Additionally, genetic variations in DGKK have been associated with hypospadias, highlighting its clinical significance in congenital malformations (van2010Common).

## Function
Diacylglycerol kinase kappa (DGKK) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in lipid signaling pathways by converting diacylglycerol (DAG) into phosphatidic acid (PA). This conversion is crucial for regulating intracellular signaling pathways, particularly in T cells, where it influences processes such as membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal reorganization, and cell growth (Joshi2013Diacylglycerol; Goto2008Lipid).

DGKK is classified as a Class II diacylglycerol kinase isozyme and is characterized by unique structural features, including an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and EPAP repeats, which may facilitate interactions with lipids and proteins (Goto2008Lipid). These structural elements suggest that DGKK is involved in lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions, potentially influencing its subcellular localization and function in biosignaling systems (Goto2008Lipid).

While specific details about the function of DGKK in healthy human cells are not fully understood, its structural characteristics imply a role in cellular localization processes and interactions with other cellular components (Joshi2013Diacylglycerol). DGKK's activity in the cytoplasm and association with cellular membranes further supports its involvement in signal transduction and lipid metabolism (Goto2008Lipid).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DGKK gene have been strongly associated with hypospadias, a common congenital malformation of the male urethra. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DGKK, particularly rs1934179 and rs7063116, which show a significant association with the condition. These SNPs have been linked to a higher risk of hypospadias, with odds ratios of 2.5 and 2.3, respectively, indicating a substantial increase in risk for individuals carrying these alleles (van2010Common). The population attributable fraction (PAF) for the risk allele of rs1934179 is estimated to be 32% in the Dutch population and 31% in the Swedish population, suggesting that this variant is a causal factor in nearly one-third of hypospadias cases in these populations (van2010Common).

DGKK expression is most abundant in the testis and placenta, and lower expression levels have been observed in preputial tissues of carriers of the risk allele rs1934179 (van2010Common). This reduced expression in affected tissues supports the hypothesis that DGKK variants contribute to the development of hypospadias by disrupting normal cellular signaling pathways involved in urethral development (van2010Common).

## Interactions
DGKK (diacylglycerol kinase kappa) is involved in several interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It is known to interact with the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), where DGKk mRNA is the most abundant mRNA species associated with FMRP in cortical neurons. This interaction is crucial for the proper expression of DGKk, as evidenced by reduced DGKk expression in Fmr1-KO mice, which lack FMRP. The control mechanism is at the mRNA translational level, with the N-terminal domain of DGKk being essential for this interaction (Habbas2021AAVdelivery).

DGKK is also implicated in the diacylglycerol (DAG)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, particularly in the context of sepsis-induced lung injury. It is delivered via extracellular vesicles (EVs) from CD4+ T cells, leading to oxidative stress and inflammation in target cells. This process involves the activation of the PKC/NOX4 pathway, where DGKK plays a regulatory role (Tu2023Extracellular). However, DGKK does not significantly bind to PDZ domain-containing proteins, as shown by its low binding affinity with the PDZome (Zambo2023Comparative).
