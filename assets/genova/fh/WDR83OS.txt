# WDR83OS

## Overview
WDR83OS is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 83 opposite strand protein, which plays a significant role in cellular processes related to protein synthesis and trafficking. The WDR83OS protein is a component of the PAT complex, an intramembrane chaperone essential for the biogenesis of multipass membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. It interacts with various proteins, including ATP13A2, BSEP, and TRPC6, implicating it in bile homeostasis and neurodegenerative pathways (Chitwood2020An; Maddirevula2019Identification; Talbot2019Transmembrane). Mutations in the WDR83OS gene have been linked to a novel syndrome characterized by intractable itching, hypercholanemia, dysmorphism, and intellectual disability, highlighting its clinical significance in pediatric cholestatic liver disease and other conditions (Maddirevula2019Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR83OS gene have been associated with a novel syndrome characterized by intractable itching, hypercholanemia, dysmorphism, and intellectual disability. This condition is linked to a homozygous coding/splicing variant that abolishes a canonical splice donor site, leading to a frameshift and premature truncation of the protein (Maddirevula2019Identification). The syndrome was mapped to a locus on chromosome 19, which includes 351 genes, none previously associated with cholestasis, suggesting a unique role for WDR83OS in this condition (Maddirevula2019Identification).

WDR83OS interacts with ATP13A2, a gene linked to neurodegenerative disorders, and BSEP, a gene associated with neonatal cholestasis (PFIC2), indicating its potential involvement in bile metabolism and neurodegenerative pathways (Maddirevula2019Identification). The gene's expression in the liver and its interaction with proteins involved in bile homeostasis suggest that mutations in WDR83OS may contribute to the genetic heterogeneity of pediatric cholestatic liver disease (Maddirevula2019Identification).

Additionally, WDR83OS has been implicated in the modulation of TRPC6 protein levels, which are relevant in conditions where TRPC6 is implicated, such as autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (Talbot2019Transmembrane). However, the exact mechanisms and clinical significance of these interactions remain to be fully elucidated (Talbot2019Transmembrane).

## Interactions
The WDR83OS protein is involved in several interactions with other proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. It is known to interact with ATP13A2 and BSEP, both of which are significant in bile homeostasis and are associated with neurodegenerative and liver disorders (Maddirevula2019Identification). WDR83OS also interacts with the TRPC6 protein, a nonselective cation channel. This interaction is maintained even when WDR83OS is truncated, although it is expressed at lower levels. The interaction occurs preferentially with the immaturely N-glycosylated form of TRPC6 (Talbot2019Transmembrane).

WDR83OS is a component of the PAT complex, which is crucial for membrane protein biogenesis. It forms an obligate complex with CCDC47, and their interaction is essential for the stability of both proteins. This complex acts as an intramembrane chaperone, interacting with nascent transmembrane domains (TMDs) of proteins (Chitwood2020An). The PAT complex, including WDR83OS, is part of a specialized translocon for multipass membrane protein biogenesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (Sundaram2022Substratedriven). These interactions highlight the role of WDR83OS in cellular processes related to protein synthesis and trafficking.
