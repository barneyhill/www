# CTAGE8

## Overview
CTAGE8 is a gene that encodes the protein CTAGE family member 8, which is part of the CTAGE family involved in critical cellular processes such as protein transport and secretion. The CTAGE8 protein is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, playing a pivotal role in vesicle-mediated transport, essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein trafficking (Pathak2019Invariant). As a ubiquitously expressed protein, CTAGE8 is implicated in various cellular functions across multiple tissues. Although specific functions of CTAGE8 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, it is part of a broader family that includes proteins like TANGO1, which are known to facilitate the secretion of large cargos such as collagens (Feng2021Tales). The protein's involvement in the ER-Golgi interface and its potential redundancy in maintaining ER exit sites (ERES) suggest a significant role in the overall secretory pathway (Feng2021Tales).

## Function
CTAGE8, a member of the CTAGE family, is involved in essential cellular processes such as protein transport and secretion. This protein is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, playing a significant role in vesicle-mediated transport, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein trafficking (Pathak2019Invariant). CTAGE8 is ubiquitously expressed across multiple tissues, indicating its involvement in various cellular functions (Pathak2019Invariant).

The CTAGE family, including CTAGE8, is linked to the ER-Golgi interface, where it is involved in the secretion of proteins. Although specific functions of CTAGE8 in healthy human cells are not detailed, it is part of a broader family that includes proteins like TANGO1, which are known to facilitate the secretion of large cargos such as collagens (Feng2021Tales). The CTAGE family proteins, including CTAGE8, may act redundantly to maintain ER exit sites (ERES) and facilitate general secretion, suggesting a role in the overall secretory pathway (Feng2021Tales). This involvement in protein transport and secretion underscores the importance of CTAGE8 in cellular processes and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
CTAGE8 has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients, CTAGE8 is among the 170 mRNAs identified as significantly downregulated, suggesting a potential role in the disease's progression (Li2022Integrative). In the context of ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), CTAGE8, also referred to as CTAGE6P, is downregulated following crizotinib treatment, indicating its involvement in the IL6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway and cell cycle regulation (Hudson2018Crizotinib).

The gene is also noted for its expression across various tissues, although specific diseases or conditions directly associated with mutations or expression changes in CTAGE8 are not detailed in the available literature (Pathak2019Invariant). Additionally, CTAGE8 is mentioned in the context of false duplications in the GRCh38 reference genome, which may complicate its study and the understanding of its clinical significance (Chen2024Genomewide). Despite these findings, the precise clinical implications of CTAGE8 mutations or expression alterations remain under investigation, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in disease mechanisms.
