# ZNF655

## Overview
ZNF655 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 655, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by their finger-like protrusions that facilitate interactions with DNA, RNA, and other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular processes. Zinc finger protein 655, in particular, has been implicated in various cellular functions, including transcriptional inhibition and cell cycle regulation, through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids (Shao2022ZNF655; Yang2020Role). The protein's involvement in cancer progression, particularly in pancreatic and non-small-cell lung cancers, underscores its clinical significance, as its altered expression is associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis (Teng2021ZNF655; Shao2022ZNF655). Additionally, ZNF655 has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, highlighting its potential role in diverse pathological conditions (Bis2018Whole).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF655 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In pancreatic cancer, ZNF655 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression correlates with higher tumor grades and poorer prognosis, as it promotes cancer progression by enhancing the binding of E2F1 to the CDK1 promoter, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation (Shao2022ZNF655). Knockdown of ZNF655 in pancreatic cancer cell lines results in decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, and impaired migration, suggesting its role in tumor aggressiveness (Shao2022ZNF655).

In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ZNF655 is also overexpressed in tumor tissues. Its high expression is associated with increased proliferation and migration of cancer cells, while knockdown leads to increased apoptosis and reduced tumor growth. This suggests that ZNF655 may regulate apoptosis through pathways such as PI3K/Akt and p53 (Teng2021ZNF655).

ZNF655 has also been linked to Alzheimer's disease, with gene-based tests identifying significant associations with rare variants of ZNF655. These findings suggest a potential role in the disease, although further research is needed to confirm its clinical significance (Bis2018Whole).

## Interactions
ZNF655 is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In glioma endothelial cells, ZNF655 interacts with the long non-coding RNA LINC00346. This interaction is sequence-specific, as demonstrated by dual-luciferase gene reporter assays, and involves the binding of both ZNF655 mRNA and LINC00346 to the protein STAU1, which is involved in mRNA decay (Yang2020Role). ZNF655 also forms part of a feedback loop with ANKHD1 and LINC00346, where it binds to the promoter regions of genes like EGFL7, ROBO4, and ANKHD1, acting as a transcriptional inhibitor (Yang2020Role).

In pancreatic cancer, ZNF655 promotes the binding of the transcription factor E2F1 to the CDK1 promoter, facilitating cancer progression. This interaction is crucial for cell cycle regulation and is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays (Shao2022ZNF655). ZNF655 also interacts with the Integrator complex, specifically binding to the INTS13-14 subunits through a unique α-helical IBM motif, which allows it to engage with the VWA domain of INTS13 (Sabath2024Mechanistic). These interactions highlight ZNF655's role in transcription regulation and its potential impact on cancer progression.
