# KRTAP22-1

## Overview
KRTAP22-1 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 22-1, a member of the high glycine-tyrosine (HGT) family of proteins. This protein plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of keratinized tissues, such as hair and nails, by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments. These interactions are essential for providing mechanical strength and resilience to these tissues. Notably, keratin-associated protein 22-1 is the smallest known member of the HGT KAPs, with a molecular weight of 5.2 kDa, and is characterized by a low degree of repetitiveness in its structure. This unique structural feature may influence its specific interactions with keratin filaments, thereby affecting hair texture and quality (Rogers2006Human).

## Function
KRTAP22-1 encodes a keratin-associated protein that is part of the high glycine-tyrosine (HGT) family, characterized by its relatively low glycine and tyrosine content compared to other members of this group. This protein is involved in the structural integrity and function of keratinized tissues, such as hair and nails, by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments. These interactions contribute to the mechanical strength and resilience of these tissues (Rogers2006Human).

The KRTAP22-1 protein is the smallest known member of the HGT KAPs, with a molecular weight of 5.2 kDa. Its structure is noted for having a low degree of repetitiveness, which may influence its specific interactions with keratin filaments (Rogers2006Human). Although the precise function of KRTAP22-1 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, it is suggested that its role in the hair cortex is significant for influencing hair texture and quality. The protein's activity in this region is crucial for the formation of a hard and compact hair fiber, which is essential for maintaining the structural properties of hair (Rogers2006Human).
