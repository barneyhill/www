# GLI3

## Overview
GLI3 is a gene that encodes the GLI family zinc finger 3 protein, a transcription factor integral to the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is pivotal in embryonic development and cellular differentiation. The GLI3 protein is characterized by its zinc finger domain, which facilitates DNA binding, and it functions as both a transcriptional activator and repressor, depending on its processing state. This dual role is modulated by the presence of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signals, which influence the protein's form and function. GLI3 is involved in critical developmental processes, including limb and craniofacial development, and its activity is regulated through interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications. Mutations in the GLI3 gene are linked to several developmental disorders, such as Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome and Pallister-Hall syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Biesecker2020PALLISTER–HALL; Matise1999Gli; Hu2006GLI3dependent).

## Structure
The GLI3 protein is a transcription factor encoded by a 4,797-base open reading frame, resulting in a protein of 1,596 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 190 kilodaltons (Ruppert1990GLI3). The primary structure of GLI3 includes a zinc finger domain, spanning amino acids 462-645, which is crucial for its DNA-binding function (VORTKAMP1995Identification). This domain shows high similarity to the GLI protein, with 88% identity over 156 amino acids (Ruppert1990GLI3).

The secondary structure of GLI3 features an amphipathic alpha helix near the carboxy terminus, which may serve as an acidic activating domain due to its richness in acidic amino acids like aspartate and glutamate (Ruppert1990GLI3). The tertiary structure is suggested by helical wheel analysis, indicating a clustering of acidic amino acids on one face of the helix, while the opposite face is hydrophobic (Ruppert1990GLI3).

GLI3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and casein kinase I (CKI), which are essential for its interaction with the SCF βTrCP1 complex, leading to ubiquitin-dependent degradation (Shafique2019Structural). The protein is expressed as a single mRNA species of 8.5 kilobases in various cell lines (Ruppert1990GLI3).

## Function
The GLI3 gene encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is essential for various developmental processes. In healthy human cells, GLI3 primarily functions as a transcriptional regulator, capable of acting as both an activator and a repressor of gene expression. This dual functionality is mediated through its processing into different forms, influenced by the presence or absence of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signals (Matise1999Gli; Hu2006GLI3dependent).

In the absence of SHH signaling, GLI3 is processed into a truncated repressor form that regulates the expression of SHH-dependent genes, crucial for proper tissue patterning and organogenesis during embryonic development (Hu2006GLI3dependent). This repressor form is involved in establishing gradients necessary for limb development and other developmental processes (Wang2000HedgehogRegulated).

GLI3 is also involved in the regulation of genes controlling cell proliferation and differentiation, impacting processes such as limb and craniofacial development, as well as renal morphogenesis (Hu2006GLI3dependent; Kang1997Gene). The protein's activity is modulated by its interaction with other proteins, such as CREB-binding protein (CBP), which is significant for SHH signaling (Villavicencio2000The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GLI3 gene are associated with several developmental disorders, primarily Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) and Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS). GCPS is characterized by craniofacial abnormalities such as macrocephaly and hypertelorism, along with limb malformations like preaxial polydactyly and syndactyly (Démurger2014New; Jamsheer2012Expanded). PHS is marked by features such as hypothalamic hamartoma, polydactyly, bifid epiglottis, and imperforate anus (Biesecker2020PALLISTER–HALL; Démurger2014New).

The type and location of GLI3 mutations influence the resulting phenotype. Truncating mutations in the middle third of the gene are typically associated with PHS, while mutations in other regions often lead to GCPS (Démurger2014New; Johnston2010Molecular). The distinct phenotypes are hypothesized to result from the presence or absence of key functional domains in the GLI3 protein, affecting its ability to activate or repress downstream genes (Shin1999GLI).

GLI3 mutations can also cause other conditions, such as postaxial polydactyly type A and acrocallosal syndrome, though these are less common (Jamsheer2012Expanded; Radhakrishna1999The). The spectrum of phenotypes associated with GLI3 mutations is broad, and these conditions are sometimes collectively referred to as "GLI3 morphopathies" (Radhakrishna1999The).

## Interactions
GLI3, a transcription factor in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, engages in various protein interactions that influence its function. It interacts with Smad proteins, which are intracellular transducers of TGFβ family signals. Notably, carboxy-terminally truncated forms of GLI3, such as Gli3C´∆ClaI, associate with Smad1, -2, -3, and -4, with stronger interactions observed with Smad1 and -2. These interactions are negatively affected by BMP and TGF-β stimulation (Liu1998Carboxyterminally).

GLI3 also binds to the Mediator complex, specifically interacting with the MED12 subunit. This interaction is crucial for GLI3's transactivation function in response to Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling. The binding occurs through a specific transactivation domain known as the MED12/Mediator-binding domain (MBD). Disruption of the GLI3-MED12 interaction inhibits GLI3's transactivation function, while MED12 depletion enhances it (Zhou2006Mediator).

Additionally, GLI3 interacts with βTrCP1, a component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, through multiple phosphodegron motifs. This interaction is essential for GLI3's ubiquitination and degradation, regulated by phosphorylation at specific sites by kinases such as PKA, CK1, and GSK3β (Shafique2019Structural).
