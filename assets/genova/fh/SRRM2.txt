# SRRM2

## Overview
The SRRM2 gene encodes the serine/arginine repetitive matrix 2 protein, which is integral to RNA processing and gene expression regulation. This protein is a key component of nuclear speckles, which are involved in RNA splicing and transcription regulation. As a part of the spliceosome complex, SRRM2 facilitates the removal of introns from pre-mRNA, ensuring accurate RNA splicing. It interacts with various proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing, such as SRRM1, CDC5L, and PRPF8, and its intrinsically disordered regions contribute to the formation of biomolecular condensates necessary for nuclear speckle formation (Zhang2023Familial; Ilık2020SON). The protein's function is conserved across species, highlighting its fundamental role in cellular processes (Ilık2020SON). Mutations and altered expression of SRRM2 have been linked to several diseases, including papillary thyroid carcinoma, neurodevelopmental disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring its clinical significance (horvath2015role; Zhang2023Familial; Tomsic2015A).

## Function
The SRRM2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in RNA processing and gene expression regulation in healthy human cells. SRRM2 is a key component of nuclear speckles (NS), which are membraneless nuclear bodies involved in RNA splicing and transcription regulation. It forms a scaffold with the SON protein, binding other proteins within NS and maintaining their structure and function (Zhang2023Familial; Ilık2020SON). 

SRRM2 is involved in the spliceosome complex, facilitating the removal of introns from pre-mRNA, which is essential for accurate RNA splicing. It interacts with several proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing, such as SRRM1, CDC5L, and PRPF8, which are crucial for various stages of mRNA splicing (Zhang2023Familial). The protein's intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are suggested to play a role in liquid-liquid phase separation, contributing to the formation of biomolecular condensates necessary for NS formation (Ilık2020SON).

SRRM2's function is conserved across species, as evidenced by its presence in both yeast and human spliceosomes, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Ilık2020SON). Its activity in the nucleus is vital for maintaining chromatin interactions and ensuring proper gene expression, which is essential for normal cellular function and organismal development (Zhang2023Familial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SRRM2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), a missense mutation in SRRM2, specifically the S346F variant, is associated with predisposition to the disease. This mutation affects alternative splicing, potentially contributing to PTC development by altering exon inclusion in certain transcripts (Tomsic2015A). The mutation exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance, suggesting interactions with environmental factors or other genetic elements (Tomsic2015A).

In neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), SRRM2 mutations, such as a heterozygous nonsense mutation, lead to premature termination of the protein, affecting RNA splicing. This disruption is linked to congenital intellectual disabilities and speech delays, indicating an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (Zhang2023Familial).

SRRM2 is also associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Variants like P630Q and P804T may influence protein interactions within the spliceosome, potentially contributing to neurodegeneration through altered gene expression patterns (horvath2015role).

In multiple myeloma, elevated SRRM2 expression in abnormal plasma cells correlates with disease progression and poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and target for immunotherapy (Guo2024SRRM2).

## Interactions
SRRM2, or serine/arginine repetitive matrix 2, is a protein that plays a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing and nuclear speckle organization. It forms condensates through phase separation, a process driven by its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and interactions such as cation-π interactions between tyrosine and arginine, and coulombic interactions with nucleic acids (Xu2022SRRM2). SRRM2 interacts with splicing-speckle proteins like SON and with pre-mRNA or non-coding speckle RNA such as MALAT1 (Xu2022SRRM2).

SRRM2 is a primary target of the mAb SC35 antibody, which is used to stain nuclear speckles, indicating its crucial role in these structures (Ilik2020SON). It co-purifies with spliceosomes and interacts with proteins such as Prp8p (PRPF8) and Snu114p (EFTUD2), supporting the activated conformation of PRP8's switch-loop during the spliceosome's B act stage (Grainger2009Physical; Ilik2020SON). The protein also interacts with SRRM1 and RBM25, with these interactions being compromised in truncated versions of SRRM2 (Ilik2020SON).

SRRM2's interactions are modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its localization and function (Xu2022SRRM2). These interactions highlight SRRM2's role in organizing splicing condensates and its potential interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids in the context of alternative splicing.
