# BAIAP2L1

## Overview
BAIAP2L1 is a gene that encodes the protein BAR/IMD domain containing adaptor protein 2 like 1, also known as insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (IRTKS). This protein is a member of the IRSp53 family and plays a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling, which is essential for maintaining cell shape, motility, and division. IRTKS is characterized by its BAR domain, which facilitates membrane curvature and interacts with other proteins to regulate endocytosis and signal transduction. It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm at sites of dynamic membrane activity, contributing to cellular processes such as migration and invasion. The protein's involvement in actin filament reorganization and its interactions with various cellular components underscore its significance in cellular dynamics and structural integrity. BAIAP2L1 has been implicated in several cancers, where it is associated with enhanced cell migration and invasion, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chao2015BAI1Associated; Pipatpanyanugoon2021BAIAP2L1; Renaud2022Multiomic).

## Structure
The BAIAP2L1 gene encodes a protein known as insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (IRTKS), which is involved in plasma membrane protrusion and actin formation during cell morphogenesis and migration. The protein is composed of 511 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 57 kD (Chao2015BAI1Associated). BAIAP2L1 belongs to the IRSp53 family and contains several key domains: an N-terminal I-BAR domain, a central SH3 domain, and a C-terminal WH2 domain (Postema2018IRTKS).

The I-BAR domain is crucial for targeting the protein to the tips of growing microvilli, where it interacts with acidic phospholipids and matches the outward membrane curvature (Postema2018IRTKS). The SH3 domain facilitates multiple protein-protein interactions, recruiting proteins such as EPS8, which is involved in actin capping and bundling (Postema2018IRTKS). The WH2 domain directly contributes to microvillar elongation by interacting with actin filaments (Postema2018IRTKS).

BAIAP2L1 is involved in Src-dependent cell migration and MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination, and it promotes cell proliferation through the activation of the EGFR-ERK pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (Chao2015BAI1Associated). The protein's interaction with EPS8 is essential for microvillar elongation, highlighting its role in cellular structure and signaling (Postema2018IRTKS). The context does not provide detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, specific folds, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of BAIAP2L1.

## Function
BAIAP2L1, also known as IRTKS, is a protein involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape, motility, and division. It contains a BAR domain that facilitates membrane curvature and interacts with other proteins to regulate endocytosis and signal transduction. BAIAP2L1 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly at sites of dynamic membrane activity, where it plays a role in cellular processes such as migration and invasion (Pipatpanyanugoon2021BAIAP2L1).

In healthy human cells, BAIAP2L1 is involved in the formation of filopodia, which are actin-rich protrusions that aid in cell movement and environmental sensing. The protein interacts with components of the filopodium-like protrusion (FLP) complex, such as Aldolase A and Cofilin, to regulate actin filament reorganization. This interaction is essential for the spatial accumulation of phosphorylated cofilin (pCofilin) at the inner part of migrating cells, contributing to cell motility (Pipatpanyanugoon2021BAIAP2L1).

The protein's activity in actin remodeling and its interactions with other proteins highlight its importance in cellular dynamics and structural integrity. These functions are critical for normal cellular operations, including migration and division, which are essential for tissue development and repair.

## Clinical Significance
The BAIAP2L1 gene, also known as IRTKS, has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell migration and metastasis. In breast cancer, BAIAP2L1 is identified as a novel oncoprotein associated with advanced and metastatic stages. Its expression enhances cancer cell migration and invasion, particularly in HER2-positive breast cancer cases. The gene's involvement in filopodia formation and interaction with proteins like cofilin, which is crucial for actin polymerization, underscores its role in cancer progression (Pipatpanyanugoon2021BAIAP2L1).

In ovarian cancer, BAIAP2L1 is considered a potential biomarker due to its higher expression levels in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. The gene's expression is even more pronounced in metastatic sites, suggesting its role in cancer progression and metastasis. The presence of an FGFR3-BAIAP2L1 fusion gene in ovarian cancer tissues further indicates its involvement in cancer pathology (Chao2015BAI1Associated).

In papillary thyroid cancer, a BAIAP2L1-BRAF fusion has been identified, which activates the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, leading to increased cell proliferation and invasion. This fusion is associated with tumorigenesis and highlights the potential of BAIAP2L1 as a therapeutic target (Renaud2022Multiomic).

## Interactions
BAIAP2L1, also known as IRTKS, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It is part of the IRSp53 family and contains the IMD (IRSp53 and Missing-in-Metastasis Domain) and SH3 domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins. The IMD domain is part of the BAR domain family, known for binding to highly curved, negatively charged membranes and interacting with actin filaments (Chao2015BAI1Associated).

BAIAP2L1 acts as a scaffold protein, aiding in the assembly of protein complexes to the actin filament or membranes with specific curvature. It has been linked to Src-dependent cell migration and MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination (Chao2015BAI1Associated). In the context of basal airway epithelial cells, BAIAP2L1 is part of a protein-protein interaction network resembling a spectrin-IRSp53 pedestal, interacting with proteins such as Anxa2, Macf1, and Lima1, which suggests cooperative assembly of actin-associated proteins (Olatona2024Candidate).

BAIAP2L1 also interacts with the translocated intimin receptor (TIR) from enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic E. coli, as validated by LUMIER assays, indicating its role in pathogen-host interactions (Blasche2014The). Additionally, BAIAP2L1 is involved in the BAIAP2L1-BRAF fusion protein, which interacts with KRAS, although this interaction is significantly impaired compared to wild-type BRAF (Renaud2022Multiomic).
