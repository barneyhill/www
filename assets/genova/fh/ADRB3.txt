# ADRB3

## Overview
The ADRB3 gene encodes the beta-3 adrenergic receptor (β3-AR), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure. This receptor is primarily involved in the regulation of lipolysis and thermogenesis, particularly in brown and beige adipose tissues. The β3-AR plays a significant role in energy homeostasis by activating pathways that increase cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, thereby promoting the breakdown of fats and the production of heat. The receptor's unique resistance to desensitization, due to the absence of phosphorylation sites for certain kinases, makes it a promising target for therapeutic interventions aimed at metabolic disorders. Variations in the ADRB3 gene, such as the Trp64Arg polymorphism, have been linked to metabolic and cardiovascular conditions, underscoring its clinical relevance (Cero2021β3Adrenergic; Daghestani2018ADRB3; Emorine1989Molecular).

## Structure
The ADRB3 gene encodes the β3-adrenoceptor (β3-AR), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a 7-transmembrane domain structure. The primary structure of the β3-AR consists of a polypeptide chain of 408 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 42,881 daltons (Pasha2024Inside; Emorine1989Molecular). The secondary structure includes seven α-helical membrane-spanning domains, which are typical of GPCRs and form the catecholamine binding site (Emorine1989Molecular). 

The β3-AR features a glycosylated extracellular N-terminal region and an intracellular C-terminus. It has three intra- and extracellular loops but lacks phosphorylation sites for PKA and β-ARK kinases, making it resistant to agonist-induced desensitization (Pasha2024Inside). This resistance is significant for its potential as a therapeutic target. The receptor's tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, forming a transmembrane domain. The β3-AR does not typically form quaternary structures as it functions as a monomer. Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which may affect receptor activity and localization (Emorine1989Molecular).

## Function
The ADRB3 gene encodes the β3-adrenergic receptor, which plays a crucial role in regulating lipolysis and thermogenesis in human brown and beige adipocytes. This receptor is primarily expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT), the urinary bladder, and the gallbladder. It is involved in the activation of adenylyl cyclase to produce cyclic AMP (cAMP), which raises the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a key protein in thermogenesis (Cero2021β3Adrenergic). In healthy cells, stimulation of β3-AR increases intracellular cAMP levels, leading to the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) pathways. These pathways promote lipolysis and thermogenic gene transcription (Valentine2022β3Adrenergic).

The β3-adrenergic receptor is essential for maintaining functional lipolytic machinery and thermogenic capacity in adipocytes. Silencing ADRB3 results in decreased lipolysis and impaired activation of hormone-sensitive lipase, as well as reduced cellular respiration and ATP production (Cero2021β3Adrenergic). The receptor's activation by agonists like mirabegron can increase lipolysis and energy expenditure, highlighting its potential in treating metabolic diseases (Cero2021β3Adrenergic). The proper functioning of ADRB3 is critical for maintaining energy balance and responding to hormonal signals that regulate fat metabolism (Valentine2022β3Adrenergic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADRB3 gene, particularly the Trp64Arg polymorphism, have been associated with several metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. This polymorphism is linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is associated with increased body weight, dyslipidemias, and a higher waist-to-hip ratio, particularly in certain populations such as Saudis and Finns (Widén1995Association; Daghestani2018ADRB3). The Trp64Arg variant is also connected to higher levels of leptin and lower levels of adiponectin, contributing to dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis, which are risk factors for coronary artery disease (Luo2020The).

In addition to metabolic disorders, the Trp64Arg polymorphism is associated with hypertension, especially in men with type 2 diabetes, and may influence blood pressure regulation through its effect on adrenergic receptor sensitivity (Li2018ADRB3; Ringel2000The). The polymorphism has also been linked to early onset type II diabetes and diabetic retinopathy, particularly in Japanese patients (ROZEC2006β3Adrenoceptors). These associations highlight the clinical significance of ADRB3 gene variations in the pathogenesis of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.
