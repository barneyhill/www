# SLC12A7

## Overview
The SLC12A7 gene encodes the protein known as solute carrier family 12 member 7 (KCC4), which is a member of the cation-chloride cotransporter family. KCC4 is a transmembrane protein that facilitates the electroneutral transport of potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl-) ions across cell membranes, playing a vital role in maintaining ion balance and cell volume regulation (Hebert2004Molecular; Zabidi2023Investigating). This protein is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, inner ear, and nervous system, where it contributes to essential physiological processes such as renal ion reabsorption and auditory function (Marcoux2017Molecular). KCC4's activity is regulated through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and it is subject to alternative splicing, which can result in different isoforms (Xie2020Structures; BazúaValenti2016Physiological). The gene's dysregulation has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including adrenocortical carcinoma and congenital hydrocephalus, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Brown2018SLC12A7; Jin2019SLC12A).

## Structure
The SLC12A7 gene encodes the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC4, a member of the cation-chloride cotransporter family. KCC4 is characterized by its transmembrane domains, which facilitate the transport of potassium and chloride ions across cell membranes (Hebert2004Molecular). The protein is 1083 amino acids in length and plays a crucial role in cell volume regulation and ion transport (Zabidi2023Investigating). 

KCC4 shares structural features with other members of the SLC12 family, including a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD) (Xie2020Structures). The CTD is involved in regulating the transporter's activity through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which are common post-translational modifications affecting KCC4's function (BazúaValenti2016Physiological). 

The protein's structure is similar to that of KCC2, with a dimeric arrangement in the TMD, although specific details about the quaternary structure of KCC4 are not provided (Xie2020Structures). KCC4 is also subject to alternative splicing, which can result in different isoforms that may alter its function or localization. 

Overall, KCC4's structure and regulatory mechanisms are integral to its role in maintaining ionic homeostasis and contributing to various physiological processes.

## Function
The SLC12A7 gene encodes the K-Cl cotransporter 4 (KCC4), which is involved in the electroneutral movement of potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl-) ions across cell membranes. This cotransporter plays a critical role in maintaining ion balance and cell volume regulation. KCC4 is widely expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, where it is localized at the basolateral membrane of type-A intercalated cells and proximal tubule cells. In the kidney, KCC4 is involved in renal K+-Cl- cotransport and contributes to transepithelial transport of Na+-Cl- by the proximal tubule, playing a role in renal acidification and the reabsorption of ions (Marcoux2017Molecular; Hebert2004Molecular).

In the inner ear, KCC4 is expressed on the surface of supporting outer and inner hair cells, where it helps recycle K+ ions back to the endolymph, a process essential for maintaining the electrochemical potential necessary for hearing. The absence of KCC4 leads to toxic accumulation of K+ in hair cells, resulting in hearing loss (Marcoux2017Molecular).

KCC4 is also expressed in the nervous system, where it may play a role in reabsorbing potassium from cerebrospinal fluid, although its exact function in the brain remains less defined (Marcoux2017Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC12A7 gene, encoding the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC4, has been implicated in various diseases due to mutations or altered expression levels. In adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), overexpression of SLC12A7 is associated with increased cell motility and invasive behavior, contributing to the aggressive nature of the cancer. This overexpression enhances cellular attachment and detachment turnover, potentially through increased filopodia formation and interaction with Ezrin, and is linked to several signaling pathways, including osmotic stress and Hippo signaling (Brown2018SLC12A7).

In congenital hydrocephalus, a novel de novo copy number variant deletion in SLC12A7 has been identified, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of the condition by affecting ion transport. This deletion is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, cognitive impairment, or intellectual disability, indicating a potential role in brain development (Jin2019SLC12A).

Additionally, SLC12A7 dysregulation is linked to insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling in ACC, where its overexpression correlates with IGF1 overexpression, potentially influencing tumor behavior and hormone secretion (Brown2019InsulinLike).

## Interactions
SLC12A7, also known as KCC4, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. In adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) cells, SLC12A7 has been shown to co-localize with the protein Ezrin at the cell surface. This interaction is thought to influence cell motility and extracellular interactions, potentially contributing to the aggressive invasive behavior observed in these cancer cells (Brown2018SLC12A7). 

The overexpression of SLC12A7 in ACC cells is associated with changes in cell adhesion properties, which may be mediated through its interactions with cytoskeletal components like Ezrin. These interactions are believed to alter cell membrane attachment kinetics, enhancing motility and invasive characteristics (Brown2018SLC12A7). 

In the context of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling, SLC12A7 may interact with IGF1, potentially influencing its recruitment to the cell membrane and increasing the activity of related ion channels. This interaction suggests a possible IGF1-SLC12A7 signaling pathway that could be relevant in tumor progression (Brown2019InsulinLike). 

These interactions highlight the role of SLC12A7 in modulating cellular behavior through its association with other proteins, impacting processes such as cell adhesion, motility, and signaling pathways.
