# DHRS7B

## Overview
The DHRS7B gene encodes the protein dehydrogenase/reductase 7B, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This family of proteins is characterized by their enzymatic activity, primarily involving the oxidation and reduction of small molecules. Dehydrogenase/reductase 7B is implicated in various metabolic processes, although its specific biological roles and substrates remain to be fully elucidated. The protein's function is thought to be significant in cellular metabolism and homeostasis, potentially influencing pathways related to lipid metabolism and detoxification. Understanding the precise mechanisms and interactions of DHRS7B could provide insights into its contributions to human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
