# ABCG2

## Overview
The ABCG2 gene encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) protein, also known as the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) or Junior blood group antigen. This protein is a transmembrane transporter belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, which plays a pivotal role in the efflux of a wide range of substrates, including drugs and xenobiotics, across cellular membranes. As a 'half-transporter,' ABCG2 requires dimerization to function effectively, facilitating the transport of substances out of cells using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis (Taylor2017Structure; Sarkadi2004ABCG2). The protein is highly expressed in tissues involved in absorption and excretion, such as the liver, intestine, and kidney, and is crucial for protecting cells from toxic compounds and contributing to multidrug resistance in cancer (Huls2008The; Homolya2021Medically). The clinical significance of ABCG2 is underscored by its involvement in drug resistance and its impact on the pharmacokinetics of various therapeutic agents, making it a critical factor in personalized medicine (Homolya2021Medically).

## Structure
The ABCG2 protein, also known as the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. It is characterized as a 'half-transporter' with a single nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a transmembrane domain (TMD) fused into a single polypeptide chain (Taylor2017Structure). The TMD consists of six membrane-spanning α-helices, forming a compact structure with a central cavity that acts as a substrate binding site (Khunweeraphong2017The; Eckenstaler20203D). The NBD contains conserved motifs such as the Walker A and B motifs, Q-loop, and C-signature motif, which are essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Eckenstaler20203D).

ABCG2 functions as a homodimer, with dimerization necessary for its activity (Taylor2017Structure). The protein's quaternary structure involves the formation of a homodimer, with disulfide bonds contributing to its stability (Sarkadi2020The). Post-translational modifications include N-glycosylation at N596, which is crucial for protein stability, although not essential for its transport function (Sarkadi2020The; Taylor2017Structure). The protein also features a unique extracellular loop (EL3) containing cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds (Eckenstaler20203D).

## Function
The ABCG2 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, specifically involved in the active transport of various substrates across cellular membranes using ATP hydrolysis. This protein plays a crucial role in the efflux of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds, contributing to multidrug resistance and the protection of tissues such as the blood-brain barrier, placenta, and intestines (Ni2010Structure; Sarkadi2004ABCG2).

In healthy human cells, ABCG2 is highly expressed in stem cells, where it provides protection against toxic substances by actively extruding them out of the cells. This function is particularly important in maintaining the undifferentiated state of human embryonic stem cells and in protecting hematopoietic stem cells, as evidenced by its high expression in these cell types (Scharenberg2002The; Apáti2008High). The protein is also involved in the regulation of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, influencing the bioavailability of various pharmacological agents (Sarkadi2004ABCG2).

ABCG2 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, small intestine, kidney, and the apical membrane of proximal tubule cells in the kidney, where it contributes to the excretion of drugs and toxic substances into the urine (Huls2008The). Its activity is crucial for protecting tissues against xenobiotics and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Sarkadi2004ABCG2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ABCG2 gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In cancer, ABCG2 is associated with multidrug resistance, impacting the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. Its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in several cancers, including hematopoietic malignancies and some solid tumors (Homolya2021Medically; Noguchi2014Human). Specific polymorphisms, such as Q141K, affect drug efflux and sensitivity, leading to increased drug accumulation and potential toxic side effects, such as gefitinib-induced diarrhea and sunitinib-induced severe thrombocytopenia (Homolya2021Medically).

ABCG2 mutations also contribute to non-cancerous conditions. The Q141K polymorphism is associated with higher serum uric acid levels and gout due to impaired protein folding and reduced membrane expression (Zámbó2018Clinically). Other polymorphisms, like V12M and Q126X, have been linked to altered drug responses and toxic side effects (Homolya2021Medically). In Abcg2-deficient mice, the absence of ABCG2 leads to phototoxic lesions upon light exposure, indicating its role in restricting intestinal uptake of certain compounds (Homolya2021Medically). These genetic variations highlight the importance of considering ABCG2 in personalized medicine, as they can significantly affect drug pharmacokinetics and contribute to various diseases.

## Interactions
ABCG2, also known as the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), primarily forms homodimers through disulfide bonds, particularly at cysteine residue Cys603, which is crucial for its function as an efflux transporter (McDevitt2009Purification; Koshiba2008Human). The protein may also form higher-order oligomers, such as tetramers or dodecamers, which are stabilized by non-covalent protein-protein interactions and are resistant to reductant treatment (McDevitt2009Purification). These oligomeric states are influenced by the presence of substrates and other conditions, suggesting a functional requirement for oligomerization in drug transport (McDevitt2009Purification).

ABCG2 interacts with heme, which is significant for its function under hypoxic conditions. This interaction is primarily ionic and is enhanced by the presence of certain substrates, indicating a cooperative interaction that enhances transport activity (Krishnamurthy2004The). The protein's interaction with heme is crucial for protecting cells from porphyrin accumulation, which can be detrimental under hypoxic conditions (Krishnamurthy2004The). These interactions highlight ABCG2's role in cellular protection and drug resistance.
