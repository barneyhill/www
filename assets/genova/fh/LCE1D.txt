# LCE1D

## Overview
LCE1D, or late cornified envelope 1D, is a gene located within the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) that encodes a protein involved in the formation of the cornified envelope (CE), a critical component of the skin's barrier function. The protein encoded by LCE1D is part of the LCE family, which is expressed during the terminal stages of epidermal differentiation. These proteins are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the CE by serving as cross-bridging molecules that interact with other structural proteins and lipids, thereby forming a robust and impermeable barrier beneath the plasma membrane (Leśniak2024Dynamics). The expression of LCE1D is tightly regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, ensuring its activity is confined to the appropriate stages of keratinocyte differentiation (Leśniak2024Dynamics). This regulation is crucial for the protein's role in supporting skin integrity and defense against environmental stressors.

## Function
LCE1D (late cornified envelope 1D) is a gene within the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) that plays a crucial role in the formation of the cornified envelope (CE), a key component of the skin's barrier function. The LCE1D gene is part of the LCE gene family, which encodes proteins that are expressed during the later stages of epidermal differentiation. These proteins are involved in the structural integrity of the CE by acting as cross-bridging molecules, linking with other structural proteins and lipids to form a thick, impermeable barrier beneath the plasma membrane (Leśniak2024Dynamics).

The expression of LCE1D is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, including histone modifications. In undifferentiated keratinocytes, repressive histone marks such as H3K27me3 are present on the promoters of EDC genes, including LCE1D. These marks are lost upon differentiation, leading to increased expression of LCE1D and other differentiation genes (Leśniak2024Dynamics). This regulation ensures that LCE1D is expressed at the appropriate stage of cell differentiation, contributing to the formation of the CE and maintaining the skin's protective barrier function. The protein's activity is primarily localized to the epidermis, where it supports skin integrity and defense against environmental stressors.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LCE1D gene have been implicated in several skin conditions. In the context of eczema, a study identified a stop codon mutation in the LCE1D gene, suggesting that this mutation may impact protein function and contribute to the pathogenesis of eczema by increasing susceptibility, similar to known mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG) (Marenholz2011Association). However, another part of the same study indicated that the effect of this mutation on eczema is unlikely, as no significant association was found (Marenholz2011Association).

In coronary heart disease (CHD), the LCE1D gene was found to be downregulated in patients, highlighting its potential role in the disease's progression. This downregulation may be linked to m6A RNA methylation, which is involved in various biological processes and could influence CHD development (Li2022m6A).

In vesicular hand eczema (VHE), the expression of LCE1D was noted to be significantly altered in lesional skin compared to control skin, although these changes could not be consistently reproduced in further validation tests (Voorberg2021Vesicular).
