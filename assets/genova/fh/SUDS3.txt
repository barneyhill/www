# SUDS3

## Overview
The SUDS3 gene encodes the SDS3 homolog, a critical component of the SIN3A corepressor complex, which is involved in transcriptional regulation through chromatin remodeling. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil regions and a Sin3 Interaction Domain (SID), facilitating its interaction with other proteins within the complex, such as Sin3A and HDAC1. Functionally, SUDS3 is integral to histone deacetylation, a process that leads to gene silencing by promoting a condensed chromatin state, thereby reducing gene expression. This activity is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression in response to cellular signals. SUDS3's role extends to cell cycle regulation and differentiation, contributing to normal embryonic development and cellular homeostasis. Clinically, SUDS3 is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, where its upregulation is associated with tumor promotion (Adams2018Co-repressor; Silveira2009Overexpression; Fang2020Long).

## Structure
The SUDS3 protein, a component of the SIN3A corepressor complex, plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. Structurally, SUDS3 contains coiled-coil regions and a C-terminal Sin3 Interaction Domain (SID), which are essential for its interaction with other proteins in the complex, such as Sin3A and HDAC1 (Adams2018Co-repressor). The SID forms a multi-helical structure, consisting of an extended N-terminal segment and a 13-residue helix, which makes hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts with the Sin3A HID (Adams2018Co-repressor).

The protein's dimerization is facilitated by its coiled-coil motifs, which are shared with its paralogs BRMS1 and BRMS1L, suggesting a conserved mechanism of interaction within the complex (Clark2015Structural). The dimerization domain of SUDS3 is characterized by a head-to-tail antiparallel arrangement, with hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions stabilizing the structure (Clark2015Structural).

SUDS3 is also involved in nucleic acid interactions, with conserved basic regions in its sequence that allow binding to double-stranded DNA, indicating a potential role in chromatin anchoring (Clark2015Structural). This structural organization is critical for the assembly and function of the Sin3L/Rpd3L corepressor complex.

## Function
SUDS3, also known as SDS3 homolog, is a component of the SIN3A corepressor complex, which plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation by modifying chromatin structure. It is involved in histone deacetylation, a process that leads to gene silencing by removing acetyl groups from histone proteins, thereby promoting a more condensed chromatin state and reducing gene expression. This activity is essential for maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression in response to various cellular signals (Silveira2009Overexpression).

SUDS3 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to several critical cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and differentiation. By participating in the SIN3-HDAC chromatin remodeling complexes, SUDS3 helps control the accessibility of transcription factors to DNA, thus influencing the transcriptional programs that govern cell proliferation and differentiation. This regulatory function is vital for normal embryonic development and cellular homeostasis (Silveira2009Overexpression).

Although SUDS3 has been implicated in cancer, its specific role in healthy human cells is primarily associated with its function in the SIN3A complex, where it ensures proper chromatin structure and function, thereby maintaining normal cellular and organismal outcomes (Silveira2009Overexpression).

## Clinical Significance
The SUDS3 gene, a component of the SIN3A corepressor complex, plays a significant role in cancer progression, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In TNBC, SUDS3 is upregulated and acts as a tumor promoter. Its expression is enhanced in TNBC cells compared to normal cells, and its silencing has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, promote apoptosis, and inhibit cell motility. This suggests that alterations in SUDS3 expression contribute to the aggressive nature of TNBC (Fang2020Long).

SUDS3 is involved in the SNHG22/miR-324-3p axis, where it is a downstream target. SNHG22 sponges miR-324-3p, leading to increased SUDS3 expression, which facilitates TNBC cell growth and motility. The repression of miR-324-3p or overexpression of SUDS3 can counteract the anti-tumor effects of SNHG22 silencing, highlighting its role in TNBC pathogenesis (Fang2020Long).

Despite its role in TNBC, SUDS3 does not function as a metastasis suppressor in other cancer contexts. Overexpression of SUDS3 in BRMS1-non-expressing metastatic cells does not suppress metastasis or affect related phenotypes, indicating distinct functional roles from its homolog BRMS1 (Silveira2009Overexpression).

## Interactions
The SUDS3 protein, a component of the SIN3A corepressor complex, plays a crucial role in protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. SUDS3 interacts with Sin3A/B through a conserved Sin3A/B interaction domain (SID), which is essential for the assembly and function of the Sin3L/Rpd3L corepressor complex (Clark2015Structural). It forms homodimers and heterodimers with BRMS1, utilizing the same dimerization interface, which is important for recruiting histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity into the complex (Clark2015Structural). Although SUDS3 does not directly interact with HDAC1, it facilitates the simultaneous engagement of Sin3A with HDAC1, contributing to the complex's stability and function (Clark2015Structural).

SUDS3 also exhibits nucleic acid-binding capabilities. It contains a capped Tudor domain that binds nucleic acids capable of forming higher-order structures, such as G-quadruplexes (Marcum2021A). This domain shows a preference for G-quadruplexes over random DNA duplexes and RNA sequences, indicating a specific interaction with these structures (Marcum2021A). The protein's ability to bind nucleic acids suggests a role in mediating interactions within the Sin3L/Rpd3L complex, potentially influencing chromatin modification and gene transcription regulation (Marcum2021A).
