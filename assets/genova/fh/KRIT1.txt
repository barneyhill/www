# KRIT1

## Overview
KRIT1, also known as CCM1, is a gene that encodes the KRIT1 ankyrin repeat containing protein, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining vascular integrity and cellular homeostasis. The protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains and a FERM domain, which facilitate crucial protein-protein interactions necessary for endothelial cell junction integrity and cardiovascular development (Francalanci2009Structural; Zhang2015Structural). As a scaffold protein, KRIT1 interacts with various partners, including integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein-1α (ICAP1α) and the small GTPase Rap1, to regulate endothelial barrier function and angiogenesis (Zhang2001Interaction; Glading2007KRIT1CCM1). Mutations in the KRIT1 gene are linked to cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), which are vascular anomalies in the brain that can lead to significant neurological symptoms (Couteulx1999Truncating). These mutations often result in loss-of-function, contributing to the pathogenesis of CCMs and related vascular disorders (Ricci2021KRIT1).

## Structure
The KRIT1 protein, also known as CCM1, is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains and a FERM domain, which are crucial for its function in maintaining endothelial cell junction integrity and cardiovascular development. The ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) consists of four repeats that facilitate protein-protein interactions and are structurally similar to designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) (Zhang2015Structural). The FERM domain, located towards the C-terminus, is composed of three subdomains: F1, F2, and F3. The F1 subdomain binds Rap1 in a GTP-dependent manner, while the F3 subdomain is predicted to have a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain (Gingras2012Structural; Francalanci2009Structural).

KRIT1's structure includes a stable ARD-FERM interface, with the ARD packing against the FERM domain, forming a compact configuration (Zhang2015Structural). The interaction between KRIT1 and the transmembrane protein HEG1 is mediated by a hydrophobic groove between the F1 and F3 subdomains, which is essential for anchoring KRIT1 at endothelial cell junctions (Gingras2012Structural).

KRIT1 exists in multiple isoforms, including KRIT1A and KRIT1B, which differ in their structural and functional properties due to alternative splicing. KRIT1B lacks a functional PTB binding pocket, affecting its ability to bind Rap1A and its subcellular localization (Francalanci2009Structural).

## Function
The KRIT1 gene, also known as CCM1, plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular integrity and cellular homeostasis by regulating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In healthy human cells, KRIT1 is involved in modulating the expression of antioxidant proteins, particularly superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), which is essential for scavenging superoxide anions and protecting cells from oxidative stress (Goitre2010KRIT1). KRIT1 also regulates the expression of the transcription factor FoxO1, which is involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress and the transition from cell proliferation to quiescence (Goitre2010KRIT1).

KRIT1 is active in endothelial cells, where it helps maintain cell-cell junctions by interacting with proteins such as β-catenin and p120-catenin, which are crucial for cell adhesion and vascular stability (Glading2007KRIT1CCM1). The loss of KRIT1 function leads to increased ROS levels, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which can result in DNA damage and impaired cellular functions (Goitre2010KRIT1). These processes highlight KRIT1's role in protecting cells from oxidative damage and maintaining cellular and vascular health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRIT1 gene are primarily associated with cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), which are vascular malformations in the brain that can lead to seizures, headaches, and neurological deficits. These malformations are characterized by enlarged capillary cavities without intervening brain tissue, and they can result in clinical symptoms such as hemorrhage and focal neurological deficits (Couteulx1999Truncating). The KRIT1 gene mutations are typically loss-of-function mutations, including nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations, which lead to premature stop codons or large deletions (Ricci2021KRIT1). 

In Mexican-American families, a common mutation, 742C→T in exon 6, results in a premature termination codon and is prevalent due to a founder effect (Sahoo1999Mutations). In non-Hispanic Caucasian families, distinct mutations such as frameshifts and splice site mutations have been identified, indicating genetic diversity across populations (Sahoo1999Mutations). 

KRIT1 mutations are also linked to hyperkeratotic cutaneous capillary-venous malformations (HCCVMs), which can occur alongside CCMs. The KRIT1∆ G103 mutation, for example, introduces an early stop codon and is associated with both cerebral and cutaneous vascular malformations (Eerola2000KRIT1). The penetrance of KRIT1 mutations for CCMs is high, estimated at 88%, but lower for HCCVMs, around 38% (Eerola2000KRIT1).

## Interactions
KRIT1, also known as CCM1, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in maintaining vascular integrity. KRIT1 interacts with integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein-1α (ICAP1α) through a NPXY motif in its N-terminus. This interaction is significant in the context of cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM), as KRIT1 competes with β1 integrin for binding to ICAP1α, suggesting a regulatory role in β1 integrin-mediated angiogenesis (Zhang2001Interaction).

KRIT1 also interacts with the small GTPase Rap1, which is essential for the localization of KRIT1 to endothelial cell-cell junctions. This interaction stabilizes these junctions and is crucial for maintaining endothelial barrier function (Glading2007KRIT1CCM1).

Additionally, KRIT1 binds to the kelch family protein Nd1-L, a cytosolic actin-binding protein. This interaction involves the FERM domain of KRIT1 and influences its subcellular localization, potentially affecting cellular responses to oxidative stress (Guazzi2012Identification).

KRIT1 also interacts with sorting nexin 17 (SNX17) through the NPXF2 motif, which may play a role in integrin activation and cardiovascular development (Stiegler2014Structural). These interactions highlight KRIT1's role as a scaffold protein in various signaling pathways.
