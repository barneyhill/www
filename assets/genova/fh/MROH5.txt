# MROH5

## Overview
The MROH5 gene encodes the protein known as maestro heat-like repeat family member 5, which is part of a family characterized by the presence of heat-like repeat motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that MROH5 may play a role in cellular signaling or structural organization. While the specific functions of the MROH5 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its classification within the heat-like repeat family indicates potential involvement in various cellular processes. The gene is expressed in multiple tissues, and its dysregulation has been implicated in certain pathological conditions, although further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance.
