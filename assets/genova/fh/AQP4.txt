# AQP4

## Overview
Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is a gene that encodes the aquaporin-4 protein, a crucial component of the water channel family predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. The aquaporin-4 protein is a transmembrane protein that facilitates the rapid transport of water across cell membranes, playing a vital role in maintaining water homeostasis in the brain (Nagelhus2013Physiological). It is primarily localized in the astrocytic endfeet at the blood-brain barrier and interfaces with the cerebrospinal fluid, where it contributes to the regulation of extracellular space volume and potassium homeostasis, essential for synaptic transmission and neuronal activity (Mader2019Aquaporin4). The protein's structure, characterized by six transmembrane alpha-helices, allows it to form tetramers that enhance its water permeability and facilitate its polarized distribution in astrocytes (Alberga2014A; Nagelhus2013Physiological). AQP4's involvement in the glymphatic system underscores its importance in clearing interstitial fluid and waste products from the brain, a process linked to neurodegenerative disease prevention (Mader2019Aquaporin4). The gene's clinical significance is highlighted by its association with conditions such as neuromyelitis optica and muscular dystrophies, where alterations in AQP4 expression or function can have profound pathological consequences (Papadopoulos2012Aquaporin; Frigeri2002Altered).

## Structure
Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is a water channel protein primarily expressed in the brain, characterized by its structure of six transmembrane alpha-helices that form a water-selective pore (Alberga2014A). The protein exists as a tetramer, with each monomer containing an independent channel, contributing to its quaternary structure (Alberga2014A). AQP4 forms orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs) in the plasma membrane, with the tetramer serving as the structural subunit of these arrays (Wolburg2011Structure).

AQP4 has two main isoforms, M1 and M23, which differ by 22 amino acids at the N-terminus due to alternative translation initiation sites (Alberga2014A; Furman2003Aquaporin4). The M23 isoform is more abundant and forms larger square arrays compared to M1, which can down-regulate the assembly of these arrays (Rash2004Freezefracture; Furman2003Aquaporin4). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, modulate AQP4's water permeability, with specific sites like Ser-180 and Ser-111 being phosphorylated by protein kinase C and G, respectively (Ho2009Crystal). Palmitoylation of cysteine residues in the M1 isoform also affects the assembly of OAPs (Wolburg2011Structure).

## Function
Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is a water channel protein predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the astrocytic endfeet at the blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid interfaces. It plays a crucial role in maintaining cerebral water balance, which is essential for normal brain function (Ho2009Crystal; Mader2019Aquaporin4). AQP4 facilitates bidirectional water transport across cell membranes, contributing to the regulation of extracellular space volume and potassium homeostasis, which are vital for synaptic transmission and neuronal activity (Nagelhus2013Physiological; Mader2019Aquaporin4).

AQP4 is involved in the clearance of interstitial fluid and waste products from the brain, a process that is part of the glymphatic system. This system is particularly active during sleep and is responsible for removing neurotoxic waste, including beta-amyloid, which is associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's (Mader2019Aquaporin4). The protein's polarized expression on astrocytes is crucial for its function in the glymphatic system and for maintaining water homeostasis (Mader2019Aquaporin4).

Structurally, AQP4 forms tetramers in the plasma membrane, which may enhance water permeability and facilitate its polarized distribution in astrocytes (Nagelhus2013Physiological). The protein's conductance is modulated by phosphorylation, affecting its activity in response to physiological conditions (Nagelhus2013Physiological).

## Clinical Significance
Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is implicated in several neurological and muscular disorders due to alterations in its expression or function. In neuromyelitis optica (NMO), AQP4 is targeted by autoantibodies, leading to inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system. The binding of these antibodies, particularly to the M23 isoform of AQP4, results in complement-dependent cytotoxicity, which is a key mechanism in NMO pathogenesis (Papadopoulos2012Aquaporin; Verkman2013Biology).

In muscular dystrophies, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD), AQP4 expression is significantly reduced. This reduction is not due to changes in muscle fiber composition but is linked to a decrease in total muscle protein content. The loss of AQP4 is specific to these dystrophies and is not observed in other forms like limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (Frigeri2002Altered).

AQP4 is also involved in cerebral edema, where its expression changes can influence the severity of the condition. Variants of the AQP4 gene can alter water permeability, affecting outcomes in conditions like traumatic brain injury and stroke (Sorani2008Novel). Understanding these alterations is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies targeting AQP4 in these diseases.

## Interactions
Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function and localization. AQP4 forms a complex with transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) in astrocytes, which is essential for regulatory volume decrease (RVD) and hypotonicity-induced calcium influx. This interaction is specific, as AQP4 does not form complexes with other proteins like AQP1 or TRPV1 (Benfenati2011An).

AQP4 also interacts with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) through α-syntrophin, which helps anchor AQP4 in the astrocyte end-feet plasma membrane. This interaction is important for the polarized expression of AQP4 in astrocytes (Neely2001Syntrophindependent; TörnrothHorsefield2022Insight). The interaction with α-syntrophin is mediated through a PDZ-binding motif at the C-terminus of AQP4 (Neely2001Syntrophindependent).

AQP4 interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner, which is important for its targeting to the plasma membrane. This interaction is mediated by a CaM-binding site located at residues 256-275 of AQP4 (TörnrothHorsefield2022Insight; Kitchen2020Targeting). AQP4 is also suggested to interact with the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1, although the direct nature of this interaction is debated (Sjöhamn2014Unraveling; Benfenati2010Water).
