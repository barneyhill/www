# EPPIN

## Overview
EPPIN, or epididymal peptidase inhibitor, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein primarily expressed on the surface of spermatozoa. The EPPIN protein is characterized by its dual-domain structure, comprising a WFDC (Whey Acidic Protein Four-Disulfide Core) domain and a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain, which are crucial for its biological functions. As a protease inhibitor, EPPIN plays a significant role in regulating sperm motility and maturation by interacting with semenogelin I (SEMG1) and other ligands. This interaction is essential for modulating sperm's internal pH and calcium levels, thereby controlling sperm function and ensuring fertilization occurs at the appropriate time. Additionally, EPPIN provides antimicrobial protection to sperm and has been implicated in modulating inflammatory responses, highlighting its broader physiological significance (Silva2012Characterization; Gomes2023Interactions; Silva2013Interacting).

## Structure
EPPIN is a protein characterized by its dual-domain structure, comprising a WFDC (Whey Acidic Protein Four-Disulfide Core) domain and a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain. The WFDC domain is located at the N-terminal (Pro22 to Leu70), while the Kunitz domain is at the C-terminal (Val76 to Pro133), connected by a hinge region (Asp71 to Asp75) (Gomes2023Interactions). The protein's structure is stabilized by seven disulfide bonds, with four in the WFDC domain and three in the Kunitz domain (Gomes2023Interactions).

The tertiary structure of EPPIN involves the spatial arrangement of these domains, allowing for conformational flexibility facilitated by the hinge region. This flexibility is crucial for EPPIN's function, as it enables the protein to assume a closed conformation that forms an orthosteric binding pocket. This pocket interacts with SEMG1 and mimetic compounds through hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions (Gomes2023Interactions). The presence of a druggable hotspot in the Kunitz domain, particularly the Asn repeat, is essential for EPPIN's activity (Gomes2023Interactions).

EPPIN is known to interact with the plasma membrane through hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, with specific residues like Leu24, Phe123, and Pro133 playing a role in anchoring (Gomes2023Interactions). The protein's interaction with SEMG1 and small organic ligands is crucial for its role in modulating sperm motility (Gomes2023Interactions).

## Function
EPPIN (epididymal peptidase inhibitor) is a protein primarily expressed on the surface of spermatozoa, where it plays a crucial role in regulating sperm motility and maturation. EPPIN interacts with semenogelin I (SEMG1) during ejaculation, forming a complex that inhibits sperm motility by modulating the sperm's internal pH and calcium levels (Silva2012Characterization; Silva2013Interacting). This interaction is essential for controlling sperm function, ensuring that spermatozoa achieve full fertilizing capacity at the appropriate time (Silva2013Interacting).

EPPIN contains WFDC (Whey-acid four disulfide core) and Kunitz-type domains, which are involved in its binding to SEMG1 and other ligands (Gomes2023Interactions). Specific amino acid residues, such as Cys102, Tyr107, and Phe117, are critical for these interactions, highlighting their importance in EPPIN's function (Silva2012Characterization). EPPIN also inhibits the digestion of SEMG1 by prostate-specific antigen (PSA), thereby modulating semen liquefaction and prolonging the inhibitory effects on sperm motility (Silva2013Interacting).

The protein's role extends to providing antimicrobial protection to sperm, as EPPIN and SEMG1-derived peptides exhibit antibacterial properties, protecting sperm from microorganisms in the vaginal environment (Silva2013Interacting).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the EPPIN gene can have significant implications for male fertility. The interaction between EPPIN and semenogelin I (SEMG1) is crucial for regulating sperm motility post-ejaculation. Disruptions in this interaction, such as mutations in the EPPIN gene or changes in its expression, can lead to reproductive issues, including infertility. Men with semen coagulum that fails to liquefy properly often exhibit poor sperm motility, which is linked to infertility (Silva2013Interacting). EPPIN has also been identified as a potential target for male contraception. Antibodies against EPPIN can block SEMG1 binding, inhibiting sperm motility, which suggests that alterations in EPPIN's normal function could be leveraged for contraceptive purposes (Silva2013Interacting).

EPPIN's role extends beyond reproduction, as it is involved in modulating inflammatory responses. It has been shown to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced chemokine production and NF-κB activation, indicating an anti-inflammatory role in lung tissues. EPPIN expression is upregulated in conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome and cystic fibrosis, suggesting its involvement in these conditions (Scott2017Characterisation). However, specific diseases directly resulting from mutations in the EPPIN gene are not detailed in the available context.

## Interactions
EPPIN (epididymal peptidase inhibitor) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the male reproductive system through its interactions with other proteins. One of its primary interactions is with semenogelin (SEMG1), a seminal plasma protein. This binding occurs on the surface of spermatozoa following ejaculation and is significant for inhibiting sperm motility, which is essential for preventing premature hyperactivation and capacitation of sperm in the female reproductive tract (O’Rand2016Nonhormonal). The interaction between EPPIN and SEMG1 results in a rapid decrease in internal pH and calcium levels, disrupting the physiological cascade necessary for fertilization (O’Rand2016Nonhormonal).

EPPIN also interacts with lactotransferrin (LTF), with specific binding sites identified in the C-terminal sequences of EPPIN. The major binding sites for SEMG1 and LTF are located in the sequences C102-P133 and F117-P133, respectively, with critical residues such as Cys102, Tyr107, and Phe117 playing essential roles in these interactions (Silva2012Characterization). These interactions are concentration-dependent and saturable, with SEMG1 and LTF effectively inhibiting the binding of their biotinylated counterparts to EPPIN (Silva2012Characterization). The binding of SEMG1 to EPPIN is also influenced by the presence of small organic ligands like EP055 and EP012, which compete with SEMG1 for EPPIN binding, indicating overlapping binding sites (Gomes2023Interactions).
