# PABPC5

## Overview
PABPC5 is a gene that encodes the protein poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 5, which is a member of the poly(A) binding protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation within the cytoplasm of human cells. It binds to the poly(A) tails of mRNA molecules, playing a crucial role in post-transcriptional gene expression control by influencing mRNA metabolism processes such as polyadenylation, export, translation, and turnover (Goss2012Poly(A; mangus2003poly) page 0 of 5). Notably, PABPC5 lacks the carboxy-terminal PABC domain found in other poly(A) binding proteins, suggesting a unique functional role that may involve distinct protein interaction capabilities (Goss2012Poly(A) page 1 of 5). Despite these structural differences, PABPC5 is essential for forming the 'closed loop' structure in messenger ribonucleoprotein particles, which is critical for translation initiation and termination, ribosome recycling, and mRNA stability (mangus2003poly).

## Function
PABPC5 (poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 5) is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation in human cells. It binds to the poly(A) tails of mRNA molecules, which is crucial for the post-transcriptional control of gene expression. This binding influences various stages of mRNA metabolism, including polyadenylation, export, translation, and turnover of transcripts (Goss2012Poly(A; mangus2003poly) page 0 of 5). PABPC5 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a role in forming a 'closed loop' structure in messenger ribonucleoprotein particles. This structure is vital for translation initiation and termination, ribosome recycling, and mRNA stability (mangus2003poly).

Unlike other poly(A) binding proteins, PABPC5 lacks the carboxy-terminal PABC domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions. This absence suggests that PABPC5 may have a unique functional role compared to other PABPCs, potentially lacking certain protein interaction capabilities (Goss2012Poly(A) page 1 of 5). Despite its structural differences, PABPC5 contributes to essential cellular processes related to mRNA stability and translation, impacting overall gene expression and cellular function (mangus2003poly).
