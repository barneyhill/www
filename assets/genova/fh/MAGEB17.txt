# MAGEB17

## Overview
MAGEB17 is a gene that encodes the protein MAGE family member B17, which is part of the broader Melanoma Antigen Gene (MAGE) family. This family is characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, and is notably recognized for its expression in cancerous tissues. The MAGEB17 protein is categorized as a cancer/testis antigen (CTA), a group of proteins typically expressed in the testis and various tumors, making them of interest in cancer research and potential therapeutic targets (Zendman2003Cancertestis‐associated). The expression of MAGEB17 and its associated protein has been linked to tumorigenicity and chemoresistance, particularly in aggressive cancers such as pediatric medulloblastomas (Collins2024Melanoma). Additionally, alterations in the MAGEB17 gene have been explored in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting a broader significance beyond oncology (Costa2024Copy).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
MAGEB17, a member of the MAGE (Melanoma Antigen Gene) family, has been implicated in various clinical contexts due to its expression patterns and potential role in disease. Alterations in the expression of MAGEB17 have been associated with cancer, particularly as part of the broader MAGE-B subfamily, which is known for its expression in cancerous tissues. This expression pattern suggests a potential role in cancer diagnosis or treatment, particularly in the context of cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) that are expressed in tumors and testis tissues (Zendman2003Cancertestis‐associated).

In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a study identified a potentially pathogenic copy number variation (CNV) involving the MAGEB17 gene in a Brazilian patient. This CNV was maternally inherited and classified as potentially pathogenic, indicating a possible link between MAGEB17 and neurodevelopmental disorders, although the specific clinical significance of MAGEB17 in ASD remains unclear (Costa2024Copy).

In pediatric medulloblastomas, particularly the aggressive group 3 subtype, MAGEB17 is part of the MAGE gene expression that contributes to tumor heterogeneity and is associated with poor prognosis and therapy resistance. Targeting MAGE genes, including MAGEB17, is suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy due to their role in tumorigenicity and chemoresistance (Collins2024Melanoma).
