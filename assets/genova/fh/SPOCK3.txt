# SPOCK3

## Overview
SPOCK3, also known as Testican-3, is a gene that encodes a secreted extracellular matrix proteoglycan belonging to the SPARC family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in extracellular matrix interactions and is categorized as a proteoglycan due to its structural domains, which include the SPARC/osteonectin domain, CWCV, and Kazal-like domains. These domains facilitate its role in binding growth factors and interacting with the cell matrix, contributing to its function as a proteinase inhibitor and anti-adhesive molecule. SPOCK3 is predominantly expressed in the brain, prostate, and ovaries, suggesting its involvement in tissue-specific functions and potential roles in neural development and cancer progression (Luo2023Mechanism; Xiao2024SPOCK:).

## Structure
SPOCK3, also known as Testican-3, is a proteoglycan that is part of the SPARC family, characterized by its involvement in extracellular matrix interactions. The protein structure includes several distinct domains: the SPARC/osteonectin domain, CWCV, and Kazal-like domains, which are similar to thyropin-type cysteine protease inhibitors (Luo2023Mechanism; Xiao2024SPOCK:). These domains contribute to its functional properties, such as binding to growth factors and interacting with the cell matrix (Xiao2024SPOCK:).

SPOCK3 is encoded by the human chromosome region 4q32.3 and is known to produce multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing (Xiao2024SPOCK:). The protein is a pure heparan sulfate proteoglycan, unlike its family member SPOCK1, which carries both heparan and chondroitin sulfate chains (Sun2020&lt; p&gt; SPOCK1). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are suggested to influence its activity and interactions, although specific details on these modifications for SPOCK3 are not provided in the context (Sun2020&lt; p&gt; SPOCK1).

The protein's expression is notably high in the brain, prostate, and ovaries, indicating its potential role in these tissues (Xiao2024SPOCK:). Despite the detailed domain information, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of SPOCK3 are not available in the provided context.

## Function
SPOCK3, also known as Testican-3, is a proteoglycan that plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity of the extracellular matrix and basal laminae. It functions as a proteinase inhibitor and an anti-adhesive molecule, which may help preserve tissue structure and prevent tumor invasion (Luo2023Mechanism). SPOCK3 is prominently expressed in the brain and prostate, particularly in epithelial cells, stromal cells, and smooth muscle cells, suggesting its involvement in tissue-specific functions (Luo2023Mechanism).

In terms of molecular processes, SPOCK3 is involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix organization and glycosaminoglycan binding. It is associated with several signaling pathways, including PI3K-Akt and MAPK, which are crucial for cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation (Luo2023Mechanism). The protein's expression is linked to immune cell infiltration, indicating a role in modulating immune responses within tissues (Luo2023Mechanism).

SPOCK3 is also expressed in various brain regions, such as the olfactory bulb, cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and striatum, which are associated with psychiatric disorders. This expression pattern suggests a potential role in neural development and function (Xiao2024SPOCK:). The protein's activity in these regions may influence processes like cell migration and proliferation, impacting overall brain function and health.

## Clinical Significance
SPOCK3, a gene encoding a secreted extracellular matrix proteoglycan, plays a significant role in the progression of prostate cancer. Alterations in its expression levels are linked to the disease's prognosis. Low expression of SPOCK3 is associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients, as it is found to be lower in cancerous tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and further reduced in advanced stages of the disease (Luo2023Mechanism). The gene's expression is correlated with several signaling pathways, including PI3K-Akt and MAPK, which are crucial in cancer progression (Luo2023Mechanism).

SPOCK3 expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration in prostate cancer tissues. Higher expression levels correlate with increased infiltration of immune cells such as Mast cells, NK cells, and B cells, suggesting a protective role against cancer progression (Luo2023Mechanism). Additionally, SPOCK3 is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process involved in cancer metastasis, with its overexpression reducing the migratory and invasive abilities of prostate cancer cells, indicating a potential tumor-suppressive function (Luo2023Mechanism). These findings highlight SPOCK3's potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in prostate cancer.
