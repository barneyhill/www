# ADGRD1

## Overview
ADGRD1, also known as GPR133, is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor D1, a member of the adhesion GPCR family. This receptor is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a long N-terminal region and a seven-transmembrane domain typical of GPCRs. The protein plays a crucial role in cellular signaling by coupling with G proteins, particularly the Gs protein, to activate the adenylyl cyclase pathway, thereby increasing intracellular cAMP levels. This signaling is essential for various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and communication. ADGRD1 is involved in several protein interactions that modulate its signaling capabilities, notably in the context of glioblastoma, where it interacts with proteins such as PTK7 and ESYT1. The gene's expression and mutations have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and metabolic conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Frenster2022PTK7; Bohnekamp2011Cell; Fischer2016Functional).

## Structure
ADGRD1, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor D1, is a member of the adhesion GPCR family characterized by a complex molecular structure. The protein features a long N-terminal region with various domains, including the GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, which is crucial for receptor activation through autoproteolytic cleavage at the GPCR proteolysis site (GPS). This cleavage results in two fragments: an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF) containing the transmembrane domain (TMD) (Qu2022Structural).

The tertiary structure of ADGRD1 includes a seven-transmembrane domain typical of GPCRs, forming an open 'V' shape that allows the tethered stalk region to interact with the receptor helical bundle, a key feature for receptor activation (Qu2022Structural). The stalk region acts as a tethered agonist, with its N-terminal half lying in a binding cavity within the helical bundle and the C-terminal half capping the TMD pocket (Qu2022Structural).

ADGRD1's quaternary structure involves interactions with G proteins, facilitated by a more open G protein-binding cavity compared to other GPCRs, allowing the C terminus of the Gα α5-helix to fit into a binding cavity composed of helices II, III, V, VI, and VII (Qu2022Structural). The protein's active conformation is stabilized by an interaction core involving residues at specific positions, with a conserved P6.47bxxG motif contributing to a kink in helix VI, essential for receptor activation (Qu2022Structural). 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in GPCRs, although specific modifications for ADGRD1 are not detailed in the available context. The structural insights into ADGRD1 highlight its potential as a target for drug discovery due to its unique activation mechanisms and structural features (Qu2022Structural).

## Function
ADGRD1, also known as GPR133, is an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in several molecular processes in human cells. It primarily couples with the Gs protein, leading to the activation of the adenylyl cyclase pathway and resulting in increased intracellular cAMP levels. This signaling pathway is crucial for various cellular functions, including cell adhesion and communication (Bohnekamp2011Cell; Fischer2016Functional).

The receptor is characterized by a long N-terminus, which includes a pentraxin-like domain and a GPCR autoproteolysis inducing (GAIN) domain. This structure allows for autoproteolytic cleavage, producing an extracellular N-terminal fragment (NTF) and an intracellular C-terminal fragment (CTF). The cleavage and subsequent dissociation of these fragments are essential for receptor activation and signaling (Stephan2021Activation; Fischer2016Functional).

ADGRD1 is expressed on the cell surface, where it plays a role in constitutive signaling pathways, often activated by agonists. Its activity is linked to its expression levels and structural integrity, particularly in the 7TM domain (Bohnekamp2011Cell). The receptor's function can be modulated by naturally occurring mutations, which may alter its basal activity and expression (Fischer2016Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ADGRD1 gene, also known as GPR133, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly glioblastoma (GBM), a highly aggressive brain cancer. GPR133 is upregulated in CD133+ glioma stem cells, which are crucial for tumor growth and survival in hypoxic conditions. Knockdown of GPR133 in GBM cells leads to reduced tumor formation and increased survival in animal models, indicating its role in tumorigenicity (Bayin2016GPR133). High expression levels of GPR133 correlate with poor prognosis in GBM patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Bayin2016GPR133).

In addition to its role in cancer, variations in the ADGRD1 gene have been associated with metabolic differences, human height, and heart frequency. Genome-wide association studies have linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADGRD1 with postprandial levels of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and heart rate (Fischer2016Functional). Some non-synonymous SNPs in ADGRD1 result in altered receptor function, which may contribute to clinically relevant phenotypes, although these mutations are generally compatible with life when heterozygous (Fischer2016Functional).

## Interactions
ADGRD1, also known as GPR133, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its signaling capabilities. In the context of glioblastoma (GBM), ADGRD1 interacts with PTK7, a transmembrane protein that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GPR133 signaling. This interaction requires PTK7 to be membrane-tethered and GPR133 to undergo autoproteolytic cleavage. PTK7 binds to the N-terminal fragment of GPR133, enhancing receptor signaling when expressed on adjacent cells (Frenster2022PTK7).

ADGRD1 also interacts with Extended Synaptotagmin 1 (ESYT1), an intracellular protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. This interaction is signaling-independent and modulates GPR133 signaling by attenuating Gas-mediated signaling. The interaction is regulated by cytosolic calcium levels, with increased calcium leading to the dissociation of ESYT1 from GPR133, thereby enhancing signaling. The C2C domain of ESYT1 is crucial for this interaction, which does not affect the plasma membrane localization of GPR133 (Stephan2023Modulation).

These interactions highlight the role of ADGRD1 in forming multiprotein complexes and engaging in transient interactions that modulate its signaling pathways, particularly in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma.
