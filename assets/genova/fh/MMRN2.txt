# MMRN2

## Overview
The MMRN2 gene encodes the protein multimerin 2, a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in vascular biology. Multimerin 2 is characterized by its complex structure, including an N-terminal EMI domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal C1q domain, which facilitate its interactions with various proteins and its assembly into high molecular weight multimers (Colombatti2012The; Khan2017Multimerin2). Functionally, multimerin 2 is involved in maintaining vascular stability and regulating angiogenesis by modulating the VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling pathway and interacting with endothelial cell surface receptors such as CD93 (Galvagni2017Dissecting; Pellicani2020Multimerin2). Its role in stabilizing endothelial cell junctions and inhibiting angiogenic sprouting underscores its importance in vascular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by pathological angiogenesis, such as cancer and corneal neovascularization (Wang2023The; Andreuzzi2017The).

## Structure
Multimerin 2 (MMRN2) is a large extracellular matrix protein characterized by several distinct structural domains. The primary structure of MMRN2 includes an N-terminal EMI domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal C1q domain (Colombatti2012The; Khan2017Multimerin2). The EMI domain is notable for its seven cysteine residues, which are uniquely spaced, distinguishing it from other cysteine-rich domains (Colombatti2012The). The central region of MMRN2 is predicted to form coiled-coil structures, which are crucial for its interactions with other proteins, such as CLEC14A and CD93 (Galvagni2017Dissecting; Khan2017Multimerin2).

The tertiary structure of MMRN2 involves the formation of a fibrillar network on the cell surface, which is important for its function in the extracellular matrix (Andreuzzi2017The). MMRN2 forms homotrimeric structures and assembles into high molecular weight multimers, contributing to its quaternary structure (Colombatti2012The). Post-translational modifications of MMRN2 include disulfide bond formation, which is essential for maintaining its binding conformation with proteins like CLEC14A (Khan2017Multimerin2). The protein is also subject to degradation by matrix metalloproteinases, such as MMP-9, which affects its function in angiogenesis (Andreuzzi2017The).

## Function
Multimerin 2 (MMRN2) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular stability and permeability. It is primarily active in endothelial cells, where it regulates the VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling axis, essential for angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis (Pellicani2020Multimerin2). MMRN2 is involved in stabilizing endothelial cell junctions, as its depletion leads to increased vascular permeability due to the disruption of adherens and tight junctions, characterized by the disintegration of VE-cadherin and β-catenin (Pellicani2020Multimerin2).

MMRN2 also exerts angiostatic functions by binding to VEGFA and other pro-angiogenic cytokines, inhibiting angiogenic sprouting. During angiogenic stimuli, MMRN2 mRNA levels decrease, suggesting its expression is down-regulated to allow efficient angiogenic sprouting (Andreuzzi2017The). The protein forms a fibrillar network on the cell surface, maintaining the non-migratory state of endothelial cells (Andreuzzi2017The).

In addition, MMRN2 interacts with C-type lectins such as CD93, playing a role in cell adhesion and migration, which are vital for endothelial cell function (Galvagni2017Dissecting). This interaction is crucial for processes like wound healing and angiogenesis, highlighting MMRN2's role in maintaining vascular integrity and function in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MMRN2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer and vascular diseases. In cancer, MMRN2 acts as a homeostatic barrier that inhibits endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, thereby affecting tumor growth. Its absence leads to abnormal vasculature, tumor vessel hypoxia, and decreased chemotherapy responsiveness, highlighting its importance in vessel homeostasis and cancer therapy outcomes (Lorenzon2011MULTIMERIN2; Li2023Angiogenesis). MMRN2 expression is often lost in several tumor types, which can compromise chemotherapy efficacy due to increased vascular permeability and reduced drug delivery (Pellicani2020Multimerin2).

In the context of corneal neovascularization, the miR-1910-5p/MMRN2 axis plays a crucial role. miR-1910-5p negatively regulates MMRN2, leading to increased vascular permeability and neovascularization. Targeting this axis has been suggested as a potential therapeutic approach for conditions involving abnormal neovascularization, such as corneal neovascularization and age-related macular degeneration (Wang2023The). These findings underscore the potential of MMRN2 as a target for therapeutic interventions in diseases characterized by pathological angiogenesis and vascular instability.

## Interactions
Multimerin 2 (MMRN2) is an extracellular matrix protein that participates in several key interactions influencing endothelial cell function and angiogenesis. MMRN2 interacts with CD93, a transmembrane glycoprotein, forming a complex that is crucial for endothelial cell adhesion and migration. This interaction is significant in angiogenesis, particularly in tumor environments, where CD93 is highly expressed in endothelial cells of tumor blood vessels. Disruption of the CD93-MMRN2 interaction impairs endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, suggesting its potential as a target for antiangiogenic therapies (Galvagni2017Dissecting).

MMRN2 is also processed by matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which cleaves MMRN2 to facilitate endothelial cell motility and sprouting angiogenesis. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of angiogenic processes, as MMP-9-mediated degradation of MMRN2 allows for the release of sequestered angiogenic factors (Andreuzzi2017The).

Additionally, MMRN2 interacts with integrins, forming a complex with β1 integrin and CD93 that is internalized and recycled during cell adhesion and migration. This complex is regulated by Rab5c, a small GTPase, which is essential for the trafficking and recycling of the CD93/MMRN2/β1 integrin complex, thereby influencing endothelial cell adhesion and migration (Barbera2019The).
