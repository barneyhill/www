# TBC1D23

## Overview
TBC1D23 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 23, which plays a pivotal role in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the endosome-to-Golgi transport pathway. The protein is characterized by the presence of TBC, rhodanese, and Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, which facilitate its function as an adaptor in cellular trafficking processes (Huang2019Structural; Liu2020Structure). Although the TBC domain is structurally similar to GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), it lacks GAP activity due to specific residue substitutions (Liu2020Structure). TBC1D23 interacts with key proteins such as FAM21 and golgins, which are essential for its role in vesicle capture and trafficking at the trans-Golgi network (Huang2019Structural; Shin2017TBC1D23). Mutations in TBC1D23 have been linked to pontocerebellar hypoplasia, a neurodevelopmental disorder, underscoring its importance in neuronal development and function (Laugwitz2020Pontocerebellar).

## Structure
The TBC1D23 protein is characterized by distinct structural domains that contribute to its function in intracellular trafficking. The protein contains both TBC and rhodanese domains, which are tightly packed and stabilized by multiple hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Liu2020Structure). The TBC domain, spanning residues 14-298, is similar to that of Gyp1p, a GAP for Rab33, but lacks GAP activity due to specific residue substitutions (Liu2020Structure). The rhodanese domain, comprising residues 316-460, adopts an α/β topology typical of single rhodanese domains but is unlikely to possess phosphatase or sulfurtransferase activity (Liu2020Structure).

The C-terminal domain of TBC1D23 adopts a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain fold, characterized by two perpendicular beta sheets and a C-terminal amphipathic helix (Huang2019Structural). This domain interacts with phosphoinositides and the endosomal protein FAM21, playing a crucial role in endosomal trafficking (Huang2019Structural). Specific residues, such as K632, K633, and K634, are critical for its interaction with FAM21 (Huang2019Structural).

The protein's structure is essential for its function as an adaptor in endosome-to-Golgi trafficking, linking it to the WASH complex and golgin-97/245 (Liu2020Structure).

## Function
The TBC1D23 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in intracellular trafficking, particularly in endosome-to-Golgi transport. It functions as a bridging factor, facilitating the capture of endosomal vesicles by golgins at the trans-Golgi network (Shin2017TBC1D23). TBC1D23 interacts with the WASH complex subunit FAM21, which is essential for the trafficking of specific transmembrane proteins, such as TGN46, from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus (Shin2017TBC1D23; Tu2024TBC1D23). 

In addition to its role in vesicle trafficking, TBC1D23 is involved in Golgi-specific LKB1 signaling. It recruits LKB1 to the Golgi, promoting the activation of AMPK, a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, particularly under energy stress conditions (Tu2024TBC1D23). This signaling pathway is crucial for normal neuronal development, as demonstrated in zebrafish models where Golgi-targeted expression of LKB1 can rescue TBC1D23 deficiency (Tu2024TBC1D23). 

TBC1D23's interaction with golgin-97 and golgin-245 is vital for its localization at the trans-Golgi network and for maintaining proper cellular function by facilitating the correct trafficking and localization of proteins within the cell (Liu2020Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBC1D23 gene are associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH), a group of rare neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impaired brain development, particularly affecting the pons and cerebellum. These mutations can lead to a nonprogressive form of the disease, resulting in microcephaly, delayed development, movement issues, and intellectual disability (Huang2019Structural; Laugwitz2020Pontocerebellar). TBC1D23 mutations disrupt endosome-to-Golgi trafficking, which is crucial for proper neuronal development. This disruption is linked to defects in intracellular trafficking, contributing to the pathogenesis of PCH (Huang2019Structural; Liu2020Structure).

In zebrafish models, TBC1D23 deficiency results in impaired neuronal growth and brain size, mimicking features of PCH. These models demonstrate that the interaction between TBC1D23 and golgin-97/245 is essential for proper neuronal development (Liu2020Structure). In humans, TBC1D23 mutations can lead to a decline in neurite outgrowths and cortical lamination anomalies, affecting brain structure and function (Cavusoglu2024Evaluation). Clinical features in patients with TBC1D23 mutations include global developmental delay, ataxia, spasticity, and seizures, with MRI findings showing pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia (Laugwitz2020Pontocerebellar).

## Interactions
TBC1D23 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular trafficking. It acts as a bridging factor for endosomal vesicle capture by golgins at the trans-Golgi network. TBC1D23 directly binds to the N-termini of golgin-97 and golgin-245, facilitating the capture of endosomal vesicles. Specific mutations in golgin-97 disrupt this binding, highlighting the specificity of these interactions (Shin2017TBC1D23; Liu2020Structure).

TBC1D23 also interacts with the WASH complex, particularly with the subunit FAM21. This interaction is essential for vesicle capture and is mediated by the C-terminal region of TBC1D23, which binds to FAM21 and endosome-derived carriers (Huang2019Structural; Shin2017TBC1D23). The binding of TBC1D23 to FAM21 is crucial for endosome-to-Golgi trafficking, and mutations that impair this interaction can disrupt normal neuronal development (Huang2019Structural).

In the context of energy stress, TBC1D23 recruits LKB1 to the Golgi, activating Golgi-AMPK and reorganizing the Golgi structure. This interaction is vital for neuronal development, as demonstrated in zebrafish models (Tu2024TBC1D23).
