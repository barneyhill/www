# OR51B5

## Overview
OR51B5 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 51 subfamily B member 5, which is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily expressed in human skin cells, particularly in suprabasal keratinocytes, where it plays a crucial role in intracellular calcium signaling and keratinocyte migration. The activation of OR51B5 by its ligand, isononyl alcohol, triggers a cAMP-adenylate cyclase-dependent signaling pathway, leading to increased intracellular calcium levels and promoting wound healing processes (Tsai2016Two). Beyond its physiological roles in skin, OR51B5 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including chronic myelogenous leukemia and systemic mastocytosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Nedoszytko2020Results; Manteniotis2016Deorphanization).

## Function
OR51B5 is an olfactory receptor expressed in human skin cells, particularly in suprabasal keratinocytes. It is part of the G-protein coupled receptor family and is involved in intracellular calcium signaling. Activation of OR51B5 by its ligand, isononyl alcohol, leads to an increase in intracellular calcium levels through a cAMP-adenylate cyclase-dependent signaling pathway (Tsai2016Two). This receptor plays a significant role in keratinocyte migration and wound healing, as evidenced by its ability to accelerate wound healing in HaCaT cell and keratinocyte monolayers, as well as in human skin organ explants (Tsai2016Two).

OR51B5 influences several phosphorylation pathways, including the phosphorylation of proteins such as p38MAPK, Hsp27, and AMPKα1, which are crucial for keratinocyte migration and wound healing (Tsai2016Two). It also modulates cytokine release, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is important for cellular processes related to wound repair (Tsai2016Two). These functions suggest that OR51B5 is involved in maintaining epidermal homeostasis and promoting skin regeneration, highlighting its potential therapeutic applications in skin diseases and wound healing (Tsai2016Two).

## Clinical Significance
The olfactory receptor OR51B5 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in relation to myelogenous leukemia. Studies have shown that OR51B5 is ectopically expressed in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell lines and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patient cells. Activation of OR51B5 by its ligand, isononyl alcohol, leads to increased intracellular calcium levels and reduced cell proliferation in CML cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic role in leukemia treatment (Manteniotis2016Deorphanization). This receptor's activation is linked to a signaling pathway involving adenylate cyclase and calcium channels, which may impact cell proliferation and survival in leukemia (Manteniotis2016Deorphanization).

In addition to its role in leukemia, a genome-wide association study identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the OR51B5 gene, rs10838094, which is less frequently found in patients with systemic and cutaneous mastocytosis compared to controls. This suggests a potential protective role or reduced risk associated with this SNP in mastocytosis (Nedoszytko2020Results). Furthermore, OR51B5 has been associated with fetal hemoglobin levels in sickle cell anemia, indicating a possible regulatory role in γ-globin gene expression (Solovieff2010Fetal).
