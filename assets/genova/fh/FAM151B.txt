# FAM151B

## Overview
FAM151B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the protein family with sequence similarity 151 member B. This protein is predicted to have phosphoric diester hydrolase activity, suggesting a role in hydrolyzing phosphodiester bonds, which are crucial in cellular processes such as signal transduction and lipid metabolism (Kulmanov2024Protein; Kulmanov2023DeepGOSE:). Additionally, the protein is involved in metal ion binding, a common feature of enzymes requiring metal ions as cofactors (Kulmanov2023DeepGOSE:). In mice, the homologous gene Fam151b is essential for retinal function, indicating a potential role in photoreceptor cell integrity and survival (Findlay2020Fam151b). While the specific molecular function of FAM151B in humans is not fully understood, its involvement in enzymatic activities and structural roles suggests it may contribute to cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways. The gene is part of the PLC-like phosphodiesterase superfamily, known for its role in hydrolyzing phosphodiester bonds (Findlay2020Fam151b).

## Function
The FAM151B gene encodes a protein that is predicted to have phosphoric diester hydrolase activity, based on structural similarity to proteins with known functions, such as the human protein Lysophospholipase D (GDPD3) (Kulmanov2024Protein; Kulmanov2023DeepGOSE:). This suggests that FAM151B may play a role in hydrolyzing phosphodiester bonds, a function that is crucial in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and lipid metabolism. The protein is also predicted to be involved in metal ion binding, which is a common feature of enzymes that require metal ions as cofactors for their catalytic activity (Kulmanov2023DeepGOSE:).

In mice, the Fam151b gene, a homolog of FAM151B, is essential for retinal function, indicating a potential role in maintaining photoreceptor cell integrity and survival (Findlay2020Fam151b). Although the specific molecular function of FAM151B in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, its involvement in critical enzymatic activities and structural roles suggests it may contribute to cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways. The gene is part of the PLC-like phosphodiesterase superfamily, which is known for its role in hydrolyzing phosphodiester bonds (Findlay2020Fam151b).

## Clinical Significance
The FAM151B gene has been implicated in several clinical contexts, although its precise role in human diseases remains under investigation. In mice, the loss of FAM151B function leads to retinal degeneration, characterized by early and rapid photoreceptor cell loss, suggesting its critical role in maintaining retinal health (Findlay2020Fam151b). However, no human patients with mutations in FAM151B have been described, and clear loss-of-function mutations in this gene are rare (Findlay2020Fam151b).

In the context of kidney function, a study identified a significant association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linked to FAM151B and proteinuria, suggesting a potential connection to kidney-related conditions (Wuttke2015Genetic). FAM151B also showed higher expression in podocytes, indicating a possible role in renal function (Wuttke2015Genetic).

In cancer research, FAM151B has been associated with methotrexate resistance in human cancer cell lines. Increased expression of FAM151B, along with other genes, was observed during the evolution of methotrexate resistance, indicating its potential involvement in drug resistance mechanisms (Meng2024Dynamic). These findings suggest that FAM151B may contribute to complex genomic changes associated with cancer drug resistance.
