# LY9

## Overview
The LY9 gene encodes the lymphocyte antigen 9 protein, a cell surface receptor that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and the Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule (SLAM) family. This receptor is primarily expressed on T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, where it plays a critical role in immune cell adhesion, activation, and signaling. The LY9 protein functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, facilitating interactions between immune cells and contributing to the modulation of immune responses. It interacts with the SLAM-associated protein (SAP), which is essential for its phosphorylation and subsequent signal transduction pathways. These pathways are crucial for regulating immune responses, including cytokine production and maintaining immune tolerance. Alterations in LY9 expression or function have been implicated in autoimmune diseases and B-cell malignancies, highlighting its clinical significance as both a biomarker and a potential therapeutic target (de2013Ly9; de2001Molecular; Roncador2022CD229).

## Structure
The human LY9 protein is a cell surface glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and is involved in cell signaling. It is encoded by a cDNA clone approximately 2100 base pairs long, which includes an open reading frame encoding a 608 amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 65 kDa after signal peptide cleavage (de2001Molecular). The extracellular region of LY9 consists of four immunoglobulin-like domains. The first and third domains are V-like domains that lack the usual disulfide bonds, while the second and fourth domains are IgSF-truncated C2 set domains with two putative disulfide bonds each (de2001Molecular; Sandrin1995Isolation). The extracellular domains also contain seven putative N-linked glycosylation sites, five of which are conserved between human and mouse LY9 (de2001Molecular).

The cytoplasmic domain of LY9 contains 179 amino acids and includes potential phosphorylation sites indicated by five tyrosine-containing motifs, which are suggestive of SH2-binding sites (de2001Molecular). These motifs are critical for binding to the SLAM-associated protein (SAP), which is implicated in X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (de2001Molecular). The cytoplasmic domain also includes 15 threonines, 16 serines, and 6 tyrosines, with five tyrosines conserved between human and mouse (de2001Molecular).

## Function
The LY9 gene encodes a cell surface receptor that is part of the Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule (SLAM) family, which plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses. In healthy human cells, LY9 is primarily expressed on T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, where it contributes to cell adhesion, activation, and signaling processes essential for immune function (de2001Molecular). The receptor functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, facilitating interactions between immune cells (de2013Ly9).

LY9 interacts with the SAP protein, which is crucial for the phosphorylation of the receptor. This interaction is important for signal transduction pathways that affect T lymphocyte and antigen-presenting cell adhesion (Simarro2004SAP; Sayós2001Cell). The phosphorylation of LY9 is regulated by SAP, which recruits the Src-like PTK FynT, enhancing the receptor's phosphorylation and subsequent signaling activities (Simarro2004SAP). These processes are vital for the regulation of immune responses, including the production of cytokines like IFN-γ and interleukin-4, which are important for immune response regulation (Simarro2004SAP).

LY9 also plays a role in maintaining immune tolerance, as demonstrated by studies on Ly9-deficient mice, which developed features of systemic autoimmunity (de2013Ly9). This suggests that LY9 functions as an inhibitory receptor, particularly affecting IFN-γ producing CD4+ T cells, and is crucial for preventing autoantibody responses (de2013Ly9).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the LY9 gene, also known as CD229, have significant clinical implications, particularly in autoimmune diseases and B-cell malignancies. In the context of autoimmune diseases, LY9 acts as an inhibitory receptor that helps maintain immune tolerance. Deficiency in LY9 leads to spontaneous autoimmunity, characterized by the production of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens, a hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). LY9-deficient mice exhibit increased levels of anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA, and anti-chromatin antibodies, along with alterations in B and T cell subsets, such as T follicular helper cells and germinal center B cells, which contribute to the development of autoimmunity (de2013Ly9).

In B-cell malignancies, LY9 is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. It is highly expressed in multiple myeloma and other B-cell lymphomas, such as marginal-zone lymphomas. The expression of LY9 increases with B cell maturation and is particularly elevated in malignant plasma cells. This makes LY9 a promising target for CAR T-cell therapy in multiple myeloma, although challenges such as 'on-target off-tissue' toxicity and interference by soluble CD229 remain (Roncador2022CD229).

## Interactions
LY9, also known as CD229, is a cell surface receptor that participates in various protein interactions, primarily within the immune system. It is a member of the Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule Family (SLAMF) and interacts with the SLAM-associated protein (SAP). SAP specifically binds to the cytoplasmic tail of LY9 at two phosphotyrosine motifs, tyrosines 558 and 581. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, as demonstrated by experiments showing that SAP only binds to LY9 when these motifs are phosphorylated (Simarro2004SAP; Sayós2001Cell).

LY9 also interacts with the protein tyrosine kinase FynT. SAP acts as an adaptor, recruiting FynT to LY9, which is crucial for the phosphorylation of LY9. This interaction enhances FynT kinase activity, highlighting the role of SAP in modulating LY9 signaling pathways (Simarro2004SAP).

In the absence of SAP, SHP-2, another protein, can bind to phosphorylated LY9, indicating a complex network of interactions involving LY9 and other signaling molecules (Sayós2001Cell). These interactions suggest that LY9 plays a significant role in immune cell signaling and regulation, influencing immune responses and maintaining immune tolerance (de2013Ly9).
