# CHMP3

## Overview
CHMP3 is a gene that encodes the charged multivesicular body protein 3, a crucial component of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT-III) complex. This protein plays a significant role in cellular membrane dynamics, particularly in the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the budding of vesicles from endosomal membranes. As a structural protein, CHMP3 is characterized by its ability to form helical polymers and interact with other ESCRT-III components, facilitating processes such as membrane remodeling and viral budding (Effantin2012ESCRTIII; Muzioł2006Structural). The protein's interactions with other cellular proteins, such as the AAA-type ATPase Vps4 and AMSH, underscore its importance in the disassembly and recycling of ESCRT complexes, as well as in recruiting MIT domain-containing proteins (Tsang2006A; Muzioł2006Structural). CHMP3's involvement in critical cellular functions and its implications in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders highlight its clinical significance (Wang2019miR‐122‐5p).

## Structure
CHMP3, a component of the ESCRT-III complex, exhibits a dynamic molecular structure characterized by multiple helical domains connected by flexible linkers. The primary structure of CHMP3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form its backbone. The secondary structure includes several alpha helices, notably helices a1 to a6, which play a crucial role in its conformational transitions (Różycki2011SAXS).

In terms of tertiary structure, CHMP3 can transition between closed, compact conformations and open, extended conformations depending on the salt concentration. At low-salt concentrations, CHMP3 predominantly adopts a closed conformation with helix a5 bound to the core formed by helices a1 to a4. In contrast, at high-salt concentrations, CHMP3 assumes an open conformation with helix a5 dissociated from the core (Różycki2011SAXS).

The quaternary structure of CHMP3 involves its interaction with other components of the ESCRT-III complex, although specific details on these interactions are not provided in the context. Helix a6 remains unbound to the core and may interact with other ESCRT components or the membrane, suggesting a role in the protein's functional assembly (Różycki2011SAXS). The study of CHMP3's structure is enhanced by SAXS ensemble refinement, which provides insights into its dynamic nature and interactions (Różycki2011SAXS).

## Function
CHMP3, a component of the ESCRT-III complex, plays a crucial role in the regulation of multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis, which is essential for the degradation of ubiquitinated protein cargo. It is involved in the final steps of vesicle budding from the endosomal membrane, a process vital for cellular membrane dynamics and the release of endosomal vesicles and enveloped viruses from cellular membranes (Muzioł2006Structural). CHMP3 interacts with other CHMP family members and the HRS-STAM complex, which is involved in the initial recognition of ubiquitinated cargo (Muzioł2006Structural).

The protein structure of CHMP3 includes a flat helical arrangement that forms a lattice, important for its function in membrane interaction and budding. This structure allows CHMP3 to dimerize, facilitating its interaction with membranes through a basic surface conserved across species (Muzioł2006Structural). CHMP3 is also implicated in the budding process of HIV-1, where it can exert a dominant-negative effect, blocking virus production (Muzioł2006Structural).

CHMP3's interaction with the AAA-type ATPase Vps4 is crucial for the disassembly and recycling of ESCRT complexes, highlighting its role in cellular membrane dynamics (Muzioł2006Structural). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and endosomal membranes, contributing to cellular homeostasis and membrane dynamics (Solomons2011Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CHMP3 gene have been implicated in the progression of various cancers, including breast cancer. In particular, CHMP3 is significantly downregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype characterized by high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. The suppression of CHMP3 by miR-122-5p promotes aggression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in TNBC cells through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. This downregulation is associated with increased cell viability, proliferation, and invasion, contributing to cancer progression. Conversely, upregulation of CHMP3 has been linked to reduced cancer cell aggression and better survival outcomes in breast cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for gene therapy in TNBC (Wang2019miR‐122‐5p).

Beyond cancer, CHMP3, as part of the ESCRT-III complex, plays a role in cellular processes such as membrane budding and fission. Alterations in CHMP3 expression or mutations can impact these processes, potentially contributing to neurodegenerative diseases and viral infections by affecting cellular homeostasis and immune responses. The involvement of CHMP3 in these critical cellular functions underscores its clinical significance in various pathological conditions (Wang2019miR‐122‐5p).

## Interactions
CHMP3, a component of the ESCRT-III complex, engages in several critical protein interactions essential for its function in cellular processes such as viral budding and membrane remodeling. CHMP3 forms stable helical polymers with CHMP2A, which are resistant to proteolysis, indicating a robust structural stability. This interaction is synergistic during HIV-1 budding, as co-depletion of CHMP2A and CHMP3 results in a significant reduction in HIV-1 infectivity (Effantin2012ESCRTIII). CHMP3 also binds to CHMP4B with a higher affinity than to CHMP2A, suggesting a preferential recruitment by CHMP4B, which may facilitate subsequent interactions with CHMP2A or CHMP2B (Effantin2012ESCRTIII).

In addition to its interactions within the ESCRT-III complex, CHMP3 interacts with AMSH, a protein containing a MIT domain. This interaction has been confirmed through colocalization experiments and protein complementation assays in live human cells, indicating its physiological relevance (Tsang2006A). CHMP3's interaction with AMSH is conserved across species, as demonstrated in Drosophila melanogaster (Tsang2006A). These interactions highlight CHMP3's role in recruiting MIT domain-containing proteins to the ESCRT-III complex in mammalian cells.
