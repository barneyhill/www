# EEF1G

## Overview
The EEF1G gene encodes the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 gamma (eEF1γ), a crucial component of the eukaryotic elongation factor-1 (eEF1) complex involved in protein synthesis. This protein functions primarily as a scaffold within the eEF1B complex, facilitating the proper assembly and stability of the complex during the elongation phase of translation. Beyond its canonical role in translation, eEF1γ is implicated in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, oxidative stress regulation, and retrograde transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum. It also plays a role in the loading of microRNAs into extracellular vesicles, highlighting its diverse functions in cellular homeostasis. The protein's interactions extend to viral processes, where it associates with viral proteins to enhance the stability of viral complexes. Clinically, alterations in EEF1G expression have been linked to various cancers, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Bondarchuk2022Quaternary; Negrutskii2020Nontranslational; BitergeSut2019Alterations).

## Structure
EEF1G, or eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 gamma, is a component of the eukaryotic elongation factor-1 complex, which plays a crucial role in protein synthesis. The protein is characterized by multiple domains, including an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain, which are likely involved in facilitating interactions with other proteins. These domains contribute to the protein's ability to participate in the elongation phase of translation by interacting with other components of the elongation factor complex.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are known to regulate the function of EEF1G, potentially affecting its interaction with other proteins and its role in translation. The presence of these modifications suggests a level of regulatory control over the protein's activity, which may be crucial for its function in the cellular environment.

EEF1G may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can result in variations in its structure and function. These isoforms may have distinct roles or regulatory mechanisms, contributing to the complexity of its function in protein synthesis. The structural diversity provided by these isoforms and post-translational modifications highlights the adaptability and regulatory potential of EEF1G in cellular processes.

## Function
The EEF1G gene encodes the gamma subunit of the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 (eEF1) complex, which plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by facilitating the delivery of aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosome during the elongation phase of translation (Sammaibashi2018StrainSpecific). The eEF1 complex is composed of two eEF1A molecules and the eEF1B complex, which includes eEF1B2, eEF1D, and eEF1G. EEF1G acts as a scaffold within the eEF1B complex, ensuring the proper assembly and stability of the complex by interacting with eEF1Bα and eEF1Bβ subunits (Bondarchuk2022Quaternary; MANSILLA2002Mapping).

In healthy human cells, EEF1G is involved in various cellular processes beyond its canonical role in translation. It is implicated in cytoskeletal organization and has been associated with the regulation of oxidative stress and actin cytoskeleton organization in fungi (Negrutskii2020Nontranslational). EEF1G is also involved in the retrograde transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum and is a candidate for loading microRNAs into extracellular vesicles, which are important for microRNA preservation and transfer (Negrutskii2020Nontranslational). These functions highlight the diverse roles of EEF1G in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating various molecular processes.

## Clinical Significance
The EEF1G gene, encoding the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 gamma, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In glioma tumors, EEF1G is significantly upregulated compared to normal tissue, and lower expression levels are associated with shorter survival periods in patients, suggesting its role in tumor progression and patient prognosis (BitergeSut2019Alterations). Similarly, in liver hepatocellular carcinoma, EEF1G mRNA is upregulated, with genetic alterations in EEF1 genes observed in a significant portion of patients (BitergeSut2019Alterations).

EEF1G is also involved in the DNA damage response, interacting with Che-1 and p53 transcripts, which are crucial for maintaining genome integrity and preventing tumorigenesis. Its depletion affects the accumulation of p53 protein during DNA damage, indicating its role in cellular stress responses and potential involvement in cancer progression (Pisani2016eEF1Bγ). The gene's pseudogenes, although not well-studied, are present in datasets related to various cancers, suggesting a potential but unclear role in these diseases (Cristiano2022The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of EEF1G in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
EEF1G, or eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 gamma, is a component of the eukaryotic elongation factor-1 (eEF1) complex, which plays a crucial role in protein synthesis. EEF1G interacts with other subunits of the eEF1 complex, such as eEF1A, eEF1Bα, and eEF1Bβ, forming a multiprotein complex essential for translation elongation. The N-terminal domain of EEF1G is involved in interactions with eEF1Bα and eEF1Bβ, facilitating the assembly of the eEF1H complex (MANSILLA2002Mapping).

EEF1G also participates in interactions beyond the eEF1 complex. It has been shown to associate with the HIV-1 reverse transcription complex (RTC), interacting with viral proteins such as reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN). This interaction enhances the stability of the RTC, which is critical for efficient HIV-1 reverse transcription (Warren2012Eukaryotic).

In the context of viral infections, EEF1G is part of the translation elongation factor-1 αβγ complex that associates with the RNA polymerase of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), contributing to the formation of an active holoenzyme necessary for viral RNA synthesis (Das1998RNA). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of EEF1G in cellular and viral processes.
