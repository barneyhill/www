# CPA2

## Overview
Carboxypeptidase A2 (CPA2) is a gene that encodes the enzyme carboxypeptidase A2, a member of the metallo-carboxypeptidase family. This enzyme is involved in the hydrolysis of the C-terminal peptide bond in protein and peptide substrates, specifically targeting aromatic and bulky aliphatic residues. CPA2 is characterized by its zinc-dependent catalytic mechanism, which is facilitated by a unique structural configuration that includes a globular α/β motif and an open-sandwich antiparallel-α/β fold (GarciaSaez1997The). The enzyme's active site is coordinated by a zinc ion, essential for its catalytic activity, and is known to interact with various inhibitors, such as the leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor, which can modulate its function (Holak2000StructureofanovelleechcarboxypeptidaseinhibitordeterminedfreeinsolutionandincomplexwithhumancarboxypeptidaseA2). CPA2's structural and functional properties make it a subject of interest for potential biotechnological and therapeutic applications.

## Structure
The human carboxypeptidase A2 (CPA2) enzyme is characterized by a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain with a pro-segment of 96 residues and a carboxypeptidase moiety of 305 residues (GarciaSaez1997The). The secondary structure includes eight α-helices and a mixed eight-stranded β-sheet, forming a globular α/β motif (Holak2000StructureofanovelleechcarboxypeptidaseinhibitordeterminedfreeinsolutionandincomplexwithhumancarboxypeptidaseA2). The tertiary structure is defined by a unique open-sandwich antiparallel-α/β fold in the globular domain, which shields the enzyme's active site (GarciaSaez1997The). 

The active site of CPA2 coordinates a zinc ion with His69, His196, and Glu72, essential for its catalytic function (GarciaSaez1997The). A notable feature is a disulfide bond between Cys210 and Cys244, which influences the position of a loop region and potentially affects enzyme specificity (GarciaSaez1997The). The specificity pocket is adapted for bulky aromatic residues, with substitutions contributing to this specificity (GarciaSaez1997The). 

CPA2 can form complexes with inhibitors, such as the leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor, which interacts with the enzyme's active site and alters its conformation (Holak2000StructureofanovelleechcarboxypeptidaseinhibitordeterminedfreeinsolutionandincomplexwithhumancarboxypeptidaseA2). This interaction highlights the enzyme's structural adaptability and potential for biotechnological applications.

## Function


## Interactions
The human carboxypeptidase A2 (CPA2) is known to interact with a novel leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor (LCI). The interaction between CPA2 and LCI is characterized by numerous contacts, including van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds, which contribute to the stability and inhibitory efficiency of the complex. Key residues involved in this interaction include Arg 71, Arg 124, Arg 127, Arg 145, and Glu 270, which are crucial for substrate binding and catalysis (Holak2000StructureofanovelleechcarboxypeptidaseinhibitordeterminedfreeinsolutionandincomplexwithhumancarboxypeptidaseA2). The LCI binds to CPA2 in a manner that prevents further cleavage of the inhibitor, even after the initial cleavage of Glu 66, highlighting its role in inhibiting CPA2 activity (Holak2000StructureofanovelleechcarboxypeptidaseinhibitordeterminedfreeinsolutionandincomplexwithhumancarboxypeptidaseA2).

The structural analysis of the LCI-CPA2 complex reveals that the C-terminal tail of LCI occludes the S1', S1, S2, and S3 subsites of CPA2, with specific residues such as Arg 145, Asn 144, and Tyr 248 playing key roles in anchoring the C-terminus of LCI. The carboxylate group of Val 65 becomes the new C-terminal end of LCI and is coordinated to zinc, further stabilizing the interaction (Holak2000StructureofanovelleechcarboxypeptidaseinhibitordeterminedfreeinsolutionandincomplexwithhumancarboxypeptidaseA2). These interactions suggest potential biotechnological applications in designing drugs that modulate metallo-carboxypeptidase activity (Holak2000StructureofanovelleechcarboxypeptidaseinhibitordeterminedfreeinsolutionandincomplexwithhumancarboxypeptidaseA2).
