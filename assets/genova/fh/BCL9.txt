# BCL9

## Overview
BCL9 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 9) is a gene that encodes the BCL9 transcription coactivator, a protein integral to the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This protein functions as a transcription coactivator, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression by facilitating the interaction between β-catenin and the Wnt enhanceosome, a multiprotein complex essential for transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes. BCL9 is characterized by its homology domains, which enable interactions with other proteins such as Pygopus and β-catenin, thereby influencing cellular processes like development, tissue homeostasis, and oncogenesis (Zhang2018StructureBased; van2017Constitutive). The protein's involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway underscores its significance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, including cancer and congenital heart defects (Cantù2018Mutations; Mani2009BCL9).

## Structure
BCL9 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 9) is a transcription coactivator involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. It contains several domains, including the homology domain 1 (HD1) and homology domain 2 (HD2). The HD1 domain is crucial for interaction with Pygopus (Pygo) proteins, while the HD2 domain adopts an α-helical structure to interact with the first armadillo repeat of β-catenin, facilitating the transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes (Zhang2018StructureBased). BCL9 also has an extensive C-terminus that contains the binding site for Groucho/TLE, which is required for Wnt responses (Wang2023Structural).

The BCL9 protein functions as a scaffolding structure within the Wnt enhanceosome, forming a stable core complex with Pygo, LDB1, and SSBP2. This complex is involved in the assembly of the Wnt enhanceosome, which is essential for Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Wang2023Structural). The interaction between BCL9 and β-catenin is a target for small-molecule inhibitors, which aim to disrupt this protein-protein interaction to treat cancers and fibroses associated with hyperactive Wnt signaling (Zhang2018StructureBased). The structural details of BCL9's primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not explicitly described in the available literature.

## Function
The BCL9 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for cell communication, development, and tissue homeostasis. In healthy human cells, BCL9 functions as an adaptor protein that captures β-catenin and facilitates its interaction with the Wnt enhanceosome, a multiprotein complex that regulates transcription (van2017Constitutive). This interaction is vital for the activation of Wnt target genes, enabling context-dependent transcriptional switches that control normal development (van2017Constitutive).

BCL9 is a constitutive component of the Wnt enhanceosome, meaning it is always present and ready to facilitate gene activation as soon as β-catenin reaches the DNA (van2017Constitutive). It interacts with various components of the Wnt enhanceosome, including TLE proteins, LDB1, PYGO2, TCF factors, and β-catenin, indicating its involvement in the transcriptional Wnt response (van2017Constitutive). BCL9 also contains a transcriptional activation domain in its C terminus, which synergizes with the C-terminal transactivation domain of β-catenin, particularly in lymphoid cells, suggesting a role in modulating transcriptional responses to Wnt signaling in a cell-type-specific manner (Sustmann2008CellTypeSpecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the BCL9 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and congenital heart defects. In cancer, BCL9 is identified as an oncogene that enhances β-catenin-mediated transcription, contributing to tumor progression in multiple myeloma, colon carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Xu2017Hypoxia; Mani2009BCL9). Overexpression of BCL9 is linked to increased tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis, while its knockdown reduces these properties and improves survival in xenograft models (Mani2009BCL9). BCL9 is also involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is crucial for metastasis (Mani2009BCL9). In colorectal cancer, BCL9 is associated with poor outcomes and affects stemness maintenance, often in synergy with APC mutations (Feng2021BCL9).

In congenital heart defects, mutations in BCL9 disrupt Wnt/β-catenin signaling, leading to heart malformations and embryonic lethality in animal models. These mutations affect cardiac neural crest cells and early mesodermal progenitors, underscoring the necessity of the BCL9-PYGO complex for proper heart development (Cantù2018Mutations). The disruption of BCL9 interactions in these contexts highlights its critical role in both oncogenesis and cardiac development.

## Interactions
BCL9 interacts with β-catenin through its homology domain 2 (HD2), specifically involving residues 352-374, which form a continuous α-helix. This helix interacts with the first armadillo repeat of β-catenin, forming a helix bundle and burying an area of approximately 1450 Å². Key interactions include hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with conserved residues of β-catenin, as well as hydrophobic contacts that stabilize the complex (Sampietro2006Crystal; Kawamoto2009Analysis).

BCL9 also plays a role in the Wnt enhanceosome, interacting with proteins such as ChiLS through its HD3 domain. This interaction is crucial for the association between BCL9 and the Wnt enhanceosome, facilitating transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes (van2017Constitutive).

In colorectal cancer cells, BCL9 interacts with paraspeckle proteins like NEAT1, NONO, and SFPQ. These interactions are RNA-dependent and contribute to mRNA processing and cell viability, indicating a role beyond the Wnt pathway (Jiang2020BCL9). BCL9's interactions with these proteins suggest its involvement in stabilizing mRNA and forming a co-regulation network in cancer cells (Jiang2020BCL9).
