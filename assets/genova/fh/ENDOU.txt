# ENDOU

## Overview
The ENDOU gene encodes a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease, a type of enzyme that plays a critical role in RNA processing and degradation. This protein, known as endonuclease, poly(U) specific, is characterized by its ability to cleave RNA molecules at uridylate-rich sequences, thereby influencing gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Structurally, the ENDOU protein is a monomer with a globular form, featuring a β-sheet-rich catalytic core and an α-helical N-terminal extension, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and regulation. The enzyme's activity is modulated by calcium ions, which induce conformational changes through allosteric regulation, a mechanism unique to eukaryotic members of the EndoU family (Malard2024Molecular). ENDOU is implicated in various cellular processes, including thymocyte development and apoptosis, and its expression is notably altered in several cancers, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor and diagnostic biomarker (Malard2024Molecular; Basic2021Integrative).

## Structure
The human ENDOU protein is characterized by a globular structure with a predominantly β-sheet catalytic core and an α-helical bundle N-terminal extension. The catalytic domain spans residues 135 to 410, and the protein's structure has been elucidated using techniques such as NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography (Malard2024Molecular). The catalytic core is rich in β-sheets, forming a basic groove that is crucial for RNA binding. This groove is defined by the cleft between two β-sheets, with nucleotide U2 anchoring near the catalytic triad, which includes conserved histidines essential for catalytic activity (Malard2024Molecular; Mushegian2020An).

Calcium ions play a significant role in the activation of ENDOU, inducing conformational changes that activate the enzyme through allosteric regulation. The binding of calcium involves residues from both the catalytic core and the N-terminal extension, suggesting an interaction that modulates activity in response to calcium (Malard2024Molecular). The protein's structure is stabilized by a network of interactions involving the eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension, which is crucial for calcium sensing and allosteric regulation (Malard2024Molecular). The ENDOU protein does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer.

## Function
The ENDOU gene encodes a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease involved in RNA processing and degradation, playing a crucial role in maintaining RNA stability and turnover in human cells. This enzyme is active in the cytoplasm, where it cleaves RNA molecules at uridylate-rich sequences, influencing gene expression and cellular homeostasis (Basic2021Integrative).

In healthy human cells, ENDOU is implicated in various cellular processes, including the removal of ribonucleoprotein particles and the organization of the endoplasmic reticulum network. Its activity is regulated by calcium ions, which bind to specific residues in the catalytic core and an N-terminal extension, triggering structural changes that activate the enzyme through an allosteric mechanism (Malard2024Molecular). This calcium-dependent activation is unique to eukaryotic members of the EndoU family and represents an evolutionary adaptation linking endoribonuclease activity to cellular signaling (Malard2024Molecular).

The protein's function is particularly significant during thymocyte development, where it is expressed prominently in developing thymocytes during specific stages, such as the double negative (DN) 2-3 transition and double positive (DP) stages (Malard2024Molecular). This suggests a role in RNA cleavage during processes like thymocyte maturation or apoptosis, potentially acting as a pro-apoptotic factor in B cells (Malard2024Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ENDOU gene have been implicated in various cancers. ENDOU is considered a potential tumor suppressor, with its expression being deregulated in several tumor types, including breast, ovarian, and head and neck carcinomas (Basic2021Integrative). In cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), ENDOU expression is significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting a role in tumor suppression. The study found that low ENDOU expression in cervical tumors is associated with poorer differentiation and disruptions in pathways related to transcriptional regulation and growth factor signaling (Basic2021Integrative).

In cervical SCC, ENDOU expression was detected in only 1% of tumor cases compared to 40% of normal cervical tissues, indicating its potential role in epithelial differentiation processes (Basic2021Integrative). The gene's expression was also weakly correlated with tumor infiltration, particularly with CD8+ T cells, suggesting a possible role in immune response modulation (Basic2021Integrative).

The downregulation of ENDOU has been consistently observed across integrated studies, with high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing malignant from normal cervical tissues, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker for cervical SCC (Basic2021Integrative).
