# MINK1

## Overview
MINK1 is a gene that encodes the protein misshapen-like kinase 1, a member of the mammalian germinal center kinase (GCK) family. This protein is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, cytoskeletal regulation, and immune responses. MINK1 is a component of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex, which is essential for cell division and motility. It also plays a role in modulating inflammatory responses by influencing Th17 cell differentiation and activating the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. Alterations in MINK1 expression have been linked to cancer chemoresistance and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhu2021Priming; Fu2017Suppression; Hyodo2012Misshapenlike).

## Structure
The MINK1 protein is a member of the mammalian germinal center kinase (GCK) family and is characterized by a distinct domain structure. It consists of a conserved N-terminal kinase domain, a coiled-coil region, a proline-rich region, and a C-terminal GCK domain (Qu2004Computational). The kinase domain is crucial for its function, particularly in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome, and is composed of a mix of α-helices and β-sheets (Zhu2021Priming; Qu2004Computational). The coiled-coil region, located between amino acids 394-495, is hydrophilic and rich in charged residues, such as Arg and Glu, and does not contain a leucine zipper (Qu2004Computational). The proline-rich region is less conserved and may adopt a loop conformation or be unstructured, contributing to MINK1's functional specificity (Qu2004Computational).

MINK1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which regulates its activity. For instance, it phosphorylates the glucocorticoid receptor at threonine 524, facilitating interactions with 14-3-3 protein regulators (Munier2021Glucocorticoid). MINK1 also has splice variant isoforms, such as MINK-2 and MINK-3, which differ in the proline-rich domain (Qu2004Computational).

## Function
Misshapen-like kinase 1 (MINK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in cytokinesis, the final step of cell division. MINK1 is a component of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex, which is essential for the completion of cytokinesis. It interacts with STRN4 and the phosphatase PP2A, and this interaction is necessary for proper cell division. The depletion of MINK1 leads to defects in cytokinesis, resulting in multinucleated cells, indicating a failure in the abscission phase where the intercellular bridge between daughter cells is severed (Hyodo2012Misshapenlike).

MINK1 is also involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton, cell motility, and cellular senescence. It is phosphorylated during mitosis by kinases such as CDK1 and PLK1, and this phosphorylation is necessary for its function in cytokinesis (Hyodo2012Misshapenlike). Additionally, MINK1 plays a role in immune responses by modulating Th17 cell differentiation. It acts as a negative regulator of Th17 cell-mediated inflammatory responses, potentially through its interaction with reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Fu2017Suppression). These functions highlight MINK1's importance in maintaining normal cellular and immune processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MINK1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and autoimmune conditions. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), MINK1 is associated with resistance to the chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil (5FU). Studies have shown that MINK1 expression is significantly higher in 5FU-resistant OSCC cell lines and tumor tissues of chemotherapy non-responders. Knocking out MINK1 in these resistant cells increases their sensitivity to 5FU, suggesting that MINK1 is a potential target for overcoming chemoresistance in OSCC (Mohanty2022CRISPR-based; Mohanty2021CRISPR-based).

MINK1 also plays a role in autoimmune diseases by regulating Th17 cell differentiation. It acts as a suppressor of Th17 cell differentiation, and its deficiency leads to increased Th17 cell activity, exacerbating conditions like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for multiple sclerosis. This suggests that MINK1 has a protective role against autoimmune diseases by modulating immune cell differentiation (Fu2017Suppression).

Additionally, MINK1 is involved in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, which is crucial for inflammatory responses. MINK1 deficiency impairs NLRP3 inflammasome activation, highlighting its role in inflammatory conditions (Zhu2021Priming).

## Interactions
MINK1, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with proteins such as PRICKLE1 and LL5β, forming a complex that includes CLASP2. This complex is crucial for cell migration, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, where MINK1 phosphorylates PRICKLE1 and LL5β, enhancing their interactions and promoting cell motility (Daulat2022The). MINK1 also phosphorylates the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) at threonine 524, facilitating its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, which are important for cellular signaling pathways (Munier2021Glucocorticoid).

In macrophages, MINK1 plays a role in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by phosphorylating NLRP3 at Ser725. This phosphorylation is essential for inflammasome assembly and is influenced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which act as a priming factor (Zhu2021Priming). MINK1's interactions and phosphorylation activities highlight its role in regulating various cellular functions, including cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, and inflammatory responses.
