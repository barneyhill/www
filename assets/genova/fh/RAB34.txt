# RAB34

## Overview
RAB34 is a gene that encodes a member of the RAS oncogene family, specifically a GTPase protein known as Rab34. This protein is primarily involved in intracellular processes such as ciliogenesis, where it plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of ciliary structures. Rab34 is categorized as a GTPase, a type of enzyme that hydrolyzes GTP, and is essential for the transport and fusion of pre-ciliary vesicles at the mother centriole, a key step in ciliary membrane formation (Ganga2021Rab34). The protein's function is cell-type specific, with its activity being crucial in some cell types but not others (Oguchi2020A). Rab34 is also implicated in lipid metabolism and protein interactions, influencing processes such as lipid droplet regulation and ubiquitination (LópezAlcalá2024Localization). Clinically, alterations in RAB34 expression have been linked to diseases such as colorectal cancer and obesity, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Jiang2022The; LópezAlcalá2024Localization).

## Function
The RAB34 gene encodes a GTPase that plays a critical role in intracellular ciliogenesis, particularly in the formation of ciliary vesicles. In healthy human cells, Rab34 is involved in the transport and fusion of pre-ciliary vesicles at the mother centriole, a crucial step for ciliary membrane formation. It dynamically localizes to the mother centriole and cilium during ciliogenesis, arriving before other proteins such as ARL13B, indicating its early involvement in the process (Ganga2021Rab34). Rab34 is essential for the proper recruitment of proteins like EHD1, Rab8, and ARL13B, which are necessary for ciliary membrane growth (Ganga2021Rab34).

Rab34's function is cell-type specific, as its knockout in certain cell types, such as hTERT-RPE1, NIH/3T3, and MCF10A cells, inhibits ciliogenesis, while in others like MDCK-II cells, it is not essential (Oguchi2020A). Rab34 is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus and is hypothesized to regulate the budding/secretion step from the Golgi, the transport of preciliary vesicles, and/or the fusion of these vesicles to form ciliary vesicles (Oguchi2020A). Rab34 is also involved in maintaining cilia, as its disruption leads to progressive cilia loss, a defect that can be rescued by cytochalasin D treatment (Ganga2021Rab34).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RAB34 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC) and obesity. In CRC, RAB34 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis. This overexpression promotes cell migration and invasion, and is linked to increased levels of immune checkpoint proteins PD-L1 and PD-L2, suggesting a role in modulating the tumor microenvironment and immune response. RAB34 is considered an unfavorable prognostic factor in CRC, and targeting it could potentially improve responses to anti-PD-1 therapy (Jiang2022The).

In the context of obesity, RAB34 expression is elevated in adipose tissues of obese individuals and murine models. It is associated with lipid droplet regulation and adipocyte function, influencing lipid accumulation and lipolysis. Dysregulation of RAB34 in adipocytes may contribute to altered adipokine secretion and lipid metabolism, potentially impacting obesity-related conditions (LópezAlcalá2024Localization).

RAB34 is also essential for ciliogenesis, particularly in the early stages of intracellular ciliogenesis. Disruptions in its function could affect ciliogenesis, potentially leading to ciliopathy-related conditions (Stuck2021Rab34).

## Interactions
Rab34, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in intracellular processes. Rab34 interacts with Rep15, acting as an effector for this protein. The interaction between Rab34 and Rep15 is characterized by a high affinity, with a dissociation constant (K_D) of approximately 0.1 µM, and is entropy-driven (Rai2022Rep15). 

Rab34 also interacts with the Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP), which functions as an effector for Rab34. RILP is involved in the recruitment of dynein-dynactin motor complexes to late endosomes and lysosomes, playing a role in lysosomal distribution and morphology (Colucci2005The). 

In adipocytes, Rab34 interacts with fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) at the lipid droplet surface, influencing lipid metabolism. This interaction occurs when Rab34 is in its active GTP-bound form, suggesting a role in regulating lipid content and hydrolysis (LópezAlcalá2024Localization). Rab34 also interacts with UBA1, an E1-ubiquitin ligase, which is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of FABP5, highlighting Rab34's role in protein stability and lipid metabolism (LópezAlcalá2024Localization).
