# ZPR1

## Overview
The ZPR1 gene encodes the ZPR1 zinc finger protein, which is a critical component in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and transcription regulation. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) and the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. These interactions are essential for normal cell growth, proliferation, and the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) (Mishra2007Structural; Gangwani1998Interaction). ZPR1 is involved in the regulation of subnuclear bodies and is crucial for histone gene expression and DNA synthesis during the S phase of the cell cycle (Gangwani2006Deficiency). The protein's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal viability, with mutations in the ZPR1 gene being implicated in diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy and certain cancers (Genabai2017Deregulation; Abok2024Bioinformatic).

## Structure
The ZPR1 protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its structural and functional roles. It contains two zinc finger modules, ZnF1 and ZnF2, each with a primary structure defined by the sequence Cys-X2-Cys-X25-Cys-X2-Cys, which is essential for zinc binding and protein stability (Galcheva-Gargova1998The; Gangwani1998Interaction). The ZnF1-A domain is necessary for binding to eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), while the ZnF2-B domain is essential for receptor binding and viability in yeast (Mishra2007Structural; Gangwani1998Interaction).

The tertiary structure of ZPR1 includes a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet stabilized by zinc-binding sites, with variations in the NH2-terminal strand and Zn2+ binding site between the ZnF1 and ZnF2 domains (Mishra2007Structural). The ZnF1 and ZnF2 domains function as independent binding modules, with the ZnF1-A domain being crucial for eEF1A interaction and the ZnF2-B domain for receptor and SMN complex interactions (Mishra2007Structural).

ZPR1's interaction with eEF1A is critical for normal cell growth and cell cycle progression, as it regulates the GTPase cycle of eEF1A by displacing eEF1Bα (Mishra2007Structural). The protein's structure and interactions are conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Gangwani1998Interaction).

## Function
The ZPR1 gene encodes a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in cell cycle progression and transcription regulation in healthy human cells. ZPR1 is involved in the localization and function of subnuclear bodies, co-localizing with the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein and the transcription factor NPAT during the S phase of the cell cycle. This co-localization is essential for histone gene expression and DNA synthesis, as ZPR1 is associated with histone gene clusters on chromosomes 1 and 6 (Gangwani2006Deficiency).

ZPR1 is primarily located in the cytoplasm during the G1 and G2/M phases but translocates to the nucleus during the S phase, where it accumulates in subnuclear bodies such as Cajal bodies and gems. This translocation is regulated by growth signals and is necessary for the proper localization of SMN and NPAT, which are critical for cell proliferation and survival (Gangwani2006Deficiency).

ZPR1 interacts with eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), influencing the GTPase cycle and potentially acting as a negative regulator of eEF1A activation. This interaction is vital for normal cell growth and proliferation (Mishra2007Structural). ZPR1's role in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal viability.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ZPR1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, most notably spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). In SMA, a deficiency in the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein leads to deregulation of ZPR1, contributing to respiratory failure and motor neuron degeneration (Genabai2017Deregulation; Jiang2019ZPR1-Dependent). ZPR1 mutations result in defects in the respiratory system, such as underdeveloped lungs and impaired diaphragm innervation, leading to respiratory failure and perinatal lethality in mouse models (Genabai2017Deregulation).

ZPR1 deficiency is also associated with neurodegeneration through the activation of the JNK signaling pathway, which leads to apoptotic degeneration of neurons (Jiang2019ZPR1-Dependent). This deficiency causes axonal degeneration and myelin defects, contributing to conditions like SMA and other neurodegenerative disorders (Doran2006Deficiency).

In addition to SMA, ZPR1 mutations have been linked to a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by growth limitations, hair loss, kidney dysfunction, developmental delays, and increased early mortality (Abok2024Bioinformatic). The gene is also associated with non-small cell lung cancer, where reduced expression of ZPR1 is linked to disease progression (Abok2024Bioinformatic).

## Interactions
ZPR1, a zinc finger protein, is known for its interactions with several key proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. One of its primary interactions is with the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A). ZPR1 binds to eEF1A in proliferating cells, a process that is enhanced by growth signals such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Gangwani1998Interaction). The NH2-terminal region of ZPR1 is crucial for this binding, and the interaction is direct, as demonstrated by in vitro assays (Gangwani1998Interaction). This interaction is essential for normal cell growth and proliferation (YANAKA2009Generation).

ZPR1 also interacts with the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein complexes, which are vital for the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). This interaction is disrupted in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients, highlighting its importance in neurodegeneration (Mishra2007Structural).

Additionally, ZPR1 binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), where it interacts with the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. This binding is regulated by EGF treatment, which causes ZPR1 to accumulate in the nucleus (Galcheva-Gargova1996Binding). These interactions underscore ZPR1's role in signal transduction and cellular regulation.
