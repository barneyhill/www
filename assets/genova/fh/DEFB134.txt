# DEFB134

## Overview
DEFB134 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 134, a member of the defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are crucial components of the innate immune system, known for their ability to disrupt microbial membranes and provide a defense mechanism against pathogens. Defensin beta 134 is characterized by a conserved beta-sheet structure stabilized by disulfide bonds, typical of defensins, which contributes to its stability and function. This protein is predominantly expressed in the human male reproductive tract, particularly in the testis and epididymis, indicating a potential role in reproductive health and fertility (Robertson2020Largescale). Additionally, DEFB134 is involved in mucosal immunity and epithelial protection, and its deletion in certain cancers suggests a role in immune surveillance and tumor suppression (Ye2017Prevailing). The gene's expression is also up-regulated in response to lipopolysaccharide exposure in adult renal progenitor cells, highlighting its involvement in systemic immune responses (Sallustio2019Renal).

## Structure
The DEFB134 gene encodes the beta-defensin 134 protein, which is part of the defensin family known for their role in the immune response. These proteins are characterized by a conserved beta-sheet structure that is stabilized by disulfide bonds, a common feature among defensins. The primary structure of beta-defensin 134 includes a sequence rich in cysteine residues, which are crucial for forming the disulfide bonds that stabilize its structure. 

The secondary structure of beta-defensin 134 is predominantly composed of beta-sheets, a hallmark of the defensin family, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure is maintained by the disulfide bonds, which help preserve the protein's functional conformation. Information on the quaternary structure of DEFB134 is limited, and specific details about any potential oligomerization are not provided in the available data.

Post-translational modifications of beta-defensin 134 may include glycosylation and proteolytic processing, which can influence its activity and stability. However, specific domains or splice variant isoforms for DEFB134 are not well-documented, indicating a need for further research to fully elucidate these aspects.

## Function
DEFB134, or defensin beta 134, is a member of the defensin family, which are antimicrobial peptides integral to the innate immune response. These peptides are known for their ability to disrupt microbial membranes, thereby providing a defense mechanism against pathogens. DEFB134 is specifically expressed in the human male reproductive tract, particularly in the testis and epididymis, suggesting a role in reproductive health and potentially in fertility (Robertson2020Largescale). The gene is also involved in the innate immune response, contributing to mucosal immunity and the protection of epithelial surfaces (Ye2017Prevailing).

In the context of cancer, DEFB134, along with other defensin genes, is part of a cluster that is often deleted in various cancer types. This deletion is associated with reduced immune surveillance and tumor suppression, indicating that DEFB134 may play a role in recognizing tumor cells and inducing anti-tumor immune responses (Ye2017Prevailing). Additionally, DEFB134 has been implicated in the response of adult renal progenitor cells to lipopolysaccharide exposure, where it is up-regulated, suggesting a role in the defense response during systemic septic conditions (Sallustio2019Renal).
