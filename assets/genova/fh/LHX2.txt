# LHX2

## Overview
LHX2 is a gene that encodes the LIM homeobox 2 protein, a transcription factor characterized by its LIM domains and homeodomain, which are essential for its role in gene regulation. The LIM homeobox 2 protein is involved in various developmental processes, particularly in neural differentiation and development. It functions by interacting with other proteins and DNA to modulate transcriptional networks and signaling pathways, such as WNT, TGFb, and BMP, which are crucial for early neural development (Hou2013LHX2). The protein's ability to bind to enhancers and regulate gene expression is vital for the transition of human embryonic stem cells to neural progenitors, influencing neural fate acquisition and suppressing non-neural lineages (Hou2013LHX2). LHX2's interactions with other proteins, such as Ldb1 and the NuRD complex, further underscore its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, impacting processes like olfactory receptor gene expression and hippocampal development (Monahan2019LHX2-; Muralidharan2016LHX2). Additionally, LHX2 has clinical significance, with its expression and mutations linked to conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and testicular vascularization disorders (CohenGulkar2023The; Singh2023LHX2).

## Structure
LHX2 is a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor characterized by its two LIM domains and a homeodomain. The LIM domains are zinc finger structures that facilitate protein-protein interactions, crucial for the transcriptional activation of target genes (Glenn1999MRG1). These domains contain conserved cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate zinc binding, forming finger-like structures (Showalter2004Cloning). The homeodomain is centrally located and allows interaction with DNA recognition elements in target genes (Showalter2004Cloning).

The LHX2 protein is predicted to be 398 amino acids long, with a serine/threonine-rich carboxyl terminus (Showalter2004Cloning). The LIM domains of LHX2 can function as transcriptional activation domains, interacting with other factors to enhance gene expression, particularly in response to signaling pathways like Ras/MAPK (Glenn1999MRG1). The interaction between LHX2 and cofactors such as Ldb1 is evolutionarily conserved and plays a critical role in developmental processes, such as hippocampal development (Kinare2020An). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions.

## Function
The LHX2 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the neural differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). It is involved in the regulation of gene expression during early neural development by modulating transcriptional networks and influencing extracellular signaling pathways, including WNT, TGFb, and BMP (Hou2013LHX2). LHX2 promotes neural differentiation by enhancing the expression of PAX6, a key transcription factor for early neural differentiation, and by suppressing non-neural differentiation pathways through the upregulation of CER1, which acts as an antagonist to BMP and WNT signaling (Hou2013LHX2).

LHX2 is expressed early in differentiating hESCs and is maintained in neural progenitors, facilitating the transition from pluripotency to the neural lineage (Hou2013LHX2). It binds to enhancers of PAX6 and CER1, marked by active chromatin signatures, to regulate neural fate acquisition and suppress non-neural lineages (Hou2013LHX2). The gene's expression overlaps with other neural transcription factors, suggesting a broader role in neural differentiation and regionalization in the forebrain (Hou2013LHX2). LHX2's function in healthy human cells involves ensuring proper neural development by balancing neural and non-neural lineage differentiation (Hou2013LHX2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LHX2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of retinal health, LHX2 plays a critical role in the differentiation and maintenance of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). Alterations in LHX2 expression or binding can influence the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3809579, affects AMD risk by altering TRPM1 expression through modulation of LHX2 binding. The T allele of this SNP disrupts LHX2 binding, leading to increased AMD risk (CohenGulkar2023The).

LHX2 is also involved in brain development, and its knockout in mice results in an absent neocortex, highlighting its significance in cortical patterning. However, no pathogenic mutations in LHX2 were found in a large cohort of patients with schizencephaly, a malformation of cortical development, suggesting that other factors might be responsible for this condition (Mellado2010Candidate).

In the developing mouse testis, LHX2 is crucial for proper testicular organization and vascularization. Its absence leads to disrupted vascularization and altered expression of pro-angiogenic factors, affecting endothelial cell migration and resulting in disorganized vascular structures (Singh2023LHX2).

## Interactions
LHX2, a LIM homeobox transcription factor, participates in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene expression and developmental processes. LHX2 interacts with the NuRD complex, which includes subunits such as LSD1, HDAC2, and RBBP4. These interactions are essential for modulating the chromatin landscape at the loci of Fezf2 and Sox11, key determinants of neuron subtype identity. The presence of LHX2 is crucial for erasing active epigenetic marks at these sites, suggesting a chromatin looping model where LHX2 brings distant regulatory elements and transcription start sites together (Muralidharan2016LHX2).

LHX2 also interacts with Ldb1, an adaptor protein, forming a complex that is vital for the regulation of olfactory receptor gene expression in olfactory sensory neurons. This interaction facilitates interchromosomal contacts necessary for the singular expression of olfactory receptor genes (Monahan2019LHX2-). In the context of hippocampal development, the LHX2-Ldb1 interaction is crucial for specifying hippocampal cell fate and regional identity, with the complex responding to morphogen gradients from the hippocampal organizer (Kinare2020An).

Additionally, LHX2 interacts with MRG1, a nuclear protein that acts as a co-activator to stimulate the transcription of the glycoprotein hormone α-subunit gene. This interaction is mediated through the LIM domain of LHX2, which cooperates with other transcription factors like Elk1 (Glenn1999MRG1).
