# PHKA2

## Overview
The PHKA2 gene encodes the phosphorylase kinase regulatory subunit alpha 2, a critical component of the phosphorylase kinase (PhK) enzyme complex, which plays a pivotal role in glycogen metabolism. This gene is located on the X chromosome and is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it contributes to the regulation of glycogen breakdown into glucose, a process essential for maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting. The protein product of PHKA2, the alpha subunit, serves a regulatory function within the PhK complex, which is composed of four subunits: alpha (α), beta (β), gamma (γ), and delta (δ). The alpha subunit interacts with other subunits to modulate the activity of the catalytic gamma subunit, primarily through phosphorylation and calcium ion-mediated mechanisms. Mutations in PHKA2 are linked to X-linked liver glycogenosis and Glycogen Storage Disease Type IXa, highlighting its clinical significance in metabolic disorders (Kishnani2019Diagnosis; Hendrickx1999Complete; Choi2016PHKA2).

## Structure
The PHKA2 gene encodes the alpha subunit of phosphorylase kinase, which plays a crucial role in glycogen metabolism. The protein consists of 1,235 amino acids and is organized into distinct structural domains. The N-terminal region of the PHKA2 protein contains a glucoamylase-like domain, which is modeled on a bacterial glucoamylase structure and adopts a characteristic (α/α)6 barrel fold. This domain is involved in substrate binding and may have catalytic activity, although this has not been experimentally confirmed (Carrière20083D; Nguyen2020A).

The C-terminal region of the protein includes a calcineurin B-like (CBL) domain, which is important for interactions with the regulatory domain of the γ-subunit of phosphorylase kinase. This domain is crucial for the protein's regulatory function and stability (Carrière20083D; Nguyen2020A).

Mutations in the PHKA2 gene often affect these domains, leading to structural and functional disruptions. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are essential for its regulatory role. The PHKA2 protein is part of a larger complex composed of four different subunits (α, β, γ, δ), with the α subunit being regulatory (Carrière20083D; Hendrickx1999Complete).

## Function
The PHKA2 gene encodes the alpha subunit of phosphorylase kinase (PhK), an enzyme complex crucial for glycogen metabolism in the liver. PhK is a heterotetramer composed of four subunits: alpha (α), beta (β), gamma (γ), and delta (δ). The alpha subunit, encoded by PHKA2, plays a regulatory role in the enzyme's activity, which is essential for the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, a process vital for maintaining blood glucose levels, especially during fasting (Kishnani2019Diagnosis; Choi2016PHKA2).

In healthy human cells, the PHKA2 gene product regulates the activity of the catalytic gamma subunit of PhK. This regulation is achieved through phosphorylation, which modulates the enzyme's ability to activate glycogen phosphorylase, thereby facilitating the conversion of glycogen to glucose (Carrière20083D; Nguyen2020A). The activity of PhK is also influenced by calcium ions, mediated by the delta subunit, which is calmodulin (Hendrickx1999Complete).

The PHKA2 gene is located on the X chromosome and is primarily active in the liver, where it plays a critical role in energy homeostasis by enabling the liver to mobilize glucose from glycogen stores (Kishnani2019Diagnosis; Zhu2023A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PHKA2 gene are primarily associated with X-linked liver glycogenosis (XLG), which is divided into two subtypes: XLG I and XLG II. Both subtypes result from mutations in PHKA2, which encodes the regulatory alpha subunit of phosphorylase kinase (PHK). XLG I is characterized by a deficiency in PHK activity in peripheral blood cells and liver, while XLG II shows normal in vitro PHK activity in peripheral blood cells and variable activity in the liver. XLG I mutations often lead to truncation or disruption of the PHKA2 protein, resulting in an unstable PHK holoenzyme and deficient enzyme activity. In contrast, XLG II mutations are typically missense mutations or small in-frame deletions and insertions, which may lead to in vivo deregulation of PHK (Hendrickx1999Complete).

PHKA2 mutations are also linked to Glycogen Storage Disease Type IXa (GSD IXa), which can manifest as ketotic hypoglycemia (KH) and glycogen storage disease with liver involvement. The clinical symptoms of these conditions include hepatomegaly, growth retardation, and hypoglycemia. Some PHKA2 variants are associated with a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from KH-only to classical GSD IXa with liver involvement (Benner2021PHKA2; Choi2016PHKA2).

## Interactions
The PHKA2 gene encodes the alpha subunit of phosphorylase kinase, which is a component of a multiprotein complex involved in glycogen metabolism. This complex includes the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subunits, with the gamma subunit providing catalytic activity and the delta subunit interacting with calcium ions through calmodulin (Hendrickx1999Complete). The alpha subunit, encoded by PHKA2, is involved in regulatory functions and interacts with other subunits to form the active enzyme complex (Carrière2008Calcineurin).

PHKA2 has been identified as a potential interactor with the giant ubiquitin ligase HERC2, suggesting a role in intracellular protein trafficking and energy metabolism (Galligan2014Proteomic). This interaction indicates that PHKA2 may participate in broader cellular processes beyond its primary role in glycogen metabolism.

Mutations in PHKA2 can affect its interactions and regulatory functions. For instance, a novel frameshift mutation in PHKA2 was found to result in a truncated protein lacking part of the CBL-like domain, which is involved in interactions with regulatory domains of kinases (Nguyen2020A). This highlights the importance of the structural integrity of PHKA2 for its interaction capabilities and regulatory roles.
