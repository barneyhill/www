# MAP3K4

## Overview
MAP3K4 is a gene that encodes the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4, a serine/threonine kinase involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. This kinase plays a pivotal role in cellular processes by activating downstream kinases such as JNK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase, which are integral to the regulation of transcription and cellular responses to stress and inflammation (van2012Defective; Huang2024MAP3K4). The MAP3K4 protein is characterized by its complex structure, including an N-terminal inhibitory domain and a C-terminal kinase domain, which facilitate interactions with various proteins to modulate its activity (Huang2024MAP3K4). It is implicated in critical biological processes such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and apoptosis, and its dysregulation is associated with conditions like XY gonadal sex reversal and certain cancers (Bogani2009Loss; Huang2024MAP3K4).

## Structure
The MAP3K4 protein is a 1608-amino acid long serine/threonine kinase with a molecular mass of 181,685 Da. It features several significant domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal domain lacks kinase activity and acts as an inhibitory region, which can be relieved by binding with molecules like GADD45, initiating MAP3K4's activity (Huang2024MAP3K4). The C-terminal domain is the kinase domain, which is crucial for its interactions with other proteins such as CIN85 and AXIN, facilitating various cellular processes (Huang2024MAP3K4). 

MAP3K4 also contains a CRIB-like domain just upstream of the catalytic domain, allowing interaction with CDC42 and RAC proteins, which are essential for its role in the JNK pathway (Huang2024MAP3K4). The protein is involved in the phosphorylation of conserved serine and threonine residues on the activation loop of MKK3/6 and MKK4/7, which subsequently activate the p38 and JNK pathways (Huang2024MAP3K4). These pathways are involved in regulating transcription and other cellular responses. The protein's structure and interactions are depicted in a schematic diagram, highlighting its functional domains and binding partners (Huang2024MAP3K4).

## Function
MAP3K4, also known as MEKK4, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in the MAPK signaling pathway, particularly in the activation of MAP kinases such as JNK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase. In healthy human cells, MAP3K4 is involved in the phosphorylation of MAP2K4/MAP2K7 and MAP2K3/MAP2K6, which are crucial steps in the MyD88-dependent pathway. This pathway is essential for the induction of pro-inflammatory genes following TLR4 stimulation by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (van2012Defective).

MAP3K4 is also implicated in the TGFβ-induced activation of p38 MAPK, where it works in conjunction with MAP3K10 to mediate this process. This activation is important for cellular processes such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and apoptosis (Sapkota2013The). In the context of EMT, MAP3K4 regulates the chromatin modifier HDAC6, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation to maintain the epithelial state. This regulation is crucial for processes like embryogenesis and tissue regeneration (Mobley2017MAP3K4).

MAP3K4's kinase activity is essential for its function, as it influences protein stability and activity, impacting cellular phenotype and function (Mobley2017MAP3K4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAP3K4 gene are associated with several disorders and conditions. In the context of sex determination, mutations in MAP3K4 can lead to XY gonadal sex reversal, where individuals with XY chromosomes develop ovaries instead of testes. This is due to a mutation causing a premature stop codon in the MAP3K4 gene, affecting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, which is crucial for the normal expression of the SRY gene and downstream testis-determining genes (Bogani2009Loss). Haploinsufficiency of MAP3K4 is linked to T-associated sex reversal (Tas) and can contribute to XY gonadal dysgenesis, a condition where individuals with XY chromosomes develop female characteristics (Bogani2009Loss).

In cancer, MAP3K4 is involved in various processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumorigenesis. Low expression of MAP3K4 is linked to poor prognosis indicators in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and is associated with shorter distant metastasis-free survival in radiotherapy-treated patients (Huang2024MAP3K4). MAP3K4 mutations are also found in several cancer types, including breast neuroendocrine neoplasms and serous endometrial tumors (Huang2024MAP3K4).

## Interactions
MAP3K4, also known as MEKK4, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate its activity and function in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the Rho superfamily GTP-binding proteins CDC42 and RAC, which are crucial for the activation of the JNK pathway (Huang2024MAP3K4). MAP3K4 also interacts with GADD45 proteins, which activate MAP3K4 by binding to its N-terminal part and preventing the autoinhibitory region from blocking the kinase domain (Huang2024MAP3K4). This interaction is essential for the activation of stress-activated p38 MAPK and is regulated by GADD45 binding, leading to its activation through dimerization and auto-phosphorylation (Sollome2014HER2HER3).

MAP3K4 interacts with CIN85, a multi-adaptor protein, promoting the activation of MKK6 and the p38 MAP kinase cascade in response to growth factors and oxidative stress (Huang2024MAP3K4). It also binds to Axin, a scaffold protein in Wnt signaling, influencing the activation of the p38/JNK MAPK pathway (Huang2024MAP3K4). TRAF4 enhances MAP3K4 kinase activity by facilitating its oligomerization, which is crucial for JNK pathway mediation (Huang2024MAP3K4). Additionally, MAP3K4 interacts with GSK3β, a serine/threonine kinase, which inhibits its activity and prevents the activation of JNK and p38 signaling (Huang2024MAP3K4).
