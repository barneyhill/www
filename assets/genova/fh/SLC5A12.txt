# SLC5A12

## Overview
SLC5A12 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 5 member 12 (SMCT2), which is a sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter. This transmembrane protein is involved in the transport of lactate and other monocarboxylates, such as pyruvate, nicotinate, and short-chain fatty acids, across cell membranes. SMCT2 is characterized by its low-affinity, high-capacity transport properties, primarily facilitating the bulk absorption of these substrates in the kidney and intestine (Pucino2018Lactate; Alexander2011Guide). The protein operates with a Na+ to monocarboxylate stoichiometry of 1:1, making the transport process electroneutral (Ganapathy2008Sodiumcoupled; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). SLC5A12 is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, intestine, brain, and immune cells, where it plays significant roles in energy metabolism, homeostasis, and potentially immune function (Ganapathy2008Sodiumcoupled; Pucino2018Lactate; Song2020Solute).

## Function
SLC5A12, also known as SMCT2, is a sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter involved in the transport of lactate and other monocarboxylates such as pyruvate, nicotinate, and short-chain fatty acids. It is characterized as a low-affinity, high-capacity transporter, primarily facilitating the bulk absorption of lactate in the kidney and intestine (Pucino2018Lactate; Alexander2011Guide). The transporter operates with a Na+ to monocarboxylate stoichiometry of 1:1, making the transport process electroneutral (Ganapathy2008Sodiumcoupled; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

In the kidney, SLC5A12 is expressed along the proximal tubule, where it plays a crucial role in the reabsorption of lactate, contributing to energy metabolism and maintaining homeostasis (Ganapathy2008Sodiumcoupled). Its expression in the small intestine and colon facilitates the absorption of nicotinate and short-chain fatty acids produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber (Alexander2011Guide). In the brain, SLC5A12 is expressed in astrocytes, suggesting a role in the uptake of lactate and ketone bodies, which are primary energy substrates for neurons (Pucino2018Lactate). The transporter is also expressed in CD4+ T cells, where it may influence immune cell function (Song2020Solute).

## Interactions
SLC5A12, also known as SMCT2, is a sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter that participates in several protein interactions. It has been identified to interact with the multivalent PDZ protein PDZK1. This interaction is facilitated by the C-terminal PDZ motifs of SLC5A12, which are crucial for binding to PDZK1. Mutations in these motifs, such as the deletion of the last three residues or substitution of specific amino acids, abolish the interaction, highlighting the importance of these motifs in PDZ domain recognition (Srivastava2019Identification).

PDZK1 contains four PDZ domains, and SLC5A12 interacts with PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ4 of PDZK1. This interaction suggests that PDZK1 may play a role in the assembly of protein complexes involving SLC5A12 (Srivastava2019Identification). Although the specific functional implications of the SLC5A12 and PDZK1 interaction are not detailed, the presence of PDZK1 is known to enhance the transport activity of related transporters, such as SMCT1, indicating a potential regulatory role (Srivastava2019Identification).

SLC5A12 is also involved in forming complexes with URAT1, a transporter implicated in urate reabsorption, although this interaction can occur independently of PDZK1 (Srivastava2019Identification).
