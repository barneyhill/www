# DNAI7

## Overview
DNAI7 is a gene that encodes the dynein axonemal intermediate chain 7 protein, a critical component of the axonemal dynein complex. This protein is integral to the function of motile cilia and flagella, which are essential for various cellular processes, including fluid movement across epithelial surfaces and embryonic transport into the uterus. As an intermediate chain, DNAI7 is involved in beta-tubulin and microtubule binding activities, contributing to the structural organization and motility of cilia (Marrella2023A; Marrella2022A). The gene's proper function is crucial for maintaining normal ciliary activity, and its impairment is linked to conditions such as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia, characterized by abnormal cilia function (Marrella2023A; Marrella2022A). Additionally, DNAI7 may play a role in cell cycle regulation, with dysregulated transcript levels associated with certain cancers, indicating its broader significance in cell biology (Marrella2023A; Marrella2022A).

## Function
DNAI7 (dynein axonemal intermediate chain 7) is a component of the axonemal dynein complex, which plays a crucial role in the function of motile cilia. These cilia are essential for various cellular processes, including the movement of fluids across epithelial surfaces and the transport of embryos into the uterus. DNAI7 is involved in beta-tubulin binding activity and microtubule binding activity, contributing to the beating of cilia (Marrella2023A; Marrella2022A). In humans, DNAI7 interacts with light chains on the intermediate chain-light chain (IC-LC) tower of the inner-arm dynein complex, suggesting its role in the structural organization and function of these dyneins, which are critical for ciliary motility (Rao2024Structure).

The proper function of DNAI7 is vital for maintaining normal ciliary activity, and its impairment is associated with conditions such as Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia, which can lead to abnormal cilia function (Marrella2023A; Marrella2022A). DNAI7 may also act as a cell cycle regulator, with dysregulated transcript abundance linked to certain cancers, indicating its broader role in cell biology beyond ciliary function (Marrella2023A; Marrella2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAI7 gene are associated with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), a condition characterized by impaired ciliary function. This impairment can lead to chronic respiratory tract infections, reduced fertility, and situs inversus due to the inability of cilia to function properly (Marrella2023A; Marrella2022A). Variants that impair DNAI7 function can result in abnormal cilia function, potentially affecting the transport of cleaving embryos into the uterus, which may contribute to fertility issues (Marrella2023A; Marrella2022A).

In the context of fertility, sub-fertile heifers have been observed to have a greater abundance of DNAI7 transcripts in their circulating white blood cells. This suggests a possible link between DNAI7 dysregulation and subfertility, potentially due to cell cycle dysregulation and increased inflammation (Marrella2023A). Dysregulated transcript abundance of DNAI7 has also been associated with nasopharyngeal neoplasm in mice and lung adenocarcinoma in humans, indicating a broader role in cell cycle regulation and cancer (Marrella2023A; Marrella2022A). Further research is needed to explore these associations and their implications for human health.

## Interactions
DNAI7, also known as dynein axonemal intermediate chain 7, is a component of the axonemal dynein complex, which plays a crucial role in ciliary and flagellar movement. In humans, DNAI7, referred to as Las1, interacts with light chains (LCs) on the IC-LC tower of the inner-arm dynein f (IADf) complex. This interaction is part of the structural arrangement that allows the IADs to bind to the A-tubule via actin and LCs (Rao2024Structure). In the model organism Chlamydomonas, a protein named FAP120 is located near the IC97 and the IC-LC tower, suggesting a similar or related interaction network involving DNAI7 in humans (Rao2024Structure).

DNAI7 is also involved in beta-tubulin binding activity and microtubule binding activity, contributing to ciliary beating. Variants that impair DNAI7 function are associated with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia, which can lead to abnormal cilia function (Marrella2023A). The protein's role in these interactions is essential for the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella, highlighting its importance in cellular motility processes.
