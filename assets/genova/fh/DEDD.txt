# DEDD

## Overview
DEDD (death effector domain containing) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. The protein, also referred to as DEDD, is characterized by the presence of a death effector domain (DED), which facilitates interactions with other proteins in apoptotic signaling pathways. As a scaffold protein, DEDD plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle and inhibiting mitosis by interacting with cyclin B1, thereby influencing cellular homeostasis (Lv2014Use). Additionally, DEDD is implicated in the regulation of protein degradation pathways, particularly affecting proteins involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Lv2014Use). The protein's involvement in nuclear functions, such as transcription regulation and DNA binding, further underscores its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Zhan2002Death; Schickling2001Nuclear). DEDD's interactions with various proteins, including its role as a tumor suppressor through autophagy activation, highlight its significance in maintaining cellular integrity and preventing aberrant cell behavior (Lo2014Tandem).

## Structure
The DEDD protein is characterized by the presence of a death effector domain (DED), which is crucial for its role in apoptosis. The DED is composed of six amphipathic α-helices that form a hexahelical bundle, facilitating interactions with other proteins involved in apoptotic signaling pathways (Tibbetts2003The; Schickling2001Nuclear). The primary structure of DEDD includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a proline-rich region, with the DED located in the N-terminal region (Schickling2001Nuclear). 

The tertiary structure of DEDD involves the arrangement of its α-helices into a compact bundle, which is typical of the death domain superfamily, including DEDs (Tibbetts2003The). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but DEDD is known to interact with caspase-6 and other proteins through its DED, suggesting a role in forming larger protein complexes (Schickling2001Nuclear).

DEDD undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function in apoptotic pathways (Riley2015DED). The protein exists in alternatively spliced forms, which may be tissue-specific, indicating potential functional diversity (Schickling2001Nuclear).

## Function
DEDD (death effector domain containing) is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It contains a death effector domain (DED), which facilitates protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation (Lv2014Use). DEDD acts as an apoptotic scaffold protein, located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it regulates the cell cycle and inhibits cell mitosis by suppressing the activity of Cdk1/cyclin B1 complexes through direct binding to cyclin B1 (Lv2014Use). This interaction suggests a role in controlling cell division and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

DEDD is also involved in the regulation of protein degradation pathways. It influences the degradation of proteins such as Snail and Twist, which are key regulators of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, through mechanisms that may involve the autophagy-lysosome pathway (Lv2014Use). This regulatory function highlights DEDD's role in maintaining cellular integrity and preventing aberrant cell behavior.

In the context of uterine decidualization, DEDD stabilizes cyclin D3, which is essential for the polyploidization of decidual cells, a process crucial for successful pregnancy (Mori2011Death). This function underscores its importance in reproductive biology.

## Interactions
DEDD, a death effector domain-containing protein, engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in apoptosis and transcription regulation. DEDD interacts with c-FLIP/FLAME-1 and FLAME-3, and weakly with caspase-8, but not with caspase-10 or FADD. These interactions were confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown experiments (Zhan2002Death). DEDD and FLAME-3 can homodimerize and heterodimerize, and they interact with the hTFIIIC102 subunit of human transcription factor IIIC, suggesting a role in nuclear functions and transcription regulation (Zhan2002Death).

DEDD also binds to DNA, specifically inhibiting RNA Polymerase I-dependent transcription in nucleoli, which is crucial for its proapoptotic function (Schickling2001Nuclear). It activates caspase-6 within the nucleus, indicating its involvement in nucleolar function and apoptosis (Schickling2001Nuclear). DEDD interacts with DEDAF, a nuclear DED binding protein, highlighting its specificity in nuclear interactions (Schickling2001Nuclear).

DEDD also acts as a tumor suppressor by binding to the class III PI 3-kinase (PI3KC3)-BECN1 complex, which activates autophagy (Lo2014Tandem). These interactions underscore DEDD's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including apoptosis and transcription regulation.
