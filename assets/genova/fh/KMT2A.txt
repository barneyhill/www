# KMT2A

## Overview
KMT2A, also known as lysine methyltransferase 2A, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family of histone methyltransferases. This protein plays a pivotal role in epigenetic regulation by catalyzing the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with transcriptional activation. The KMT2A protein is a component of a multi-subunit complex that includes core proteins such as WDR5, RbBP5, and ASH2L, which enhance its enzymatic activity. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression patterns crucial for cellular differentiation and development, particularly through its interaction with the kinase Msk1 and its regulation of Hox genes. Mutations and rearrangements in the KMT2A gene are linked to various developmental disorders, such as Wiedemann-Steiner Syndrome, and hematological malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (Wiersma2016Protein; Guenther2005Global; Chan2019Expanding; Forgione2020KMT2A).

## Structure
The KMT2A gene encodes a multidomain protein consisting of 3972 amino acids, which plays a crucial role in chromatin-mediated transcription (Lebrun2017Molecular). The protein structure includes several key domains: three DNA-binding AT-hooks at the N terminus, a cysteine-rich CXXC domain, a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger motif, a bromodomain, a transactivation (TAD) domain, a FYRN domain, a WDR5 interaction (Win) motif, and a C-terminal SET domain responsible for histone methylation activity (Lebrun2017Molecular).

The PHD3 domain is involved in oligomerization and binding to the CYP33 protein, acting as a 'reader domain' for H3K4 me2/3, with its function enhanced by the adjacent bromodomain (Meyer2024The). Alternative splicing at the exon 15/16 junction results in four protein variants: 0, -3, -11, and -14, which affect the PHD3 domain's structure and interaction capabilities (Meyer2024The). The 0-variant has strong dimerization capacity, blocking CYP33 binding, while the -3-variant binds H3K4 me3 signatures without CYP33. The -11 and -14 variants exhibit weaker dimerization due to missing alpha-helices (Meyer2024The).

KMT2A undergoes cleavage at two independent sites, resulting in C-terminal and N-terminal fragments that form a stable complex localized to a subnuclear compartment (Lebrun2017Molecular). Variants in KMT2A, particularly non-sense and frameshift variants, are associated with Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome, affecting the protein's expression and function (Lebrun2017Molecular).

## Function
KMT2A, also known as lysine methyltransferase 2A, is a crucial epigenetic regulator involved in the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with active transcription. This methylation process is essential for maintaining an open chromatin structure, thereby facilitating gene expression (Wiersma2016Protein; Guenther2005Global). KMT2A is part of a multi-subunit complex that includes core proteins such as WDR5, RbBP5, and ASH2L, which enhance its catalytic activity (Wiersma2016Protein). The complex interacts with various proteins, including MENIN and LEDGF, which influence gene targeting and transcriptional regulation (Wiersma2016Protein).

In healthy human cells, KMT2A plays a significant role in regulating genes involved in differentiation and development, particularly through its interaction with the kinase Msk1. Msk1 enhances H3K4 methylation and allows the complex to access condensed chromatin, facilitating gene expression (Wiersma2016Protein). KMT2A is also involved in the regulation of Hox genes, which are crucial for maintaining cellular identity and are implicated in hematopoiesis and development (Guenther2005Global). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it forms part of a larger protein complex that regulates gene expression patterns essential for normal cellular and organismal functions (Kerimoglu2017KMT2A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KMT2A gene are associated with several diseases, most notably Wiedemann-Steiner Syndrome (WSS) and various forms of leukemia. WSS is a Mendelian syndromic intellectual disability condition characterized by features such as hypertrichosis cubiti, dysmorphic facial features, short stature, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. This syndrome is linked to de novo loss-of-function (LoF) and missense variants in the KMT2A gene, which lead to defects in chromatin remodeling and global changes in gene expression (Foroutan2022Clinical; Chan2019Expanding).

KMT2A rearrangements are also implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These rearrangements often result in fusion genes that disrupt normal hematopoiesis, leading to malignancy. In pediatric ALL, particularly in infants, KMT2A rearrangements are associated with aggressive disease features and poor prognosis (Górecki2023Updates; Forgione2020KMT2A). The presence of KMT2A::AFF1 rearrangement, however, is linked to longer event-free and overall survival (Górecki2023Updates).

The KMT2A gene's role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation underscores its significance in both developmental disorders and hematological malignancies (Strom2014De).

## Interactions
KMT2A, also known as MLL1, is a histone methyltransferase that forms part of a multiprotein complex essential for its catalytic activity. This complex, known as WRAD, includes core components such as WDR5, RbBP5, ASH2L, and DPY30, which significantly enhance the methyltransferase activity of KMT2A by several hundred-fold (Bochyńska2018Modes). KMT2A interacts with the nucleosome core particle (NCP) through the RbBP5 subunit, which binds to both DNA and the histone H4 tail, facilitating higher methylation states like H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 (Park2019CryoEM).

KMT2A also interacts with the protein kinase Msk1, which is part of the MAP kinase signaling pathway. Msk1 phosphorylates histone H3 at serines 10 and 28, enhancing the methylation activity of KMT2A and preventing chromatin condensation (Wiersma2016Protein). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of multiple target genes, including those involved in differentiation and development (Wiersma2016Protein).

Additionally, KMT2A forms a stable complex with the H4 K16 acetyltransferase MOF, which exhibits robust histone methyltransferase and acetyltransferase activities. This complex is essential for optimal transcription activation on chromatin templates (Dou2005Physical). These interactions highlight the role of KMT2A in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation.
