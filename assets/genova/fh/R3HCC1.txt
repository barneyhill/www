# R3HCC1

## Overview
The R3HCC1 gene encodes the protein R3H domain and coiled-coil containing 1, which is characterized by the presence of an R3H domain and coiled-coil motifs. This protein is involved in nucleic acid binding and is implicated in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and signal transduction. The R3H domain is known for its role in binding single-stranded nucleic acids, which suggests a potential function in RNA processing or regulation (Miller2016RNASeq). The protein's involvement in critical pathways and its expression in different tissues highlight its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Shahrisa2021The; Shi2024A).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The R3HCC1 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its mutations, expression alterations, and interactions. In diabetic foot ulcers (DFU), R3HCC1 is identified as a key glutamine metabolism-related gene, potentially serving as a biomarker for diagnosis and treatment. Its role in DFU pathogenesis is suggested, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Shi2024A).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), R3HCC1 is one of the genes with significant deletions, primarily located on chromosome 8p21.3. These deletions are associated with various signaling pathways, including those related to apoptosis and P53, indicating a potential role in cancer progression (Shahrisa2021The).

In Huntington's Disease (HD), R3HCC1 is noted for its nucleic acid-binding function, with differential expression observed in HD patient monocytes. This suggests a role in the proinflammatory transcriptional changes characteristic of HD, although the specific impact of R3HCC1 in this context is not fully detailed (Miller2016RNASeq).

Additionally, R3HCC1 has been studied in the context of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), where its expression patterns and epigenetic modifications are analyzed, although direct associations with specific conditions are not provided (MonteagudoSánchez2019Differences).
