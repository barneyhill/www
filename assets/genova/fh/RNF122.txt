# RNF122

## Overview
RNF122 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 122, which is a transmembrane RING finger protein functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and regulation within cells. Characterized by its transmembrane and RING finger domains, ring finger protein 122 is involved in various cellular processes, including protein stability and immune response modulation. It interacts with proteins such as the calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), influencing calcium signaling and antiviral responses, respectively. The gene's expression and function have been linked to several clinical conditions, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and cancer, highlighting its potential role in synaptic plasticity and tumorigenesis (Wang2016RNF122; GarciaMartínez2017Genewide; Peng2010RNF122:).

## Structure
RNF122 is a transmembrane RING finger protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It is characterized by a transmembrane domain at the N terminus and a RING finger domain at the C terminus, which is indicative of its role in ubiquitin ligase activity (Wang2016RNF122). Unlike typical members of the PA-TM-RING family, RNF122 lacks the protease-associated (PA) domain and the signal peptide sequence, which are usually involved in protein-protein interactions (Nakamura2011The; Lebensohn2022Receptor). 

RNF122 is known to undergo self-ubiquitination, leading to its degradation by the proteasome, a process that is upregulated following viral infection (Wang2016RNF122). This self-ubiquitination is facilitated by K48-linked ubiquitination, a common post-translational modification that tags proteins for degradation (Wang2016RNF122). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and partially in the endoplasmic reticulum (Wang2016RNF122). 

The interaction of RNF122 with other proteins, such as RIG-I, is mediated through its transmembrane domain, which binds to the CARDs of RIG-I, highlighting its role in modulating immune responses (Wang2016RNF122).

## Function
RNF122 is a RING finger protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and regulation within cells. This protein is involved in the proteasome-mediated processing, trafficking, and degradation of proteins, acting as an essential mediator of substrate specificity in ubiquitin ligation (GarciaMartínez2017Genewide; Peng2010RNF122:). RNF122 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, where it interacts with the calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML), stabilizing RNF122 and potentially influencing calcium signaling (Nakamura2011The; Peng2010RNF122:).

In the context of immune response, RNF122 interacts with RIG-I, a receptor involved in detecting viral RNA, and suppresses the production of type I interferons by targeting RIG-I for degradation. This interaction helps regulate the antiviral response, preventing excessive inflammation (Wang2016RNF122). RNF122 is also implicated in the central nervous system, where its overexpression has been associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), suggesting a role in synaptic plasticity and neuropsychiatric conditions (GarciaMartínez2017Genewide).

## Clinical Significance
RNF122 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in protein ubiquitination and degradation. Alterations in RNF122 expression have been associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A study identified RNF122 as a novel susceptibility gene for ADHD, noting its overexpression in individuals with the disorder. The research suggests that changes in RNF122 expression or function could impact synaptic receptor regulation, contributing to ADHD pathophysiology (GarciaMartínez2017Genewide).

In the context of cancer, RNF122 is overexpressed in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis. The gene's involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation, suggests that its dysregulation may affect cell viability and cancer progression (Peng2010RNF122:).

RNF122 also plays a role in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense. It negatively regulates the production of type I interferons by targeting the RIG-I protein for degradation. Alterations in RNF122 expression or function could impact the body's ability to respond to RNA viral infections, potentially influencing susceptibility to viral diseases (Wang2016RNF122).

## Interactions
RNF122 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. One of its notable interactions is with the calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML). This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed in HEK293T cells through co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The interaction occurs via the RING finger domain of RNF122, which functions as a ubiquitin ligase. However, CAML is not a substrate for RNF122's ubiquitinylating activity. Instead, CAML appears to stabilize RNF122, potentially by inhibiting its ubiquitination (Peng2010RNF122:).

RNF122 also interacts with the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), a cytoplasmic sensor for viral RNA. RNF122 binds directly to the caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) of RIG-I, facilitating its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This interaction suppresses the production of type I interferons, highlighting RNF122's role in modulating the antiviral response (Wang2016RNF122).

These interactions underscore RNF122's involvement in both protein stability regulation and immune response modulation, reflecting its diverse functional roles in cellular processes.
