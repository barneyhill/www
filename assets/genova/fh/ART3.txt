# ART3

## Overview
ART3 is a gene that encodes the protein ADP-ribosyltransferase 3, which is classified as part of the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase family. Despite its classification, the protein is considered inactive due to the absence of key motifs necessary for enzymatic activity, such as the R-S-EXE motif (Lüscher2017ADP-Ribosylation; Koch‐Nolte2006ADP‐ribosylation). The ART3 gene is located on chromosome 4q13-q21 and is predominantly expressed in the testis, suggesting a potential role in reproductive biology (Okazaki1999CHARACTERIZATION). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple mRNA variants, which may produce truncated proteins or noncoding RNAs (Friedrich2006Genomic). Although the specific biological functions of ART3 remain largely unknown, its expression pattern and involvement in various cellular processes indicate a complex regulatory role beyond its enzymatic activity. Additionally, ART3 has been implicated in certain diseases, including non-obstructive azoospermia and aggressive cancers, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Tan2016ART3; Okada2008GenomeWide).

## Structure
The ART3 protein is characterized by a complex exon-intron structure, with several small exons in the C-terminal region and a single long exon encoding most of the native protein. It contains hydrophobic N-terminal peptides, suggesting extracellular localization, and its secondary structure is predicted to be mainly helical in the N-terminal region and dominated by β-sheets in the C-terminal region, similar to bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins (Glowacki2002The). ART3 is localized to chromosome 4q13-q21 and is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, predominantly in the testis (Okazaki1999CHARACTERIZATION).

The ART3 gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple mRNA variants. These variants often lack exon 2, which encodes the catalytic domain, suggesting that ART3 may produce truncated proteins or noncoding RNAs (Friedrich2006Genomic). The gene has two promoters, pα and pβ, with tissue-specific expression patterns (Friedrich2006Genomic). Despite its classification as an ADP-ribosyltransferase, ART3 lacks detectable enzymatic activity, possibly due to the absence of the R-S-EXE motif associated with arginine-specific transferase activity (Glowacki2002The). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as the addition of a GPI-anchor, similar to ART1 (Okazaki1999CHARACTERIZATION).

## Function
The human ART3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase family, although it is considered inactive due to the absence of key motifs necessary for enzymatic activity (Lüscher2017ADP-Ribosylation; Koch‐Nolte2006ADP‐ribosylation). Despite this, ART3 is thought to play a role in cellular processes beyond its enzymatic function. It is most strongly expressed in the testis, particularly in spermatocytes during a specific stage of spermatogenesis, suggesting a potential role in reproductive biology (Friedrich2006Genomic). The gene's expression is regulated by two tissue-specific promoters, with one being active in testis, semen, activated macrophages, and MonoMac-6 cells, while the other is active in skeletal and heart muscle and tonsils (Friedrich2006Genomic).

ART3 is characterized by extensive alternative splicing, resulting in multiple variants that may produce truncated proteins or short peptides, although their exact functions are not well understood (Friedrich2006Genomic). The presence of ART3 mRNA in various tissues, including testis, heart muscle, skeletal muscle, and tonsil, indicates a complex regulation of its expression, which may influence its function in different cell types (Friedrich2006Genomic). Despite these insights, the specific biological functions of ART3 in healthy human cells remain largely unknown.

## Clinical Significance
The ART3 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In the context of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a condition characterized by the absence of sperm in the ejaculate, ART3 has been identified as a susceptibility gene. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within ART3, such as ART3-SNP25, have shown a significant association with NOA. A protective haplotype, H1, was identified, which is under-represented in NOA patients and associated with higher testosterone levels, suggesting a potential role in the genetic susceptibility to this condition (Okada2008GenomeWide).

In cancer research, ART3 overexpression has been linked to aggressive behavior in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and melanoma. In TNBC, ART3 overexpression leads to increased cell proliferation, invasion, and survival, primarily through the activation of the AKT and ERK pathways. This overexpression is associated with worse survival outcomes in patients, indicating ART3 as a potential therapeutic target (Tan2016ART3). Similarly, in melanoma, ART3 is overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and its silencing results in reduced cell migration, highlighting its role in melanoma progression (He2018Targeted).
