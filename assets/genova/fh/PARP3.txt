# PARP3

## Overview
PARP3, or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, particularly in the repair of double-strand breaks. The protein, also referred to as PARP3, is a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family and functions primarily as an enzyme with mono-ADP-ribosylation activity. It plays a significant role in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), a critical pathway for repairing DNA double-strand breaks, and is involved in various cellular processes, including mitotic progression and chromatin remodeling. PARP3's interactions with other proteins, such as DNA-PKcs and tankyrase 1, underscore its importance in maintaining genomic stability. Alterations in PARP3 expression or function have been linked to cancer progression, particularly in BRCA1-deficient breast cancers, and its role in neurogenesis suggests potential implications for neurodegenerative diseases (Beck2014PARP3; Boehler2011Poly(ADPribose); RodriguezVargas2020Parp3 page 0 of 7).

## Structure
PARP3 is a protein involved in DNA repair, characterized by its distinct domain structure. It consists of three main domains: a unique N-terminal domain (NTD), a central WGR domain, and a C-terminal catalytic domain (Grundy2016PARP3). The WGR domain is crucial for DNA interaction, particularly binding to DNA with a 3' overhang, and plays a significant role in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (Grundy2016PARP3). The catalytic domain includes the ADP-ribosyl transferase (ART) domain, which is responsible for its enzymatic activity (van2021PARP).

The protein's structure reveals an N-terminal R-helical domain and a C-terminal R/β-domain, with a conserved PARP signature motif (Lehtiö2009Structural). PARP3 lacks the D-loop found in other PARP family members, which may relate to its function in mono-ADP-ribosylation rather than poly-ADP-ribosylation (van2021PARP). 

PARP3 can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, and undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Lindgren2013PARP). The protein's ability to bind and ribosylate nucleosomes, particularly in response to DNA strand breaks, highlights its specificity and functional importance in DNA repair mechanisms (Grundy2016PARP3).

## Function
PARP3 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 3) is an enzyme involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, particularly in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs). It plays a critical role in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), a major pathway for repairing DSBs. PARP3 interacts with components of the NHEJ machinery, such as DNA-PKcs, Ku70, Ku80, and APLF, facilitating efficient DNA end joining and protecting DNA ends from excessive resection, which can lead to error-prone repair (Rulten2011PARP3; Beck2014PARP3). 

PARP3 also influences the balance between homologous recombination (HR) and NHEJ by modulating the recruitment of repair proteins like Ku80 to DNA damage sites, thereby affecting the choice of repair pathway (Beck2014PARP3). In addition to its role in DNA repair, PARP3 is involved in mitotic progression. It interacts with mitotic components such as NuMA and tankyrase 1, contributing to spindle dynamics and telomere integrity, which are crucial for proper cell division (Boehler2011Poly(ADPribose) page 2 of 5). 

PARP3 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it forms part of complexes involved in DNA damage repair and transcriptional silencing, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Rouleau2006PARP‐3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PARP3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, PARP3 plays a critical role in the survival and proliferation of BRCA1-deficient triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Knockout of PARP3 in these cells impairs proliferation, survival, and tumor progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in BRCA1-associated cancers (Beck2018PARP3). The absence of PARP3 leads to increased centrosome amplification and genome instability, which are linked to cancer progression (Beck2018PARP3).

PARP3 is also involved in the regulation of DNA repair pathways. Its downregulation in certain breast tumors, particularly in hormone receptor-negative subgroups, suggests a shift towards reliance on homologous recombination for DNA repair, which could influence tumor behavior and treatment response (Bieche2013Variations). Additionally, PARP3's role in regulating G4 DNA structures and chromosomal rearrangements suggests that its deficiency could lead to increased genomic instability, contributing to cancer development (Day2017PARP3).

In neurogenesis, PARP3 is crucial for maintaining redox homeostasis and mTORC2 signaling. Its deficiency leads to increased oxidative stress and impaired astrocytic differentiation, which may have implications for neurodegenerative diseases and conditions involving oxidative stress (RodriguezVargas2020Parp3).

## Interactions
PARP3 is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in DNA repair and cellular processes. It interacts with PARP-1, forming catalytically active heterodimers that can activate PARP-1 in the absence of DNA. This interaction is strong enough to withstand high salt and detergent conditions, suggesting a robust association (Loseva2010PARP3). PARP3 also associates with components of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair machinery, including DNA-PKcs, DNA ligase IV, Ku70, and Ku80. These interactions facilitate the recruitment of these proteins to DNA damage sites, enhancing the accuracy of NHEJ (Zarkovic2018Characterization; Rouleau2006PARP‐3).

PARP3 is part of a protein complex with NuMA and tankyrase 1, influencing mitotic spindle dynamics and telomere integrity. It can induce ADP ribosylation of NuMA both directly and through tankyrase 1, and it stimulates the auto-ADP ribosylation of tankyrase 1 (Boehler2011Poly(ADPribose) page 2 of 5). PARP3 also interacts with chromatin-associated Polycomb Group components, such as EZH2, Suz12, and YY1, suggesting a role in modulating chromatin state and influencing DNA damage repair (Beck2014PARP3). These interactions highlight PARP3's significant role in maintaining genome stability and its potential as a target in cancer therapy.
