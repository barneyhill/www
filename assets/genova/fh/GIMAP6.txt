# GIMAP6

## Overview
GIMAP6 is a gene that encodes the protein GTPase, IMAP family member 6, which is part of the GTPase family known for its role in immune regulation. The protein is characterized by a conserved GTP-binding AIG1 domain, which is integral to its function in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (mukadam2019investigation; Ho2017Functional). GIMAP6 is predominantly expressed in T cells, where it functions as an anti-apoptotic factor, contributing to immune cell survival and activation (Ho2017Functional). It is also involved in autophagy, particularly in the recruitment to autophagosomes, which is essential for cellular homeostasis (Pascall2018GIMAP6). The protein's expression is modulated during T cell activation, enhancing resistance to apoptosis and playing a critical role in immune responses during infections and autoimmune conditions (Ho2017Functional). GIMAP6's involvement in various immune-related disorders and cancers highlights its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker (Zhang2023Prognostic; Yu2019Effects).

## Structure
GIMAP6 is a protein encoded by the GIMAP6 gene, characterized by the presence of a conserved GTP-binding AIG1 domain at its N-terminus, which is a hallmark of the GIMAP family (mukadam2019investigation; Ho2017Functional). This domain includes a GTP/ATP binding P-loop motif, a conserved box, and the IAN motif, contributing to its nucleotide-binding capabilities (Ho2017Functional). GIMAP6 exhibits both GTPase and ATPase activities, although its hydrolysis activity is not essential for its anti-apoptotic function (Ho2017Functional).

The protein is predicted to have coiled-coil motifs, which are common structural features that may facilitate protein-protein interactions (Ho2017Functional). GIMAP6 can form multimers, and its oligomerization is linked to its hydrolysis activity (Ho2017Functional). The C-terminal region of GIMAP6, particularly the last 10 amino acids, is crucial for its interaction with GABARAPL2, suggesting the presence of alpha-helical structures involved in this interaction (mukadam2019investigation).

GIMAP6 has multiple splice variants, including hgimap6_v1 and hgimap6_v2, which encode proteins of different lengths and molecular weights (Krücken2004Comparative). These variants may have distinct functions due to differences in their NH2-termini and the presence of specific domains.

## Function
GIMAP6 is a protein primarily expressed in T cells, where it plays a significant role in modulating immune function by controlling cell death and activation. It acts as an anti-apoptotic protein, protecting T cells from apoptosis induced by agents such as hydrogen peroxide, Fas ligand, and okadaic acid. This protective role is linked to the activation of NF-κB, as GIMAP6 knockdown results in reduced phosphorylation of the NF-κB p65 subunit (Ho2017Functional).

GIMAP6 is involved in the autophagic process, particularly in its recruitment to autophagosomes, which suggests a role in autophagy regulation. This function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and the clearance of damaged organelles, such as mitochondria (Pascall2018GIMAP6). The protein is localized mainly in the cytosol of T-lymphocytes, where it exhibits ATPase and GTPase activity, although these enzymatic activities are not essential for its anti-apoptotic function (Ho2017Functional).

GIMAP6's expression is upregulated upon T cell activation, enhancing resistance to activation-induced cell death and contributing to T cell immunity during infections and autoimmune diseases (Ho2017Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GIMAP6 gene have been linked to various immune-related disorders and cancers. GIMAP6 deficiency is identified as a novel primary immune deficiency, characterized by increased apoptosis in lymphocytes, leading to immune system dysfunction. This condition was observed in two siblings with a homozygous deleterious variant in the GIMAP6 gene, where one sibling experienced lymphopenia and recurrent infections, while the other was asymptomatic (Shadur2020A).

In cancer, GIMAP6 expression levels are altered in several types. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), GIMAP6 is over-expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its role in tumor pathology and as a potential diagnostic marker (Zhang2023Prognostic). Conversely, in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), GIMAP6 expression is lower in tumor tissues, and its higher expression is associated with a better prognosis, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Wang2021GAS6AS1; Yu2019Effects).

GIMAP6 is also implicated in chronic lung diseases like asthma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), where it may play a role in modulating immune responses, presenting potential therapeutic targets (Maghsoudloo2020Identification).
