# DHRS7

## Overview
The DHRS7 gene encodes the enzyme dehydrogenase/reductase 7, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This enzyme is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and plays a significant role in steroid metabolism, particularly in the conversion of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5αDHT) to 3α-androstanediol (3αAdiol), thereby modulating androgen receptor signaling (araya2018toward). The DHRS7 protein exists in two isoforms due to alternative splicing, with distinct structural features such as the Rossmann fold, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (araya2018toward). The expression of DHRS7 is notably high in the prostate, where it may contribute to maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating cell proliferation and migration (Rizzotto2023Reduction). Alterations in DHRS7 expression have been associated with various cancers, including prostate and renal clear cell carcinoma, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and its involvement in cancer progression (Tang2022DHRS7; Rizzotto2023Reduction).

## Structure
The DHRS7 gene encodes a protein that is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, characterized by a conserved NAD(P)(H) cofactor binding region known as the Rossmann fold (araya2018toward). The DHRS7 protein exists in two isoforms produced by alternative splicing. Isoform 1 consists of 339 amino acids, while isoform 2 is shorter, consisting of 289 amino acids, missing the first 50 amino acids of isoform 1 at the N-terminus (araya2018toward). The predicted structure of isoform 1 includes a Rossmann fold, an active site, and intermembrane domain regions (araya2018toward).

The enzyme is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane with its active site facing the cytoplasm, suggesting a specific membrane topology (araya2018toward). The cytoplasmic orientation is supported by the distribution of charged amino acids in its primary sequence, with a glutamate residue at the N-terminus and arginine residues at positions 24 and 27 (araya2018toward). The enzyme's activity involves the reduction of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5αDHT) to 3α-androstanediol (3αAdiol), indicating its role in steroid metabolism (araya2018toward). However, specific details on the tertiary or quaternary structure, post-translational modifications, or additional domains are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The DHRS7 gene encodes an enzyme that is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, which is involved in the metabolism of various substrates, including steroids and retinoids. In healthy human cells, DHRS7 is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, with its catalytic domain facing the cytoplasm (araya2018toward). The enzyme exhibits 3α/20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, suggesting a role in steroid metabolism (araya2018toward).

DHRS7 is involved in the inactivation of the potent androgen 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5αDHT) to the less active 3α-androstanediol (3αAdiol), which may help regulate androgen receptor (AR) signaling (araya2018toward). This activity is important for controlling AR-mediated processes, potentially impacting cell proliferation and migration, particularly in tissues like the prostate (araya2018toward).

The enzyme's expression is notably high in the prostate, where it may play a protective role by modulating AR activity and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Rizzotto2023Reduction). Despite these insights, the full physiological relevance of DHRS7 in healthy cells remains to be fully elucidated, warranting further research into its specific substrates and functions (araya2018toward).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DHRS7 gene have been linked to various cancers, including renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and prostate cancer. In KIRC, low expression of DHRS7 is associated with advanced clinical stages and poor survival rates, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. The gene's expression is correlated with tumor microenvironment factors, such as tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, which are important in cancer progression (Tang2022DHRS7).

In prostate cancer, reduced DHRS7 expression is observed in higher-grade tumors and is associated with increased nuclear size, a characteristic of aggressive cancer phenotypes. The loss of DHRS7 in prostate cancer cells leads to enhanced proliferation, migration, and decreased cell adhesion, indicating its role in cancer metastasis (Rizzotto2023Reduction).

DHRS7 expression is also implicated in breast cancer, where its depletion results in cell cycle arrest and changes in cell adhesion and migration, suggesting a role in cancer cell aggressiveness (araya2018toward). Beyond cancer, DHRS7 expression changes have been noted in metabolic conditions such as diabetes mellitus type 2, where increased mRNA levels are observed in muscle tissue (araya2018toward).
