# ACKR2

## Overview
The ACKR2 gene encodes the atypical chemokine receptor 2, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically classified as a seven-transmembrane receptor. Unlike typical chemokine receptors, ACKR2 does not activate classical G protein signaling pathways. Instead, it functions primarily as a scavenger receptor, regulating the bioavailability of inflammatory chemokines through a β-arrestin-dependent mechanism (Gowhari2022The; Bonecchi2016Atypical). This receptor plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses by binding and internalizing a variety of CC chemokines, thereby preventing excessive leukocyte recruitment and maintaining homeostasis (Nibbs2013Immune). ACKR2 is expressed in various cell types, including lymphatic endothelial cells and trophoblasts, and is involved in diverse physiological processes, such as maintaining the inflammatory balance at the maternal-fetal interface during pregnancy (Sjöberg2020The; Gowhari2022The). Its clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in cancer, neurological conditions, and renal diseases, where alterations in its expression or function can influence disease progression and outcomes (Gowhari2022The; Yang2023Comprehensive).

## Structure
The ACKR2 protein, also known as atypical chemokine receptor 2, is a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in chemokine scavenging. Its primary structure consists of 384 amino acids, with a notable single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2228467, resulting in a single amino acid change at position 41, which affects binding affinity and receptor recycling (Gowhari2022The). The secondary structure of ACKR2 includes alpha helices typical of GPCRs, contributing to its ability to traverse the cell membrane. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, which is crucial for its function as a receptor.

ACKR2 is characterized by the replacement of the highly conserved DRYLAIVHA motif with DKYLEIVHA, introducing an extra charged residue that distinguishes it from other chemokine receptors (Gowhari2022The). This structural variation is significant for its atypical function, as ACKR2 does not trigger classical G protein signaling but instead regulates chemokine availability through a b-arrestin-dependent pathway (Gowhari2022The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, influencing its activity and interactions. There are known splice variants of ACKR2, which can affect its function and localization, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
ACKR2, also known as atypical chemokine receptor 2, functions primarily as a scavenger receptor for inflammatory chemokines in healthy human cells. It binds a wide range of inflammatory CC chemokines, including CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, and CCL11, and internalizes them for degradation in lysosomes, thereby regulating their concentration and bioavailability (Gowhari2022The; Bonecchi2016Atypical). This scavenging activity is crucial for modulating immune responses and maintaining homeostasis by limiting excessive leukocyte recruitment and preventing chronic inflammation (Gowhari2022The; Nibbs2013Immune).

ACKR2 is expressed in various cell types, including lymphatic endothelial cells, trophoblasts, and some leukocytes, such as macrophages and B cells (Sjöberg2020The; Nibbs2013Immune). It is predominantly located in internal endosomes, with a smaller portion on the cell surface, allowing efficient chemokine binding and degradation (Gowhari2022The). The receptor's activity is regulated through a β-arrestin-dependent pathway, which enhances its surface expression and scavenging function (Bonecchi2016Atypical).

In the context of pregnancy, ACKR2 is highly expressed in trophoblast cells, where it helps maintain the proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory balance at the maternal-fetal interface, preventing inflammation-induced abortion and supporting embryo survival (Gowhari2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the atypical chemokine receptor 2 (ACKR2) have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In cancer, reduced ACKR2 expression is linked to larger tumor sizes and poorer survival outcomes in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer. This downregulation is associated with increased expression of metastatic factors, suggesting an anti-tumor role for ACKR2 through its anti-inflammatory functions (Gowhari2022The; Yang2023Comprehensive). In colon adenocarcinoma, decreased ACKR2 expression correlates with increased tumor invasiveness and an immunosuppressive microenvironment, indicating its potential as a biomarker for tumor progression (Gowhari2022The).

In breast cancer, ACKR2 is often hypermethylated, leading to reduced expression levels, which are associated with lower recurrence-free survival rates (Yang2023Comprehensive). ACKR2's role in modulating immune cell infiltration and angiogenesis further underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Yang2023Comprehensive).

In neurological conditions, ACKR2 plays a protective role by reducing chronic inflammation, as seen in traumatic brain injury and multiple sclerosis. Its absence can lead to increased inflammation and disease severity (Gowhari2022The). In renal diseases, ACKR2 helps control inflammation and fibrotic remodeling, with its deficiency leading to more severe kidney damage (Gowhari2022The). These findings highlight the importance of ACKR2 in disease progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ACKR2, also known as atypical chemokine receptor 2, primarily functions as a scavenger receptor for inflammatory chemokines. It interacts with β-arrestins, which are crucial for its trafficking and function. This interaction facilitates the internalization and recycling of ACKR2, allowing it to effectively scavenge chemokines and regulate their extracellular concentrations (Bachelerie2013International; Nibbs2013Immune). The β-arrestin-dependent pathway is essential for the receptor's chemokine-scavenging function and influences its surface expression (Gowhari2022The).

ACKR2 also interacts with various chemokines, including CCL2-8, CCL11-14, CCL17, and CCL22, which are ligands for classical inflammatory receptors CCR1-5 (Chevigné2021CXCL10; Szpakowska2023New). It has been shown to bind CXCL10, a CXC chemokine, with significant potency, acting as a partial agonist and leading to the intracellular accumulation of CXCL10 (Chevigné2021CXCL10). This interaction suggests a regulatory role for ACKR2 in controlling extracellular chemokine levels.

The receptor's interaction with chemokines does not activate conventional signaling pathways but enhances scavenging and surface expression through β-arrestin-dependent mechanisms (Nibbs2013Immune). These interactions highlight ACKR2's role in modulating inflammatory responses and its potential involvement in various physiological and pathological processes.
