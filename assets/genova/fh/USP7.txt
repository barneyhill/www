# USP7

## Overview
USP7, or ubiquitin specific peptidase 7, is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in various cellular processes, including protein stability, DNA repair, and epigenetic regulation. The protein, ubiquitin specific peptidase 7, is characterized by its multi-domain structure, which includes a TRAF-like domain, a catalytic domain, and multiple ubiquitin-like domains, facilitating its interaction with numerous substrates and regulatory proteins (Zhou2021UbiquitinSpecific; Pozhidaeva2019USP7:). As a deubiquitinating enzyme, USP7 plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating the ubiquitination status of key proteins, thereby influencing pathways related to tumorigenesis, immune response, and neurodevelopment (Kim2017Regulation; AlEidan2022The). Its clinical significance is underscored by its association with neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers, where it can function as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the cellular context (Fountain2019Pathogenic; Nie2022USP7).

## Structure
USP7, also known as ubiquitin specific peptidase 7, is a multi-domain protein consisting of 1102 amino acids. It features an N-terminal TRAF-like domain, a catalytic domain, and five C-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domains (Zhou2021UbiquitinSpecific). The TRAF-like domain, spanning residues 53-205, has an eight-stranded, antiparallel β-sandwich fold and is responsible for binding substrates through a P/A-x-x-S motif (Pozhidaeva2019USP7:). The catalytic domain has a papain-like architecture with finger, thumb, and palm domains, forming a ubiquitin binding pocket (Faesen2011Mechanism; Zhou2021UbiquitinSpecific).

The C-terminal region includes five Ubl domains organized in a 2-1-2 configuration, which are crucial for USP7's activity and interactions with other proteins (Faesen2011Mechanism; Kim2017Regulation). These domains are connected by flexible linkers, allowing dynamic interdomain arrangements (Pozhidaeva2019USP7:). The Ubl domains serve as a substrate-binding platform, with each domain having unique surface charge distributions that facilitate distinct protein interactions (Pozhidaeva2019USP7:).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, modulate USP7's substrate affinity and activity (Pozhidaeva2019USP7:). The protein's structure and flexibility are essential for its regulatory functions in various cellular processes.

## Function
USP7, also known as ubiquitin-specific protease 7, is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protein stability and activity in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus but also forms complexes in the cytosol (Kim2017Regulation). USP7 is involved in the regulation of the p53/Mdm2 axis, crucial for genome stability and stress responses. It deubiquitinates and stabilizes p53, promoting apoptosis in response to DNA damage, while also protecting MDM2 from auto-ubiquitination under normal conditions (Faesen2011Mechanism; Kim2017Regulation).

USP7 also plays a significant role in DNA replication by maintaining a SUMO-rich environment at replication forks, which is essential for proper DNA replication and cell cycle progression (Lecona2016USP7). It regulates the stability of various proteins involved in DNA repair, such as XPC in nucleotide excision repair and components of the double-strand break repair pathways, ensuring genome integrity (Valles2020USP7).

In addition to its role in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, USP7 influences epigenetic regulation by stabilizing histone demethylases and interacting with DNA methylation machinery, impacting gene expression and chromatin dynamics (Bhattacharya2018Emerging; Rawat2019Nuclear). These activities underscore USP7's importance in regulating cellular processes and maintaining genomic stability.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the USP7 gene are associated with several diseases, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. Pathogenic variants in USP7 are linked to a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and seizures. These variants include deletions, nonsense, splice-site, and missense mutations, which lead to a range of clinical manifestations such as hypotonia, eye anomalies, and feeding difficulties (Fountain2019Pathogenic). The disorder, sometimes referred to as Hao-Fountain syndrome, is marked by speech delays, altered behavior, and neurologic anomalies, with MRI findings often showing reduced white matter (Zheng2022Expansion; Fountain2019Pathogenic).

In cancer, USP7 plays a dual role, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the context. Its overexpression is linked to tumor progression in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer, where it influences the stability of proteins like p53, MDM2, and N-MYC (Valles2020USP7; Nie2022USP7). Aberrant USP7 expression can lead to poor clinical outcomes, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Valles2020USP7).

## Interactions
USP7 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 7) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that interacts with a variety of proteins, playing crucial roles in cellular processes such as tumorigenesis, DNA repair, and immune response. USP7 forms a trimeric complex with MDM2 and SUV39H1, protecting SUV39H1 from MDM2-mediated degradation, and stabilizes p53 by deubiquitinating MDM2 and MDMX (AlEidan2022The). It also interacts with LSD1, a histone demethylase, which is linked to glioma progression (AlEidan2022The).

USP7 binds and stabilizes DNMT1, a key player in DNA methylation, through its KG linker, which is essential for their interaction (Cheng2015Molecular). It also forms complexes with Dnmt1 and UHRF1, stabilizing UHRF1 by preventing its autoubiquitinylation and degradation (Felle2011The). USP7 interacts with β-catenin, promoting Wnt signaling by forming a complex with RNF220 to deubiquitinate and stabilize β-catenin (AlEidan2022The).

In the immune response, USP7 stabilizes NF-ĸB subunits, particularly p65, through its Ubl2 domain, which is crucial for NF-ĸB-mediated transcription (Mitxitorena2020The). It also interacts with SIRT7, regulating its deacetylase activity and influencing glucose metabolism (Jiang2017Ubiquitinspecific). These interactions highlight USP7's multifaceted role in cellular regulation.
