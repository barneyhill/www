# TP53TG3E

## Overview
TP53TG3E is a gene that encodes the protein TP53 target 3 family member E, which is involved in the p53 signaling pathway. This protein is part of a family of genes that are transcriptionally regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, a critical regulator of the cell cycle and apoptosis. The TP53TG3E protein is implicated in cellular responses to DNA damage and stress, playing a role in maintaining genomic stability. Its expression is notably altered in certain pathological conditions, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), suggesting its involvement in disease mechanisms and potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Ziff2022Metaanalysis; Ziff2023Integrated; Zhu2018Systematic; Ziff2022Genome).

## Clinical Significance
TP53TG3E is implicated in several diseases due to its role in the p53 signaling pathway. In the context of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), TP53TG3E is significantly upregulated in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons (iPSMNs) from ALS patients. This upregulation is associated with the activation of the p53 signaling pathway, which is linked to the DNA damage response in ALS pathology. The increased activity of the TP53 transcription factor, with TP53TG3E as part of the gene set, suggests a connection between p53 pathway activation and ALS, potentially contributing to motor neuron degeneration (Ziff2022Metaanalysis; Ziff2023Integrated; Ziff2022Genome).

In congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), TP53TG3E is located within a 2.4-Mb gain at 16p11.2, a region associated with the condition. Although the specific role of TP53TG3E in CDH is not detailed, its presence in this region suggests it may contribute to the pathogenesis of CDH (Zhu2018Systematic). The clinical significance of TP53TG3E in these conditions highlights its potential as a target for further research and therapeutic intervention.
