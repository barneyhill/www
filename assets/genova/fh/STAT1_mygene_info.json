In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. The protein encoded by this gene can be activated by various ligands including interferon-alpha, interferon-gamma, EGF, PDGF and IL6. This protein mediates the expression of a variety of genes, which is thought to be important for cell viability in response to different cell stimuli and pathogens. The protein plays an important role in immune responses to viral, fungal and mycobacterial pathogens. Mutations in this gene are associated with Immunodeficiency 31B, 31A, and 31C.
