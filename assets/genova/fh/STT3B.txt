# STT3B

## Overview
STT3B is a gene that encodes the STT3 oligosaccharyltransferase complex catalytic subunit B, a critical component of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex involved in N-linked glycosylation. This process is a vital post-translational modification occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells, where STT3B plays a unique role in posttranslational glycosylation, complementing the cotranslational activity of its homolog, STT3A (RuizCanada2009Cotranslational; Cherepanova2019Quantitative). The STT3B protein is characterized by its transmembrane domains and luminal catalytic domain, allowing it to interact with other OST complex subunits and facilitate the transfer of oligosaccharides to asparagine residues on target proteins (Zhu2019Comprehensive; Mohanty2020Structural). Its ability to glycosylate sites in folded protein domains and hydrolyze lipid-linked oligosaccharides underscores its importance in protein folding and function (Lu2018Mammalian). Mutations in the STT3B gene are linked to congenital disorders of glycosylation, highlighting its clinical significance (Kılıç2020Novel).

## Structure
The STT3B protein is a catalytic subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which plays a crucial role in N-linked glycosylation. It is embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and features transmembrane domains along with a luminal catalytic domain. The structure of STT3B includes interactions with other subunits of the OST complex, such as MAGT1, which binds specifically to STT3B and not to STT3A due to steric clashes (Mohanty2020Structural). This interaction is unique to the OST-B complex, where STT3B is the catalytic subunit.

The cryo-EM structures of the OST-B complex reveal that STT3B binds both an acceptor peptide and a donor substrate, dolichylphosphate, at its active site (Mohanty2020Structural). The presence of dolichol phosphate near the catalytic divalent metal ion is noted, although no density for dolichol pyrophosphate was observed (Mohanty2020Structural). The EL5 helix in STT3B may transition from disordered to structured upon lipid-linked oligosaccharide binding, indicating a dynamic structural adaptation during substrate interaction (Mohanty2020Structural). The protein's structure allows for selective lipid-linked oligosaccharide hydrolysis, possibly through interactions with the external loop 5 (EL5) and the catalytic site (Lu2018Mammalian).

## Function
The STT3B gene encodes a catalytic subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is essential for N-glycosylation, a critical post-translational modification in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. STT3B is primarily involved in posttranslational glycosylation, targeting sites that are missed during cotranslational glycosylation by the STT3A complex. This function is crucial for ensuring that proteins entering the secretory pathway are properly glycosylated, which is important for their stability and function (RuizCanada2009Cotranslational; Cherepanova2019Quantitative).

STT3B operates independently of the protein translocation channel and is capable of glycosylating sites in folded protein domains that are inaccessible to STT3A. It works in conjunction with oxidoreductases like MagT1 and TUSC3, which are necessary for its full activity, facilitating glycosylation by delaying disulfide bond formation (Cherepanova2016Mammalian; Cherepanova2019Quantitative).

In addition to its glycosylation role, STT3B-OST can hydrolyze lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) in the absence of an acceptor, a function not shared by STT3A-OST. This balance between transferase and hydrolase activities is crucial for proper protein folding and function in healthy human cells (Lu2018Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STT3B gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation type Ix (CDG-Ix), a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by defects in protein or lipid glycosylation. These mutations can lead to severe clinical manifestations, including developmental delays, neurological issues, and immune deficiencies. A specific case study identified a novel homozygous mutation, c.38C>G, in the STT3B gene, which resulted in severe respiratory failure, infantile spasms, and developmental delays in a 5-year-old patient (Kılıç2020Novel).

Alterations in STT3B expression levels have been linked to inflammatory conditions. Inflammation can cause an increase in STT3B expression in tissues such as the vascular endothelium and uterine epithelium, leading to changes in glycosylation patterns that may affect disease progression, including atherogenesis and cancer (Prados2020Inflammatory).

STT3B is also implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. A genome-wide association study identified a significant association between the STT3B locus and diabetic retinopathy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, suggesting that increased STT3B expression may influence susceptibility to this condition (Imamura2021Genomewide).

## Interactions
STT3B is a catalytic subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which plays a crucial role in N-glycosylation. It interacts with several other proteins within the OST complex, including ribophorin I (RPN1), ribophorin II (RPN2), OSTC, and DDOST/OST48, facilitating the transfer of oligosaccharides to asparagine residues on target proteins (Zhu2019Comprehensive). STT3B is also associated with specific subunits such as MAGT1 and TUSC3, which are essential for its full glycosylation activity. These subunits interact with STT3B to ensure proper glycosylation of substrates, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses (Zhu2019Comprehensive; Cherepanova2019Quantitative).

STT3B's interaction with viral proteins has been highlighted in studies involving the Lassa virus (LASV) glycoprotein. It is crucial for the N-glycosylation of LASV glycoproteins, which is essential for viral infectivity. The OST complex, including STT3B, interacts with host proteins and is necessary for the formation of infectious arenavirus particles (Zhu2019Comprehensive). Additionally, STT3B interacts with EREG in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, promoting its glycosylation and stabilization, which is critical for PD-L1 upregulation and immune evasion (Xu2024Stabilization).
