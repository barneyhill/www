# INSL3

## Overview
INSL3, or insulin-like 3, is a gene that encodes a peptide hormone belonging to the relaxin/insulin family. The protein product, also known as insulin-like 3, is primarily produced by Leydig cells in the testes and plays a pivotal role in male reproductive physiology, particularly in the process of testicular descent during fetal development. This hormone functions by interacting with the RXFP2 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, to mediate its biological effects, which include the regulation of spermatogenesis and bone metabolism (Ivell2009Biology; Ferlin2011Profiling). The INSL3 protein is characterized by a relaxin/insulin fold, consisting of two chains linked by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for its structural integrity and receptor binding (Rosengren2006Solution). Mutations or altered expression of the INSL3 gene have been associated with reproductive disorders such as cryptorchidism and testicular dysgenesis syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Sinopidis2019Novel; Ferlin2006Insulinlike).

## Structure
The INSL3 protein is characterized by a typical relaxin/insulin fold, consisting of two chains, A and B, which are linked by disulfide bonds. The primary structure includes specific residues that form these disulfide bonds, crucial for maintaining its conformation (Rosengren2006Solution). The secondary structure of the A-chain features two parallel α-helical regions, separated by an extended segment that forms a small β-sheet through hydrogen bonding with the B-chain (Rosengren2006Solution). The B-chain contains a longer helical segment that spans across the face of the A-chain helices (Rosengren2006Solution).

The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which hold the peptide chains together around a hydrophobic core. This core includes side chains from several residues, such as Pro A6, Cys A10, and Leu B9 (Rosengren2006Solution). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but the protein is suggested to exist in a monomeric form without concentration-dependent aggregation (Rosengren2006Solution).

The B-chain is essential for receptor binding, with key residues like Arg B16 and Trp B27 forming the receptor binding surface (Rosengren2006Solution). The protein is highly dynamic, with disordered termini and conformational exchange in the core (Rosengren2006Solution).

## Function
INSL3 (insulin-like 3) is a peptide hormone primarily produced by Leydig cells in the testes and plays a crucial role in male reproductive physiology. It is involved in the development of the gubernaculum ligament, which is essential for the transabdominal phase of testicular descent during fetal development. This process is vital for the proper positioning of the testes, and disruptions can lead to cryptorchidism, a condition where the testes fail to descend properly (Ivell2009Biology; EstebanLopez2020Diverse).

In adults, INSL3 is a marker of Leydig cell differentiation and is involved in maintaining spermatogenesis. It acts through the RXFP2 receptor, which is expressed on Leydig cells and post-meiotic germ cells, but not on Sertoli cells. INSL3 has an anti-apoptotic role, protecting germ cells from apoptosis, which is crucial for sustaining male fertility (Ivell2009Biology).

Beyond its reproductive functions, INSL3 is also implicated in bone metabolism. It influences osteoblast activity by stimulating genes involved in bone mineralization and structure, such as COL1A1 and osteonectin, and modulates osteoclastogenesis through the RXFP2 receptor. This activity is important for maintaining bone density and structure, suggesting a broader physiological role for INSL3 in bone health (Ferlin2011Profiling).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the INSL3 gene are associated with several reproductive disorders, primarily cryptorchidism, a condition characterized by undescended testes. Specific single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in the INSL3 gene, such as those at genomic sites c.126, c.178, and c.*263, have been linked to severe forms of cryptorchidism. The missense polymorphism c.178A > G, which results in an amino acid change, can affect the protein's function and its interaction with its receptor, potentially leading to embryonic testosterone insufficiency (Sinopidis2019Novel). 

Mutations in INSL3, such as P93L, R102C, and R102H, have been associated with testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS), infertility, and seminoma. These mutations may not directly alter INSL3 function but could influence hormone processing or protein stability, contributing to conditions like cryptorchidism and testicular cancer (Ferlin2006Insulinlike). 

Environmental factors, such as exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, can also reduce INSL3 expression, leading to reproductive development disruptions, including cryptorchidism (Ivell2022Expression). In females, abnormal INSL3 levels have been linked to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), suggesting a role in follicle arrest and anovulation (EstebanLopez2020Diverse).

## Interactions
INSL3 interacts primarily with the RXFP2 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, to mediate its biological effects. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the classical adenylyl cyclase (AC) pathway, leading to increased production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) (EstebanLopez2020Diverse). The binding of INSL3 to RXFP2 involves specific structural domains of the receptor. The B-chain of INSL3 binds to high-affinity sites in the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of RXFP2, while the A-chain binds to low-affinity sites in the transmembrane (TM) domain (Bathgate2012The; EstebanLopez2020Diverse). 

Mutations in specific residues of the LRR domain can affect receptor expression and binding, highlighting the importance of these interactions for receptor activation (EstebanLopez2020Diverse). Additionally, INSL3 can also interact with the LGR8 receptor, which is important for testis descent. This interaction similarly leads to increased cAMP production, confirming the specificity of INSL3 for its receptor targets (Kumagai2002INSL3Leydig). 

INSL3 does not directly interact with nucleic acids, but it influences gene expression through signaling pathways such as the MAPK cascade in osteoblasts, affecting the expression of various osteoblast markers (Ferlin2011Profiling).
