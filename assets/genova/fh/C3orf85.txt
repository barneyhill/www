# C3orf85

## Overview
C3orf85 is a gene located on chromosome 3 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 3 open reading frame 85. This protein is categorized as an uncharacterized protein, meaning its specific biological functions and roles within cellular processes are not yet fully understood. Despite the limited information available, studies suggest that C3orf85 may be involved in various cellular pathways and could have implications in certain physiological or pathological conditions. Further research is necessary to elucidate the precise functions and interactions of the C3orf85 protein, as well as its potential clinical significance.
