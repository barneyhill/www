# IFT56

## Overview
IFT56 is a gene that encodes the protein intraflagellar transport 56, which is a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically within the IFT-B complex. This protein plays a significant role in the anterograde transport of proteins along cilia, which are essential for various developmental processes such as organogenesis and neural patterning. IFT56 is integral to the proper functioning and structural integrity of the IFT-B complex, facilitating the accumulation of key signaling proteins like Gli2 and Gli3 at the ciliary tips, which are vital for Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathways. The protein is known to interact with other components of the IFT-B complex, such as IFT46, and is involved in the recruitment of motility factors into cilia. Mutations in the IFT56 gene can lead to developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in vertebrate development and ciliary function (Katoh2016Overall; Xin2017IFT56).

## Function
IFT56, also known as TTC26, Dyf-13, or Piftc3, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically as part of the IFTB complex. This complex is essential for the anterograde transport of proteins within cilia, which are vital organelles involved in various developmental processes, including left-right specification, organogenesis, and neural patterning (Xin2017IFT56). IFT56 is necessary for maintaining the integrity and function of the IFTB complex, ensuring the proper accumulation of Gli2 and Gli3 proteins at the distal tips of cilia. These proteins are critical for Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling, a pathway important for limb and neural tube development (Xin2017IFT56).

In Ift56 hop mutants, which lack functional IFT56, there are defects in Shh-dependent patterning and abnormal ciliary microtubule arrangement, although primary cilia can still form. These defects highlight the essential role of IFT56 in ciliary function and vertebrate development (Xin2017IFT56). IFT56 also interacts with IFT46 and is required for the trafficking of motility factors into cilia/flagella, affecting the localization of other IFTB components like IFT27 (Xin2017IFT56).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFT56 gene are associated with several developmental disorders, primarily due to its role in maintaining the integrity of the intraflagellar transport B (IFTB) complex and ciliary microtubule architecture. One notable condition linked to IFT56 mutations is preaxial polydactyly, characterized by the presence of an extra digit on the anterior side of the limbs. This condition arises from disruptions in Gli-Activator (GliA) and Gli-Repressor (GliR) functions, which are crucial for Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling, a pathway essential for limb and neural tube patterning (Xin2017IFT56).

The Ift56 hop mutation, a nonsense mutation leading to a truncated IFT56 protein, results in defects in cilia formation or function, contributing to reduced Shh signaling and abnormal ciliary microtubule arrangement. This mutation also causes gait abnormalities and male sterility in mice, highlighting the gene's role in broader developmental processes (Xin2017IFT56).

While the Ift56 hop phenotype is relatively mild compared to other IFTB mutants, it underscores the importance of IFT56 in ciliary function and its potential link to various human ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by ciliary dysfunction (Xin2017IFT56).

## Interactions
IFT56, also known as TTC26, is a component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT)-B complex, where it primarily interacts with IFT46. This interaction is robust, suggesting that IFT56 is part of the core subcomplex, although it is not essential for the assembly of the overall core subcomplex (Katoh2016Overall). IFT56's interaction with IFT46 has been confirmed through yeast-2-hybrid analysis and pull-down assays, indicating its role within the IFT-B1 complex (Taschner2016Intraflagellar).

In addition to its interaction with IFT46, IFT56 is implicated in the recruitment of motility complexes to cilia, potentially interacting with IFT70, although this interaction has not been experimentally verified due to difficulties in expressing IFT56 as a soluble protein (Petriman2022Biochemically). IFT56 is also part of the IFT-B core-2 subcomplex, which interacts with the IFT-A complex, although specific details of these interactions are not well-documented (Kobayashi2021Cooperation).

Furthermore, IFT56 interacts with ANKRD55, particularly forming a pair with IFT46, as demonstrated by visible immunoprecipitation assays (Mena2024ANKRD55). This interaction highlights the importance of the IFT46-IFT56 pair in the IFT-B complex.
