# KIR2DL4

## Overview
KIR2DL4 is a gene that encodes the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor, two Ig domains and long cytoplasmic tail 4, a unique receptor primarily expressed in natural killer (NK) cells and a subset of T cells. This receptor is distinguished by its structural features, including two immunoglobulin-like domains and a long cytoplasmic tail, which contribute to its atypical signaling properties compared to other members of the KIR family. Unlike most KIRs that signal from the cell surface, KIR2DL4 predominantly localizes in endosomes, where it mediates cytokine secretion without inducing cytotoxicity. The receptor's interaction with its known ligand, HLA-G, plays a crucial role in immune modulation, particularly during early pregnancy, by promoting a proinflammatory and proangiogenic response necessary for maternal vascular remodeling. KIR2DL4's unique signaling and interaction capabilities underscore its significance in immune regulation and its potential implications in various clinical conditions, including pregnancy-related disorders and immune responses to infections (Faure2002KIR2DL4; Rajagopalan2012KIR2DL4).

## Structure
KIR2DL4 is a unique member of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor family, characterized by its distinct molecular structure. The protein features two immunoglobulin-like domains, D0 and D2, arranged with an acute elbow angle, which is atypical compared to other KIRs that usually have a D1 domain (Moradi2015The). The D0 domain contains eight β-strands and two 3_10 helices, while the D2 domain comprises ten β-strands and an additional short D strand (Moradi2015The). A unique disulfide bond between Cys 10 and Cys 28 in the D0 domain contributes to its distinct conformation (Moradi2015The).

KIR2DL4's quaternary structure is notable for its ability to form tetramers through self-association mediated by the D0 domain, which is concentration-dependent (Moradi2015The). This tetrameric assembly is facilitated by van der Waals contacts and a hydrophobic core involving key residues such as Phe 9, Ser 11, and Trp 13 (Moradi2015The). The protein also has two glycosylation sites at Asn 118 and Asn 152, with the latter being conserved across KIR genes (Moradi2015The). These structural features contribute to KIR2DL4's unique functional properties and ligand interactions.

## Function
KIR2DL4 is a unique member of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family, primarily expressed in natural killer (NK) cells and a subset of T cells. Unlike other KIRs, KIR2DL4 is predominantly localized in endosomes rather than on the cell surface, where it signals for cytokine secretion without inducing cytotoxicity (Rajagopalan2012KIR2DL4). The receptor is involved in the activation of NK cells through endosomal signaling, which is distinct from other KIRs that signal from the cell surface. This signaling involves the phosphorylation of Akt, regulated by DNA-PKcs, leading to the activation of NF-κB and resulting in a proinflammatory and proangiogenic response (Rajagopalan2012KIR2DL4).

KIR2DL4's only known ligand is HLA-G, expressed by fetal trophoblast cells during early pregnancy. This interaction supports a proinflammatory and proangiogenic response, contributing to the remodeling of maternal vasculature (Rajagopalan2012KIR2DL4). The receptor's engagement results in the activation of NK cells for cytokine and chemokine secretion, particularly IFN-γ, without promoting cytotoxicity (Rajagopalan2001Cutting). This function is crucial during early pregnancy, where it aids in vascular remodeling through its interaction with soluble HLA-G (Rajagopalan2012KIR2DL4).

## Clinical Significance
KIR2DL4 is implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in immune regulation. Alterations in KIR2DL4 expression or function have been associated with preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related condition. While KIR2DL4 alleles alone do not show a direct association with preeclampsia, specific combinations of maternal and fetal alleles, such as maternal KIR2DL4*006 with fetal HLA-G*0106, may increase the risk in multigravid pregnancies (Tan2009Possible). 

The gene's polymorphisms, particularly in exon 6, intron 6, and exon 7, may influence susceptibility to diseases like cancer or viral infections by affecting NK cell functions (Witt2000Detection). KIR2DL4's interaction with HLA-G is contentious, but it is suggested to play a role in immune modulation during pregnancy (Tan2009Possible). 

In the context of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection, KIR2DL4 copy number variation (CNV) is linked to CD4+ T-cell depletion and NK cell functionality, indicating its potential impact on immune response and disease progression (Hellmann2013KIR2DL4Copy). These findings highlight the gene's significance in immune-related conditions and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
KIR2DL4 is known for its interactions with various proteins, playing a dual role in immune signaling. The cytoplasmic tail of KIR2DL4 can bind to SHP-1 and SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatases when phosphorylated, similar to other inhibitory KIRs, indicating its potential for inhibitory signaling (Faure2002KIR2DL4). Despite having a single immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), KIR2DL4 can also activate NK cells, leading to cytokine and chemokine secretion (Rajagopalan2012KIR2DL4).

KIR2DL4 interacts with the Fc receptor γ (FcRγ) protein, which enhances its surface expression and functional responses in NK cells. This association is crucial for signal transduction, as demonstrated by increased surface expression and Ca2+ mobilization in co-transduced cell lines (KikuchiMaki2005Cutting). The interaction with FcRγ supports KIR2DL4's activating function, particularly in IL-2-activated NK cells (KikuchiMaki2005Cutting).

While KIR2DL4 has been reported to bind HLA-G, this interaction is disputed, with some studies showing no significant binding to HLA-G or other HLA molecules (Moradi2015The). The receptor's unique structure and oligomerization properties suggest potential interactions with non-HLA ligands, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans (Moradi2015The).
