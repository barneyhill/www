# CCDC148

## Overview
The CCDC148 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 148 protein, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the CCDC148 protein may play a role in cellular processes that require such interactions. Although the specific biological functions of the CCDC148 protein are not fully understood, it has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including childhood apraxia of speech and musculoskeletal symptoms associated with aromatase inhibitor therapy. The gene is located on chromosome 2q24.1, and alterations in this region have been associated with developmental and congenital conditions, indicating a potential, albeit not fully elucidated, role in human health and disease (AlHassnan2018Identification; Laffin2012Novel; Hertz2022Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC148 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, although its precise role remains unclear. In a study on childhood apraxia of speech (CAS), a deletion at 2q24.1 involving the CCDC148 gene was identified in a participant who also had a likely pathogenic FOXP2 mutation. This suggests a potential contributory role of CCDC148 in the FOXP2-associated phenotype, which includes speech delay, microcephaly, and intellectual and developmental disabilities (Laffin2012Novel).

Another study identified an intronic variant, rs79048288, within the CCDC148 gene, which was associated with a 4.4-fold higher risk of aromatase inhibitor-induced musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS). However, the functional impact of this variant is not well understood, and its clinical significance remains uncertain due to the lack of functional evidence (Hertz2022Genomewide).

In a case study of a patient with congenital heart disease and developmental delays, a deletion on chromosome 2q24.1, including CCDC148, was noted. The clinical significance of CCDC148 in this context was not directly addressed, but it was part of a larger genomic imbalance (AlHassnan2018Identification). These findings highlight the need for further research to elucidate the clinical implications of CCDC148 alterations.
