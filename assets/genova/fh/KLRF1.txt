# KLRF1

## Overview
KLRF1, or killer cell lectin-like receptor F1, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the killer cell lectin-like receptor family. This protein is primarily expressed in natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cells, where it plays a pivotal role in modulating immune responses. The KLRF1 protein is characterized by its C-type lectin-like domain, which is involved in recognizing specific ligands on target cells, thereby influencing cytotoxic responses. Notably, the protein contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory-like motifs (ITIMs) within its cytoplasmic domain, suggesting a potential inhibitory function in immune cell signaling. KLRF1 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune surveillance and the regulation of immune cell activity, and has been associated with several diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and certain cancers (Truong2019Killerlike; Sun2024The; RodaNavarro2000HumanKLRF1).

## Structure
The KLRF1 protein is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 26.5 kDa, consisting of 231 amino acids. Its structure includes a 42-amino acid cytoplasmic region, a 23-amino acid transmembrane segment, and a 166-amino acid extracellular region that features a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) (RodaNavarro2000HumanKLRF1). The extracellular domain contains four potential N-glycosylation sites, indicating that the protein may undergo glycosylation as a post-translational modification (RodaNavarro2000HumanKLRF1). 

The KLRF1 protein shares structural similarities with other members of the killer cell lectin-like receptor family, such as the presence of six invariant cysteine residues that form intrachain disulfide bonds, and the tryptophan/isoleucine/glycine/leucine (WIGL) motif. However, it lacks the conserved calcium-binding residues and hydrophobic residues typically found in sugar-binding C-type lectins, suggesting it may not bind sugars in the same manner (RodaNavarro2000HumanKLRF1). 

The cytoplasmic domain of KLRF1 contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory-like motifs (ITIMs), which suggest a potential inhibitory function in immune cell signaling (RodaNavarro2000HumanKLRF1). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two major mRNA variants, one of which lacks a 150-bp fragment corresponding to the stalk exon (RodaNavarro2000HumanKLRF1).

## Function
The KLRF1 gene encodes a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the killer cell lectin-like receptor family. It is primarily expressed in natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells, particularly CD4+ memory T cells. KLRF1 is involved in the regulation of immune responses, playing a crucial role in immune surveillance by recognizing and binding to specific ligands on target cells, which can lead to the activation of cytotoxic responses (Truong2019Killerlike; RodaNavarro2000HumanKLRF1).

In CD4+ memory T cells, KLRF1 expression is associated with a decline in cytokine production potential, indicating its role in the terminal differentiation and exhaustion of these cells. This suggests that KLRF1 may have an inhibitory function in CD4+ T cell activation, although this requires further investigation (Truong2019Killerlike). The expression of KLRF1 is acquired at a late stage in memory T-cell differentiation, marking a stage of reduced cytokine production potential (Truong2019Killerlike).

KLRF1 is also expressed in NK cells, where it is hypothesized to be involved in inhibitory signaling, potentially interacting with class I molecules. The presence of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory-like motifs (ITIMs) within its cytoplasmic tail supports this potential inhibitory role (RodaNavarro2000HumanKLRF1).

## Clinical Significance
KLRF1, or killer cell lectin-like receptor F1, has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), KLRF1 is identified as a hub gene involved in immune dysregulation. Its expression is downregulated in SLE, suggesting a role in the shared pathogenesis of these autoimmune conditions (Sun2024The). 

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), KLRF1 is highly expressed in CD8+ T cells, which are driven into a senescent effector memory phenotype. This suggests that KLRF1 may contribute to the immune response processes in CLL, potentially impacting disease progression (Göthert2013Expanded).

In bladder cancer, KLRF1 expression is significantly lower in new positive cases compared to recurrent cases, indicating a potential role in cancer progression or recurrence (Elamin2020A). 

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), higher expression levels of KLRF1 are associated with better responses to anti-PD-1 therapy, suggesting its involvement in the effectiveness of immune checkpoint therapies (Chen2021Immune‑related). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of KLRF1 in various diseases, particularly in the context of immune system regulation and cancer.

## Interactions
KLRF1, a member of the killer cell lectin-like receptor family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence immune cell activity. It is expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes, where it plays a role in modulating immune responses through inhibitory signaling pathways. The cytoplasmic tail of KLRF1 contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory-like motifs (ITIMs), which are indicative of its potential inhibitory function. These ITIMs can recruit phosphatases such as SHP-1, which are involved in the inhibition of activation pathways in NK cells and monocytes (RodaNavarro2000HumanKLRF1).

KLRF1 is genetically linked to the AICL (CLEC2B) ligand, suggesting a potential interaction that may influence NK cell activity (Kirkham2014Complexity). However, specific details on the physical interactions between KLRF1 and other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the available literature. The gene's expression in immune cells and its structural features suggest a role in immune regulation, but further research is needed to fully elucidate its interaction partners and functional mechanisms (RodaNavarro2000HumanKLRF1).
