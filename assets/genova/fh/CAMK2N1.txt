# CAMK2N1

## Overview
CAMK2N1 is a gene that encodes the protein calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1, which functions as a specific inhibitor of the enzyme calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). CaMKII is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, synaptic plasticity, and memory formation. The CAMK2N1 protein is primarily localized in cell junctions and synapses, where it modulates CaMKII activity, thereby influencing cellular responses to calcium fluctuations and maintaining cellular homeostasis. This regulation is crucial for controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis, highlighting the gene's significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, such as cancer (Wu2019MiR‐129‐5p; Wang2014The; Xu2019MicroRNA532).

## Function
CAMK2N1 encodes a protein that functions as an inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, CAMK2N1 is localized in the cell junctions and synapses, where it acts as a potent and specific inhibitor of CaMKII. This inhibition plays a crucial role in regulating cell-cycle progression by deactivating MEK/ERK kinase activity and promoting the accumulation of the p27 protein, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. This regulation is essential for controlling the cell cycle and apoptosis (Wu2019MiR‐129‐5p; Wang2014The).

In normal prostate tissue, CAMK2N1 is distributed throughout the cell, with stronger staining observed in the nucleus compared to the cytoplasm, suggesting its involvement in normal cellular processes (Wang2014The). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm and nucleus impacts cellular responses to calcium fluctuations, influencing processes such as synaptic plasticity and memory formation. CAMK2N1's role as a CaMKII inhibitor highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Wang2014The; Xu2019MicroRNA532).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAMK2N1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), hypermethylation of CAMK2N1 is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. This methylation leads to downregulation of CAMK2N1 expression, contributing to tumor aggressiveness and chemoresistance (Häfner2015RUNX3). CAMK2N1 methylation is also linked to shorter survival times in EOC patients, serving as a potential prognostic marker (Häfner2015RUNX3).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), CAMK2N1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is inversely related to the levels of miR-182-5p, a microRNA that promotes OSCC cell proliferation by downregulating CAMK2N1. This interaction highlights the role of CAMK2N1 in inhibiting tumor growth and suggests that its dysregulation can contribute to cancer progression (Li2018miR1825p).

In prostate cancer, CAMK2N1 expression is suppressed by PRMT5, an oncogene that inhibits its transcription through histone methylation. This suppression is associated with poor progression-free survival, indicating that CAMK2N1 downregulation may facilitate cancer progression (Yao2022The).

## Interactions
CAMK2N1, also known as CaMKIIN, is a protein that interacts with the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to inhibit its activity. This interaction is characterized by CAMK2N1 binding to the CaMKII kinase domain, where it affects binding affinity and specificity. Key residues such as E96 and W214 on the CaMKII kinase domain play significant roles in facilitating this binding. Mutation of these residues can significantly disrupt the interaction, highlighting their importance in maintaining the binding affinity of CAMK2N1 to CaMKII (Özden2020CaMKII).

CAMK2N1 also interacts with a hydrophobic pocket on the CaMKII kinase domain, involving a conserved leucine at the -5 position, which fits into a pocket formed by residues F98, I101, V102, and I205. This interaction stabilizes the helical motif of CAMK2N1, which is crucial for its proper orientation and binding to CaMKII (Özden2020CaMKII).

In addition to its role in inhibiting CaMKII, CAMK2N1 is involved in the regulation of synaptic signaling. It interacts with the catalytic domain of CaMKII in the presence of calmodulin, inhibiting its activity in a noncompetitive manner, which suggests a regulatory role in CaMKII-mediated synaptic signaling (Ling2010Spatiotemporal).
