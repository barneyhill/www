# HPD

## Overview
The HPD gene encodes the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, which is a key component in the catabolism of the amino acid tyrosine. This enzyme is categorized as a dioxygenase and is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisate, a critical step in the tyrosine degradation pathway. The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining normal tyrosine levels and preventing the accumulation of toxic intermediates, which can lead to metabolic disorders. Structurally, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase is characterized by a complex molecular architecture, including a non-heme iron center crucial for its catalytic function. It typically forms homodimers or homotetramers, enhancing its enzymatic efficiency. The enzyme is predominantly active in the liver and kidneys, where it contributes to energy production and detoxification processes. Mutations in the HPD gene are linked to metabolic disorders such as tyrosinemia type III and hawkinsinuria, highlighting its clinical significance (Frick2014Structural; Ghosh2021Biallelic; Neve2003Tissue).

## Structure
The human 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD) enzyme is involved in the catabolism of tyrosine and is characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of HPD consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the HPD gene, forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the enzyme's stability and function. The tertiary structure of HPD results in a compact, globular shape, which is essential for its catalytic activity. This structure contains a non-heme iron center, crucial for the enzyme's function in catalyzing the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisate (Frick2014Structural; Neve2003Tissue).

HPD typically forms homodimers or homotetramers, which are part of its quaternary structure, allowing for efficient enzymatic activity (Frick2014Structural). The enzyme's active site is located in the C-terminal domain, which is conserved across species and plays a significant role in substrate binding and catalysis (Neve2003Tissue). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate HPD activity, although specific details on these modifications in humans are not extensively documented (Neve2003Tissue). The enzyme is also associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes, potentially through an adapter protein, despite lacking typical membrane-targeting signals (Neve2003Tissue).

## Function
The HPD gene encodes the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of the amino acid tyrosine. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisate, a key step in the tyrosine degradation pathway (Neve2003Tissue; Endo1995A). This process involves decarboxylation, oxidation, and rearrangement, and is essential for maintaining normal tyrosine levels in the body by preventing the accumulation of toxic intermediates (da2006Fungal; Neve2003Tissue).

In healthy human cells, HPD is primarily active in the liver and kidneys, where it contributes to energy production and detoxification processes (Neve2003Tissue; Endo1995A). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the conversion of tyrosine into fumarate and acetoacetate, which are further metabolized in the citric acid cycle for energy production (Shan20194hydroxyphenylpyruvate). HPD is associated with the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, suggesting its involvement in cellular processes related to these organelles (Neve2003Tissue). Proper functioning of HPD is vital for preventing metabolic disorders such as tyrosinemia (Ghosh2021Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HPD gene, which encodes the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, are associated with two primary metabolic disorders: tyrosinemia type III and hawkinsinuria. Tyrosinemia type III is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by elevated blood tyrosine levels and excessive excretion of its derivatives in urine. This condition results from a deficiency in HPD activity, leading to symptoms such as mild mental retardation, ataxia, and convulsions (Endo2003Animal; Tomoeda2000Mutations). A specific homozygous missense mutation, C803T, resulting in an alanine to valine change at codon 268 (A268V), has been identified in patients with this disorder (Tomoeda2000Mutations).

Hawkinsinuria is an autosomal dominant condition marked by transient metabolic acidosis and tyrosinemia, with symptoms improving within the first year of life. Patients continue to excrete the hawkinsin metabolite in urine throughout their lives. A heterozygous missense mutation causing an alanine to threonine substitution at codon 33 (A33T) has been associated with hawkinsinuria (Endo2003Animal; Tomoeda2000Mutations). The condition is characterized by failure to thrive and diminished activity due to metabolic acidosis (Thodi2016Hawkinsinuria). These findings suggest that the HPD gene may not be strictly autosomal recessive, providing new insights into the pathogenesis of these conditions (Zhao2020Variant).

## Interactions
4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD) is involved in several protein interactions that regulate its stability and function. HPD interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase PELI1, which facilitates its polyubiquitylation and subsequent degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of threonine 382 (T382) on HPD, a modification mediated by the serine/threonine protein kinase STK33. The phosphorylated T382 is recognized by the FHA domain of PELI1, promoting HPD degradation (Xie2019HPD).

The molecular chaperone TTC36 plays a regulatory role by blocking the binding of PELI1 to HPD, thereby preventing its polyubiquitylation and degradation. Depletion of TTC36 enhances the interaction between PELI1 and HPD, as well as between STK33 and HPD, leading to increased degradation of HPD. Conversely, overexpression of TTC36 reduces these interactions, stabilizing HPD levels (Xie2019HPD).

These interactions are crucial for maintaining HPD levels and preventing conditions such as tyrosinemia and associated neurological disorders. The TTC36-STK33-PELI1 signaling axis is a key regulatory mechanism controlling HPD stability through phosphorylation and ubiquitination processes (Xie2019HPD).
