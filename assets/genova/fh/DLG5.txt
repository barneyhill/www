# DLG5

## Overview
DLG5 is a gene that encodes the discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 5, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. This protein functions primarily as a scaffold protein, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling and maintaining cell polarity. It is characterized by multiple domains, including PDZ, SH3, and GUK domains, which facilitate its interactions with various signaling pathways, notably the Hippo and Hedgehog pathways. DLG5 is involved in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation by modulating the activity of key signaling components such as MST1/2 and LATS1/2. The protein's interactions at cell junctions contribute to the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells, making it essential for tissue morphogenesis and development. Variations in the DLG5 gene have been linked to several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and ciliopathy-related conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Stoll2004Genetic; Kwan2016DLG5).

## Structure
The DLG5 protein is a large multidomain member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, characterized by several distinct domains that facilitate its role in cellular signaling and scaffolding. It contains a CARD domain, a coiled-coil domain, four PDZ domains, and SH3 and GUK domains, which are indicative of its scaffolding and signaling functions (Kwan2016DLG5). The third PDZ domain is particularly noted for its strong binding to MST1/2, components of the Hippo signaling pathway, although this interaction alone is not sufficient to inhibit the pathway, suggesting the involvement of other domains in regulatory functions (Kwan2016DLG5).

The DLG5 protein also features a single repeat unit of the Regulator of Chromosomal Chromatin (RCC1) domain, which is involved in chromatin binding and gene regulation, starting at base pair 4333 (Shah2002The). Additionally, it has a prenyl group-binding site (CAAX box) starting at base pair 5536, which is involved in post-translational modification and intracellular signal transduction (Shah2002The). The presence of two leucine zippers suggests potential protein-protein interactions (Shah2002The). DLG5 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, contributing to its functional diversity. The gene also has splice variant isoforms, which further diversify its functional roles (Kwan2016DLG5).

## Function
The DLG5 gene encodes a protein that is part of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, which plays a significant role in maintaining cell polarity and regulating cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. DLG5 functions as a scaffold protein, facilitating interactions between various proteins involved in the Hippo signaling pathway, a critical regulator of organ size and cell growth (Kwan2016DLG5). 

DLG5 negatively regulates the Hippo signaling pathway by interacting with core components such as MST1/2 and LATS1/2, inhibiting their kinase activity. This regulation is crucial for maintaining proper levels of YAP and TAZ proteins, which are transcriptional co-activators involved in cell growth and differentiation (Kwan2016DLG5). The protein also interacts with MARK3, enhancing its role as a negative regulator of the Hippo pathway (Kwan2016DLG5).

In healthy human cells, DLG5 is involved in intracellular signaling and is active at cell junctions, contributing to the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells (Shah2002The). Its role in maintaining cell polarity and signaling is essential for tissue morphogenesis and development (Kwan2016DLG5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the DLG5 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, has been linked to genetic variations in DLG5. Specific variants, such as DLG5_e26 and rs1058198, are undertransmitted in individuals with IBD, suggesting a protective effect, while the 113A variant is overtransmitted, indicating an increased risk (Stoll2004Genetic). The DLG5 gene is also implicated in multiple congenital anomalies related to ciliopathy phenotypes. Variants in DLG5 have been identified in patients with conditions such as cystic kidneys, hydrocephalus, and congenital heart disease, highlighting its role in cilia function and structure (Marquez2020DLG5).

DLG5 is part of the CARD interaction network, and its mutations can affect signaling pathways like Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), leading to developmental issues such as hydrocephalus and cystic fibrosis (Sakthinathan2024An). The gene's involvement in maintaining cell structure and signaling pathways also links it to cancer susceptibility due to its role in cell adhesion and signaling (Friedrichs2008The). These findings underscore the gene's clinical significance in various pathologies.

## Interactions
DLG5 is involved in several key protein interactions, particularly within the Hippo and Hedgehog signaling pathways. In the Hippo pathway, DLG5 interacts with MST1/2 and Salvador (SAV1), core components of the pathway, through its third PDZ domain. This interaction inhibits the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for cellular self-renewal and differentiation (Kwan2016DLG5). DLG5 also acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating interactions between MST1/2 and MARK3, leading to the inhibition of MST1/2 kinase activity (Kwan2016DLG5).

In the Hedgehog signaling pathway, DLG5 interacts with Smoothened (Smo) and Kif7. The interaction with Smo is mediated by the PDZ4 and GK domains of DLG5 and is enhanced upon Hedgehog pathway activation. This interaction is crucial for the activation of Gli proteins, particularly Gli2, at the ciliary tip (Chong2015Bifurcating). DLG5 also interacts with Kif7, contributing to the accumulation of Gli2 and Kif7 in the cilium, which is essential for Gli activation (Chong2015Bifurcating).

DLG5 is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system through its interaction with β-TrCP, a substrate recruiting subunit of the SCF complex. This interaction influences the stability and ubiquitination of DLG5 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Wang2019βTrCPmediated).
