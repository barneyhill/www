# CEACAM6

## Overview
Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6) is a gene that encodes the CEA cell adhesion molecule 6, a glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in cell adhesion processes, playing a crucial role in both homophilic and heterophilic interactions. CEACAM6 is expressed on epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract and neutrophils, contributing to immune responses and cellular communication. It is anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and is highly glycosylated, which influences its functional interactions. CEACAM6 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, due to its altered expression levels and interactions with other cellular and microbial proteins (Thomas2023CEACAMS; Johnson2015Emerging; Kuroki2001Identification).

## Structure
CEACAM6 is a glycoprotein that belongs to the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family and is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein is characterized by an extracellular domain composed of immunoglobulin (Ig) variable-like N-terminal domains followed by C2-type Ig domains. CEACAM6 can have configurations of 6 (A1B1, A2B2, A3B3), 3 (A1B1, A2), or 2 (A1B1) C2-type Ig domains (Rizeq2018Towards). The N-terminal domain is crucial for its adhesion activities, with specific residues such as N27, S32, and L44 being important for homophilic adhesion, and N27, I29, L28, and S32 for heterophilic adhesion with CEACAM8 (Kuroki2001Identification).

CEACAM6 is anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum. This anchor consists of a backbone of N-acetyl-glucosamine, three mannose residues, and ethanolamine bound to a phosphoinositol molecule, which is covalently linked to a glycerolipid moiety within the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (Rizeq2018Towards). The protein is highly glycosylated, a common post-translational modification that influences its function and interactions (Johnson2015Emerging). CEACAM6 is involved in both homophilic and heterophilic adhesion, interacting with other CEACAM family members such as CEACAM8, CEACAM1, and CEA (Kuroki2001Identification).

## Function
CEACAM6 (CEA cell adhesion molecule 6) is a glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion processes, playing a significant role in both homophilic (self-binding) and heterophilic (binding to other molecules) adhesion activities. It is expressed on epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract and on neutrophils, where it contributes to the immune response by facilitating interactions with various bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis (Kuroki2001Identification). The N-domain of CEACAM6 is crucial for its adhesion activities, with specific amino acid residues such as N27, S32, and L44 being key for homophilic adhesion, and N27, I29, L28, and S32 important for heterophilic adhesion with CEACAM8 (Kuroki2001Identification).

CEACAM6 also plays a role in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by neutrophils, contributing to self-defense mechanisms (Kuroki2001Identification). The protein's interactions with bacterial Opa proteins are mediated through its N-domain, which is involved in binding and potentially influencing bacterial adhesion and invasion processes (Virji1999Critical). These interactions are significant for the modulation of immune responses and cellular invasion processes, highlighting CEACAM6's role in maintaining cellular communication and defense in healthy human cells (Virji1996Carcinoembryonic).

## Clinical Significance
CEACAM6 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. Overexpression of CEACAM6 is associated with poor prognosis in several malignancies, including colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, and breast cancers. In colorectal cancer, CEACAM6 overexpression correlates with poor overall and disease-free survival, and its knockdown reduces invasiveness and metastatic potential (Johnson2015Emerging). In gastric cancer, CEACAM6 is linked to increased lymph node metastasis and is associated with advanced TNM stages and higher pathological grades, indicating its role in cancer progression (An2021Carcinoembryonic; Johnson2015Emerging). 

In pancreatic cancer, CEACAM6 expression correlates with tumor stage, metastasis, and post-operative survival (Johnson2015Emerging). CEACAM6 also plays a role in immune evasion in hematologic malignancies, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and multiple myeloma, by acting as an immune checkpoint suppressor (Johnson2015Emerging). 

In inflammatory bowel disease, CEACAM6 expression is increased in conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, where it acts as a receptor for adherent invasive E. coli, contributing to inflammation and altered microbiome (Thomas2023CEACAMS). These findings highlight CEACAM6 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
CEACAM6, also known as CD66c, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It engages in homophilic interactions with itself and heterophilic interactions with other members of the CEACAM family, such as CEACAM5 and CEACAM8, facilitating cell adhesion and immune modulation (Thomas2023CEACAMS). CEACAM6 also interacts with integrin receptors, which are crucial for maintaining tissue architecture and regulating signal transduction, particularly in the context of cancer (Johnson2015Emerging).

In the context of viral infections, CEACAM6 serves as a receptor for the Influenza A virus (IAV) by interacting with the viral neuraminidase (NA) protein. This interaction facilitates the entry of the virus into host cells, as demonstrated by increased viral binding and entry in cells overexpressing CEACAM6 (Rahman2021The). The interaction between CEACAM6 and NA is specific to IAV and does not affect the entry of other viruses, such as the Hepatitis C virus (Rahman2021The).

CEACAM6 also influences adenovirus trafficking within cancer cells by altering cytoskeletal dynamics through the Src pathway, affecting the expression of proteins like tubulin and dynactin (Wang2009CEACAM6).
