# SSX4

## Overview
SSX4 is a gene that encodes the protein SSX family member 4, which is part of the synovial sarcoma X (SSX) breakpoint family. This family of proteins is characterized by their role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. SSX family member 4 is primarily known for its involvement in oncogenic processes, particularly in synovial sarcoma, where it forms part of the SS18-SSX fusion protein due to a specific chromosomal translocation (de2006Thea; Zöllner2015Synovial). Although the SS18-SSX4 fusion is less prevalent than other SS18-SSX fusions, it still plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of this aggressive cancer by altering chromatin structure and gene expression patterns (Zöllner2015Synovial). Understanding the function and interactions of SSX family member 4 is essential for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying synovial sarcoma and developing potential therapeutic strategies (McBride2018The).

## Clinical Significance
SSX4 is implicated in several cancers, most notably synovial sarcoma, a rare and aggressive soft tissue tumor. This cancer is characterized by a specific chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2), which results in the fusion of the SS18 gene with SSX4, among other SSX family members. The resulting SS18-SSX fusion protein plays a critical role in the oncogenic transformation of cells by altering chromatin remodeling and gene expression (de2006Thea; Zöllner2015Synovial). Although SS18-SSX4 fusions are less common compared to SS18-SSX1 and SS18-SSX2, they still contribute to the pathogenesis of synovial sarcoma (Zöllner2015Synovial).

The SS18-SSX fusion protein disrupts normal chromatin remodeling by incorporating into the SWI/SNF complex and competing with wild-type SS18, leading to the ejection of the tumor suppressor INI1. This disruption results in the activation of transcription factors like SOX2, which is associated with proliferation in synovial sarcoma (Zöllner2015Synovial). The fusion protein's interactions with chromatin remodeling complexes suggest a complex role in gene silencing and activation, contributing to the malignancy's development and maintenance (McBride2018The). Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted therapies for synovial sarcoma.
