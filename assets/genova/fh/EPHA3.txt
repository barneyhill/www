# EPHA3

## Overview
EPHA3 is a gene that encodes the EPH receptor A3, a member of the Eph receptor family, which is the largest subgroup of receptor tyrosine kinases. The EphA3 protein functions as a transmembrane receptor involved in cell signaling, playing a pivotal role in mediating cell-cell communication and influencing cellular positioning and movement. This receptor is characterized by its complex structure, including an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a cysteine-rich domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. EphA3 is activated through autophosphorylation upon binding with ephrin ligands, such as ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5, leading to various cellular responses, including cytoskeletal reorganization and cell adhesion or repulsion. The gene is expressed in multiple tissues during development and is implicated in processes like neovascularization and tissue maintenance. Alterations in EPHA3 expression and mutations have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Janes2017EPHA3; Liu2023EPHA3; Qin2024The).

## Structure
The EPHA3 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the Eph receptor family, specifically a receptor tyrosine kinase. The primary structure of the EphA3 protein consists of 983 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of 110.1 kDa. The mature form of the protein is a 135 kDa glycoprotein due to N-glycosylation (Janes2017EPHA3).

The secondary structure includes a signal peptide at the N-terminus (amino acids 1-20) and features such as alpha helices and beta sheets within its domains. The tertiary structure of EphA3 includes an extracellular domain with a ligand-binding domain, a cysteine-rich domain containing complement control protein and EGF-like domains, and two fibronectin type III repeats. The intracellular domain comprises a tyrosine kinase domain and a sterile alpha motif (Janes2017EPHA3; Forse2015Distinctive).

EphA3 functions as a single-pass transmembrane receptor, and its quaternary structure involves dimerization and higher-order clustering upon ligand binding, which is crucial for its signaling functions (Janes2017EPHA3). Post-translational modifications include autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues, particularly Y596, Y602, and Y779, which are essential for its activation and downstream signaling (Shi2010EphA3). The protein also has splice variant isoforms, including a potential soluble form, although its function is not well established (Janes2017EPHA3).

## Function
The EPHA3 gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that is part of the Eph receptor family, which plays a crucial role in cell signaling. EphA3 is involved in bidirectional signaling through its interaction with ephrin ligands, primarily ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5, leading to the formation of receptor-ligand complexes that can trigger various cellular responses, including cytoskeletal reorganization, cell detachment, and cellular repulsion or adhesion (Janes2017EPHA3). In healthy human cells, EphA3 mediates cell-cell communication and influences cell positioning and movement, essential for tissue development and maintenance (Janes2017EPHA3).

EphA3 is characterized by a conserved domain structure, including a ligand-binding domain, a cysteine-rich domain, and a tyrosine kinase domain. Activation of EphA3 involves autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues, which modulates its activity (Janes2017EPHA3). The receptor's function is influenced by interactions with proteins such as the adaptor protein CrkII and the phosphatase PTP1B, which modulate its signaling outcomes (Janes2017EPHA3). EphA3 is expressed in various tissues during development, including the neural system and mesodermally-derived tissues, and plays a role in processes like neovascularization during endometrial regeneration (Janes2017EPHA3).

## Clinical Significance
EPHA3 mutations and alterations in expression levels have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EPHA3 mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis for patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). These mutations correlate with higher tumor mutational burden and neoantigen load, which enhance tumor immunogenicity and potentially improve immunotherapy outcomes. EPHA3 mutations also lead to increased infiltration of immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and NK cells in the tumor microenvironment, indicating a more active immune response (Qin2024The).

In small cell lung cancer (SCLC), EPHA3 expression is linked to multidrug resistance. Knockdown of EPHA3 results in increased chemoresistance through the PI3K/BMX/STAT3 signaling pathway. Conversely, higher EPHA3 expression is associated with better survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Peng2016EPHA3).

In bladder cancer, EPHA3 is downregulated, and higher expression levels are associated with a favorable prognosis. It may act as an anti-oncogene by inhibiting cell growth and promoting apoptosis, potentially through the inhibition of the Ras/pERK1/2 pathway (Liu2023EPHA3).

## Interactions
EPHA3, a member of the Eph receptor family, engages in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with ephrin ligands, such as ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5, forming receptor-ligand dimers and higher-order signaling clusters. These interactions lead to autophosphorylation of EPHA3, initiating intracellular signaling pathways that affect cytoskeletal reorganization and cell adhesion or repulsion (Janes2017EPHA3).

EPHA3 also interacts with the adaptor protein Nck1, which binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue Y602 on EPHA3. This interaction is crucial for regulating cell migration and process retraction. Nck1 acts as a signaling intermediate, linking tyrosine phosphorylation signals to downstream effectors (Hu2009Regulation). The interaction between EPHA3 and Nck1 is essential for ephrin-A5-induced cellular process retraction, with both SH2 and SH3 domains of Nck1 playing significant roles (Hu2009Regulation).

EPHA3 is also regulated by the Hippo-YAP pathway, where YAP1 and TEAD1 bind to transcriptional regulatory elements within the EPHA3 promoter, promoting its expression. This regulation is significant for modulating cell-cell interaction and motility (AlMathkour2022The).
