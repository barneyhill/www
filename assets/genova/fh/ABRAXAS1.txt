# ABRAXAS1

## Overview
ABRAXAS1 is a gene that encodes the protein abraxas 1, a critical subunit of the BRCA1-A complex, which plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage response and repair mechanisms. The protein is categorized as a scaffold protein, facilitating the recruitment and localization of the BRCA1-A complex to sites of DNA damage, thereby maintaining genomic stability. Abraxas 1 is characterized by its structural domains, including a JAMM/MPN-domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a phosphorylated C-terminus, which are essential for its interactions within the complex and with BRCA1. The gene's proper function is crucial for regulating DNA repair pathways, the G2/M checkpoint, and apoptosis, and its mutations have been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer due to disruptions in DNA repair processes (Rabl2020BRCA1A; Bose2019BRCA1; Sachsenweger2023ABRAXAS1).

## Structure
The ABRAXAS1 protein, a component of the BRCA1-A complex, plays a crucial role in DNA damage response. Structurally, ABRAXAS1 contains an N-terminal JAMM/MPN-domain, which is homologous to the JAMM/MPN+ domain but is enzymatically inactive due to the absence of a zinc binding site. This domain is essential for binding to the JAMM/MPN+ domain of BRCC36, thereby activating it (Rabl2020BRCA1A). Following the JAMM/MPN-domain, ABRAXAS1 features a coiled-coil domain and a long, unstructured C-terminus, which ends in a twin phosphorylation site (S404, S406) recognized by the BRCT domain of BRCA1 (Rabl2020BRCA1A).

In terms of quaternary structure, ABRAXAS1 is part of a dimer of hetero-pentamers within the BRCA1-A complex, which includes BRCC36, BRE, MERIT40, and RAP80. This arrangement allows ABRAXAS1 to act as a bivalent ligand, enhancing the binding affinity to BRCA1 (Rabl2020BRCA1A). The interaction between ABRAXAS1 and BRCC36 is mediated by β-sheets, and the coiled-coil domains of ABRAXAS1 and BRCC36 form a helical bundle, contributing to the dimerization of the pentamers (Rabl2020BRCA1A). The phosphorylated C-terminus of ABRAXAS1 provides a high-affinity docking site for BRCA1, crucial for its sequestration away from DNA damage sites (Rabl2019Structural).

## Function
The ABRAXAS1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the DNA damage response and repair pathways in healthy human cells. It is a key component of the BRCA1-A complex, which includes BRCA1, RAP80, MERIT40, BRCC45, and BRCC36. This complex is essential for the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA, a crucial process for maintaining genomic stability (Bose2019BRCA1; Sachsenweger2023ABRAXAS1).

ABRAXAS1 acts as a scaffold within the BRCA1-A complex, facilitating the recruitment of BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage. This is achieved through the recognition of Lys63-linked ubiquitin adducts by RAP80, which helps localize the complex to damaged chromatin (Sachsenweger2023ABRAXAS1). The protein contains several key domains, including a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is crucial for the translocation of the BRCA1-A complex into the nucleus (Bose2019BRCA1).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, ABRAXAS1 is involved in regulating the G2/M checkpoint, apoptosis, and transcription. It helps prevent excessive DNA end-resection by sequestering BRCA1 to the flanks of DSBs, thereby maintaining the balance between different DNA repair pathways (Sachsenweger2023ABRAXAS1). The proper functioning of ABRAXAS1 is vital for preventing genomic instability and potential tumorigenesis (Bose2019BRCA1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABRAXAS1 gene are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, particularly in early-onset cases. Truncating mutations such as c.1106dup and c.577C>T have been identified in German breast cancer patients, leading to disruptions in DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) pathways. These mutations cause a shift in BRCA1 complex formation, promoting low-fidelity repair mechanisms like single-strand annealing (SSA) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), which contribute to genomic instability (Sachsenweger2023ABRAXAS1).

The Finnish ABRAXAS1 founder mutation, c.1082G>A, also demonstrates a hereditary predisposition to breast cancer. This mutation results in decreased BRCA1 protein levels and mislocalization, affecting the DNA damage response and increasing cancer susceptibility (Bose2019BRCA1). The mutation acts in a dominant-negative manner, leading to aberrant DNA damage responses and potentially contributing to cancer development (Bose2019BRCA1).

ABRAXAS1 mutations can lead to impaired BRCA1-A complex formation, affecting the DNA repair process and increasing the risk of breast cancer. These mutations may serve as markers for assessing the pathogenicity of breast cancer risk gene variants (Sachsenweger2023ABRAXAS1).

## Interactions
ABRAXAS1 is a key component of the BRCA1-A complex, interacting with several proteins to facilitate DNA damage response and repair. It directly binds to the BRCA1 BRCT repeats through a phospho-SXXF motif, forming a complex with Rap80, which is essential for DNA damage resistance and repair (Wang2007Abraxas). ABRAXAS1 also interacts with other components of the BRCA1-A complex, including BRCC45, MERIT40, BRCC36, and RAP80, which are crucial for the accumulation of BRCA1 at double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Sachsenweger2023ABRAXAS1).

The interaction between ABRAXAS1 and BRCA1 is phosphorylation-dependent, particularly at serine residues S404 and S406, which are crucial for the formation of a stable BRCA1-BRCT/Abraxas dimer complex at DNA damage sites (Wu2016Structure). This phosphorylation is induced by ionizing radiation and is ATM-dependent, facilitating the recruitment of BRCA1 to DNA damage sites (Wu2016Structure). ABRAXAS1 also plays a role in terminating the DNA damage response via BRCC36-mediated deubiquitinase activity and prevents excessive DNA end-resection by sequestering BRCA1 to the flanks of DSBs (Sachsenweger2023ABRAXAS1). These interactions are crucial for maintaining genome stability and proper execution of homologous recombination repair processes.
