# KRT85

## Overview
KRT85 is a gene that encodes keratin 85, a type II hair keratin protein, which is integral to the structural integrity and mechanical properties of hair and nails. As a member of the keratin family, keratin 85 is categorized as an intermediate filament protein, playing a pivotal role in the formation of the hair shaft and nail structure. The protein is predominantly expressed in the hair follicle, where it forms coiled-coil dimers with type I keratins, contributing to the assembly of intermediate filaments that provide mechanical strength and resilience (Ho2022Update; Chamcheu2011Keratin). Mutations in the KRT85 gene can lead to ectodermal dysplasia, a condition characterized by hair and nail abnormalities, underscoring the gene's clinical significance in maintaining the integrity of these structures (Naeem2005A; Shimomura2010Mutations).

## Structure
The KRT85 gene encodes a type II hair keratin protein, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of hair and nails. The primary structure of KRT85 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which is typical for keratins. The secondary structure predominantly features alpha-helices, a common characteristic of keratin proteins, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers (Ho2022Update). These dimers are essential for the assembly of intermediate filaments, which are critical for the mechanical properties of hair fibers (Duchstein2015Atomistic).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these alpha-helices into a stable conformation, allowing the protein to maintain its structural role. In terms of quaternary structure, KRT85 interacts with other keratin proteins to form stable heterodimers and homodimers, which are integral to the formation of intermediate filaments (Ho2022Update).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can occur in KRT85, influencing filament assembly and stability. These modifications are important for the protein's function in maintaining the resilience and elasticity of keratin fibers (Duchstein2015Atomistic). The presence of cysteine residues in KRT85 allows for the formation of disulfide bonds, further contributing to the protein's structural stability (Duchstein2015Atomistic).

## Function
KRT85, or keratin 85, is a type II hair keratin protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and mechanical properties of hair fibers. It is primarily active in the hair follicle, where it contributes to the formation and resilience of the hair shaft. KRT85 forms part of the intermediate filament network within keratinocytes, providing mechanical strength and support to hair and nails (Chamcheu2011Keratin).

At the molecular level, KRT85 participates in the formation of keratin dimers, specifically pairing with KRT35 to form a coiled-coil structure. This dimerization is essential for the assembly of higher-order keratin structures, which are critical for maintaining the mechanical integrity of hair fibers. The presence of cysteine groups in KRT85 facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, which are vital for the stability and elasticity of the keratin fibers (Duchstein2015Atomistic).

KRT85's role extends beyond structural support, as it is involved in the regulation of keratin expression in response to hormonal changes. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) has been shown to downregulate KRT85 expression, suggesting a link between endocrine regulation and hair keratin expression, which may influence hair shaft abnormalities in thyroid disorders (Ramot2011TSH).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT85 gene are associated with ectodermal dysplasia of the hair and nail type, a congenital disorder characterized by hypotrichosis (sparse hair) and nail dystrophy. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is linked to specific mutations in the KRT85 gene, such as a homozygous missense mutation resulting in an arginine to histidine substitution at position 78 (R78H) (Naeem2005A; Shimomura2010Mutations). This mutation affects a highly conserved region of the gene, potentially destabilizing the coiled-coil structure crucial for intermediate filament assembly, leading to severe phenotypes like complete alopecia and nail dystrophy (Naeem2005A; Chamcheu2011Keratin).

Another mutation, a two-nucleotide deletion in the tail domain of the K85 protein, disrupts filament formation and is associated with severe phenotypes, including complete alopecia and severe nail dystrophy (Yamamoto2021De). These mutations highlight the critical role of KRT85 in maintaining hair and nail integrity, and alterations in its expression or interactions can lead to significant clinical manifestations (Raykova2014Autosomal; Ho2022Update).

## Interactions
KRT85, or keratin 85, is a type II hair keratin that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of hair and nails. It forms heterodimeric complexes with type I keratins, which are essential for the assembly of intermediate filaments (IntFils) in epithelial cells. These heterodimers align to form antiparallel tetramers, which are the building blocks for higher-order IntFil assemblies. The hydrophobic interface between heterodimers, particularly the 'knob-pocket tetramerization mechanism' on type II keratins, is critical for the alignment and assembly of mature IntFils (Ho2022Update).

KRT85 is involved in forming disulfide bonds through cysteine groups, which are significant for the structural integrity and mechanical properties of keratin dimers. These bonds are crucial in maintaining the coiled-coil structure of the keratin dimer, which is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and protein-protein hydrogen bonding (Duchstein2015Atomistic). The presence of cysteine groups in the coil regions facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds between monomers, promoting the connection of dimers to form larger fibers (Duchstein2015Atomistic). These interactions are vital for the mechanical stability and resilience of hair fibers.
