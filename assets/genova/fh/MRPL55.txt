# MRPL55

## Overview
MRPL55 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L55, a crucial component of the large 39S subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a significant role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by participating in the assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome. Despite its low sequence conservation with its yeast homolog, bL31m, MRPL55 shares structural similarities that suggest a conserved function across species (Greber2014The). The protein is characterized by motifs and sequences that facilitate its localization to mitochondria and potential interactions with nucleic acids, indicating a role in mitochondrial rRNA transcription and protein translation (Tselykh2005The). MRPL55 is also involved in forming inter-subunit bridges within the ribosome, essential for its structural integrity and function (Key2023Translation). The presence of conserved phosphorylation sites suggests that MRPL55 may undergo post-translational modifications, which could regulate its activity and interactions within the mitochondrial ribosome (Tselykh2005The).

## Structure
The MRPL55 protein, also known as mitochondrial ribosomal protein L55, is a component of the large 39S subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome. It is homologous to the yeast bL31m protein, despite low sequence conservation, and has been renamed bL31m based on structural similarities (Greber2014The). The protein contains conserved motifs, such as the FDGSTI_ sequence, and features like nuclear localization signals (NLS) and mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTS) (Tselykh2005The). The secondary structure of MRPL55 resembles KOW motif-containing proteins, which are involved in nucleic acid interactions (Tselykh2005The). This suggests a potential role in binding mitochondrial DNA or RNA, contributing to mitochondrial rRNA transcription and protein translation (Tselykh2005The).

MRPL55 is associated with the mitochondrial ribosome and is essential for mitochondrial function. The protein's structure includes a conserved casein kinase II (CKII) site and potential phosphorylation sites, indicating possible post-translational modifications (Tselykh2005The). The protein's tertiary and quaternary structures are not explicitly detailed in the available context, but its localization to mitochondria and association with the ribosomal subunit are well-documented (Tselykh2005The).

## Interactions
MRPL55 is a component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU) and is involved in the assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome. It is part of a mitochondria-specific cluster that connects the mtLSU and the small subunit (mtSSU) via inter-subunit bridges. This cluster serves as a docking site for tRNA Val or tRNA Phe in mitochondria, which is distinct from its bacterial counterpart that binds 5S rRNA (Key2023Translation). 

MRPL55 interacts with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, such as MRPL18, MRPL38, and MRPL46, as part of the mtLSU-CP intermediate assemblies. These interactions are crucial for the proper assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome (Key2023Translation). The protein is also involved in the folding and assembly of tRNA with the mtLSU central protuberance, a process that is regulated by the CLPXP complex. In the absence of CLPP, MRPL55 accumulates significantly, indicating its role in the assembly process and its regulation by CLPXP (Key2023Translation). 

These interactions highlight MRPL55's essential role in mitochondrial translation and its involvement in maintaining mitochondrial function.
