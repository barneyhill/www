# POM121L12

## Overview
POM121L12 is a gene that encodes the protein POM121 transmembrane nucleoporin like 12, which is part of the nucleoporin family. Nucleoporins are integral components of the nuclear pore complex, which regulates the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The POM121L12 protein is characterized by its transmembrane domain, suggesting a role in anchoring or stabilizing the nuclear pore complex within the nuclear envelope. Although the specific functions of POM121L12 are not fully elucidated, its involvement in various cellular processes is suggested by its association with several genetic conditions and diseases. Research has identified mutations and alterations in the POM121L12 gene in contexts such as neuroendocrine tumors, Hirschsprung disease, ossification of spinal ligaments, and basal cell carcinoma, indicating its potential significance in these pathologies (zhai2022Whole; Jayaraman2014Mutational; Bae2016A; Erdrich2018Surgical).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the POM121L12 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of neuroendocrine tumors, a variant of unknown significance (VUS) in POM121L12 was identified in a liver metastasis, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression, although its clinical significance remains unclear (Erdrich2018Surgical). In Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), a genetic disorder affecting the intestinal tract, POM121L12 is located near a significant copy number variation (CNV) locus at 7p12.1, indicating a possible association with the disease, though the exact impact on gene expression or disease mechanism is not fully understood (Bae2016A).

In the study of ossification of spinal ligaments (OSL), POM121L12 was among several genes with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in patients, suggesting a potential genetic contribution to the condition, although specific clinical implications were not detailed (zhai2022Whole). In basal cell carcinoma, POM121L12 was listed among significantly mutated genes, but the clinical relevance of these mutations in cancer development or progression was not specified (Jayaraman2014Mutational). Overall, while POM121L12 is associated with various conditions, further research is needed to elucidate its precise role and clinical significance.
