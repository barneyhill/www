# ZNF248

## Overview
ZNF248 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 248, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which functions primarily as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which enable it to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. ZNF248 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, by modulating the transcription of target genes. It is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it influences chromatin structure and gene expression patterns. The protein contains a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which recruits KAP1, a corepressor that facilitates transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling. ZNF248 has been implicated in immune system regulation and is associated with late-onset asthma in African Americans, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Wang2016Genebased; Helleboid2019The).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF248, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, functions primarily as a transcription factor in healthy human cells. It is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding, allowing it to regulate gene expression by interacting with specific DNA sequences. ZNF248 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, by modulating the transcription of target genes. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences chromatin structure and gene expression patterns, contributing to normal cellular and organismal functions (Wang2016Genebased).

The protein is expressed in a wide range of adult tissues and contains the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which is known to function as a regulatory transcription factor. Although the specific physiological function of ZNF248 in healthy human cells has not been extensively investigated, many KRAB domain-containing zinc finger proteins are known to play important roles in immune system regulation (Wang2016Genebased). The KRAB domain of ZNF248 recruits KAP1, a corepressor that acts as a scaffold for a heterochromatin-inducing complex, suggesting a role in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling (Helleboid2019The).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF248 has been implicated in the development of late-onset asthma (LOA) in African Americans. A study by Wang et al. identified a significant association between ZNF248 and LOA using gene-based analysis with the VEGAS algorithm. This association was observed in two cohorts, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), suggesting that ZNF248 may play a role in the regulation of immune responses related to asthma, particularly in older individuals (Wang2016Genebased). The gene is located at 10p11 and encodes a zinc finger protein with a KRAB domain, which is known to be involved in immune system regulation (Wang2016Genebased).

The study also highlighted that the association of ZNF248 with LOA was specific, as it was weaker in non-LOA cases. The association was further strengthened when accounting for comorbid conditions such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis (Wang2016Genebased). Although no single SNP reached genomewide significance after Bonferroni correction, the gene-based approach provided evidence for ZNF248's involvement in LOA, indicating its potential clinical significance in understanding and treating asthma in older African American populations (Wang2016Genebased).

## Interactions
ZNF248 is a KRAB zinc finger protein that interacts with genomic elements, particularly transposable elements (TEs) and gene transcription start sites (TSS). It is known to bind to L1PA6 and L1PA5 LINE1 integrants, along with other proteins such as ZNF93 and ZNF765. Initially, these proteins acted as inhibitors of transposition, but their continued association with these integrants suggests a shift in function. ZNF248 and its counterparts may no longer effectively block retrotransposition but might still repress transcription without limiting the spread of retrotransposons (Helleboid2019The).

The KRAB domain of ZNF248 recruits KAP1, which serves as a scaffold for a heterochromatin-inducing complex. This interaction is a common feature among KRAB zinc finger proteins, which are involved in repressing transposable elements during early embryogenesis (Helleboid2019The). The study by Helleboid et al. also highlights that while most KZFPs conserved up to placental mammals recruit KAP1, some more ancient KZFPs interact with factors related to genome architecture or RNA processing, indicating a diverse range of interactions beyond transcriptional repression (Helleboid2019The).
