# ANGPTL6

## Overview
ANGPTL6, or angiopoietin-like 6, is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein involved in various physiological processes, including angiogenesis, metabolism, and tissue regeneration. The protein, also known as angiopoietin-related growth factor (AGF), is characterized by an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain, which are essential for its functional roles in the body (Carbone2018AngiopoietinLike; Hato2008The). Unlike other angiopoietin-related proteins, ANGPTL6 does not interact with the TIE1 or TIE2 receptors but may engage with integrins, influencing cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Oike2004Angiopoietinrelated). The protein is primarily secreted by the liver and circulates in the bloodstream, where it plays a crucial role in promoting angiogenesis and regulating metabolic processes, such as counteracting obesity and insulin resistance (Hato2008The; Kitazawa2007AngiopoietinRelated). ANGPTL6's involvement in disease states, including hepatocellular carcinoma and psoriasis, highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Hu2021Use; Tanigawa2016Upregulation).

## Structure
ANGPTL6, also known as angiopoietin-related growth factor (AGF), is a protein characterized by two main structural domains: an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain. These domains are crucial for its function in angiogenesis and metabolism (Carbone2018AngiopoietinLike; Hato2008The). The coiled-coil domain is involved in polymer formation and is essential for regulating lipid metabolism, although its precise role in metabolism is not fully understood (Hato2008The). The fibrinogen-like domain is important for angiogenic activities and is conserved across species, indicating its functional significance (Hostettler2021ANGPTL6).

ANGPTL6 is a secreted glycoprotein, suggesting that it undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which may influence its stability and function (Carbone2018AngiopoietinLike; Hato2008The). The protein is secreted into the systemic circulation, primarily by the liver, and is present in the serum of both mice and humans (Bourcier2018Rare; Hato2008The). While the specific details of its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of these domains and modifications suggests a complex structure that supports its diverse biological roles.

## Function
ANGPTL6, also known as angiopoietin-like 6, is a protein that plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including angiogenesis, metabolism, and tissue regeneration. In healthy human cells, ANGPTL6 is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it influences several cell signaling pathways.

One of the key functions of ANGPTL6 is its role in promoting angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. It enhances the chemotactic activity of endothelial cells, leading to increased microvessel density and neovascularization, as demonstrated in transgenic mouse models (Oike2004Angiopoietinrelated). Unlike other angiopoietin-related proteins, ANGPTL6 does not bind to the TIE1 or TIE2 receptors but may interact with integrins, as it contains an RGD sequence, a common integrin-binding motif (Oike2004Angiopoietinrelated).

In addition to its angiogenic properties, ANGPTL6 is involved in metabolic regulation. It plays a role in counteracting obesity and insulin resistance by suppressing gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Kitazawa2007AngiopoietinRelated). ANGPTL6 also influences mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, particularly in adipose tissue, by modulating the expression of key metabolic genes (Kang2017ANGPTL6).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ANGPTL6 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and psoriasis. In HCC, high levels of ANGPTL6 are associated with an increased risk and poor prognosis. Studies have shown that ANGPTL6 is an independent risk factor for HCC, with higher expression correlating with worse overall survival. Serum ANGPTL6 levels are significantly elevated in HCC patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic marker. The combination of ANGPTL6 with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) improves diagnostic performance for HCC (Hu2021Use; Zuo2022Screening).

In psoriasis, overexpression of ANGPTL6 in keratinocytes leads to psoriasis-like symptoms, such as thickened epidermis and increased inflammation. This is due to the hyper-proliferation of prematurely differentiated keratinocytes and elevated levels of inflammatory proteins. ANGPTL6's role in psoriasis suggests it could be a target for understanding the disease's pathogenesis and developing new therapeutic strategies (Tanigawa2016Upregulation).

ANGPTL6 is also involved in liver metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, where it interacts with a complex of α6 integrin and E-cadherin, promoting metastatic processes (Marchiò2012A).

## Interactions
ANGPTL6, also known as angiopoietin-like 6, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. It is known to interact with integrins and E-cadherin, which are crucial for cell adhesion and signaling. This interaction is particularly significant in the context of cancer metastasis, as it facilitates liver homing and colonization by colorectal cancer cells. An angiopoietin-like 6-mimicking peptide can disrupt this interaction, suggesting a potential antimetastatic role for ANGPTL6 in cancer therapy (Tang2020Mining).

ANGPTL6 also plays a role in activating signaling pathways such as ERK1/2 and AKT, which are essential for endothelial cell migration and tube formation. These pathways are critical for angiogenesis, a process that ANGPTL6 promotes, particularly in alpha-fetoprotein-producing gastric cancer (AFPGC). The activation of these pathways by ANGPTL6 enhances endothelial cell functions, contributing to tumor progression (Chen2019ANGPTL6mediated).

While ANGPTL6 is a proangiogenic factor, it does not bind to the angiopoietin receptors Tie1 or Tie2, distinguishing it from other angiopoietins. Its angiogenic effects are mediated through the ERK1/2-eNOS-NO signaling pathway, which involves the phosphorylation of eNOS and subsequent nitric oxide production (Hato2008The).
