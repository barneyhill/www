# PDLIM5

## Overview
PDLIM5 is a gene that encodes the protein PDZ and LIM domain 5, which is a member of the Enigma family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its PDZ and LIM domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and play a critical role in cellular signaling and structural organization. As a scaffold protein, PDZ and LIM domain 5 is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, neuronal development, and cardiac muscle function. It interacts with multiple proteins, influencing pathways related to synaptic plasticity, muscle cell development, and membrane trafficking. The gene's expression is tissue-specific, with different isoforms present in cardiac and skeletal muscle, as well as in the nervous system. Clinically, PDLIM5 has been implicated in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, cardiovascular diseases like idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and certain cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, where it may serve as a prognostic biomarker (Shi2020PDLIM5; Verdonschot2019Mutations; Huang2020An).

## Structure
PDLIM5, also known as PDZ and LIM domain 5, is a protein characterized by its structural domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions. The protein contains an N-terminal PDZ domain and three C-terminal LIM domains. The PDZ domain, approximately 80-90 amino acids in length, is known for binding to the C-terminus of interacting proteins, forming multi-protein complexes with partners such as membrane-associated proteins and cytoskeletal components (Elkins2010Unusual; Huang2020An). The LIM domains, each about 55 amino acids long, adopt a zinc finger-like structure by coordinating zinc ions, which contributes to the protein's structural stability and its ability to interact with various signaling molecules and cytoskeletal elements (healy2023pdlim; Huang2020An).

PDLIM5 is part of the Enigma family and exhibits tissue-specific expression, with different isoforms present in various tissues. Long isoforms are expressed in multiple tissues, while short isoforms are primarily found in cardiac and skeletal muscle, suggesting distinct functional roles (Huang2020An). The protein's interactions and structural features are crucial for maintaining cell morphology and function, particularly in the context of heart disease and cancer metastasis (Huang2020An).

## Function
PDLIM5, also known as PDZ and LIM domain 5, is a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular and physiological functions. It is involved in cytoskeletal organization, acting as a scaffold protein that links cytoskeletal components with signaling molecules and transcription factors. In the nervous system, PDLIM5 is essential for brain development, neuronal calcium signaling, and the formation of nerve growth cones. It interacts with proteins such as PKC and N-type Ca2+ channels, influencing neuronal differentiation and microfilament remodeling (Ren2015PDLIM5; Huang2020An).

In cardiac muscle, PDLIM5 is located on the z-line of the sarcomere in cardiomyocytes, where it is involved in cardiac development and function. It binds to α-actinin and mediates PKCβ signaling, affecting muscle cell development and promoting cardiomyocyte growth (Huang2020An). In skeletal muscle, PDLIM5 influences myogenesis by affecting the expression of myogenic regulators like MyoD and myogenin (Huang2020An).

PDLIM5 also plays a role in membrane trafficking, particularly at the endosomal compartment, interacting with sorting nexin 17 (SNX17) and influencing the localization of various transmembrane proteins (healy2023pdlim). Its involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function.

## Clinical Significance
The PDLIM5 gene is implicated in several psychiatric and cardiovascular conditions. In the context of psychiatric disorders, polymorphisms in PDLIM5 have been associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Studies have identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PDLIM5 that are linked to schizophrenia, such as rs2433320 and rs2433322, which influence gene expression and nuclear protein binding (Horiuchi2006A; Zain2013Nonsynonymous). Increased expression of PDLIM5 has been observed in the brains of patients with schizophrenia, suggesting a role in genetic susceptibility to the disorder (Horiuchi2006A).

In cardiovascular diseases, PDLIM5 is associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM). Polymorphisms in PDLIM5 have been linked to an increased risk of IDCM, particularly in the Chinese Han population (Wang2019Novel). Mutations in PDLIM5, although rare, may act as disease modifiers in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), potentially affecting cardiac function when combined with other genetic factors (Verdonschot2019Mutations).

In cancer, PDLIM5 is upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is associated with poor prognosis. It interacts with SMAD3, promoting cancer cell migration and invasion by enhancing TGFβ signaling (Shi2020PDLIM5). This suggests that PDLIM5 could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in NSCLC (Shi2020PDLIM5).

## Interactions
PDLIM5, also known as PDZ and LIM domain 5, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling and structural organization. PDLIM5 interacts with the postsynaptic protein SPAR, influencing dendritic spine morphology by promoting spine shrinkage. This interaction requires the LIM2 and LIM3 domains of PDLIM5, which are also involved in binding to protein kinase C (PKC) (Herrick2010Postsynaptic). PDLIM5 can form a complex with SPAR and α-actinin, potentially linking SPAR to the F-actin cytoskeleton, which regulates morphological changes in dendritic spines (Herrick2010Postsynaptic).

PDLIM5 also interacts with PalmD, a protein associated with the cytoskeleton and membrane shaping, to promote dendrite branching. This interaction is crucial for dendritic morphology, as the presence of both proteins is necessary for their effects on dendritic branching (Srivastava2024Role). Additionally, PDLIM5 forms complexes with PKC and N-type Ca2+ channels, influencing nerve growth cone formation and microfilament remodeling (Huang2020An).

These interactions highlight PDLIM5's role as a scaffold protein, facilitating the formation of multiprotein complexes that are essential for synaptic plasticity and cellular functions across various tissues (Srivastava2024Role; Huang2020An).
