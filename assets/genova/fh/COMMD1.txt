# COMMD1

## Overview
COMMD1, or copper metabolism domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including copper homeostasis, protein trafficking, and the regulation of inflammation. The COMMD1 protein is characterized by its two-domain structure, which facilitates its role as a scaffold in forming oligomeric complexes on endosomes. It is a member of the COMM Domain-containing protein family and is known for its involvement in the regulation of NF-kB-mediated transcription, where it promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of NF-kB subunits, thus modulating inflammatory responses. Additionally, COMMD1 plays a crucial role in copper metabolism by influencing the degradation of the copper transporter ATP7B, thereby maintaining copper balance within the cell. The protein's interactions with various cellular components, including those involved in DNA repair, underscore its importance in maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis (Maine2006COMMD1; Burkhead2009COMMD1; Drévillon2011COMMD1Mediated).

## Structure
The COMMD1 protein is characterized by a two-domain structure, consisting of an N-terminal domain (VARD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD). The N-terminal domain, spanning residues 1-121, is entirely α-helical and adopts a compact, monomeric fold. It features a unique arrangement of helices, including an irregular helix (α1), a short helix (α2), and a third helix (α3) bent by almost 90° in the middle. The C-terminal domain, comprising residues 125-190, contains three β-strands and two short α-helices, and is crucial for oligomerization (Sommerhalter2007Solution; Burkhead2009COMMD1).

The CTD is sufficient for forming oligomeric complexes, particularly in the presence of liposomes, and can form dimers through a conserved hydrophobic interface. This domain is also involved in interactions with other proteins and negatively charged phospholipid membranes (Burkhead2009COMMD1; Healy2018Structural).

COMMD1 can form higher-order oligomers, such as tetramers, under non-reducing conditions, and the presence of a single cysteine residue in the CTD allows for disulfide-bond formation, facilitating dimerization under oxidizing conditions (Burkhead2009COMMD1). The protein's structure suggests it acts as a scaffold, forming large oligomeric complexes on endosomes (Burkhead2009COMMD1).

## Function
COMMD1, a member of the COMM Domain-containing protein family, is involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in regulating NF-kB-mediated transcription by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of NF-kB subunits, such as RelA, through a cullin-containing ubiquitin ligase complex. This regulation is crucial for controlling inflammation and immune responses, as it limits the duration of NF-kB-chromatin interactions and terminates NF-kB-mediated transcriptional responses (Maine2006COMMD1; Burstein2005COMMD).

COMMD1 is also involved in copper metabolism, where it influences the degradation of the copper transporter ATP7B, thereby maintaining copper homeostasis (Maine2007COMMD). In addition, COMMD1 is implicated in endosomal membrane trafficking as part of the CCC complex, affecting the recycling and degradation of proteins like CFTR (Healy2018Structural; Drévillon2011COMMD1Mediated).

The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, interacting with various proteins involved in DNA repair, such as CHK2 and BRCA1, indicating its role in maintaining genomic stability through effective DNA repair mechanisms (Suraweera2021COMMD1). These diverse functions highlight COMMD1's importance in cellular homeostasis and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the COMMD1 gene are linked to several diseases and conditions. In Bedlington terriers, a homozygous deletion in the COMMD1 gene causes copper toxicosis, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hepatic copper accumulation, leading to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (Vonk2011LiverSpecific; Kim2016Prevalence). This condition is similar to Wilson's disease in humans, where copper accumulates due to defective copper excretion (van2007Increased).

In humans, COMMD1 is implicated in non-Wilsonian copper storage disorders, although no direct mutations have been identified in these conditions (Vonk2011LiverSpecific). Altered expression of COMMD1 is associated with various cancers, where decreased expression correlates with increased tumor invasion and worse clinical outcomes. This is due to its role in suppressing the NF-κB and HIF pathways, which are involved in tumor progression (van2010COMMD1).

COMMD1 also plays a role in inflammatory processes. Its deficiency can lead to increased NF-κB activity, contributing to inflammation and potentially increasing the risk of colitis-induced tumors (Weiskirchen2021COMMD1). In myeloid-specific COMMD1-deficient mice, there is enhanced liver inflammation, indicating its anti-inflammatory actions (Weiskirchen2021COMMD1).

## Interactions
COMMD1 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as copper homeostasis, protein trafficking, and inflammation. It binds with ATP7B, a copper-transporting ATPase, to regulate copper metabolism, and with the delta epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), inhibiting its function by reducing cell surface expression through ubiquitination (Weiskirchen2021COMMD1). COMMD1 also enhances the surface expression of the Na-K-Cl co-transporter (NKCC1) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) by modulating their ubiquitination (Weiskirchen2021COMMD1).

In the context of NF-kB signaling, COMMD1 interacts with NF-kB subunits, inhibiting NF-kB-mediated transcription by affecting chromatin association rather than nuclear translocation (Maine2007COMMD). It forms complexes with Cullin-Ring-ligases, such as Cul2, and other components like SOCS1, to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of NF-kB subunits (Riera‐Romo2017COMMD1:; Maine2007COMMD).

COMMD1 also interacts with proteins involved in the DNA damage response, such as BRCA1 and CHEK2, suggesting a role in DNA repair processes (Riera‐Romo2017COMMD1:). It forms homo- and heterodimeric complexes with other COMMD proteins through its C-terminal COMM domain, which is crucial for its interactions within the CCC complex and with endosomal membranes (Healy2018Structural).
