# RAB3D

## Overview
RAB3D is a gene that encodes a member of the RAS oncogene family, specifically a small GTP-binding protein known as RAB3D. This protein is categorized as a GTPase and is primarily involved in the regulation of vesicle trafficking and exocytosis in secretory cells. RAB3D is predominantly associated with secretory vesicles in various exocrine and endocrine tissues, such as the pancreas, parotid glands, and alveolar epithelial type II cells in the lungs (Ohnishi1996Rab3D; van2004Rab3D). The protein plays a crucial role in the maturation and homeostasis of secretory granules, influencing their size and function, and is essential for the proper secretion of hormones and enzymes (Tian2010RAB26). Additionally, RAB3D interacts with other proteins, such as calmodulin and the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, to facilitate vesicular trafficking processes (Evans2008Direct; Zhu2016Calmodulin). Alterations in RAB3D expression and function have been implicated in various diseases, including Sjögren's syndrome and renal cell carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Bahamondes2011Changes; Zhai2020Long).

## Function
RAB3D is a small GTP-binding protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of vesicle trafficking and exocytosis in secretory cells. It is primarily associated with secretory vesicles in various exocrine and endocrine tissues, including the pancreas, parotid glands, and alveolar epithelial type II (AET-II) cells in the lungs (Ohnishi1996Rab3D; van2004Rab3D). In AET-II cells, RAB3D is localized to a subset of lamellar bodies, which are involved in surfactant secretion, a critical function for maintaining alveolar integrity and respiratory efficiency (van2004Rab3D).

RAB3D is involved in the maturation and homeostasis of secretory granules, influencing their size and function. It is thought to regulate the release of mature secretory granules by tethering them to elements of the cortical actomyosin mesh, which is crucial for the proper secretion of hormones and enzymes (Tian2010RAB26). In neuroendocrine cells, RAB3D is implicated in the biosynthetic transport and maturation processes of secretory granules, essential for the regulated secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters (Kögel2013Rab3D). The protein's activity is necessary for the formation of large secretory granules, as its disruption leads to defects in granule formation and secretion (Tian2010RAB26).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and distribution of the RAB3D gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving secretory dysfunction. In Sjögren's syndrome (SS), a condition characterized by dry eyes and mouth due to glandular dysfunction, RAB3D protein levels are significantly decreased in the salivary glands of patients, despite unchanged mRNA levels. This reduction is associated with a loss of cell polarity, redistribution of cellular components, and mucin accumulation, contributing to the secretory dysfunction observed in SS (Bahamondes2011Changes). The altered distribution of RAB3D in SS patients suggests a disruption in the exocytosis process, which is crucial for maintaining normal glandular function (Bahamondes2011Changes).

RAB3D is also involved in cancer, particularly renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The long noncoding RNA LINC01133, which is highly expressed in RCC, regulates RAB3D through miR-30b-5p, a microRNA that targets RAB3D. This regulatory axis is associated with RCC progression, as LINC01133 promotes malignant behaviors by modulating RAB3D expression, highlighting its potential role in RCC pathogenesis (Zhai2020Long). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RAB3D in both autoimmune and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
RAB3D, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate vesicular trafficking. One significant interaction is with calmodulin, a protein that regulates intracellular calcium homeostasis. This interaction is calcium-dependent and plays a crucial role in osteoclastic bone resorption. Calmodulin and RAB3D co-localize in the ruffled border of osteoclasts, and their interaction is essential for the exocytic pathway in these cells. Disruption of this interaction leads to reduced bone resorption activity, highlighting its importance in osteoclast function (Zhu2016Calmodulin).

RAB3D also interacts with the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) in lacrimal gland acinar cells. This interaction is sensitive to the GTP-bound state of RAB3D, with the GTP-bound form unable to bind pIgR. The interaction suggests a role for RAB3D in the trafficking and localization of pIgR within secretory granules. The dominant negative Rab3DT36N mutant binds more effectively to pIgR, indicating that pIgR might act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RAB3D, facilitating GDP/GTP exchange (Evans2008Direct). These interactions underscore RAB3D's role in vesicle docking, fusion, and trafficking processes in various cellular contexts.
