# CD44

## Overview
CD44 is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, which is a member of the cell adhesion molecule family. The protein product of the CD44 gene, also known as the Indian blood group antigen, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. It functions primarily as a receptor for hyaluronan, a key component of the extracellular matrix, facilitating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The CD44 protein is characterized by its structural complexity, resulting from extensive alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, which generate multiple isoforms with diverse biological functions (Bajorath2000Molecular; Bennett1995Regulation). These isoforms are implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes, such as lymphocyte activation, hematopoiesis, and cancer metastasis, underscoring the gene's significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Naor2002CD44; Günthert1993CD44:).

## Structure
CD44 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with a complex molecular structure characterized by extensive alternative splicing and post-translational modifications. The primary structure of CD44 includes an extracellular domain of 248 amino acids, a 21-residue transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic domain of 72 residues (Bajorath2000Molecular). The extracellular domain contains a hyaluronan-binding region, which is crucial for its function in cell adhesion and migration (Bennett1995Regulation).

The secondary and tertiary structures of CD44 are influenced by its link module, which is essential for hyaluronan binding. This module consists of approximately 100 residues and forms a compact domain with two three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets and two α-helices, similar to the C-type lectin domain of E-selectin (Bajorath2000Molecular). However, the isolated link module does not bind hyaluronan effectively without N- and C-terminal extensions (Bajorath2000Molecular).

CD44 exhibits significant structural variability due to alternative splicing of its 19 exons, with at least 10 being variably spliced, resulting in multiple isoforms (Bajorath1998Identification). These isoforms, such as CD44H and CD44E, differ in their extracellular domains and glycosylation patterns, affecting their binding capabilities and functions (Bennett1995Regulation). Post-translational modifications, including N- and O-linked glycosylation and glycosaminoglycan attachment, further contribute to the structural diversity and functional properties of CD44 (Bajorath2000Molecular).

## Function
The CD44 gene encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a significant role in various cellular functions, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. In healthy human cells, CD44 is involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, contributing to processes such as lymphocyte recirculation, hematopoiesis, and cell migration (Günthert1993CD44:). It acts as a receptor for hyaluronan, a major component of the extracellular matrix, and this interaction is crucial for cellular aggregation, cytokine release, and lymphocyte activation (Ponta2003CD44:; Günthert1993CD44:).

CD44 also functions as a co-receptor in cell signaling, particularly with receptor tyrosine kinases, influencing growth factor receptor activation and signal transduction pathways (Ponta2003CD44:). It interacts with integrins and other cell adhesion receptors to mediate cell-cell adhesion and intracellular signaling, affecting cell shape and gene expression (Williams2013CD44). The protein's role in organizing the actin cytoskeleton and its involvement in leukocyte rolling highlight its importance in maintaining normal cellular architecture and communication (Ponta2003CD44:).

The diversity of CD44 isoforms, generated through alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, allows it to participate in a wide range of biological processes, including stem cell niche regulation and immune response modulation (Ponta2003CD44:; Williams2013CD44).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CD44 gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. CD44 is associated with tumor progression and metastasis in several cancers, including breast, colorectal, thyroid, lung, hepatocellular, renal, gallbladder, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, as well as melanoma (Naor2002CD44). Specific isoforms, such as CD44v6, are linked to the aggressiveness of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and are highly expressed in metastatic growths, suggesting a role in cancer metastasis (Naor2002CD44; Basakran2015CD44).

In breast cancer, the CD44/CD24 ratio is considered a potential guideline for early detection, and CD44 is linked to chemotherapy resistance and relapse (Basakran2015CD44). CD44 also mediates receptor tyrosine kinase activity in ovarian cancer, promoting tumor cell proliferation (Basakran2015CD44). In prostate cancer, hypermethylation of the CD44 gene can lead to transcriptional inactivation, affecting cancer progression (Chen2018The).

CD44 is involved in the regulation of cancer stem cells, contributing to their resistance to oxidative stress and chemotherapy, which is particularly noted in intestinal tumors (Basakran2015CD44). Additionally, CD44's interaction with monoclonal antibodies can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in leukemia cells, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Basakran2015CD44).

## Interactions
CD44 is a cell surface receptor that interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. The cytoplasmic tail of CD44, despite its short length, contains motifs for binding cytoskeletal and signaling proteins, including the FERM-binding domain and the ankyrin-binding domain, which link CD44 to the actin cytoskeleton (Skandalis2010Proteomic). CD44 also has a PDZ-domain binding motif at its C-terminus, allowing it to form complexes with PDZ-domain containing proteins (Skandalis2010Proteomic).

Proteomic studies have identified several proteins interacting with CD44, such as IQGAP1, which links CD44 signaling to the cytoskeleton, and the nuclear receptor corepressor SMRT, which interacts with nuclear hormone receptors (Skandalis2010Proteomic). Other identified interacting proteins include the coatomer protein complex (COPA) and EHD2, a lipid raft protein involved in endocytosis (Skandalis2010Proteomic).

CD44 also interacts with nucleic acids, specifically mRNA. The CRD-BP protein binds to CD44 mRNA, particularly within the 3' untranslated region, influencing tumor progression (King2014Assessing). These interactions highlight CD44's involvement in various cellular processes, including cell survival and tumor promotion.
