# GOLGA6L6

## Overview
GOLGA6L6 is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A6 family like 6, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. These proteins are typically involved in the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids within the cell. While the specific functions of golgin A6 family like 6 remain to be fully elucidated, it is believed to play a role in maintaining Golgi structure and facilitating vesicular transport. The gene is located on chromosome 15q11.1-q11.2, a region that has been associated with various genetic conditions due to its susceptibility to copy number variations (CNVs) (Alhazmi2024Copy; Trivedi2021Arraybased). Understanding the precise biological roles and interactions of GOLGA6L6 and its encoded protein is crucial for elucidating its involvement in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
The GOLGA6L6 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression or copy number variations (CNVs). In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly among smokers, a copy loss of GOLGA6L6 has been identified, suggesting a potential link to the development of smoking-related lung cancer, although its specific clinical significance in COPD remains unexplored (Trivedi2021Arraybased). In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the 15q11.1-q11.2 chromosomal region, which includes GOLGA6L6, has been associated with significant CNV occurrences in autistic children, indicating a possible role in neurological diseases and cognition defects (Alhazmi2024Copy).

In non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), GOLGA6L6 was found to be downregulated, suggesting it may play a role in the pathology of NOA, potentially affecting sperm morphology and translocation (Karoii2024Whole). Additionally, in rectal neuroendocrine tumors (R-NETs), amplification of the GOLGA6L6 gene was observed, which may contribute to tumor development or progression, although further studies are needed to validate its biological effects (Li2023Wholeexome). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in various conditions, though its precise clinical implications require further investigation.
