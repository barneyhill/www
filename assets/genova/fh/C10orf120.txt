# C10orf120

## Overview
C10orf120 is a gene located on chromosome 10 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 10 open reading frame 120. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions are not yet fully elucidated. Emerging research suggests that the C10orf120 protein may play a role in neuronal function and has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, potentially through its interactions with other proteins and cellular pathways. Additionally, alterations in the expression of C10orf120 have been associated with certain cancers, indicating its possible involvement in tumorigenesis. The protein's role in these diseases highlights its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target, warranting further investigation into its molecular mechanisms and interactions.
