# HOXA5

## Overview
The HOXA5 gene is a member of the homeobox family of genes, which are known for encoding transcription factors that play pivotal roles in regulating developmental processes. The protein encoded by HOXA5, homeobox A5, is a transcription factor that is integral to the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development and in adult tissues. It is involved in various biological processes, including myeloid differentiation, epithelial cell differentiation, and angiogenesis. Homeobox A5 functions as a tumor suppressor in several cancers, such as breast and colorectal cancer, by influencing pathways related to cell cycle control and apoptosis (Jeannotte2016Hoxa5:; Strathdee2007HOXA5). The expression of HOXA5 is tightly regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, which can impact its role in disease pathogenesis (Strathdee2007HOXA5).

## Function
The HOXA5 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in various developmental and physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of myeloid differentiation, promoting granulocytic and monocytic differentiation while inhibiting erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation (Strathdee2007HOXA5). In the context of hematopoiesis, HOXA5 is expressed in human bone marrow progenitor cells, influencing cell differentiation by promoting myelopoiesis and inhibiting erythropoiesis (Jeannotte2016Hoxa5:).

HOXA5 also acts as a tumor suppressor, particularly in breast tissue, where it regulates the expression of the p53 gene, a critical protein for cell cycle control and apoptosis (Jeannotte2016Hoxa5:). It can induce apoptosis through both p53-dependent and independent mechanisms, involving caspases 2 and 8 (Strathdee2007HOXA5). In non-small cell lung cancer, HOXA5 positively regulates the expression of Cdkn1a, encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, thereby controlling cell proliferation (Jeannotte2016Hoxa5:).

In addition, HOXA5 is involved in epithelial cell differentiation and inhibits angiogenesis by preventing the expression of pro-angiogenic molecules and promoting anti-angiogenic factors (Jeannotte2016Hoxa5:). Its expression is regulated by cell-type-specific CpG island methylation, which correlates with gene expression levels (Strathdee2007HOXA5).

## Clinical Significance
The HOXA5 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, HOXA5 expression is often lost due to promoter hypermethylation, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. Overexpression of HOXA5 in breast cancer cell lines can induce apoptosis through both p53-dependent and independent pathways, highlighting its potential in tumor suppression (Chen2004HOXA5Induced). In ovarian cancer, loss of HOXA5 function is associated with the expression of cancer markers PAX8 and WT1, indicating a predisposition to the disease (Jeannotte2016Hoxa5:).

In colorectal cancer, a decrease in HOXA5 expression correlates with high levels of nuclear β-catenin, a hallmark of Wnt signaling activity. Overexpression of HOXA5 in colorectal tumors can suppress cancer stem cell self-renewal and reduce tumor size and metastasis (Jeannotte2016Hoxa5:). In non-small cell lung cancer, reduced HOXA5 expression is a biomarker for poor prognosis, as it regulates cell proliferation by controlling the expression of Cdkn1a, which encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (Jeannotte2016Hoxa5:).

HOXA5 also plays a role in angiogenesis, where its expression in endothelial cells prevents angiogenesis by inhibiting pro-angiogenic molecules and promoting anti-angiogenic factors (Li2019The). In endometrial cancer, reduced HOXA5 expression is observed, suggesting its potential as a molecular marker for early detection of neoplastic changes (Dziobek2020Assessment).

## Interactions
HOXA5 is a transcription factor that interacts with both proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. It plays a significant role in binding to specific DNA sequences, such as the pleiotrophin (PTN) promoter, where it recognizes a TAAT-containing sequence. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the PTN promoter, and mutations in this sequence can abolish HOXA5's binding ability (Chen2005Identification). The DNA binding domain of HOXA5 is essential for its function, as demonstrated by the inability of a truncated version lacking this domain to activate the PTN promoter (Chen2005Identification).

HOXA5 also forms protein-protein interactions that enhance its DNA binding specificity. It interacts with cofactors like PBX1A, which are part of the TALE class homeodomain proteins, to increase its binding affinity and specificity (Philippidou2013Hox). These interactions are important for the transcriptional regulation of target genes.

In addition to its role in gene regulation, HOXA5 stabilizes IκB-α, a component of the NF-κB pathway, through direct protein-protein interactions. This stabilization extends the half-life of IκB-α in the nucleus, thereby modulating NF-κB transcriptional activity and influencing oncogenic processes (Pai2022HOXA5Mediated).
