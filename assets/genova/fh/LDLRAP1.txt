# LDLRAP1

## Overview
The LDLRAP1 gene encodes the low-density lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein 1, a critical component in cholesterol metabolism. This protein, also known as ARH, functions as an adaptor protein that facilitates the endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors by linking them to the clathrin-mediated endocytic machinery. The LDLRAP1 protein contains a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which is essential for its interaction with the NPXY motif of LDL receptors, enabling the internalization of LDL particles into cells, particularly in the liver (RodríguezJiménez2019A; Calandra2011Mechanisms). Mutations in the LDLRAP1 gene can lead to autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH), a condition characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol levels and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (Brautbar2015Genetics). The protein's role in cholesterol homeostasis underscores its importance in maintaining normal plasma cholesterol levels and preventing hypercholesterolemia (Shaik2020Molecular).

## Structure
The LDLRAP1 protein, also known as ARH, plays a crucial role in the endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. It contains a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which is essential for its interaction with the NPXY motif of LDL receptors (Calandra2011Mechanisms). The secondary structure of LDLRAP1 includes one sheet, four beta hairpins, one beta bulge, eight strands, seven helices, two helix-helix interactions, 67 beta turns, and 24 gamma turns (Shaik2020Molecular). 

Mutations in LDLRAP1 can lead to structural deviations, as indicated by RMSD scores greater than 2 Å at the residue level. The most significant deviation is observed with the substitution of tryptophan for arginine at residue 39, resulting in an RMSD score of 4.3857 Å (Shaik2020Molecular). These mutations can affect the protein's stability and flexibility, as predicted by computational tools like DUET and CABS-flex (Shaik2020Molecular). 

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions (Calandra2011Mechanisms). Variants in LDLRAP1 are associated with familial hypercholesterolemia, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity for proper LDL receptor function (Shaik2020Molecular).

## Function
The LDLRAP1 gene encodes the low-density lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein 1, which is crucial for the internalization of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in clathrin-coated pits. This process is essential for the endocytosis of LDL particles, which are rich in cholesterol, into cells, primarily in the liver. The protein facilitates the uptake and degradation of LDL, thereby maintaining normal cholesterol levels in the plasma (RodríguezJiménez2019A; Shaik2020Molecular).

LDLRAP1 functions as a chaperone protein that interacts with LDLR, coupling it to the clathrin machinery at the plasma membrane. This interaction is mediated by the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain of LDLRAP1, which binds to the FDNPxY motif within the cytoplasmic tail of LDLR. The C-terminus of LDLRAP1 interacts with clathrin and the β2-adaptin subunit of AP-2, facilitating the internalization of the LDLR-LDL complex into endosomes (RodríguezJiménez2019A; Shaik2020Molecular).

In healthy human cells, LDLRAP1 is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it plays a critical role in cholesterol homeostasis. This function is vital for clearing LDL from the circulation, thus preventing hypercholesterolemia and associated cardiovascular diseases (RodríguezJiménez2019A; Shaik2020Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LDLRAP1 gene are associated with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH), a rare genetic disorder characterized by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and an increased risk of premature coronary heart disease. ARH is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in LDLRAP1, which impair the internalization of LDL receptors (LDLR) and reduce LDL uptake and metabolism (RodríguezJiménez2019A; Brautbar2015Genetics). The condition presents similarly to homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) but typically exhibits higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and slower disease progression (Brautbar2015Genetics).

The prevalence of ARH is extremely low, with a frequency of less than 1 in 5,000,000, but it is more common in certain populations, such as in Sardinia, Italy, due to founder effects and consanguinity (Brautbar2015Genetics). Patients with ARH generally respond well to lipid-lowering therapies, including statins and PCSK9 inhibitors, although responses can vary (RodríguezJiménez2019A). Genetic testing is crucial for the definitive diagnosis of ARH, as it requires the identification of mutations in both LDLRAP1 alleles (Brautbar2015Genetics).

## Interactions
LDLRAP1, also known as ARH, is a crucial adaptor protein involved in the endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. It interacts directly with the LDL receptor (LDLR) by binding to its cytoplasmic tail, facilitating the internalization of the LDL-LDLR complex into cells. This interaction is essential for the proper uptake and degradation of LDL particles, which is a key process in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis (RodríguezJiménez2019A).

The protein contains a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain at its N-terminus, which is responsible for binding to the LDLR. This domain interacts with the FDNPxY motif on the LDLR tail, a critical interaction for the internalization process (RodríguezJiménez2019A). Additionally, LDLRAP1 interacts with clathrin and the β2-adaptin subunit of the AP-2 complex through motifs located in its C-terminal region. These interactions are vital for coupling the LDLR to the clathrin-mediated endocytic machinery at the plasma membrane (RodríguezJiménez2019A).

The requirement for LDLRAP1 is tissue-specific, with other proteins like Disabled 2 (Dab-2) potentially compensating for its absence in certain cell types, such as fibroblasts (RodríguezJiménez2019A).
