# NT5DC4

## Overview
NT5DC4 is a gene that encodes the protein 5'-nucleotidase domain containing 4, which is involved in nucleotide metabolism. This protein is categorized as a nucleotidase, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of nucleotides into nucleosides and phosphate. The NT5DC4 gene has been implicated in several metabolic and pathological processes, including mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer progression. Its expression and mutation patterns have been associated with diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and various cancers, including ovarian cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The protein's role in these conditions suggests its potential as a biomarker and a target for therapeutic interventions (Lin2022Identification; Yu2024Metabolic; Lv2022Combined).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
NT5DC4 has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), NT5DC4 mutations were found in all six patients studied, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis, possibly through involvement in mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic pathways (Lv2022Combined). In ovarian cancer, NT5DC4 is significantly overexpressed, particularly in cases with TP53 mutations, indicating its potential role in cancer prognosis and as a target for therapeutic interventions (Lin2022Identification). 

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCA), NT5DC4 is associated with distinct metabolic subtypes, although its specific role in cancer progression remains unclear (Yu2024Metabolic). The gene is also involved in nucleotide metabolism, as indicated by its upregulation in response to homocysteine thiolactone treatment in vascular endothelial cells, which may have implications for atherosclerosis (Gurda2015Homocysteine). 

These findings suggest that NT5DC4 may play a role in various diseases, particularly those involving metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction, and could serve as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target.
