# POPDC2

## Overview
POPDC2 is a gene that encodes the protein popeye domain containing 2, which is a transmembrane protein involved in cardiac function. The protein is characterized by its three transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic Popeye domain, which is evolutionarily conserved and plays a critical role in binding cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (Schindler2016The; Brand2017New). POPDC2 is predominantly expressed in the cardiac conduction system, including the sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node, and Purkinje fibers, where it modulates ion channel activity and maintains electrical stability in the heart (Rinné2020POPDC2; Schindler2016The). The protein interacts with the TREK-1 potassium channel and other proteins, such as XIRP1 and annexin A5, to support cardiac structure and function (Holt2020An). Mutations in the POPDC2 gene are linked to cardiac conduction defects and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, underscoring its clinical significance in cardiac health (Nicastro2024Biallelic).

## Structure
The POPDC2 protein is a medium-sized transmembrane protein characterized by three transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic Popeye domain. The Popeye domain is approximately 150 amino acids long and is evolutionarily conserved, showing structural similarity to cAMP binding domains, although it has low sequence similarity (Schindler2016The; Brand2017New). This domain contains two invariant sequence motifs crucial for cAMP binding, and mutations in these motifs can impair this function (Brand2017New).

The protein's structure includes a short extracellular domain with N-glycosylation sites, which affect its electrophoretic mobility and may vary depending on the tissue (Schindler2016The). The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) is variable and subject to alternative splicing, as well as β1AR-dependent phosphorylation, which may modulate the protein's biological activity (Brand2017New).

POPDC2 can form both homodimers and heterodimers, with the latter being favored, particularly with POPDC1. These interactions are mediated by the αC-helix within the Popeye domain, which is crucial for proper membrane localization and function (Swan2023Differential). The αC-helix contains conserved hydrophobic residues essential for these interactions (Swan2023Differential).

## Function
POPDC2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cardiac function, particularly within the cardiac conduction system. The protein is prominently expressed in the sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node, and Purkinje fibers, which are crucial for maintaining normal cardiac rhythm (Rinné2020POPDC2; Schindler2016The). POPDC2 interacts with the two-pore domain potassium channel TREK-1, enhancing its current amplitude and membrane transport, which is essential for modulating cardiac ion channel activity and maintaining electrical stability in the heart (Rinné2020POPDC2; Brand2014The).

The protein contains a conserved Popeye domain that binds cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with high affinity, influencing the function of TREK-1 channels and potentially forming cAMP nanodomains (Amunjela2019The; Brand2014The). This interaction is crucial for regulating the resting membrane potential and excitability of cardiac myocytes, contributing to the proper conduction of electrical signals in the heart (Schindler2016The). In healthy human cells, POPDC2's role in modulating ion channels and maintaining cardiac rhythm underscores its importance in cardiac function and organismal homeostasis (Brand2017New).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POPDC2 gene are associated with a novel autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by cardiac conduction defects and variable hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Biallelic variants in POPDC2, such as p.W188X, p.L37SfsTer20, p.Q172-Y176delinsH, p.R263H, and p.R263C, have been identified as pathogenic, affecting the structural integrity of the cAMP-binding Popeye domain, which is crucial for POPDC2 function. These mutations impair the gene's ability to bind cAMP and interact with TREK-1 potassium channels, leading to cardiac symptoms such as sinus node disease, AV conduction defects, cardiac arrest, atrial arrhythmia, and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (Nicastro2024Biallelic).

The study of these variants in animal models, such as mice and zebrafish, supports the intolerance of POPDC2 to homozygous loss-of-function variants, which are not well tolerated and are predicted to be damaging (Nicastro2024Biallelic). Unlike other POPDC genes associated with muscular dystrophy, no signs of muscular dystrophy were observed in patients with POPDC2 variants, suggesting a cardiac-specific phenotype (Nicastro2024Biallelic). The findings highlight the importance of including POPDC2 in genetic testing panels for patients with unexplained sinus node dysfunction and AV conduction defects (Nicastro2024Biallelic).

## Interactions
POPDC2, a member of the Popeye domain-containing protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. POPDC2 interacts with POPDC1 to form heterodimers, which are essential for proper membrane trafficking and localization. These interactions are mediated by the αC-helix within the Popeye domain, which forms a heteromeric interface between the two proteins (Swan2023Differential). Mutations in POPDC2, such as p.W188X, can disrupt these interactions, leading to mislocalization and reduced interaction with POPDC1 (Swan2023Differential).

POPDC2 also interacts with the TREK-1 potassium channel, enhancing the outward K+ current when co-expressed. This interaction is sensitive to cAMP levels, indicating a regulatory role in ion channel activity (Swan2023Differential). Additionally, POPDC2 interacts with XIRP1, a scaffolding protein that stabilizes intercalated discs in the heart, and annexin A5, which is involved in membrane repair. These interactions are significant for maintaining cardiac structure integrity and are implicated in cardiac arrhythmias (Holt2020An). The presence of POPDC2 at intercalated discs and T-tubules in heart tissues further supports its role in cardiac function (Holt2020An).
