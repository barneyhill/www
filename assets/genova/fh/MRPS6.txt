# MRPS6

## Overview
MRPS6 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S6, a crucial component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a significant role in mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for mitochondrial function and energy production in human cells (O’Brien2003Properties). MRPS6 is involved in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR mt), which is vital for maintaining protein homeostasis, particularly in energy-demanding organs such as the brain, heart, and pancreas (Lin2023MRPS6). Beyond its role in mitochondrial function, MRPS6 is implicated in various cellular processes, including glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells and antiviral defense mechanisms (Jiang2024A; Lin2023MRPS6). Alterations in MRPS6 expression have been linked to several diseases, including Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and cancer, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis (Gopisetty2016Mammalian; Lin2023MRPS6; PAPAPETROPOULOS2006Multiregional).

## Function
MRPS6 (mitochondrial ribosomal protein S6) is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It facilitates the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production in human cells (O’Brien2003Properties). MRPS6 is involved in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR mt), a stress response mechanism that helps maintain protein homeostasis between the mitochondria and the nucleus. This process is particularly important in organs with high energy demands, such as the brain, heart, and pancreas (Lin2023MRPS6).

In pancreatic β-cells, MRPS6 modulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by interacting with UPR mt. Its expression is positively correlated with UPR mt marker genes, suggesting a regulatory role in insulin secretion and mitochondrial protein homeostasis (Lin2023MRPS6). MRPS6 knockdown leads to increased UPR mt activity, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and apoptosis, while its overexpression reduces these effects, enhancing GSIS in an ATF5-dependent manner (Lin2023MRPS6). This indicates that MRPS6 is vital for maintaining cellular function and energy metabolism, with implications for conditions like impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes (Lin2023MRPS6).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MRPS6 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), diabetes, and various cancers. In Parkinson's disease, MRPS6 is significantly upregulated in 20 out of 21 brain regions studied, suggesting a link between its increased expression and mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a known factor in PD pathogenesis (PAPAPETROPOULOS2006Multiregional).

In the context of diabetes, MRPS6 plays a role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic β-cells. Its expression is regulated by the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), and disruptions in this regulation can lead to impaired GSIS, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis, contributing to conditions like impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes (Lin2023MRPS6).

MRPS6 is also associated with cancer, where its expression varies across different types. It is upregulated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and certain breast cancer cell lines, contributing to tumorigenic processes such as cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Gopisetty2016Mammalian; Oviya2021Mitochondrial). These findings highlight the potential role of MRPS6 in the progression of various diseases through its impact on mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism.

## Interactions
MRPS6, a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. In the context of Porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) infection, MRPS6 interacts with proteins such as RPS16 and SNF8. The upregulation of MRPS6, along with the downregulation of RPS16 or upregulation of SNF8, has been shown to hinder PDCoV viral replication, suggesting a role in antiviral defense (Jiang2024A). MRPS6 also interacts with components of the interferon-beta (IFN-b) pathway, promoting IFN-b transcription and activating downstream components like STAT1, STAT2, and IRF7, which are crucial for the antiviral response (Jiang2024A).

In breast cancer, MRPS6 is involved in a network of protein-protein interactions. It has been shown to interact with proteins such as AKAP10, indicating potential ribosome-independent functions (Oviya2021Mitochondrial). These interactions suggest that MRPS6 may play a role in tumorigenic processes by participating in cancer-associated pathways (Oviya2021Mitochondrial). The study of these interactions provides insights into the diverse roles of MRPS6 in both antiviral defense and cancer biology.
