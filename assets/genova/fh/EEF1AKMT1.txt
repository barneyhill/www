# EEF1AKMT1

## Overview
EEF1AKMT1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme eEF1A lysine methyltransferase 1, which is a methyltransferase involved in the post-translational modification of proteins. This enzyme specifically targets lysine 79 on the elongation factor eEF1A, a key player in the protein synthesis process. The methylation of eEF1A by EEF1AKMT1 is a conserved modification across eukaryotic species, underscoring its essential role in cellular function (Hamey2018Methylation). EEF1AKMT1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it influences translation efficiency and fidelity, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Jakobsson2018Regulation). The enzyme's activity has broader implications, potentially affecting cytoskeleton organization and protein degradation, although these roles are not yet fully understood in mammals (Xu2022Functions).

## Function
EEF1AKMT1, also known as eEF1A lysine methyltransferase 1, is an enzyme that specifically methylates lysine 79 on the elongation factor eEF1A, a protein crucial for the translation process in protein synthesis. This methylation is conserved across eukaryotes, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Hamey2018Methylation). The enzyme's activity has been confirmed through in vitro assays using recombinant eEF1A, highlighting its specificity for this substrate (Hamey2018Methylation).

In healthy human cells, EEF1AKMT1 is involved in regulating translation processes. Knockout studies of EEF1AKMT1 have shown downregulation of proteins related to tRNA aminoacylation and nuclear exosome, while proteins related to ubiquitination regulation and small-subunit processome are upregulated, suggesting a role in these cellular processes (Xu2022Functions). The enzyme's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it modulates translation efficiency and fidelity, contributing to cellular homeostasis and function (Jakobsson2018Regulation).

The methylation of eEF1A by EEF1AKMT1 may also influence other cellular activities, such as cytoskeleton organization and protein degradation, although the precise physiological functions in mammals remain to be fully elucidated (Xu2022Functions).
