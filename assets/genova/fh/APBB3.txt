# APBB3

## Overview
APBB3, or amyloid beta precursor protein binding family B member 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. The protein encoded by APBB3 is part of a family of proteins that interact with the intracellular domain of APP, influencing its internalization and subsequent cleavage within endosomes. This process is significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease, as it contributes to the generation of amyloid β peptide, a key component in the disease's pathology (Novikova2019Integration). Additionally, APBB3 is subject to regulation by non-coding RNAs, which can modulate its expression through post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanisms (Namboori2010Effect). The gene has also been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis through genetic interactions with APP, suggesting a role in inflammatory pathways (Emily2009Using).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
APBB3, also known as amyloid beta precursor protein binding family B member 3, is involved in interactions with the amyloid precursor protein (APP). It binds to the intracellular domain of APP, playing a role in APP internalization into endosomes where it is cleaved to generate amyloid β peptide, a process relevant to the endolysosomal system's role in Alzheimer's disease (Novikova2019Integration). 

APBB3 is also a target for post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanisms involving non-coding RNAs, such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). These ncRNAs can silence APBB3 by degrading its mRNA, preventing translation into proteins. This process is mediated by the Argonaute protein, which binds to the antisense strand of siRNA or miRNA, guiding it to the target mRNA for degradation (Namboori2010Effect).

In the context of rheumatoid arthritis, there is evidence of biological epistasis between APP and APBB3, with specific SNP interactions indicating a predisposition to the disease. This suggests a potential interaction between these genes in inflammatory pathways (Emily2009Using). However, specific physical interactions of APBB3 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond these contexts are not detailed in the available literature.
