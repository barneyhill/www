# UBE2R2

## Overview
UBE2R2 is a human gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 R2, a critical component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This enzyme is categorized as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, or E2, and plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, and maintaining cellular homeostasis. UBE2R2 is specifically involved in the formation of polyubiquitin chains with lysine 48 linkages, marking proteins for degradation by the proteasome (Hill2016Mechanism). The enzyme interacts with the SCF (Skp1/cullin/F-box) E3 ligase complex, facilitating the ubiquitination of proteins that regulate the G1-S phase transition of the cell cycle (Wijk2009The). UBE2R2's activity is characterized by its interaction with specific residues, such as Asp 143 on UBE2R2 and Arg 54 on ubiquitin, which are crucial for stabilizing the UBE2R2-acceptor ubiquitin complex and ensuring efficient polyubiquitin chain formation (Hill2016Mechanism). The enzyme is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes, including protein stability and DNA repair (Huang2013E2).

## Structure
The UBE2R2 protein, encoded by the human gene UBE2R2, is involved in the ubiquitination process, specifically in the formation of polyubiquitin chains with lysine 48 specificity. The protein contains a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Hill2016Mechanism). This domain is characterized by a high sequence identity with UBE2R1, suggesting similar biochemical activities between the two proteins (Hill2016Mechanism).

The molecular structure of UBE2R2 includes specific residues that play significant roles in its function. Aspartic acid at position 143 (Asp 143) is important for forming a stable complex with acceptor ubiquitin, interacting with arginine at position 54 (Arg 54) on ubiquitin. This interaction is essential for maintaining the specificity of lysine 48 chain formation (Hill2016Mechanism). The protein also features an acidic loop, which is flexible and interacts with the Rbx1 subunit of the SCF complex, influencing the protein's binding affinity and activity (Hill2016Mechanism).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the activity of UBE2R2, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its role in ubiquitin transfer and chain elongation (Hill2016Mechanism).

## Function
UBE2R2 encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a critical role in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, and maintaining cellular homeostasis. This enzyme is involved in the formation of polyubiquitin chains, specifically with lysine 48 linkages, which target proteins for degradation by the proteasome (Hill2016Mechanism). UBE2R2 interacts with the SCF (Skp1/cullin/F-box) E3 ligase complex, facilitating the ubiquitination of proteins that regulate the G1-S phase transition of the cell cycle (Wijk2009The). 

The enzyme's activity is characterized by its interaction with specific residues, such as Asp 143 on UBE2R2 and Arg 54 on ubiquitin, which are crucial for stabilizing the UBE2R2-acceptor ubiquitin complex and ensuring efficient polyubiquitin chain formation (Hill2016Mechanism). UBE2R2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes, including protein stability and DNA repair (Huang2013E2). The enzyme's function is vital for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating cellular health, highlighting its importance in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Hill2016Mechanism).

## Interactions
UBE2R2, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in ubiquitination. It interacts with the Rbx1 subunit of the SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box) E3 ligase complex, where specific residues such as Asp 102 and Asp 103 on UBE2R2 interact with Arg 91 on Rbx1. This interaction is significant for the binding affinity of UBE2R2 to the SCF complex, as demonstrated by charge-swapped mutations that affect this interaction (Hill2016Mechanism).

UBE2R2 also forms a complex with ubiquitin, where an electrostatic interaction between Arg 54 on ubiquitin and Asp 143 on UBE2R2 is crucial for stabilizing the UBE2R2-acceptor ubiquitin complex. Mutations in these residues, such as D143A in UBE2R2 and R54A in ubiquitin, lead to defects in ubiquitin chain formation, highlighting the importance of this interaction (Hill2016Mechanism).

Additionally, UBE2R2 can perform ubiquitin conjugation independently of an E3 ligase, a property that distinguishes it from many other E2 enzymes. This unique ability suggests that UBE2R2 may have specific functional properties that allow it to participate in ubiquitin transfer without the need for E3 ligase mediation (Sheng2012A).
