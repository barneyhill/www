# MAT2B

## Overview
The MAT2B gene encodes the methionine adenosyltransferase 2 non-catalytic beta subunit, a regulatory protein that is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. This protein plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a vital methyl donor involved in numerous methylation processes within the cell (Wan2024MAT2B; An2020Methionine). MAT2B modulates the activity of the catalytic alpha subunit, MAT2A, thereby influencing cellular methylation, gene expression, and metabolic pathways (Wan2024MAT2B). Structurally, MAT2B is characterized by a core Rossmann-like domain and a smaller extension domain, with specific motifs that confer a preference for NADP binding (Shafqat2013Insight). The protein is involved in various protein-protein interactions, including those with MAT2A, SIRT1, and HuR, which are significant in contexts such as liver cancer and cellular responses to resveratrol (Wan2024MAT2B; Yang2013Methionine). Clinically, alterations in MAT2B expression or function have been linked to liver diseases and cancer, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Ramani2017Methionine; Wan2024MAT2B).

## Structure
The human methionine adenosyltransferase 2B (MAT2B) protein is a regulatory subunit that is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. Its structure is characterized by a core Rossmann-like domain and a smaller extension domain. The core domain features a seven-stranded β-sheet and six α-helices, which include conserved sequences typical of SDRs, such as a glycine-rich dinucleotide-binding motif and a catalytic triad crucial for substrate activation (Shafqat2013Insight). The extension domain contains five α-helices and a double-stranded β-sheet, with a loop region that forms a substrate-binding pocket (Shafqat2013Insight).

MAT2B has a preference for binding NADP over NAD, facilitated by specific motifs and residues that confer this specificity. The protein structure also reveals two resveratrol molecules bound per protomer, with distinct binding modes. One resveratrol molecule is located in an interdomain cleft, interacting with the NADP nicotinamide ring, while the other is positioned at the dimer interface, stabilized by van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds (Shafqat2013Insight).

MAT2B is monomeric, unlike the dimeric or tetrameric forms of related sugar-modifying enzymes, although a dimeric packing observed in crystal structures is likely a crystallization artifact (Shafqat2013Insight). The MAT2B gene produces several splice variants, including MATβV1 and MATβV2, which differ in their first 20 amino acids due to alternative transcriptional initiation sites (panmanee2020methionine).

## Function
The MAT2B gene encodes the regulatory subunit of methionine adenosyltransferase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a crucial methyl donor in various methylation processes (Wan2024MAT2B; An2020Methionine). MAT2B modulates the activity of the catalytic alpha subunit, MAT2A, influencing cellular methylation processes, gene expression, and metabolic pathways (Wan2024MAT2B). It regulates MAT2A's protein stability in an NADP+-dependent manner, which is essential for maintaining RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) levels, a modification important for gene expression regulation (Wan2024MAT2B).

In healthy cells, MAT2B is active in the cytoplasm and plays a role in cellular growth and differentiation by interacting with various proteins and pathways. It interacts with G protein-coupled receptor kinase interacting ArfGAP1 (GIT1) to enhance the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), which are crucial for cell growth, metabolism, and differentiation (An2020Methionine). This interaction is significant for proper microtubule assembly and maternal gene expression during oocyte maturation (An2020Methionine). Through these molecular activities, MAT2B contributes to the regulation of cellular processes and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the MAT2B gene have been implicated in various liver diseases and cancer. In liver tumors, MAT2B is involved in the regulation of MAT2A protein levels, which is crucial for maintaining RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) stability. Disruption of the MAT2B-MAT2A interaction, which is NADP+-dependent, can affect m6A levels and is associated with liver cancer tumorigenesis (Wan2024MAT2B). The expression of MAT2B is upregulated in liver tumors, and this upregulation is linked to shorter survival times in patients, suggesting a role in liver tumor progression (Wan2024MAT2B).

MAT2B is also implicated in liver fibrogenesis and is upregulated in hepatic stellate cells during chronic liver injury. This upregulation promotes hepatic stellate cell activation through pro-fibrogenic signaling pathways, contributing to liver fibrosis (Ramani2017Methionine). Additionally, MAT2B expression is regulated by factors such as TNF-α and SIRT1, and its mRNA stability is influenced by HuR in liver cancer cells (Ramani2017Methionine). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of MAT2B in liver-related diseases and its role in cancer biology. However, the direct clinical significance of MAT2B gene mutations remains less clear (Nordgren2011Methionine).

## Interactions
MAT2B, the methionine adenosyltransferase 2 non-catalytic beta subunit, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. MAT2B interacts with the catalytic subunit MAT2A, forming a complex that stabilizes MAT2A and enhances its enzymatic activity. This interaction is crucial for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a key methyl donor in biological processes (Nordgren2011Methionine; Wan2024MAT2B). The interaction between MAT2B and MAT2A is regulated by NADP+, with the NADP+ binding domain of MAT2B being essential for this regulatory effect (Wan2024MAT2B).

MAT2B also interacts with other proteins, such as SIRT1 and HuR, particularly in the context of liver cancer cells. Resveratrol treatment enhances the interaction between MAT2B, SIRT1, and HuR, which plays a significant role in cellular responses to resveratrol, impacting apoptosis and growth (Yang2013Methionine). Additionally, MAT2B interacts with GIT1, contributing to the activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway, which is important for cell growth and oocyte maturation (Portillo2020Proteinprotein; An2020Methionine). These interactions highlight MAT2B's role in regulating various cellular pathways and processes.
