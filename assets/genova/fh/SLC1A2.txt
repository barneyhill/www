# SLC1A2

## Overview
The SLC1A2 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 1 member 2, also known as Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2 (EAAT2), which is a critical component in the regulation of glutamate levels in the central nervous system. EAAT2 is a transmembrane protein that functions as a sodium-dependent co-transporter, facilitating the uptake of glutamate into cells, particularly astrocytes, to prevent excitotoxicity and maintain synaptic transmission (Fiorentino2014Association; Todd2020The). Structurally, EAAT2 forms a homotrimer with each protomer comprising eight transmembrane helices, organized into transport and scaffold domains, which are essential for its function and interaction with other proteins (Kato2022Structural). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are crucial for maintaining glutamate homeostasis, and alterations in SLC1A2 have been linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia (Fiorentino2014Association; Qu2022Functional).

## Structure
The SLC1A2 gene encodes the Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2 (EAAT2), a crucial protein for glutamate transport in the central nervous system. EAAT2 is a member of the SLC1 family and forms a homotrimer, with each protomer consisting of eight transmembrane helices and two helical hairpins. These are organized into transport and scaffold domains. The scaffold domain, comprising four transmembrane segments, facilitates trimer interactions, while the transport domain, also with four transmembrane segments and two hairpins, is involved in substrate transport (Kato2022Structural).

The transport domain contains a glutamate-binding site and a cavity that can be disrupted during the transport cycle. This domain protrudes from the lipid bilayer and is open toward the intracellular solvent, indicating an inward-facing state (Kato2022Structural). EAAT2's structure is similar to the IFS-Na+ state of EAAT3, with conserved residues playing a role in substrate recognition and transport (Kato2022Structural).

The protein's function is influenced by interactions with cholesterol, which may affect its transport activity and localization in lipid rafts (Kato2022Structural). Additionally, specific amino acids in the transmembrane domain 2 (TM2) are critical for its function, affecting substrate transport and anion currents (Mai2021Critical).

## Function
The SLC1A2 gene encodes the excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), a crucial protein in the central nervous system responsible for the uptake of the neurotransmitter glutamate into cells, particularly astrocytes (Fiorentino2014Association; Todd2020The). EAAT2 is a sodium-dependent co-transporter that plays a vital role in maintaining low extracellular glutamate concentrations, thereby preventing excitotoxicity, a condition that can lead to neuronal damage (Todd2020The). This transporter is essential for the rapid clearance of glutamate from the synaptic cleft, regulating synaptic transmission and preventing excessive neuronal excitation (Todd2020The).

EAAT2 is predominantly expressed in astrocytes, which are glial cells that support neuronal function, and is one of the most abundant proteins in the human brain, particularly in the visual cortex and hippocampus (Todd2020The). The transport mechanism involves the co-transport of sodium and hydrogen ions and the counter-transport of potassium ions, resulting in a net positive charge that facilitates glutamate uptake (Todd2020The). EAAT2's function is critical for maintaining glutamate homeostasis in the central nervous system, ensuring proper neuronal communication and preventing damage from excessive glutamate (Todd2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC1A2 gene, which encodes the glutamate transporter EAAT2, have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Variants in SLC1A2 are associated with bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ). Specific rare variants, such as rs145827578:G4A and rs199599866:G4A, have been linked to these conditions, although their clinical significance requires further investigation (Fiorentino2014Association). The gene's involvement in glutamatergic neurotransmission suggests that its mutations may contribute to the pathophysiology of these disorders (Fiorentino2014Association).

In epilepsy, SLC1A2 variants like G82R, L85P, and P289R have been shown to significantly reduce the expression and function of the GLT-1 transporter, leading to impaired glutamate clearance and contributing to excitotoxicity. These variants also affect calcium signaling pathways, which may play a role in epilepsy pathogenesis (Qu2022Functional).

Alterations in SLC1A2 are also linked to elevated glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is associated with mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and BD. These genetic variations may impact glutamatergic neurotransmission and contribute to mood disorder subphenotypes, particularly rapid cycling (Veldic2019Genetic).

## Interactions
SLC1A2, also known as EAAT2 or GLT-1, is a glutamate transporter that engages in various protein-protein interactions critical for its function and regulation. In the mouse brain, SLC1A2 interacts with Presenilin 1 (PS1), a component of the γ-secretase complex, through specific residues located in their transmembrane regions. This interaction is significant as it may influence glutamate transport activity, which is relevant in the context of Alzheimer's disease (Perrin2023Identification).

SLC1A2 also interacts with GDPD1 and NEK6, proteins that affect its trafficking and subcellular localization. Depletion of these interactors via RNA interference results in decreased GFP intensity at the plasma membrane, indicating altered localization of SLC1A2. GDPD1, in particular, plays a role in regulating SLC1A2's transport function, as its depletion significantly reduces glutamate uptake in HEK 293 cells overexpressing SLC1A2 (Frommelt2024The).

Additionally, SLC1A2 is involved in interactions with cholesterol molecules, which may influence its transport activity and localization in lipid rafts, affecting its function in clearing extracellular glutamate (Kato2022Structural). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing SLC1A2's role in maintaining glutamate homeostasis.
