# HOXB3

## Overview
HOXB3 is a member of the homeobox (HOX) gene family, which encodes transcription factors that play a pivotal role in regulating gene expression during embryonic development and cell differentiation. The HOXB3 gene is located on chromosome 17 and is part of the HOXB cluster, which is crucial for the proper development of various tissues and organs. The protein encoded by HOXB3, homeobox B3, functions primarily as a transcription factor, binding to specific DNA sequences to modulate the expression of target genes. This regulation is essential for processes such as hematopoiesis, where HOXB3 influences the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation in hematopoietic stem cells (Alharbi2012The; Abramovich2005Hox). Additionally, HOXB3 is involved in cellular transformation and cancer progression, interacting with other proteins like PBX1 to affect cell growth and differentiation (Krosl1998Cellular). Its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including myelodysplastic syndrome and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and pathology (Svingen2003Altered; Yin2024Sequential).

## Function
HOXB3 is a homeobox gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression during hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell formation. In healthy human cells, HOXB3 is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and early progenitors, playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. It is highly expressed in uncommitted hematopoietic cells and is involved in the self-renewal and differentiation of myeloid and lymphoid lineages (Alharbi2012The; Abramovich2005Hox).

HOXB3 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to regulate the expression of target genes, influencing cell differentiation and tissue patterning. Overexpression of HOXB3 in murine models has been shown to impair B and T lymphoid differentiation while enhancing the proliferation of myeloid-restricted cells, indicating its role in promoting myeloid lineage expansion and affecting lymphoid development (Sauvageau1997Overexpression).

In normal hematopoietic development, HOXB3 expression is downregulated as cells differentiate, particularly as they transition from CD34+ CD38- to CD34+ CD38+ phenotypes, suggesting its role in maintaining the undifferentiated state of hematopoietic progenitor cells (Kawagoe1999Expression).

## Clinical Significance
HOXB3 is implicated in various diseases and conditions through its altered expression and interactions. In myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), HOXB3 is significantly upregulated in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from patients. This overexpression is associated with the progression of MDS to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Blocking HOXB3 in MSCs has been shown to reduce apoptosis, enhance cell proliferation, and improve differentiation capabilities, suggesting that its overexpression may inhibit these functions and contribute to disease progression (Yin2024Sequential). 

In cancer biology, HOXB3 is involved in angiogenesis, specifically in capillary morphogenesis. Its expression is downregulated in certain breast cancer cell lines, such as MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, indicating a potential role in cancer development and progression (Svingen2003Altered). The gene's misexpression has been linked to oncogenic transformations, suggesting its involvement in carcinogenesis and metastasis (Svingen2003Altered).

While HOXB3 is overexpressed or dysregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), specific diseases or conditions directly associated with mutations in HOXB3 are not detailed in the provided context (BeebeDimmer2015The).

## Interactions
HOXB3 is known to interact with PBX1, a critical partner in cellular proliferation and transformation. The interaction between HOXB3 and PBX1 is essential for the transformation of Rat-1 cells, as demonstrated by studies showing that HOXB3 mutants with compromised DNA-binding ability have a reduced capacity to support cell growth. This suggests that direct interactions between HOXB3, PBX1, and their DNA target sequences are crucial for cellular transformation (Krosl1998Cellular).

HOXB3 also participates in protein-protein interactions with other members of the HOX gene family. For instance, the HOXD8 homeo domain can establish interactions with HOXB3, indicating that homeo domain-mediated interactions are possible between different HOX proteins (Zappavigna1994Specificity).

In the context of prostate cancer, HOXB3 binds to the promoter region of the CDCA3 gene, transactivating its expression. This interaction is significant for the progression of prostate cancer, as HOXB3 overexpression leads to increased CDCA3 mRNA and protein levels, promoting cell proliferation and migration (Chen2013HoxB3).
