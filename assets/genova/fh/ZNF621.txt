# ZNF621

## Overview
ZNF621 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 621, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role as transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by zinc finger motifs that enable them to bind to DNA and regulate gene expression. Zinc finger protein 621 is primarily involved in modulating transcriptional activities within the nucleus, influencing various cellular processes such as cell differentiation and development. While its precise functions in normal physiological conditions are not fully elucidated, ZNF621 has been studied in the context of cancer, where it may interact with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and participate in chromosomal rearrangements, such as those observed in spermatic cord leiomyoma (Koronowicz2017Fatty; PANAGOPOULOS2021Several). Further research is needed to clarify its roles in both health and disease (Feitosa2022Genetic; Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF621 (zinc finger protein 621) is a member of the zinc finger protein family, characterized by zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding. These proteins often function as transcription factors, regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. ZNF621 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, by modulating the transcription of target genes. It is typically active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell.

In the context of cancer research, ZNF621 has been identified as potentially regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, suggesting a role in PPAR-related pathways (Koronowicz2017Fatty). Additionally, ZNF621 has been implicated in chromosomal rearrangements in spermatic cord leiomyoma, where it forms a fusion gene with LARS2, indicating its involvement in chromothripsis, a phenomenon where chromosomes break and reassemble, potentially generating oncogenic fusion genes (PANAGOPOULOS2021Several).

Despite these findings, the specific function of ZNF621 in healthy human cells remains less clear, as most studies focus on its role in disease contexts or genetic variations rather than its normal physiological roles (Feitosa2022Genetic; Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).
