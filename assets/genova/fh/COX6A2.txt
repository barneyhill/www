# COX6A2

## Overview
The COX6A2 gene encodes the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6A2, a protein integral to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, specifically as a component of complex IV. This protein is categorized as a subunit of the cytochrome c oxidase complex, which is essential for the final step of the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons to oxygen and contributing to ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. COX6A2 is predominantly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle tissues, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the efficiency of energy production and the assembly of complex IV (Bachman1997Structure; Inoue2019COX6A2). Additionally, COX6A2 is expressed in certain brain neurons, where it helps protect against oxidative stress and supports neuronal function (Sanz‐Morello2020Complex). Mutations in the COX6A2 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including muscle-specific cytochrome c oxidase deficiency and cardiac dysfunctions, underscoring its importance in cellular energy metabolism and disease (Jiang2023COX6A2; Inoue2019COX6A2).

## Function
The COX6A2 gene encodes a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which is complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This complex is crucial for the electron transport chain, a key component of cellular respiration, facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, ultimately producing ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (Inoue2019COX6A2). COX6A2 is specifically expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle, where it plays a vital role in maintaining normal COX activity and complex IV assembly, essential for efficient energy production in these tissues (Bachman1997Structure; Inoue2019COX6A2).

In healthy human cells, COX6A2 is involved in the proper assembly and function of complex IV, as well as the formation of mitochondrial supercomplexes, which are important for optimal mitochondrial function (Inoue2019COX6A2). The protein is also expressed in parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons in the brain, where it helps protect these cells from oxidative stress and supports their function by regulating ATP synthesis and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (Sanz‐Morello2020Complex). This protective role is crucial for the high metabolic demands and fast-spiking properties of PV+ interneurons, which are important for maintaining normal neuronal and behavioral functions (Sanz‐Morello2020Complex).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the COX6A2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, particularly affecting muscle and cardiac function. Biallelic variants in COX6A2 have been linked to a muscle-specific cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, characterized by reduced complex IV activity and assembly in muscle tissues. This deficiency manifests as muscle weakness, hypotonia, and in some cases, cardiomyopathy (Inoue2019COX6A2). In patients, these mutations lead to significant clinical symptoms, including severe respiratory insufficiency and sudden cardiopulmonary arrest (Inoue2019COX6A2).

In cardiac tissues, COX6A2 deficiency is associated with cardiac remodeling, a precursor to heart failure. This condition is marked by increased oxidative stress, abnormal calcium transport, and reduced contractility in cardiomyocytes. These dysfunctions contribute to myocardial remodeling and are linked to conditions such as cardiac hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy (Jiang2023COX6A2). The deficiency also results in impaired energy metabolism, with reduced oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, leading to insufficient ATP production (Jiang2023COX6A2).

COX6A2 has also been implicated in other diseases. A variant, rs769482258, is associated with Parkinson's disease, although its role in cancer remains to be fully explored (de2023Mutations). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in various metabolic and degenerative conditions.

## Interactions
COX6A2 is a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of this complex. COX6A2 is specifically expressed in striated muscles and is involved in the final step of Complex IV assembly, indicating its significant role in the expression and enzymatic activity of the complex (Quintens2013Mice; Duggan2011Coordination).

COX6A2 can substitute for the COX6A1 subunit during cytochrome c oxidase assembly, as demonstrated in COX6A1 knockdown cells where ectopic expression of COX6A2 restored wild-type levels of the enzyme. This suggests that COX6A2 can interact functionally with other subunits of the complex, although specific physical interactions are not detailed (Fornuskova2010Novel).

COX6A2 is also known to bind ADP, which increases the catalytic activity of Complex IV, allowing it to respond to changes in the ATP-to-ADP ratio within mitochondria. This interaction is specific to COX6A2, as the other isoform, COX6A1, does not interact with ADP (Sanz‐Morello2020Complex). The binding of ADP and ATP by COX6A2 influences its catalytic activity, and at high intramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratios, COX6A2 is involved in intrinsic uncoupling, which decreases proton pumping capacity (Quintens2013Mice).
