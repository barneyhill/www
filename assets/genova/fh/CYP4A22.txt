# CYP4A22

## Overview
CYP4A22 is a gene that encodes the protein cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily A member 22, which is part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. These enzymes are known for their role in the metabolism of various endogenous and exogenous compounds, including fatty acids. The CYP4A22 protein is primarily involved in the hydroxylation of medium-chain fatty acids, although its specific physiological substrates remain to be fully elucidated (Durairaj2019Functional). Structurally, CYP4A22 features a heme-binding domain essential for its enzymatic activity, with a tertiary structure that allows for the adaptation of its active site to accommodate different substrates (Gajendrarao2010Molecular; Durairaj2019Functional). The gene is expressed mainly in the liver and kidney, similar to other members of the CYP4A subfamily, and has been implicated in coronary heart disease through specific genetic polymorphisms (Huang2024Novel; Durairaj2019Functional).

## Structure
The CYP4A22 protein is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, characterized by its role in the metabolism of various substances. The primary structure of CYP4A22 consists of 519 amino acids (Gajendrarao2010Molecular). Its secondary structure includes helices A-L and five antiparallel beta sheets, connected by loops, with the heme group positioned between conserved helices I and L (Gajendrarao2010Molecular). The tertiary structure of CYP4A22 features a heme-binding domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The heme is covalently linked to Glu321, a feature that is shared with the rabbit CYP4B1, indicating a conserved structural motif within the CYP4 family (Machalz2021Structural; Durairaj2019Functional).

The active site of CYP4A22 is adaptable, allowing it to catalyze various reactions, including the hydroxylation of fatty acids. This flexibility is facilitated by the outward rotation of Phe320, which opens an additional pocket in the active site (Durairaj2019Functional). Key residues involved in ligand binding include Y120, L133, L132, C230, and E321, which participate in hydrophobic interactions or hydrogen bonding with ligands (Gajendrarao2010Molecular). The protein's structure is stabilized by molecular dynamics simulations, which reveal stable RMSD values and a decrease in potential energy after equilibration (Gajendrarao2010Molecular).

## Function
CYP4A22 is a member of the cytochrome P450 family, primarily involved in the hydroxylation of fatty acids. This enzyme catalyzes the x-hydroxylation of medium-chain fatty acids, such as lauric and myristic acids, although with low activity, suggesting these may not be its primary physiological substrates (Durairaj2019Functional). The enzyme is capable of both aliphatic and aromatic hydroxylation reactions, indicating its potential role in metabolizing a range of substrates (Durairaj2019Functional). CYP4A22 is expressed mainly in the liver and kidney, similar to its closely related enzyme CYP4A11, which is known for x-hydroxylation of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (Durairaj2019Functional).

The enzyme's activity is partly due to a covalent attachment of the B-type heme cofactor, which is present in some CYP4 enzymes, including CYP4A22 (Durairaj2019Functional). The active site of CYP4A22 can adapt to different shapes, allowing it to catalyze various reactions, with key residues such as Arg96 and Arg233 being crucial for substrate binding (Durairaj2019Functional). Despite its potential roles, the specific physiological substrates and functions of CYP4A22 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Durairaj2019Functional).

## Clinical Significance
The CYP4A22 gene has been associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) through specific polymorphisms. The study by Huang et al. identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP4A22 gene, rs12564525 and rs2056900, that are linked to CHD susceptibility. The rs12564525 variant is associated with a reduced risk of CHD, while rs2056900 is linked to an increased risk (Huang2024Novel). These polymorphisms may influence the expression level of CYP4A22, affecting the levels of 20-HETE, a compound involved in cardiac angiogenesis and potentially linked to CHD and myocardial ischemic injury (Huang2024Novel).

The study suggests that the mutant allele 'A' of CYP4A22-rs12564525 may reduce CYP4A22 expression and 20-HETE levels, potentially lowering CHD risk. Conversely, rs2056900 may increase 20-HETE levels, thus increasing CHD risk (Huang2024Novel). These findings highlight the potential role of CYP4A22 polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of CHD, although further functional verification and larger sample studies are needed to confirm these associations and explore the role of CYP4A22 in CHD development and prognosis (Huang2024Novel).

## Interactions
CYP4A22, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, is involved in various interactions essential for its enzymatic function. One significant interaction is with the electron supplier cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR), which is crucial for the enzyme's activity. This interaction is influenced by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that results in a variant of CYP4A22 with tyrosine at position 152, known as CYP4A22-WT. This variant is more common in the human population compared to the reference sequence, CYP4A22.1, which has asparagine at the same position. The polar asparagine in CYP4A22.1 enhances the interaction with POR, leading to increased enzymatic activity (Durairaj2019Functional).

The enzyme also interacts with its substrates through specific residues that form stable interactions. For instance, the carboxylate moiety of the substrate Luciferin-BE forms a stable salt bridge with either Arg96 or Arg233, which is crucial for substrate recognition and binding (Durairaj2019Functional). These interactions ensure the substrate is positioned close to the heme iron, which is essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity. However, there is no specific information on interactions of CYP4A22 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its interaction with POR (Durairaj2019Functional).
