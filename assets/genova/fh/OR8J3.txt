# OR8J3

## Overview
The OR8J3 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily J member 3, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in the detection of odorants, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. Olfactory receptors, including the protein encoded by OR8J3, are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by their seven transmembrane domain structure. These receptors are responsible for the recognition and transduction of odorant signals through interaction with specific G proteins, initiating a cascade of intracellular events that ultimately lead to the perception of smell. The OR8J3 gene, like other olfactory receptor genes, is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the vast repertoire of olfactory receptors necessary for the detection of a wide array of odorant molecules (Qiu2020aarFDC).
