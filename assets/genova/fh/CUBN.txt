# CUBN

## Overview
CUBN is a gene that encodes the protein cubilin, a large, multi-ligand receptor primarily involved in the reabsorption of proteins and vitamins in the kidney and intestine. Cubilin is a peripheral membrane protein that lacks a transmembrane domain, necessitating its interaction with other proteins such as amnionless (AMN) and megalin for proper function and localization. Structurally, cubilin is characterized by multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF) and CUB domains, which facilitate its role as a receptor for various ligands, including the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex and albumin. Functionally, cubilin is crucial for maintaining nutrient homeostasis and renal function, and its dysfunction due to mutations in the CUBN gene is linked to clinical conditions such as Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome and isolated proteinuria (Ran2023Isolated; Storm2013Detailed; Gan2022Novel).

## Structure
Cubilin (CUBN) is a large, multi-ligand receptor protein with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of cubilin includes an N-terminal stretch of 110 amino acids, followed by eight epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains and 27 CUB domains, which serve as ligand-binding sites for various complexes and proteins (Ran2023Isolated). The secondary structure of cubilin is characterized by β-sheets and α-helices, with the CUB domains forming a β-sandwich fold composed of two five-stranded β-sheets (Gaboriaud2011Structure). 

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, with the CUB domains organized to expose ligand-binding regions (Larsen2018Structural). The quaternary structure of cubilin involves its interaction with amnionless (AMN) to form the cubam receptor complex, essential for vitamin B12 uptake and protein reabsorption (Larsen2018Structural). Cubilin forms trimers that are anchored to the apical membrane through interaction with AMN, with the β-helix domains of cubilin associating with AMN to form a complex (Larsen2018Structural).

Cubilin undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is crucial for its expression and function on the cell surface (Larsen2018Structural).

## Function
Cubilin (CUBN) is a large glycoprotein that functions as a multi-ligand endocytic receptor, playing a critical role in the reabsorption of proteins and vitamins in the kidney and intestine. In healthy human cells, cubilin is highly expressed in the renal proximal tubules, where it facilitates the receptor-mediated tubular reabsorption of key ligands such as albumin, transferrin, and α1-microglobulin from glomerular ultrafiltrates (Gan2022Novel). It operates as part of a receptor complex with megalin and amnionless (AMN), which is essential for its function, as cubilin lacks a transmembrane domain and requires AMN for proper membrane targeting (Gan2022Novel).

Cubilin is also involved in the intestinal uptake of vitamin B12, functioning as a receptor for the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex (Storm2013Detailed). In the kidney, cubilin interacts with megalin to promote the reabsorption of albumin and other proteins, maintaining protein balance and preventing proteinuria (Yang2022CUBN). The protein's role in these processes is crucial for maintaining normal blood levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and albumin, contributing to overall nutrient homeostasis and renal function (Gan2022Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CUBN gene, which encodes the protein cubilin, are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome (IGS) and isolated proteinuria. IGS is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by selective intestinal vitamin B12 malabsorption, megaloblastic anemia, and proteinuria. This condition arises from mutations in the CUBN gene that affect the cubilin protein's ability to bind and absorb vitamin B12, leading to its malabsorption and subsequent anemia (Tanner2012Inherited; Storm2013Detailed).

Isolated proteinuria, another condition linked to CUBN mutations, involves the presence of excess proteins in the urine without significant impact on renal function. This condition is often benign and does not lead to progressive kidney damage. Mutations in CUBN can lead to structural abnormalities in cubilin, impairing its function in protein reabsorption in the renal proximal tubules (Ran2023Isolated; Gan2022Novel). Notably, some CUBN variants are associated with proteinuria without causing vitamin B12 malabsorption, indicating a distinct pathogenic mechanism from IGS (Gan2022Novel).

These findings underscore the importance of genetic testing in diagnosing and managing conditions associated with CUBN mutations, as they can present with varying clinical manifestations (Jayasinghe2019Isolated).

## Interactions
Cubilin (CUBN) is a peripheral membrane protein that interacts with several other proteins to facilitate its functions. It forms a complex with megalin (LRP2), a transmembrane receptor, to mediate endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. This interaction is crucial for the reabsorption of albumin in the kidney's proximal tubule, as megalin acts as a coreceptor for cubilin (Birn2000Cubilin; Verroust2002The). Cubilin also interacts with amnionless (AMN), a single transmembrane protein, which is essential for its proper localization to the apical cell surface. The interaction between cubilin and AMN is necessary for the internalization of ligand complexes, and disruptions in this interaction can lead to diseases such as Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome (Strope2004Mouse; Larsen2018Structural).

Cubilin binds to various ligands, including intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complexes, albumin, and fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8). It acts as a high-affinity receptor for Fgf8, playing a role in vertebrate head development by enhancing Fgf ligand endocytosis and availability to Fgf receptors (Cases2013Cubilin). Cubilin's interactions with these proteins are critical for its role in nutrient reabsorption and developmental processes.
