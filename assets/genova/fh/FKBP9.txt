# FKBP9

## Overview
FKBP9 is a gene that encodes the FKBP prolyl isomerase 9 protein, a member of the FK506-binding protein family. This protein is characterized by its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity, which plays a crucial role in protein folding and function. FKBP prolyl isomerase 9 is primarily localized to the rough endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in calcium-mediated processes due to its EF-hand domain, which facilitates calcium binding (Ishikawa2015Ziplocing). The protein undergoes various post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, which regulate its stability and activity (Xu2020FKBP9; Ishikawa2015Ziplocing). FKBP9 is implicated in several cellular pathways, including the p38MAPK signaling pathway and the unfolded protein response, highlighting its significance in cellular stress responses and oncogenic processes (Xu2020FKBP9).

## Structure
FKBP9, also known as FKBP prolyl isomerase 9, is a member of the FK506-binding protein family, characterized by its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. The protein is encoded by the FKBP9 gene and is known to localize to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) (Ishikawa2015Ziplocing). FKBP9 shares high homology with FKBP65 and is part of a class of FKBPs that contain four FKBP-type domains linked to a single EF-hand domain, which is involved in calcium binding (Ishikawa2015Ziplocing). 

The protein exhibits post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity (Ishikawa2015Ziplocing). FKBP9 is also subject to ubiquitination, particularly at lysine 265, which targets it for proteasomal degradation under stress conditions (Xu2020FKBP9). 

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of FKBP9 are not provided, the presence of the EF-hand domain suggests a role in calcium-mediated processes, and the FKBP-type domains are likely involved in its isomerase activity (SchieneFischer2015Multidomain). The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the available context.

## Clinical Significance
FKBP9 has been implicated in the progression of glioblastoma (GBM), a type of high-grade glioma. High expression levels of FKBP9 are associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients, as it promotes malignant behavior in glioblastoma cells and confers resistance to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducers (Xu2020FKBP9). FKBP9 influences the activation of the p38MAPK signaling pathway, which is critical for its oncogenic activity in GBM. Knockdown of FKBP9 results in decreased phosphorylation of p38MAPK, while its overexpression activates this pathway, suggesting that p38MAPK is a key mediator of FKBP9's role in GBM (Xu2020FKBP9).

A specific mutation in FKBP9, the M541I variant, has been identified in clinical glioma tissue samples. This mutation exhibits less oncogenic effects compared to the wild-type FKBP9, resulting in smaller tumor sizes and decreased proliferation in mouse models (Xu2020FKBP9). FKBP9 is also associated with poor prognoses in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and prostate cancer, with alterations in its expression linked to worse outcomes in these cancers (Wang2022Penetrating). In LUAD, FKBP9 expression is positively associated with neutrophil infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, indicating its role in the immunological landscape of the disease (Wang2022Penetrating).

## Interactions
FKBP9, a member of the FK506-binding protein family, is involved in several interactions that influence glioblastoma (GBM) progression. It plays a significant role in activating the p38MAPK signaling pathway through ASK1, which contributes to the clonogenic growth of GBM cells. This interaction is crucial for the oncogenic effects of FKBP9, as evidenced by the decreased phosphorylation of p38MAPK and reduced levels of cyclinD1 upon FKBP9 knockdown. Conversely, overexpression of FKBP9 leads to robust activation of p38MAPK and increased phosphorylation of downstream targets such as pS6 and p4EBP1 (Xu2020FKBP9).

FKBP9 also modulates the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway, part of the unfolded protein response (UPR) activated during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This modulation helps confer resistance to ER stress inducers, which typically lead to FKBP9 ubiquitination and degradation (Xu2020FKBP9). These interactions highlight FKBP9's role in regulating UPR signaling and its contribution to GBM cell survival and proliferation. While FKBP9's interactions in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) are less detailed, its expression is associated with immune cell infiltration, particularly with neutrophils, suggesting potential roles in the tumor microenvironment (Wang2022Penetrating).
