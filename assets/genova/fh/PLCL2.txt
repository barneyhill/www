# PLCL2

## Overview
PLCL2, or phospholipase C-like 2, is a gene that encodes a member of the phospholipase C-like protein family, which is involved in intracellular signaling pathways. Unlike classical phospholipase C enzymes, the protein encoded by PLCL2 lacks phospholipase activity but is thought to play a regulatory role in cellular processes. The PLCL2 protein is categorized as a signaling molecule and is implicated in various cellular functions, including the modulation of signal transduction pathways. It is expressed in multiple tissues and has been associated with several physiological and pathological conditions, such as systemic sclerosis, colon cancer, and cardiovascular diseases (Huang2022FineMapping; Arismendi2015Identification; Dmitriev2020Functional; Hirokawa2014A).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
PLCL2 has been implicated in several diseases due to its genetic variations and altered expression levels. In systemic sclerosis (SSc), the PLCL2 rs1372072 variant is associated with increased susceptibility, particularly in the limited cutaneous subgroup and in patients with anti-centromere antibodies. This variant shows an odds ratio of 1.23 for limited cutaneous SSc and 1.29 for the presence of anti-centromere antibodies, indicating a significant role in the disease's pathogenesis (Arismendi2015Identification). 

In colon cancer, PLCL2 is frequently hypermethylated, leading to decreased expression. This downregulation is observed in 67% of colon cancer cases, suggesting that PLCL2 may function as a tumor suppressor gene. The hypermethylation and reduced expression of PLCL2 are associated with the progression of colon cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Dmitriev2020Functional).

PLCL2 is also linked to ischemic stroke risk in patients with metabolic syndrome. Specific polymorphisms, such as rs4685423 and rs4618210, are associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke, suggesting a protective role in this context (Huang2022FineMapping). Additionally, PLCL2 has been identified as a susceptibility locus for myocardial infarction, with its expression potentially affecting the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (Hirokawa2014A).
