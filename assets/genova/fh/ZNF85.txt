# ZNF85

## Overview
ZNF85 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 85, a member of the ZNF91 family, characterized by its zinc finger motifs and a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain. The protein is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation, functioning as a transcriptional repressor. It achieves this through its KRAB domain, which interacts with nuclear proteins to modulate gene expression. The zinc finger motifs, located in the carboxy-terminal region, facilitate DNA binding in a zinc-dependent manner, underscoring the protein's role in gene regulation. ZNF85 is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the testis and certain cancer cell lines, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis and potential implications in cancer biology (PONCELET1998Functional). The gene's expression and methylation status have been linked to cancer-related processes, highlighting its clinical significance (Liu2019Identification; Micci2010Array‐CGH).

## Structure
The ZNF85 protein is a member of the ZNF91 family and is characterized by its KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) domain and zinc finger motifs. The primary structure of ZNF85 includes 15 tandemly repeated C2H2 Krüppel-type zinc finger units, which are highly homologous to the Krüppel family of zinc finger proteins (PONCELET1998Functional). These zinc fingers are located in the carboxy-terminal region of the protein and are responsible for its DNA-binding activity, which is zinc-dependent (PONCELET1998Functional).

The protein also contains a KRAB domain at the amino-terminal, which is involved in transcriptional repression. This domain is composed of two subdomains, KRAB(A) and KRAB(B), with the KRAB(A) domain alone exhibiting repressing activity that is enhanced by the KRAB(B) domain (PONCELET1998Functional). The KRAB domain interacts with nuclear proteins, potentially acting as cofactors for repression (PONCELET1998Functional).

ZNF85 has a nuclear localization signal within the spacer region connecting the KRAB domain to the zinc finger repeats, ensuring its localization in the nucleus (PONCELET1998Functional). The protein is expressed in multiple tissues, with a splice variant lacking zinc fingers but retaining the KRAB domain (Hamilton2006Evolutionary).

## Function
ZNF85 is a zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It is a member of the ZNF91 family, characterized by 15 tandemly repeated zinc fingers and a KRAB domain at the amino-terminal region (PONCELET1998Functional). The KRAB domain is known for its transcriptional repressing activity, which is enhanced by the presence of the KRAB(B) domain. This domain interacts with several nuclear proteins, potentially acting as cofactors for repression (PONCELET1998Functional).

ZNF85 is highly expressed in the testis, seminomas, and the NT2/D1 teratocarcinoma cell line, suggesting a specialized function in these tissues (PONCELET1998Functional). The protein binds DNA with high affinity in a zinc-dependent manner, indicating its role in gene regulation through DNA-binding capability (PONCELET1998Functional). The nuclear localization of ZNF85 is facilitated by a nuclear localization signal in the spacer region connecting the KRAB domain with the zinc finger repeats (PONCELET1998Functional).

The ZNF85 protein's potential involvement in spermatogenesis is suggested by its expression pattern, although this role is not conserved across all mammals, reflecting evolutionary differences in spermatogenesis regulation (PONCELET1998Functional).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF85, a member of the zinc finger protein family, has been implicated in various cancer-related processes due to alterations in its expression and methylation status. In ovarian carcinogenesis, ZNF85 is located on chromosome 19, a region frequently gained in ovarian carcinomas. This gain often involves zinc finger genes, which may be overexpressed or rearranged, potentially contributing to cancer development. The overexpression of ZNF85 could play a role in the altered regulation of key target genes, promoting carcinogenesis (Micci2010Array‐CGH).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), ZNF85 is identified as one of the top hypermethylated genes associated with lymph node metastasis. This hypermethylation suggests a role in transcriptional regulation processes that contribute to cancer metastasis, highlighting the clinical significance of ZNF85 methylation changes in cancer progression (Liu2019Identification).

ZNF85 is also predominantly expressed in seminomas and the NT2/D1 teratocarcinoma cell line, suggesting a specialized function in testis tissue and potential involvement in testis-specific diseases or conditions. However, specific clinical conditions resulting from mutations or alterations in ZNF85 expression are not detailed (PONCELET1998Functional).

## Interactions
The ZNF85 protein, a member of the ZNF91 family, is involved in several interactions with nuclear proteins and nucleic acids. It contains a KRAB domain that exhibits transcriptional repression activity. This repression is enhanced by the KRAB(B) domain, which binds several nuclear proteins that may act as critical cofactors for repression (PONCELET1998Functional). The KRAB(A) domain of ZNF85 binds to proteins of 19, 24, and 100 kDa, while the KRAB(B) domain interacts with proteins of 22 and 35 kDa, as demonstrated using GST fusion proteins in a Far-Western blot assay (PONCELET1998Functional).

ZNF85 also exhibits strong DNA-binding activity, which is zinc-dependent. This activity was confirmed through zinc blotting and Southwestern blotting procedures, showing that the zinc finger domain of ZNF85 binds DNA with high affinity under high-stringency conditions (PONCELET1998Functional). The protein's DNA-binding ability is crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor, although the specific DNA sequences it targets are not detailed in the available context. The nuclear localization of ZNF85 is facilitated by a nuclear localization signal in the spacer region, allowing it to function effectively within the nucleus (PONCELET1998Functional).
