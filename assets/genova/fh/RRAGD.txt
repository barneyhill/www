# RRAGD

## Overview
The RRAGD gene encodes the Ras-related GTP-binding protein D (RagD), a member of the Rag GTPase family, which plays a pivotal role in the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. RagD is a GTPase that forms heterodimers with other Rag proteins, such as RagA or RagB, to facilitate the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 at the lysosomal surface. This process is crucial for nutrient sensing and energy homeostasis, as mTORC1 regulates cell growth, metabolism, and autophagy in response to amino acid availability (Sambri2023RagD; Gollwitzer2022A). The protein's unique structural features, including its unstructured N- and C-terminal regions, distinguish it from its paralogue RagC and enhance its lysosomal localization and interaction with the LAMTOR complex (Gollwitzer2022A). Mutations in RRAGD can lead to constitutive activation of RagD, impacting cellular processes such as lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, and are associated with clinical conditions like kidney tubulopathy and cardiomyopathy (Sambri2023RagD; Schlingmann2021mTORactivating).

## Structure
The RRAGD gene encodes the RagD GTPase, a protein involved in mTORC1 signaling and lysosomal biogenesis. RagD is part of the Rag GTPase family, which includes RagA, RagB, and RagC, and is characterized by a GTP-binding domain. The protein's structure is influenced by its unstructured N- and C-terminal regions, which are crucial for its functional properties and differentiate it from RagC, despite their high sequence identity (Gollwitzer2022A).

RagD forms heterodimers with other Rag GTPases, such as RagA or RagB, contributing to its quaternary structure. These dimers are essential for the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 at the lysosomal surface, a process that is more effective with RagD-containing dimers due to their stronger lysosomal localization and higher affinity for the LAMTOR complex (Gollwitzer2022A).

Mutations in the RRAGD gene can lead to constitutive activation of RagD, affecting its GTP-binding and hydrolysis activity. These mutations often result in a nucleotide-free or GDP-loaded state, which are active conformations, and can impair the nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, impacting lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy (Sambri2023RagD).

## Function
The RRAGD gene encodes the RagD protein, a member of the Rag GTPase family, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, RagD forms heterodimers with RagA or RagB, facilitating the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 at the lysosomal surface. This process is essential for nutrient sensing and energy homeostasis, as mTORC1 regulates cell growth, metabolism, and autophagy in response to amino acid availability (Sambri2023RagD; Gollwitzer2022A).

RagD has a stronger association with lysosomes compared to its paralogue RagC, enhancing the phosphorylation of transcription factors TFEB and TFE3, which are involved in lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy regulation. Under nutrient-replete conditions, mTORC1 phosphorylates these factors, causing their cytoplasmic sequestration. When mTORC1 is inactive, TFEB and TFE3 relocate to the nucleus to promote gene expression (Gollwitzer2022A).

The nucleotide-binding state of RagD, unlike RagA/B, does not significantly affect the phosphorylation of canonical mTORC1 substrates like S6K and 4E-BP1, indicating a substrate-specific pathway termed 'non-canonical mTORC1 signaling' (Sambri2023RagD). RagD's proper function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in response to metabolic and environmental stress (Sambri2023RagD).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RRAGD gene, which encodes the RagD GTPase, are associated with a novel autosomal dominant condition characterized by kidney tubulopathy and cardiomyopathy. These mutations lead to the production of 'autoactivating' RagD proteins that cause constitutive phosphorylation of TFEB and TFE3 by mTORC1, inhibiting their nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. This inhibition impairs the cellular response to lysosomal and mitochondrial injury, contributing to the development of kidney tubulopathy and cardiomyopathy (Sambri2023RagD).

The condition, known as kidney tubulopathy and cardiomyopathy (KICA) syndrome, is characterized by symptoms such as hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, salt-wasting, nephrocalcinosis, and dilated cardiomyopathy. These symptoms are linked to defects in renal electrolyte handling and cardiac function due to the constitutive activation of mTOR signaling caused by RRAGD mutations (Schlingmann2021mTORactivating).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high expression of RRAGD is associated with poorer overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Knockdown of RRAGD in cell lines significantly inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in promoting HCC progression and regulating the Warburg effect, a key metabolic hallmark of cancer (Ding2021Ras).

## Interactions
RRAGD, a Ras-related GTP-binding protein, interacts with several proteins to regulate mTORC1 signaling. It forms heterodimers with RRAGA or RRAGB, which are crucial for the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 at the lysosomal surface. This interaction is essential for the phosphorylation of lysosomal substrates such as TFEB and TFE3, transcription factors involved in lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy (Gollwitzer2022A).

RRAGD exhibits a strong binding affinity to the LAMTOR complex, particularly the p18/LAMTOR1 component, which enhances its ability to recruit mTORC1 to lysosomes. This interaction is more pronounced in RRAGD compared to its paralogue RRAGC, due to differences in their N- and C-terminal regions (Gollwitzer2022A).

Mutations in RRAGD can lead to auto-activation, affecting its interaction with TFEB independently of FLCN, a protein that typically regulates this interaction. These mutations result in impaired TFEB nuclear translocation, which is critical for cellular processes regulated by mTORC1 (Sambri2023RagD). These interactions highlight RRAGD's role in cellular signaling and its impact on diseases such as kidney tubulopathy and cardiomyopathy (Schlingmann2021mTORactivating).
