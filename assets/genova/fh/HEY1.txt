# HEY1

## Overview
HEY1 is a gene that encodes the protein hes related family bHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 1, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix-Orange (bHLH-O) family of transcription factors. This protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor and plays a crucial role in the Notch signaling pathway, which is involved in regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The HEY1 protein is characterized by its bHLH domain, essential for DNA binding and dimerization, and a conserved C-terminal YRPW motif, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. It is involved in various developmental processes, including cardiovascular development and neurogenesis, and is particularly significant in endothelial cells for vascular development. HEY1 also interacts with the androgen receptor, acting as a corepressor, which suggests a role in modulating androgen signaling pathways. Alterations in HEY1 expression have been linked to several cancers and congenital heart defects, underscoring its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Watanabe2020Importance; Belandia2005Hey1; Heisig2012Target).

## Structure
HEY1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix-Orange (bHLH-O) family. It contains a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain, which is crucial for DNA binding and dimerization, and an Orange domain that may also participate in dimerization (Heisig2012Target). The protein also features a conserved C-terminal YRPW motif, which is important for protein-protein interactions, although its specific interaction partners are not well defined (Heisig2012Target).

HEY1 undergoes post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation at serine 68 (Ser-68), which is located within the helix 1 of the HLH domain. This phosphorylation affects HEY1's stability and its ability to interact with other proteins, such as p53 and HEY2, and modulates its transcriptional activity (LópezMateo2016HEY1). The phosphorylation is mediated by kinases STK38 and STK38L and does not alter HEY1's nuclear localization (LópezMateo2016HEY1).

HEY1 functions as a transcriptional repressor and is involved in the Notch signaling pathway. It interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) and other co-repressors, such as Sin3, through its bHLH domain, indicating a role in modulating transcriptional repression (Belandia2005Hey1; LópezMateo2016HEY1). The protein's structure and modifications are integral to its function in cellular processes like cell cycle arrest and differentiation.

## Function
HEY1 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, HEY1 functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, binding to DNA near transcriptional start sites to modulate gene expression. It is involved in the regulation of approximately 500-2,000 mRNAs, despite having around 10,000 binding sites in the genome, indicating a modulatory role rather than a simple on/off switch in gene expression (Heisig2012Target).

HEY1 is active in the nucleus and is essential for several developmental processes, including cardiovascular development, neurogenesis, and maintaining stem cell populations. It is particularly important in endothelial cells, where it regulates vascular development and morphogenesis of thoracic great vessels (Watanabe2020Importance). HEY1 also acts as a corepressor for the androgen receptor (AR), inhibiting transcription from androgen-dependent target genes, which suggests a mechanism for cross talk between Notch and androgen-signaling pathways (Belandia2005Hey1). This interaction is crucial in tissues like the prostate, where HEY1 colocalizes with AR in epithelial cells (Belandia2005Hey1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HEY1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the NOTCH4/HEY1 pathway is upregulated, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increasing tumorigenicity. HEY1 activation supports SOX2 expression, a marker for cancer stem cells, and is associated with poor prognosis in HNSCC (Fukusumi2020Reciprocal). In glioblastoma (GBM), HEY1 is overexpressed due to hypomethylation of its promoter, contributing to the tumor's proliferative and invasive properties. Silencing HEY1 reduces invasion, migration, and proliferation of GBM cells, indicating its role in tumor progression (Tsung2017Methylation).

HEY1 is also involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factors and associated with shorter survival and advanced tumor stages (KungChun2019Hypoxia). In mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, the HEY1-NCOA2 fusion gene modulates chondrogenic differentiation and contributes to cancer development (Tanaka2023HEY1NCOA2).

HEY1's role extends to congenital heart defects, where its combined loss with HeyL leads to impaired epithelial to mesenchymal transition, resulting in severe heart malformations (Fischer2007Combined). These findings highlight HEY1's significant impact on cancer progression and congenital diseases.

## Interactions
HEY1, a transcriptional repressor, engages in various protein-protein interactions that influence its function. It interacts with the corepressor protein mSin3A, forming a repressosome complex that represses the RTA promoter in Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), maintaining viral latency. This interaction is disrupted by the RTA protein, leading to HEY1 degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (Gould2009Kaposi’s).

HEY1 also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), acting as a corepressor by binding to the AR's activation function-1 (AF1) domain, thereby repressing AR-dependent transcription (Belandia2005Hey1). It interacts with the bHLH-PAS domain of SRC1, a coactivator, indicating a regulatory role in AR activity (Belandia2005Hey1).

In the context of p53 signaling, HEY1 interacts with ribosomal proteins such as RPL11, inhibiting MDM2-mediated p53 degradation. This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation at Ser-68, which inhibits HEY1's interaction with both MDM2 and RPL11 (LópezMateo2016HEY1). HEY1's phosphorylation at Ser-68 also affects its ability to enhance p53 transcriptional activity (LópezMateo2016HEY1).
