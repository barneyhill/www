# EVX1

## Overview
EVX1, or even-skipped homeobox 1, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in crucial developmental processes, particularly during early embryogenesis. The protein product of EVX1, a homeobox protein, plays a significant role in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and the anterior-posterior patterning of the developing embryo. It functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator, influencing the expression of genes necessary for the development of posterior mesodermal tissues while repressing anterior markers. EVX1 is a downstream effector of key signaling pathways, such as BMP4 and WNT, which are vital for posterior tissue patterning. The protein's activity is characterized by its ability to bind DNA and interact with other proteins, facilitating complex regulatory networks essential for proper cell fate specification. Clinically, EVX1 is notable for its hypermethylation in prostate cancer, serving as a potential biomarker for disease prognosis (Truong2012Evenskipped; Bell2016The; Kalisz2012EVENSKIPPED).

## Function
The EVX1 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation and anterior-posterior patterning during early development. In hESCs, EVX1 is involved in the differentiation of cells into posterior streak-like cells and mesoderm by repressing anterior streak and definitive endoderm markers such as goosecoid (GSC) and SOX17. This repression is crucial for promoting posterior development and inhibiting anterior development, highlighting EVX1's role in maintaining the balance of gene expression necessary for proper cell differentiation (Kalisz2012EVENSKIPPED).

EVX1 functions as a downstream effector of BMP4 and WNT signaling pathways, which are essential for posterior tissue patterning. It influences the expression of genes associated with the posterior side of the embryo, such as those involved in blood, blood vessel, and cardiac development. In the absence of EVX1, there is an upregulation of anterior genes and a downregulation of posterior genes, indicating its role as a transcriptional activator of posterior mesoderm genes and a repressor of anterior/dorsal genes (Bell2016The).

EVX1 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and directly represses the expression of target genes like GSC, contributing to the proper specification of cell fates during early development (Kalisz2012EVENSKIPPED).

## Clinical Significance
The EVX1 gene is clinically significant in the context of prostate cancer. It is frequently hypermethylated in prostate cancer tissues, an epigenetic alteration that can suppress gene expression. This hypermethylation is a strong independent predictor of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence following prostatectomy, particularly in intermediate-grade prostate cancer. Studies have shown that EVX1 hypermethylation is present in a significant majority of prostate cancer tumors compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues, and it is associated with worse recurrence-free survival. This suggests that EVX1 hypermethylation could serve as a biomarker for prostate cancer prognosis and progression (Truong2012Evenskipped).

In embryonic development, the EVX1 gene plays a crucial role in anterior-posterior patterning during gastrulation. Disruption of EVX1 in mice leads to early postimplantation lethality, indicating its essential role in early development. The absence of EVX1 expression results in defects in the differentiation of extraembryonic tissues and morphogenesis, leading to embryonic lethality shortly after implantation. This highlights the gene's critical function in the regulation of cell differentiation and tissue formation during early embryogenesis (Spyropoulos1994Targeted).

## Interactions
EVX1, a human homeobox protein, is involved in transcriptional repression through interactions that do not solely depend on direct DNA binding. The C-terminal region of EVX1, rich in alanine and proline, is crucial for its repressive function, suggesting that this region may facilitate interactions with other proteins rather than specific DNA motifs (Briata1995Transcriptional). EVX1's repressive activity is independent of specific DNA-binding sites, indicating that it may interact with general transcription factors to exert its effects (Briata1995Transcriptional).

In the context of human embryonic stem cell differentiation, EVX1 interacts with the GSC promoter, particularly in BMP4-treated cells, to repress GSC expression. This interaction is confirmed through ChIP analysis and EMSA, which demonstrate EVX1's binding to specific sequences in the GSC promoter (Kalisz2012EVENSKIPPED). EVX1 is also a downstream target of BMP signaling, part of the TGFβ superfamily, and interacts with GSC in mediating cell fate decisions, potentially influencing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Mallak2015Contribution). These interactions highlight EVX1's role in modulating gene expression through complex protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.
