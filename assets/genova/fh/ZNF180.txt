# ZNF180

## Overview
ZNF180 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 180, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by their ability to bind nucleic acids. Zinc finger protein 180 functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in gene regulation by interacting with DNA and RNA. It is particularly significant in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), where it influences the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis, such as METTL14, an RNA methyltransferase (Xu2024Zinc). The protein's ability to bind single-stranded RNA suggests additional roles in post-transcriptional regulation (Bendak2012A). ZNF180's expression is modulated by microRNA-181a, which can downregulate its activity, highlighting its complex regulatory network (Huang2010MicroRNA-181a). The gene's expression levels have been associated with clinical outcomes in CRC, making it a potential biomarker for prognosis and a target for therapeutic strategies (Xu2024Zinc).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF180 has been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) due to its role as a transcription factor that influences the expression of METTL14, a key RNA methyltransferase. Alterations in ZNF180 expression, particularly its downregulation, have been associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients. This downregulation is often attributed to hypermethylation of the ZNF180 promoter, which correlates with decreased expression levels in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues (Xu2024Zinc). 

High expression of ZNF180 is linked to longer overall survival and disease-free survival in CRC patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. Conversely, low levels of ZNF180 are associated with advanced cancer stages and increased mortality risk (Xu2024Zinc). The overexpression of ZNF180 has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and enhance sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), indicating its role as a tumor suppressor (Xu2024Zinc).

The interaction between ZNF180 and METTL14 is significant, as METTL14 is also considered a tumor suppressor. The positive correlation between their expressions suggests that ZNF180 may regulate METTL14, contributing to its tumor-suppressive effects (Xu2024Zinc). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZNF180 in CRC, particularly in its potential to serve as a biomarker for prognosis and a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
Zinc finger protein 180 (ZNF180) is involved in several interactions with nucleic acids and proteins, particularly in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC). ZNF180 has been shown to interact with the METTL14 gene, a major RNA N6-adenosine methyltransferase, by binding to its promoter region and enhancing its transcriptional activity. This interaction leads to increased METTL14 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, contributing to the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation in CRC cells (Xu2024Zinc).

ZNF180 also demonstrates the ability to bind single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), as evidenced by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) results. This suggests a potential role in post-transcriptional gene regulation, although the specific functional implications of this RNA-binding capability remain to be fully elucidated (Bendak2012A).

Additionally, ZNF180 expression is modulated by microRNA-181a (miR-181a), which targets the coding region of ZNF180, leading to its downregulation. This interaction highlights a regulatory mechanism by which miR-181a can influence ZNF180 expression and potentially its interactions with other nucleic acids or proteins (Huang2010MicroRNA-181a).
