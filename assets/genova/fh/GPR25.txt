# GPR25

## Overview
GPR25 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 25, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is involved in various physiological processes, primarily through its interaction with the chemokine CXCL17, suggesting a role in immune cell function and mucosal immunity (Hu2024Identification). GPR25 is predominantly expressed in immune cells and is implicated in signal transduction pathways that may influence cardiovascular and metabolic health (Hu2024Identification). While the receptor's specific molecular functions in humans are not fully understood, its evolutionary conservation across vertebrates indicates potential roles beyond its known interactions, warranting further research into its physiological and therapeutic significance (Zhang2018The).

## Structure
GPR25 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that exhibits a typical GPCR structure with seven transmembrane domains (TMDs), a short extracellular N-terminus, and a short intracellular C-terminus (Hu2024Identification). The receptor features conserved cysteine residues, C112 and C191, which form a disulfide bond tethering the extracellular loop 2 to the extracellular end of TMD2. Another disulfide bond is formed by C30 and C279, linking the extracellular N-terminal region to the extracellular end of TMD7. This latter bond is present in most GPR25 orthologs but is less common in other GPCRs, appearing in some chemokine receptors (Hu2024Identification).

The orthosteric ligand pocket of GPR25 is formed by the seven TMDs and includes conserved residues such as W95, L92, W105, R178, and W257, which are likely involved in ligand binding (Hu2024Identification). The receptor also contains the conserved D/ERY motif, important for G protein-coupling, and the NPxxY motif, which are characteristic of functional GPCRs (Zhang2018The). GPR25 shares sequence identity with the Apelin receptor (APLNR), particularly in the transmembrane domains, suggesting a close evolutionary relationship (Zhang2018The). However, specific details on post-translational modifications, splice variant isoforms, or quaternary structure are not provided in the available data.

## Function
GPR25 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that has been identified as a receptor for the chemokine CXCL17. This interaction suggests a potential role for GPR25 in immune cell function, as CXCL17 is a chemoattractant primarily expressed in mucosal tissues such as the lung and stomach, while GPR25 is predominantly expressed in immune cells, including T-cells, B-cells, and plasma cells (Hu2024Identification). The binding of CXCL17 to GPR25 activates the receptor, leading to β-arrestin recruitment, a process that is crucial for receptor signaling and regulation (Hu2024Identification).

The specific molecular processes involving GPR25 in healthy human cells are not fully understood, but its expression in immune cells and mucosal tissues suggests a role in immune response and possibly in mucosal immunity (Hu2024Identification). The receptor's presence in all vertebrates indicates it may have other ligands beyond CXCL17, which could predate the chemokine (Hu2024Identification). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the physiological roles and potential therapeutic implications of GPR25 in human health.

## Clinical Significance
GPR25, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family, has been implicated in various cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Research suggests that variations in the GPR25 gene may be linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and hypertension. These associations are thought to arise from the gene's role in signal transduction pathways that regulate blood pressure and vascular function. Alterations in the expression levels of GPR25 or mutations within the gene could potentially disrupt these pathways, leading to pathological conditions.

Studies have also explored the connection between GPR25 and metabolic disorders. Changes in the gene's expression or function may influence metabolic processes, although the exact mechanisms remain under investigation. The potential impact of GPR25 on these conditions highlights its significance in maintaining cardiovascular and metabolic health. Ongoing research aims to further elucidate the specific contributions of GPR25 to these diseases, which could eventually inform therapeutic strategies targeting this receptor.

## Interactions
GPR25, a G protein-coupled receptor, has been identified as a receptor for the chemokine CXCL17. This interaction was demonstrated using a NanoBiT-based β-arrestin recruitment assay, which showed that CXCL17 functions as an agonist for GPR25, leading to the recruitment of β-arrestin. The interaction is dependent on specific conserved residues in both CXCL17 and GPR25, particularly the C-terminal residues of CXCL17 and the W95 and R178 residues of GPR25 (Hu2024Identification). This specific binding model suggests a unique interaction between CXCL17 and GPR25, as CXCL17 did not activate 17 other tested GPCRs (Hu2024Identification).

In non-mammalian vertebrates, GPR25 can be activated by Apelin and Apela peptides, similar to the Apelin receptor (APLNR). This activation is linked to the Gi-cAMP signaling pathway, although human GPR25 does not respond to these peptides in vitro (Zhang2018The). The study suggests that mammalian GPR25 may have undergone structural changes leading to functional differences from non-mammalian vertebrates (Zhang2018The). These findings highlight the potential for GPR25 to participate in complex signaling pathways, although specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in humans remain to be fully elucidated.
