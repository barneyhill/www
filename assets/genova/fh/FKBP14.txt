# FKBP14

## Overview
FKBP14 is a gene that encodes the protein FKBP prolyl isomerase 14, also known as FKBP22, which is a member of the FK506-binding protein family. This protein functions as a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) and acts as a molecular chaperone within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), playing a critical role in the folding and assembly of specific collagen types, including types III, VI, and X (Giunta2018A; Lim2019Transcriptome). The FKBP14 protein is characterized by a conserved FKBP domain essential for its isomerase activity and an EF-hand domain that suggests a role in calcium signaling (GharteyKwansah2018Comparative). Mutations in the FKBP14 gene are linked to kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder, and the gene has also been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in colon carcinoma (p&gt; FKBP14; Giunta2018A; Yang2019&lt).

## Structure
The FKBP14 protein, encoded by the FKBP14 gene, is a member of the FK506-binding protein family and functions as a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase). It is involved in protein folding, particularly of collagen types III, VI, and X, acting as a molecular chaperone within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Giunta2018A; Lim2019Transcriptome). The protein contains a highly conserved FKBP domain consisting of 95 amino acids, which is crucial for its isomerase activity (GharteyKwansah2018Comparative). Additionally, FKBP14 includes an EF-hand domain, which is known to bind calcium ions, suggesting a role in calcium signaling or regulation (GharteyKwansah2018Comparative).

Structurally, FKBP14 is characterized by a C-terminal helical structure, which is a common feature among certain FKBP family members (Somarelli2008Structure‐based). The protein's tertiary structure includes a putative PPIase active site, with the Met48 residue being highly conserved and located near this site (Giunta2018A). Mutations in this region, such as the Met48Lys variant, can alter the protein's function by affecting its binding affinity to collagen and its PPIase activity (Ishikawa2020The). FKBP14 is localized in the ER, indicating its involvement in protein folding and processing within this cellular compartment (GharteyKwansah2018Comparative).

## Function
FKBP14 encodes the protein FKBP22, which functions as a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) and molecular chaperone in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) of cells. This protein plays a crucial role in collagen biosynthesis by catalyzing the folding of specific collagen types, including type III, VI, and X, but not type I, II, or V (Ishikawa2015Ziplocing; Ishikawa2020The). FKBP22's activity is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix, ensuring proper collagen folding and assembly, which is vital for the normal development and maintenance of connective tissues (Semyachkina2021EhlersDanlos; Giunta2018A).

In healthy human cells, FKBP14 is involved in the posttranslational modification of polypeptide chains containing hydroxyproline, a process critical for collagen synthesis and organization (Semyachkina2021EhlersDanlos). The protein's ability to recognize modified proline residues, such as 4-hydroxyproline, supports its role in collagen folding (Ishikawa2015Ziplocing). FKBP22 also contributes to the regulation of ER cisternae size and structure, with its deficiency leading to ER cisternae enlargement and fragmentation of elastic fibers (Semyachkina2021EhlersDanlos). These functions underscore FKBP14's importance in maintaining normal cellular architecture and tissue function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FKBP14 gene are associated with kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (kEDS), specifically the kyphoscoliotic type 2 (EDSKS2). This rare connective tissue disorder is characterized by severe congenital muscular hypotonia, early-onset progressive kyphoscoliosis, joint hypermobility, skin hyperelasticity, and hearing loss. The FKBP14 gene encodes the FKBP22 protein, which is involved in collagen folding and interacts with collagen types III, VI, and X. Mutations in FKBP14, such as the c.362dupC duplication, lead to a loss of function, disrupting normal collagen biosynthesis and affecting tissue integrity (Semyachkina2021EhlersDanlos; Giunta2018A).

In addition to its role in connective tissue disorders, FKBP14 has been implicated in cancer biology. It is upregulated in colon carcinoma tissues, where it promotes cell proliferation and migration through the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. High levels of FKBP14 expression are associated with poor prognosis in colon carcinoma patients, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (p&gt; FKBP14; Yang2019&lt). The altered expression of FKBP14 in these contexts highlights its clinical significance in both genetic disorders and oncological conditions.

## Interactions
FKBP14, also known as FKBP prolyl isomerase 14, is involved in several protein interactions, particularly with collagen types. It acts as a molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum, facilitating the folding of type III collagen and interacting with other collagen types such as IV, VI, and X (Ishikawa2023Local). The Met48Lys (M48K) mutation in FKBP14 affects its binding affinity to these collagens, generally weakening its interaction except for type X collagen, where the binding is stronger (Ishikawa2020The). This mutation also increases FKBP14's competition with Hsp47 during collagen biosynthesis (Ishikawa2020The).

FKBP14's interaction with collagen is influenced by the local net charge state of the collagen triple helix, which affects its binding specificity (Ishikawa2023Local). The protein's peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity is crucial for its role in collagen folding, and the M48K mutation reduces this activity by approximately 30% (Ishikawa2020The). FKBP14's interactions are not limited to collagen; it is also involved in cellular signaling pathways, such as the Notch signaling pathway, where it regulates presenilin protein levels and γ-secretase activity (GharteyKwansah2018Comparative).
