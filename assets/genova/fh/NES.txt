# NES

## Overview
The NES gene encodes nestin, a type VI intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in neural stem cells and various progenitor cells. Nestin is characterized by its unique molecular structure, which includes a central α-helical rod domain essential for filament assembly and interaction with other cytoskeletal components. Unlike other intermediate filaments, nestin forms heterodimers and heterotetramers with proteins such as vimentin, due to its truncated head domain. Functionally, nestin plays a critical role in the survival, self-renewal, and differentiation of neural stem cells, as well as in the regulation of endothelial cell proliferation. It is involved in various cellular processes through interactions with proteins like cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and gelsolin. Clinically, alterations in NES expression are associated with aggressive tumor characteristics and poor prognosis in several cancers, including breast and prostate cancer, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Bernal2018Nestinexpressing; Zhang2020Clinicopathological; Park2010Nestin).

## Structure
Nestin (NES) is a type VI intermediate filament protein characterized by a unique molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of 1618 amino acids, with a central α-helical rod domain flanked by a short N-terminal head and an unusually long C-terminal tail (Bott2020Intermediate; Xie2015Characterization). The rod domain is crucial for filament assembly and includes segments separated by linkers, facilitating coiled-coil interactions (Bernal2018Nestinexpressing; Lendahl1990CNS).

The secondary structure of nestin is rich in α-helices, particularly in the carboxyl-terminal domains, which contain sequence repeats that contribute to its high α-helical content (Steinert1999A). The tertiary structure is influenced by the long C-terminal tail, which may serve as a cross-bridging element between intermediate filaments and other cytoskeletal components (Steinert1999A).

In terms of quaternary structure, nestin does not form homopolymers due to its truncated head domain. Instead, it forms heterodimers and heterotetramers with other intermediate filament proteins like vimentin and α-internexin (Steinert1999A; Bott2020Intermediate). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate nestin's assembly and disassembly, impacting its role in cellular processes (Xie2015Characterization).

## Function
Nestin (NES) is an intermediate filament protein that plays a significant role in the survival and self-renewal of neural stem cells (NSCs). It acts as a scaffold for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), inhibiting its proapoptotic action, which helps prevent apoptosis in NSCs (Park2010Nestin). Nestin is crucial for maintaining the self-renewal capacity of NSCs, as its deficiency leads to increased apoptosis and a complete loss of neurosphere-forming ability, indicating a critical role in NSC survival (Park2010Nestin).

In endothelial cells (ECs), nestin is an endothelial-enriched intermediate filament protein that is independent of angiogenesis. It is involved in regulating EC proliferation, with its expression inhibiting cell division. Knockdown of NES increases EC proliferation, suggesting a role in maintaining vascular stability and integrity (Dusart2018A). Nestin's expression in ECs is modulated by mechanical forces such as shear stress, which influences its subcellular distribution and function (Dusart2018A).

Nestin is also expressed in various progenitor cells, where it is associated with essential functions such as self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. It plays a role in asymmetric cell division, crucial for maintaining the stem cell pool and generating differentiated cells (Bernal2018Nestinexpressing).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NES gene, which encodes the protein nestin, have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In breast cancer, increased nestin expression is associated with aggressive tumor characteristics, including higher histological grade, larger tumor size, and specific subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and basal-like phenotype. It is linked to poorer survival outcomes, such as reduced breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival, making it a marker for worse prognosis (Zhang2020Clinicopathological). Nestin is also implicated in tumor angiogenesis, contributing to tumor vascularization by differentiating into endothelial cells (Zhang2020Clinicopathological).

In prostate cancer, nestin expression is associated with advanced disease and metastasis, particularly in androgen-insensitive and castration-resistant cases. It is not present in androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-naive tumors but is induced by ADT, suggesting a role in metastasis and cancer lethality (Kleeberger2007Roles).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, nestin depletion leads to increased DNA damage and sensitivity to ionizing radiation, highlighting its role in tumorigenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (Ma2014Depletion). These findings underscore nestin's potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target across various cancer types.

## Interactions
Nestin, encoded by the NES gene, is known to interact with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It forms heterodimeric or heteropolymeric filaments with other intermediate filament proteins, such as vimentin, which is crucial for its structural assembly and function in cells (Bernal2018Nestinexpressing; Dusart2018A). In endothelial cells, nestin co-localizes with vimentin under both static and shear stress conditions, suggesting shared regulatory mechanisms for their spatial distribution (Dusart2018A).

In the context of human melanoma cells, nestin has been identified as interacting with gelsolin, a protein involved in actin filament dynamics. This interaction was revealed through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry studies, indicating a potential role in cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (Mazur2016Gelsolin).

Nestin also interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and its activator p35, influencing neuronal migration and differentiation. This interaction highlights nestin's involvement in regulating cell cycle and apoptosis, particularly in neural stem cells and progenitor cells (Bernal2018Nestinexpressing). These interactions underscore nestin's multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and its potential implications in various physiological and pathological contexts.
