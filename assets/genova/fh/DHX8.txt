# DHX8

## Overview
The DHX8 gene encodes the DEAH-box helicase 8, a member of the DEAH-box family of RNA helicases, which are characterized by their involvement in RNA processing and metabolism. The protein encoded by DHX8 is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing and the nuclear export of spliced mRNA. It is distinguished by its conserved C-terminal helicase domain, which includes two RecA-like domains essential for its helicase activity, as well as additional domains such as the Winged-Helix, ratchet-like, and Oligonucleotide Binding-fold domains that facilitate interactions with nucleic acids and protein cofactors. DHX8 is activated by RNA and is primarily active in the nucleus, where it unwinds RNA duplexes to aid in the removal of introns and the joining of exons, processes vital for proper gene expression and cellular function (Abdelhaleem2003The; Rehan2023Binding).

## Structure
The DHX8 protein is a member of the DEAH-box family of RNA helicases, characterized by the DEAH (Asp-Glu-Ala-His) motif. It features a conserved C-terminal helicase domain, which includes two RecA-like domains (RecA1 and RecA2) that form the helicase core. These domains contain up to 12 distinctive motifs involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, RNA binding, and helicase activity (Rehan2023Binding; 1). The C-terminal region of DHX8 also includes additional domains such as the Winged-Helix (WH), ratchet-like, and Oligonucleotide Binding (OB)-fold domains, which are involved in nucleic acid interactions and may serve as platforms for cofactor interactions (Rehan2023Binding; 1).

The protein is activated by the presence of RNA and participates in pre-mRNA splicing and the nuclear export of spliced mRNA (Rehan2023Binding). The 3D structure of DHX8 has been studied, with its interaction with compounds like novobiocin being explored through molecular docking techniques (Rehan2023Binding). The structure of DHX8 is conserved across species, indicating evolutionary conservation (Abdelhaleem2003The).

## Function
DHX8 (DEAH-box helicase 8) is an essential RNA helicase involved in several critical molecular processes within healthy human cells. It plays a pivotal role in pre-mRNA splicing, a process crucial for the maturation of mRNA. DHX8 facilitates the release of mature mRNA from spliceosomes, enabling its subsequent nuclear export, which is vital for proper gene expression and cellular function (Abdelhaleem2003The; Rehan2023Binding).

Structurally, DHX8 contains a conserved C-terminal helicase domain, which includes two RecA domains forming the helicase core. These domains are involved in ATP binding, hydrolysis, RNA binding, and helicase activity. The helicase domain also features Winged-Helix, ratchet-like, and Oligonucleotide Binding-fold domains, which contribute to its interaction with nucleic acids and protein cofactors (Rehan2023Binding; 1).

Functionally, DHX8 is active in the nucleus, where it is activated by the presence of RNA. It prefers adenine-rich RNA substrates and operates as an ATP-dependent helicase, unwinding RNA duplexes to facilitate the removal of introns and the joining of exons during splicing. This activity is essential for the proper processing and transport of mRNA, impacting various biological processes, including hematopoiesis (Rehan2023Binding).

## Clinical Significance
The DHX8 gene, encoding the DEAH-box helicase 8, is implicated in various diseases, particularly gastric cancer, through alterations in its expression and interactions. In gastric cancer, the circular RNA derived from DHX8, known as circDHX8, is significantly upregulated and contributes to cancer progression by promoting autophagy and stabilizing the ATG2B protein. This stabilization occurs through the inhibition of ATG2B's ubiquitination and degradation, facilitated by the interaction of circDHX8 with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF5 (Wei2024Human).

CircDHX8 enhances the malignancy of gastric cancer cells by increasing their proliferation, invasion, and migration capabilities. Its overexpression is associated with unfavorable pathological characteristics and a worse prognosis in gastric cancer patients (Wei2024Human). The study highlights that circDHX8 does not affect the expression of the linear DHX8 transcript, indicating that the circular form specifically contributes to the disease (Wei2024Human).

These findings suggest that targeting circDHX8 and its interactions could provide new avenues for precision treatment in gastric cancer, emphasizing the clinical significance of DHX8-related pathways in cancer progression (Wei2024Human).

## Interactions
DHX8, a DEAH-box helicase, is involved in RNA processing and splicing, primarily through its interactions with the spliceosome. This helicase facilitates the splicing process by associating with the spliceosome, where it aids in protein displacement, structural rearrangement, and stabilization of reaction intermediates, ensuring the fidelity and directionality of splicing (1 page 7 of 30). The structural features of DHX8, including its conserved C-terminal domains such as the OB-fold, winged-helix, and ratchet domains, suggest specific physical interactions with nucleic acids. These domains enable DHX8 to form stacking interactions with nucleic acid bases, indicating its role in RNA substrate binding and translocation (1 page 5 of 30).

While specific details on DHX8's interactions with other proteins are not extensively detailed, it is implied that, like other RNA helicases, DHX8 interacts with components of the spliceosome to assist in mRNA maturation (1 page 7 of 30). The helicase's activity is regulated by trans-acting proteins and post-translational modifications, which influence its interactions and activity within the spliceosome (1 page 7 of 30). These interactions are crucial for its function in RNA metabolism and splicing.
