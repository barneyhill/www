# TMPRSS11A

## Overview
TMPRSS11A is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane serine protease 11A, a type II transmembrane serine protease. This protein is characterized by its structure, which includes an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular region with a SEA domain and a serine protease domain. TMPRSS11A is primarily expressed in airway epithelial cells and is involved in the proteolytic activation of precursor proteins, playing a role in processes such as cell signaling and tissue remodeling (Zhang2020Intracellular). The protein is notable for its ability to undergo intracellular autoactivation, a process that distinguishes it from other transmembrane serine proteases (Zhang2020Intracellular). TMPRSS11A has been implicated in the cleavage of viral proteins, including the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, suggesting a potential role in viral pathogenesis (Zhang2020Intracellular). Additionally, it interacts with tumor suppressor genes and is involved in cellular processes related to cancer suppression and viral infectivity (Li2011A; Zhang2020Intracellular). Despite its involvement in these processes, the full physiological roles of TMPRSS11A in human health and disease remain to be fully elucidated.

## Structure
TMPRSS11A is a transmembrane serine protease composed of 418 amino acids. Its primary structure includes an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a single-span transmembrane domain, and an extracellular region that contains a SEA domain and a C-terminal serine protease domain (Zhang2020Intracellular). The protein undergoes cleavage at a conserved activation site between Arg186 and Ile187, which is essential for its activation. A disulfide bond between Cys175 and Cys292 links the protease domain to the propeptide region after cleavage (Zhang2020Intracellular).

The tertiary structure of TMPRSS11A is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are common in serine proteases to maintain structural integrity. The protein is expressed on the cell surface, as demonstrated in HEK293 cells, and can be detected through flow cytometry and immunostaining (Zhang2020Intracellular). TMPRSS11A is known to undergo intracellular autoactivation, converting from a zymogen to an active enzyme before reaching the cell surface, a process distinct from the extracellular activation seen in other transmembrane serine proteases (Zhang2020Intracellular). The protein can cleave the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, indicating its potential role in viral processing (Zhang2020Intracellular).

## Function
TMPRSS11A is a type II transmembrane serine protease expressed in airway epithelial cells, including those in the trachea, esophagus, stomach, bladder, and skin (Zhang2020Intracellular). It is involved in the proteolytic activation of precursor proteins, which is crucial for processes like cell signaling and tissue remodeling. TMPRSS11A undergoes intracellular autoactivation, converting from a zymogen to an active enzyme before reaching the cell surface (Zhang2020Intracellular). This activation is primarily mediated by autocatalysis, occurring before the protease reaches the cell surface, and is not dependent on its presence on the cell surface (Zhang2020Intracellular).

TMPRSS11A has been implicated in the cleavage of viral proteins, such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, suggesting a role in viral pathogenesis (Zhang2020Intracellular). Despite its expression in various tissues, Tmprss11a-deficient mice do not show noticeable defects in embryonic development or postnatal survival, indicating that TMPRSS11A may not be essential for normal tracheal structure but may have a regulatory function in the airway epithelium (Zhang2020Intracellular). The precise physiological roles of TMPRSS11A in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, but its activity is thought to influence cellular responses to environmental stimuli and contribute to maintaining epithelial barrier integrity.

## Clinical Significance
TMPRSS11A has been studied for its potential role in various diseases and conditions. A specific polymorphism in the TMPRSS11A gene, rs353163, results in a nonsynonymous substitution (Arg290Gln) and is predicted to be probably damaging. This polymorphism has been associated with an increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Vargas-Alarcón2020Variability). However, in the context of COVID-19, studies have not found a significant association between TMPRSS11A polymorphisms, including rs353163, and the severity of the disease in the Ukrainian population (izmailova2023polymorphism).

TMPRSS11A is also implicated in the regulation of migration and wound healing, with its expression levels increasing with age in skin and gingival tissues. Overexpression of TMPRSS11A is associated with decreased cell migration, spreading, and induced cellular senescence, which may have implications for tissue repair and aging (izmailova2023polymorphism). Despite its involvement in these cellular processes, no direct link has been established between TMPRSS11A mutations or expression alterations and specific diseases beyond its potential role in viral entry and cancer risk (izmailova2023polymorphism; Vargas-Alarcón2020Variability).

## Interactions
TMPRSS11A, also known as ECRG1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It directly interacts with the esophageal carcinoma-related gene 4 (ECRG4), a novel tumor suppressor gene. This interaction has been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce a G1 phase cell cycle block in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells. The co-expression of ECRG4 and TMPRSS11A significantly upregulates the p21 protein level, contributing to the suppression of cell proliferation in ESCC (Li2011A).

TMPRSS11A also plays a role in viral infections, particularly in the activation of coronavirus spike proteins. It undergoes intracellular autoactivation and can cleave the spike proteins of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, facilitating viral entry and cell-cell fusion. This protease activity is regulated by interactions with hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitors (HAI-1 and HAI-2), with HAI-2 being more effective in inhibiting TMPRSS11A activity (Zhang2020Intracellular). These interactions highlight TMPRSS11A's potential role in both cancer suppression and viral infectivity.
