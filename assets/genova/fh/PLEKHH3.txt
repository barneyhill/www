# PLEKHH3

## Overview
PLEKHH3 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology, MyTH4 and FERM domain containing H3, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of pleckstrin homology (PH), MyTH4, and FERM domains, which are typically associated with cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction. The PLEKHH3 protein is implicated in the regulation of endothelial cell function and tight junction formation, which are critical for maintaining vascular integrity. Research has highlighted its potential role in the pathophysiology of diseases such as prostate cancer and obstructive sleep apnea, suggesting that PLEKHH3 may influence disease progression through its effects on cellular structures and signaling pathways (Hunter2016Searching; Chen2017Genomewide). Further studies are required to fully understand the diverse functions and clinical implications of this gene and its encoded protein.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PLEKHH3 gene have been implicated in several health conditions. In the context of prostate cancer (PC), a study identified a truncating variant in the PLEKHH3 gene that demonstrated complete segregation with PC in families with a significant history of the disease. This suggests that mutations in PLEKHH3 may be associated with an increased risk of developing familial prostate cancer, particularly in cases without BRCA1/2 mutations (Hunter2016Searching).

In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), PLEKHH3 expression levels were found to correlate positively with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), a measure of OSA severity. This correlation was reversed with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, indicating that PLEKHH3 may play a role in chronic intermittent hypoxia-related endothelial dysfunction in OSA patients. The gene is thought to influence the formation of tight junctions in endothelial cells, which could impact the pathophysiology of OSA and related conditions (Chen2017Genomewide).

While PLEKHH3 has been identified in studies related to mastitis resistance in dairy cattle, its clinical significance in human diseases beyond prostate cancer and OSA remains to be fully elucidated (Cai2018Prioritizing). Further research is needed to establish the gene's role in other conditions.
