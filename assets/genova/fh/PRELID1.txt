# PRELID1

## Overview
PRELID1 is a gene that encodes the protein PRELI domain containing 1, which is integral to mitochondrial lipid metabolism. The protein is characterized by a PRELI domain and functions primarily as a lipid transfer protein within the mitochondria, specifically facilitating the transport of phosphatidic acid across the mitochondrial intermembrane space. This transport is crucial for the synthesis of cardiolipin, a phospholipid essential for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function (Miliara2019Structural; Potting2013TRIAP1PRELI). The PRELID1 protein forms a complex with TRIAP1, which is necessary for its stability and function in lipid transfer (Jeffers2017TgPRELID). Alterations in PRELID1 expression and its alternative polyadenylation have been associated with various cancer outcomes, highlighting its role in cellular stress response and mitochondrial integrity (Gillen2017Alternative; Wang2022Single).

## Structure
The PRELID1 protein is characterized by a PRELI domain, which plays a crucial role in lipid transfer within mitochondria. The primary structure of PRELID1 includes key residues such as K58, T95, and E108, which are important for substrate selection and lipid specificity (Miliara2019Structural). The secondary structure of the PRELI domain consists of a seven β-stranded antiparallel concaved β-sheet packed against three α helices, forming a tunnel-like cavity within the hydrophobic core, capped by the Ω loop (Miliara2019Structural). This structural arrangement is essential for the protein's function in lipid binding and transfer.

The tertiary structure of PRELID1 involves a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates lipid molecules, with the Ω loop and C-terminal α3 helix playing significant roles in substrate capture and delivery (Miliara2019Structural). The quaternary structure of PRELID1 includes its interaction with TRIAP1, forming a complex that facilitates the transfer of phosphatidic acid across the mitochondrial intermembrane space (Miliara2019Structural).

Post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of PRELID1 are not detailed in the provided context. The structural features of PRELID1 are critical for its function in lipid specificity and mitochondrial integrity (Miliara2019Structural).

## Function
The PRELID1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial lipid metabolism and function. It is part of the PRELI-TRIAP1 complex, which is responsible for the intramitochondrial transport of phosphatidic acid (PA) across the intermembrane space to the inner mitochondrial membrane. This transport is essential for the synthesis of cardiolipin (CL), a phospholipid critical for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function (Miliara2019Structural; Potting2013TRIAP1PRELI). Cardiolipin is involved in stabilizing respiratory chain supercomplexes, mitochondrial fission, and the regulation of apoptosis by retaining cytochrome c within mitochondria (Gillen2017Alternative).

The PRELID1 protein is localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it forms a complex with TRIAP1 to facilitate lipid transfer. This process is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and preventing apoptosis, as deficiencies in cardiolipin can lead to increased cytochrome c release and cell death (Eiyama2020Disturbed; Potting2013TRIAP1PRELI). The PRELID1/TRIAP1 complex is evolutionarily conserved and primarily functions as a PA transfer protein, although it can also transport CDP-DAG with low efficiency (Potting2013TRIAP1PRELI). The protein's activity is crucial for cellular energy homeostasis and stress response, impacting processes such as mitochondrial reactive oxygen species signaling and cancer outcomes (Gillen2017Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and alternative polyadenylation (APA) of the PRELID1 gene have been linked to various cancer outcomes. In breast cancer, the APA of PRELID1, rather than its expression level, correlates with patient survival, with differing effects based on estrogen receptor (ER) status. In ER-negative breast cancer, increased use of the proximal polyadenylation site of PRELID1 is associated with better survival, whereas in ER-positive breast cancer, the opposite is true (Gillen2017Alternative). This suggests that PRELID1 plays a role in stress response control across various cancers, with significant associations found in 14 cancer types in the TCGA database (Gillen2017Alternative).

In endometrial cancer, PRELID1 is one of the genes identified as up-regulated and associated with poor survival prognosis. It is part of a prognostic model related to liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which may influence cancer signal transduction and epigenetic regulation (Wang2022Single).

PRELID1 is also involved in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, which is crucial for the growth of certain breast cancer cells. Its knockdown affects cellular responses to stress and growth rates, indicating its potential role in cancer cell survival and proliferation (Gillen2017Alternative).

## Interactions
PRELID1, a mitochondrial protein, primarily interacts with TRIAP1 to form a complex that facilitates the transfer of phosphatidic acid (PA) across the mitochondrial intermembrane space. This interaction is crucial for the synthesis of cardiolipin, a lipid essential for mitochondrial function (Miliara2019Structural; Tatsuta2017Intramitochondrial). The PRELID1-TRIAP1 complex is analogous to the yeast Ups1-Mdm35 complex, which performs a similar function in yeast cells (Tatsuta2017Intramitochondrial).

The structural analysis of the PRELID1-TRIAP1 complex reveals that PRELID1 forms swapped dimers under crystallographic conditions, involving the exchange of the α3 C-terminal helix between two symmetry-related molecules. This structural arrangement is important for the protein's lipid specificity and function (Miliara2019Structural). The interaction between PRELID1 and TRIAP1 is essential for stabilizing PRELID1, which is inherently unstable on its own (Jeffers2017TgPRELID).

There is no evidence in the provided context of PRELID1 interacting with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond TRIAP1. The focus of its interactions is primarily on lipid transfer and maintaining mitochondrial integrity (Miliara2019Structural).
