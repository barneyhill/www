# AVP

## Overview
The AVP gene encodes the peptide hormone arginine vasopressin, a neurohypophysial nonapeptide that plays a crucial role in water homeostasis and blood pressure regulation in humans. Synthesized in the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary gland, arginine vasopressin functions primarily through its interaction with three G protein-coupled receptors: V1aR, V1bR, and V2R, each mediating distinct physiological effects. The hormone is involved in antidiuretic processes, vasoconstriction, and various neuropeptide functions, including modulation of social behavior and stress responses. The AVP gene's expression and regulation are critical for maintaining these physiological processes, and its dysregulation is implicated in several clinical conditions, such as diabetes insipidus and affective disorders (Thibonnier1994Molecular; Christensen2003Six; Sparapani2021The).

## Structure
Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a neurohypophysial nonapeptide hormone with the primary structure sequence CYFQNCPRG-NH2. This sequence forms a 20-membered tocin ring through a disulfide bridge between cysteine residues, which is crucial for its tertiary structure (Rodrigo2007Mapping). The secondary structure of AVP includes a short alpha-helix, and the tertiary structure is stabilized by the disulfide bond, ensuring the hormone's functional conformation. AVP functions as a monomer and does not exhibit a quaternary structure. A common post-translational modification of AVP is the amidation at the C-terminus, which is essential for its biological activity (Richter1983Synthesis).

The AVP precursor is synthesized as part of a larger precursor molecule that includes neurophysin II (NpII) and copeptin. This precursor undergoes proteolytic cleavage to produce the active hormone. The AVP-NpII precursor is composed of 166 amino acids, with a signal sequence of 19 amino acids followed by the AVP sequence, a triplet Gly-Lys-Arg, and the NpII sequence (Richter1983The). The precursor is glycosylated, although the specific glycosylation sites are not typical for AVP and NpII sequences (Richter1983Synthesis).

## Function
Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a peptide hormone that plays a critical role in maintaining water homeostasis and regulating blood pressure in humans. It is synthesized in the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary gland. AVP primarily acts through three G protein-coupled receptors: V1aR, V1bR, and V2R, each with distinct functions and tissue distributions (Sparapani2021The).

The V2 receptor (V2R) is primarily involved in the antidiuretic function of AVP, promoting water reabsorption in the kidneys. This process involves the activation of adenylyl cyclase, leading to increased cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which activate protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates aquaporin-2 (AQP2), facilitating its translocation to the apical membrane of renal cells, thereby enhancing water reabsorption (Sparapani2021The).

The V1a receptor (V1aR) is associated with vasoconstriction and is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, contributing to the regulation of blood pressure. It is coupled to phospholipase C, which generates inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), leading to calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation (Thibonnier1994Molecular).

In the brain, AVP functions as a neuropeptide, influencing social behavior, memory, and stress responses. It is involved in the modulation of neural transmission and the neuroendocrine stress response, with effects on social recognition and aggression (Sparapani2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the AVP gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Autosomal dominant familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (adFNDI) is a disorder caused by mutations in the AVP gene, leading to a deficiency in the secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). This results in symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia due to the inability to concentrate urine. Mutations in the AVP gene affect the folding and dimerization of the neurophysin II moiety, causing the mutant hormone precursor to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to cytotoxic accumulation and degeneration of AVP-producing neurons (Christensen2003Six).

In the context of affective disorders, elevated levels of AVP have been linked to anxiety and depression. Clinical studies have shown that increased AVP levels are associated with anxiety disorders such as PTSD and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In panic disorder, AVP levels rise during panic attacks. Animal models have demonstrated that AVP is linked to anxiety and depressive-like behaviors, with genetic variations influencing these conditions (Surget2008Involvement). These findings suggest that AVP and its receptors play a significant role in the pathophysiology of anxiety and depression, with potential implications for treatment strategies targeting AVP pathways.

## Interactions
Arginine vasopressin (AVP) interacts with the vasopressin receptor 2 (V2R), a G protein-coupled receptor predominantly found in the kidney, playing a critical role in body fluid homeostasis. The cryo-EM structure of the AVP-V2R-Gs signaling complex reveals that AVP binds to V2R with its cyclic moiety buried in the ligand-binding pocket and its linear moiety extending towards the extracellular space. Specific interactions include a hydrogen bond between the main chain carbonyl group of AVP residue Gly9 and the main chain amine group of V2R residue R32, as well as cation-π interactions between AVP residue Arg8 and V2R residue W193. The side chains of AVP residues Tyr2 and Asn5 engage in polar interactions with V2R residues L312 and C192, respectively. AVP residues Tyr2 and Phe3 also form a hydrophobic cluster with V2R residues M120, M123, F287, and F288 (Wang2021CryoEM).

In the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), AVP neurons are involved in circadian rhythms and are influenced by CLOCK/BMAL1 transcription factors. AVP expression is regulated by CRY1 and CRY2 proteins, which are negative regulators of E-box-related transcription, indicating a role in circadian rhythm regulation (Ono2021Roles).
