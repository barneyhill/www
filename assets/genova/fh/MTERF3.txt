# MTERF3

## Overview
MTERF3 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial transcription termination factor 3, a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of mitochondrial DNA transcription. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor and is involved in the negative regulation of transcription initiation within mitochondria. Mitochondrial transcription termination factor 3 binds to specific promoter regions on mitochondrial DNA, thereby modulating the transcriptional activity necessary for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Spåhr2010Structure; Park2007MTERF3). The protein's structure, characterized by a series of α-helices forming a superhelical shape, facilitates its interaction with nucleic acids and other mitochondrial components (Spåhr2010Structure). MTERF3 is also implicated in mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis, further underscoring its importance in cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis (Wredenberg2013MTERF3). Alterations in MTERF3 expression have been associated with various clinical outcomes, particularly in cancer and mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2024Constructing; Sun2019Prognostic).

## Structure
MTERF3 is a mitochondrial protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial DNA transcription. The primary structure of MTERF3 includes a sequence of amino acids that form a conserved MTERF-domain, essential for DNA binding and transcription regulation (Spåhr2010Structure). The secondary structure of MTERF3 is characterized by 22 α-helices that form a curved, half-doughnut shape, which is composed of repeated motifs known as MTERF-motifs. Each motif consists of three α-helices, contributing to the protein's superhelical structure (Spåhr2010Structure).

The tertiary structure of MTERF3 involves the packing of these motifs to form a hydrophobic core, stabilized by conserved hydrophobic residues. This structure suggests a half clamp nucleic acid-binding mode, allowing MTERF3 to interact with the mitochondrial promoter region and negatively regulate transcription initiation (Spåhr2010Structure). 

MTERF3 does not appear to have a quaternary structure involving interactions with other proteins, as no structural homologues were found, although it shares a similar overall shape with Pumilio-homology domains (Spåhr2010Structure). The protein undergoes post-translational processing upon import into mitochondria, indicating cleavage of its targeting sequence (Park2007MTERF3).

## Function
MTERF3 is a mitochondrial protein that functions as a negative regulator of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription initiation. In healthy human cells, MTERF3 binds to the mtDNA promoter regions, specifically the light strand promoter (LSP) and heavy strand promoter (HSP), to repress transcription initiation. This regulation is crucial for maintaining proper mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation capacity, which are vital for responding to physiological demands and preventing mitochondrial dysfunction (Park2007MTERF3).

MTERF3's repression of mtDNA transcription helps prevent transcriptional collisions between opposing promoters on the small circular mtDNA molecule, which could otherwise lead to decreased expression of critical tRNA genes (Park2007MTERF3). The protein's action likely involves interactions with additional mitochondrial proteins beyond the basal transcription machinery (Park2007MTERF3).

MTERF3 is also involved in mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis, specifically binding to mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA, which is essential for the proper assembly of mitochondrial ribosomes. This function is crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis and overall cellular energy production (Wredenberg2013MTERF3). The absence of MTERF3 leads to increased mtDNA transcription and respiratory chain deficiencies, highlighting its role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis (Wredenberg2013MTERF3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MTERF3 gene have been linked to various clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer and mitochondrial dysfunction. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high MTERF3 expression is associated with improved overall survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), especially in those who have never smoked. However, this association is not observed in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) or in smokers (Sun2019Prognostic). Conversely, in LUAD, lower MTERF3 expression correlates with longer overall survival and better prognosis, suggesting a complex role in tumor biology (Wang2024Constructing).

MTERF3 is also crucial for mitochondrial function, as its deficiency can lead to severe respiratory chain deficiencies and impaired mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis. In mouse models, the loss of MTERF3 results in increased mitochondrial transcription and decreased oxidative phosphorylation capacity, which may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and associated diseases (Wredenberg2013MTERF3; Park2007MTERF3). These findings highlight the potential of MTERF3 as a target for therapeutic interventions in conditions related to mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer (Wang2024Constructing).

## Interactions
MTERF3 is a mitochondrial protein that plays a significant role in regulating mitochondrial DNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis. It interacts with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by binding to promoter regions, specifically the light strand promoter (LSP) and heavy strand promoter (HSP), to repress transcription initiation (Park2007MTERF3). MTERF3 also interacts with mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA, which is crucial for the assembly of the 39S ribosomal subunit. This interaction is supported by electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays and RNA-immuno-precipitation experiments, which demonstrate MTERF3's specific binding to 16S rRNA in both mouse and fly samples (Wredenberg2013MTERF3).

In addition to its interactions with nucleic acids, MTERF3 is involved in protein-protein interactions. It has been shown to interact with other mitochondrial proteins, such as mTERF2, through coimmunoprecipitation experiments. These interactions are mediated by mtDNA, highlighting the importance of MTERF3 in forming complexes that regulate mitochondrial transcription (Wenz2009RETRACTED:). These interactions are essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and ensuring proper transcriptional and translational regulation within the organelle.
