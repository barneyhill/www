# CYP2A13

## Overview
CYP2A13 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily A member 13, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the human respiratory tract, particularly in the epithelial cells of the tracheae and bronchi, where it plays a significant role in the metabolic activation of various carcinogens, including tobacco-specific nitrosamines and aflatoxin B1 (He2006Efficient; Chiang2012Differential). The protein is characterized by a small, highly hydrophobic active site, which is crucial for its function in metabolizing xenobiotics (Gay2010Structural). Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2A13 can influence its catalytic efficiency and expression, impacting individual susceptibility to tobacco-related cancers (D’Agostino2008Characterization; Zhang2002Genetic). The enzyme's interactions with transcription factors such as FOXA2 and GATA6 further underscore its role in the regulation of xenobiotic metabolism and its potential implications in lung cancer susceptibility (Xiang2015Pulmonary).

## Structure
CYP2A13 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, primarily expressed in the respiratory tract. The protein's structure is characterized by a polypeptide backbone closely resembling that of CYP2A6, with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.5 Å (Gay2010Structural). The active site of CYP2A13 is small, highly hydrophobic, and contains a cluster of six phenylalanines, with a notable F300I substitution compared to CYP2A6. The active site cavity is planar with a volume of 307 Å³, making it one of the smallest reported in X-ray crystal structures (Gay2010Structural). 

The presence of Asn297 in the active site enables hydrogen bonding to ligands, such as indole, which can adopt two distinct conformations within the cavity. This residue is suggested to be a defining characteristic of CYP2A enzymes, potentially controlling ligand orientation (Gay2010Structural). The sequence identity between CYP2A13 and CYP2A6 is over 90%, suggesting similar conformational properties in the presence of other ligands (Gay2010Structural). 

The protein's structure includes specific residues such as Phe107, Phe111, Phe209, Leu366, and Leu370, which are important for binding interactions (Fan2018Exploring). However, detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, specific domains, prominent folds, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of CYP2A13 is not provided in the available context.

## Function
CYP2A13 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme predominantly expressed in the human respiratory tract, particularly in the epithelial cells of the tracheae and bronchi (Chiang2012Differential). It plays a crucial role in the metabolic activation of various carcinogens, including aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and tobacco-specific nitrosamines like NNK (He2006Efficient; Zhang2002Genetic). CYP2A13 is highly efficient in converting AFB1 into carcinogenic epoxides, which can bind to DNA and potentially lead to mutagenesis (He2006Efficient). This enzyme is also involved in the metabolism of 4-aminobiphenyl, a component of tobacco smoke, through N-hydroxylation, contributing to the formation of DNA adducts in the bladder and lung (Nakajima2006CYP2A13).

CYP2A13's activity is influenced by genetic polymorphisms, such as the Arg257Cys variant, which reduces its catalytic efficiency (Zhang2002Genetic). The enzyme's expression and activity can be modulated by factors like retinoic acid, which enhances its expression in tracheobronchial epithelial cells (Newland2011CYP1A11B1). Overall, CYP2A13's function in metabolizing carcinogens highlights its potential role in respiratory tract carcinogenesis and its importance in understanding individual susceptibility to tobacco-related cancers.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the CYP2A13 gene have been linked to various diseases, particularly lung cancer. The CYP2A13*2 allele, characterized by the Arg25Gln and Arg257Cys mutations, is associated with decreased incidences of lung adenocarcinoma in smokers. This variant exhibits reduced enzyme activity and lower mRNA expression levels, which may lead to decreased metabolic activation of tobacco-specific carcinogens like NNK, thereby reducing cancer risk (D’Agostino2008Characterization).

Conversely, the CYP2A13*7 allele, which includes a nonsense mutation (Arg 101 Stop), results in a truncated protein and is associated with an increased risk of small cell lung cancer in individuals heterozygous for the null allele. This mutation is more frequent in certain populations and has been linked to a significant risk increase for small cell lung cancer (Cauffiez2004Genetic).

The CYP2A13 gene's role in metabolizing carcinogens like aflatoxin B1 and its involvement in the bioactivation of NNK further implicates it in lung cancer susceptibility. Genetic variations in CYP2A13 can influence the risk of tobacco-induced lung cancer by altering the enzyme's activity and expression levels (Vrzal2021Genetic; He2006Efficient).

## Interactions
CYP2A13, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, is involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, including the activation of tobacco-specific carcinogens. It interacts with several proteins and transcription factors that regulate its expression and function. One significant interaction is with the transcription factor FOXA2, which binds to the promoter region of CYP2A13, enhancing its transcription in lung tissues. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of xenobiotic metabolism in the lungs, particularly in the context of lung cancer (Xiang2015Pulmonary).

FOXA2 also interacts with GATA6, another transcription factor, to regulate the expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, including CYP2A13. Co-immunoprecipitation assays have demonstrated a physical interaction between FOXA2 and GATA6, suggesting that they may work together to modulate the expression of CYP2A13 and other related genes (Xiang2015Pulmonary).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving CYP2A13, FOXA2, and GATA6, which may influence lung cancer susceptibility by affecting the metabolic pathways of inhaled carcinogens (Xiang2015Pulmonary).
