# ACTBL2

## Overview
ACTBL2 (actin beta like 2) is a gene that encodes a cytoskeletal protein involved in maintaining cellular structure and facilitating various cellular processes. The protein, actin beta-like 2, is a member of the actin family, which is crucial for the formation of actin filaments that support cell shape, motility, and intracellular transport. It is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in the formation of actin-based structures such as stress fibers and lamellipodia, which are essential for cell movement and adhesion (Malek2021The). ACTBL2 is expressed at low levels in several cell types, including melanoma cells, and its unique amino acid substitutions may influence its interactions with other proteins and cofactors (Malek2021The). The gene's expression is regulated by various factors, including biomechanical stress, highlighting its importance in cellular processes and its potential implications in diseases such as cancer and coronary artery disease (Kolur2020Transcriptome; HÃ¶debeck2014TonEBPNFAT5).

## Structure


## Function
ACTBL2 (actin beta like 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the cytoskeletal structure of cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining cell shape, enabling cell movement, and facilitating intracellular transport. This protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to various cellular processes such as cell division and signal transduction. In healthy human cells, ACTBL2 is involved in the formation of actin-based structures, such as stress fibers and lamellipodia, which are essential for cell motility and adhesion (Malek2021The).

ACTBL2 is expressed at low levels in several cell types, including melanoma cells, where it incorporates into F-actin structures similar to β- and γ-actin (Malek2021The). The protein's unique amino acid substitutions may affect its interactions with other proteins and cofactors, influencing its function and interactions within the cell (Malek2021The). ACTBL2's role in cytoskeletal organization is critical for processes such as cell motility and invasion, as well as the formation of focal adhesions, which are important for cellular adhesion and signaling (Malek2021The). The gene's expression and activity are regulated by various factors, including biomechanical stress, which can influence its role in cellular processes (HÃ¶debeck2014TonEBPNFAT5).

## Clinical Significance
ACTBL2 has been identified as a gene with significant implications in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ACTBL2 is upregulated, marking its novel association with the disease. This upregulation suggests that ACTBL2 could serve as a biomarker for CRC and may play a role in tumorigenesis by interacting with proteins that influence cell growth and migration (Ghazanfar2017Identification). 

In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), ACTBL2 is expressed in tumor-infiltrating leukocytes and is associated with improved overall survival, particularly in patients with low-grade serous carcinoma. This suggests a potential protective role in EOC (Topalov2023Characterization). 

ACTBL2 is also involved in melanoma, where its expression affects cell motility and focal adhesion formation. Knockout studies in melanoma cells have shown that the absence of ACTBL2 leads to altered actin cytoskeleton architecture and reduced invasion potential, indicating its role in cancer cell behavior (Malek2021The). 

Additionally, ACTBL2 has been implicated in coronary artery disease (CAD), where it is identified as a differentially expressed gene, suggesting a role in the progression of CAD (Kolur2020Transcriptome).

## Interactions
ACTBL2 (actin beta-like 2) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. One of its key interactions is with gelsolin, a multifunctional actin-binding protein involved in actin filament assembly and disassembly. This interaction is observed in human melanoma cells, where ACTBL2 and gelsolin are found in lamellipodia, structures enriched in filamentous actin, suggesting a direct interaction that contributes to ACTBL2's promigratory effects (Malek2021The; Topalov2021Actin).

In colorectal cancer, ACTBL2 is identified as a binding partner of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1), which is involved in cell proliferation, growth, survival, and morphogenesis. This interaction suggests that ACTBL2 may contribute to tumorigenesis by promoting cell migration and proliferation (Ghazanfar2017Identification).

The regulatory impact of NFAT5 on ACTBL2 is also noted, with NFAT5 knockdown leading to reduced ACTBL2 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. NFAT5 is involved in cell migration and proliferation, and its expression is elevated in ovarian cancer cells, indicating a regulatory mechanism that influences ACTBL2's role in cancer cell migration and proliferation (Topalov2021Actin).
