# LDLRAD4

## Overview
LDLRAD4, also known as C18orf1, is a gene that encodes the protein low density lipoprotein receptor class A domain containing 4. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein involved in cellular signaling pathways, particularly as a negative regulator of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway. The LDLRAD4 protein plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating immune responses, which are vital for processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Song2024Hypomethylation; Jin2021Identification). It is expressed in various tissues, including immune organs, and is implicated in several signaling pathways, such as the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and the Wnt signaling pathway, highlighting its involvement in inflammation and neurotransmitter regulation (Jin2021Identification). The gene's expression and interactions have significant implications in clinical contexts, including cancer metastasis and neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Zarrei2019A; Mo2020Antisense).

## Function
LDLRAD4, also known as C18orf1, encodes a protein that functions as a negative regulator of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Song2024Hypomethylation; Jin2021Identification). The protein is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating immune responses, potentially influencing cell growth and preventing excessive proliferation (Jin2021Identification). 

LDLRAD4 is expressed in multiple organs, including immune organs like lymph nodes and the spleen, suggesting a role in immune function (Song2024Hypomethylation). It may also be involved in the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, which is significant in cell pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death associated with inflammation (Jin2021Identification). 

In the context of brain function, LDLRAD4 has been associated with neurotransmitter regulation and synaptic activity, indicating its potential role in pathways such as the Wnt signaling pathway and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (Jin2021Identification). These functions highlight LDLRAD4's involvement in critical cellular and molecular processes that contribute to maintaining normal physiological functions.

## Clinical Significance
LDLRAD4 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disruptions in its normal interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), the antisense long noncoding RNA LDLRAD4-AS1 is upregulated, leading to decreased expression of LDLRAD4. This reduction promotes metastasis by facilitating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients (Mo2020Antisense). LDLRAD4 acts as a metastasis suppressor, and its overexpression impedes CRC cell migration and invasion, while its knockdown enhances these processes (Mo2020Antisense).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypomethylation of the LDLRAD4 gene has been observed, particularly in specific regions, correlating with inflammatory indicators. This epigenetic change suggests LDLRAD4 could serve as a diagnostic and therapeutic marker for RA (Song2024Hypomethylation).

LDLRAD4 is also involved in neurodevelopmental disorders, with deletions impacting the gene observed in cases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These findings suggest a potential common genetic contribution to these disorders (Zarrei2019A).

## Interactions
LDLRAD4, also known as C18ORF1, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence cellular signaling pathways. It is identified as a negative regulator of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway. LDLRAD4 can inhibit TGF-β-induced Smad-driven transcriptional activity, similar to TMEPAI, another negative regulator of TGF-β signaling. Despite structural similarities, LDLRAD4 and TMEPAI have different mRNA expression profiles across tissues. LDLRAD4 can colocalize with TMEPAI in early endosomes and physically interact with it, forming a homomeric complex (Nakano2014C18).

In the context of colorectal cancer, LDLRAD4 acts as a metastasis suppressor. Its expression is negatively correlated with the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LDLRAD4-AS1. This lncRNA disrupts the stability of LDLRAD4 mRNA, leading to decreased LDLRAD4 expression. The interaction between LDLRAD4-AS1 and LDLRAD4 mRNA is hypothesized to occur through colocalization in the nucleus, where the lncRNA decreases the stability of LDLRAD4 mRNA, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis in colorectal cancer (Mo2020Antisense).

LDLRAD4 also interacts with SMAD2 and SMAD3, competing with SARA, and influences cell proliferation and migration by interacting with E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 (Song2024Hypomethylation).
