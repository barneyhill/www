# NT5C3B

## Overview
The NT5C3B gene encodes the enzyme 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic IIIB (cN-IIIB), which is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in nucleotide metabolism, specifically within the nucleotide salvage pathways, where it catalyzes the dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates to their corresponding nucleosides. The protein is characterized by a globular core domain and a smaller CAP domain, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and substrate specificity (Kubacka2022SubstrateBased). cN-IIIB's ability to interact with a range of deoxynucleotide monophosphates, including deoxythymidine monophosphate, suggests a broader substrate specificity than previously recognized (Lim2018An). The gene's expression and potential mutations have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (ZapataGarcía2022Comparative). Understanding the structure and function of NT5C3B is crucial for elucidating its role in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Structure
The human cytosolic nucleotidase IIIB (cN-IIIB), encoded by the NT5C3B gene, is characterized by a distinct molecular structure comprising two main domains: a globular core domain and a smaller CAP domain. The core domain is a haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) domain with a three-layer α/β/α architecture, which includes residues that coordinate a magnesium ion essential for its enzymatic activity (Kubacka2022SubstrateBased). The CAP domain consists mainly of a bundle of helices responsible for ligand recognition, particularly accommodating the 3,4-difluorobenzyl group of inhibitors within a hydrophobic cavity formed by specific sidechains (Kubacka2022SubstrateBased).

The enzyme undergoes conformational changes upon inhibitor binding, particularly in the CAP domain, where two helices shift to accommodate inhibitors in the 7-methylguanine-binding pocket. This binding induces changes in the side chains of amino acids such as Tyr60 and Trp105, stabilizing the complex through aromatic interactions (Kubacka2022SubstrateBased). The presence of a magnesium ion is coordinated by specific aspartate residues and water molecules, contributing to the enzyme's open conformation, which is suggested to play a role in its resistance to dephosphorylation (Kubacka2022SubstrateBased). The structural insights into cN-IIIB provide a foundation for understanding its inhibition mechanism and potential therapeutic targeting.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the NT5C3B gene can significantly impact cellular nucleotide balance, potentially contributing to various disorders, including cancer and metabolic diseases. The enzyme encoded by NT5C3B plays a crucial role in nucleotide metabolism, specifically within the nucleotide salvage pathways, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Disruptions in these pathways due to NT5C3B mutations can lead to an imbalance in nucleotide pools, which may result in genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer development. Additionally, altered expression levels of NT5C3B have been implicated in metabolic disorders, where the precise regulation of nucleotide levels is critical for normal cellular function. The gene's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in disease mechanisms, as any deviation from its normal function can have significant pathological consequences. Understanding the clinical significance of NT5C3B mutations and expression alterations is vital for developing targeted therapies and diagnostic tools for conditions associated with its dysfunction.

## Interactions
NT5C3B, also known as 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic IIIB, has been identified to interact with deoxynucleotide monophosphates (dNMPs) through the use of the Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA). Notably, NT5C3B was found to have an unexpected interaction with deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), suggesting a broader substrate specificity than previously understood (Lim2018An). This interaction indicates that NT5C3B may participate in nucleotide metabolism beyond its known substrates, potentially influencing various cellular processes.

In the context of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), NT5C3B has been identified as a gene with high expression in leukemia-derived cell lines and ALL patients. Although the specific protein interactions in leukemia are not detailed, the gene's expression suggests a possible role in the disease's pathology, warranting further investigation into its interactions and functions in this context (ZapataGarcía2022Comparative).

While NT5C3B's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the available literature, its involvement in nucleotide metabolism and potential interactions with dNMPs highlight its significance in cellular processes and disease states. Further research is needed to elucidate the full spectrum of its interactions and functional implications.
