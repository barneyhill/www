# TEX10

## Overview
TEX10 is a gene that encodes the testis expressed 10 protein, which plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by structural domains such as the Armadillo-type fold and HEAT domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins, DNA, and RNA. These interactions are crucial for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by regulating enhancer activity and gene expression. TEX10 functions as a coactivator in the pluripotency network, working alongside key factors like Sox2, Oct4, and p300 to sustain the undifferentiated state of ESCs. Beyond its role in stem cell biology, TEX10 is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in colorectal and oral squamous cell carcinomas, where it acts as an oncogene by enhancing NF-κB signaling pathways (Wang2020RNAi; Kuk2024Prognostic; Ding2015Tex10).

## Structure
The TEX10 protein is characterized by a molecular structure that includes an Armadillo-type fold, an Armadillo-like helical, and a type 2 HEAT domain. These structural features facilitate interactions with proteins, DNA, and RNA, enabling TEX10's versatile functions in regulating enhancer activity and maintaining pluripotent cell identity (Ding2015Tex10). The Armadillo-type fold is known for its role in mediating protein-protein interactions, which is crucial for TEX10's involvement in the pluripotency network. The presence of these domains suggests that TEX10 can effectively participate in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation processes.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in TEX10, influencing its function and interactions within the cell. These modifications can affect the protein's stability, localization, and activity, although specific details on these modifications in TEX10 are not extensively covered in the provided context.

TEX10 may also exist in different splice variant isoforms, which can lead to structural and functional diversity. These isoforms could potentially alter the protein's interaction capabilities and its role in various cellular processes, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the context provided. Overall, TEX10's structure is integral to its function in maintaining stem cell pluripotency and regulating gene expression.

## Function
TEX10 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, playing a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In human cells, TEX10 is a significant component of the enhanceosome assembly, working alongside proteins such as p300 and Tet1 to regulate histone acetylation and DNA hypomethylation at super-enhancers (SEs). This regulation is essential for the transcriptional activation of pluripotency genes like Oct4 and Nanog, which are critical for maintaining the undifferentiated state of ESCs (Ding2015Tex10).

TEX10 is directed by Sox2 to a subset of ESC-specific SEs, indicating its collaborative role in enhancer activity regulation. It acts as a coactivator with Oct4 and Sox2, enhancing the expression of pluripotency genes by maintaining open chromatin and hypomethylation at SEs (Ding2015Tex10). TEX10's function is evolutionarily conserved, as it is also crucial for human embryonic stem cell maintenance and reprogramming. Depletion of TEX10 in human ESCs leads to differentiation and downregulation of pluripotency genes, highlighting its essential role in sustaining stem cell identity (Ding2015Tex10).

## Clinical Significance
TEX10 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in promoting cell proliferation and survival. In colorectal cancer (CRC), TEX10 is overexpressed and acts as an oncogene by enhancing NF-κB activation, which is crucial for tumor growth and progression. High TEX10 expression is associated with poor prognosis, including worse overall and progression-free survival in CRC patients. TEX10 interacts with the RELA protein, a component of the NF-κB signaling pathway, promoting the expression of genes like TNFAIP8, SAT1, and IL6ST, which are linked to cancer cell proliferation and survival (Wang2020RNAi).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), TEX10 is overexpressed in cases with perineural invasion (PNI), a condition associated with poor prognosis and high recurrence rates. TEX10's expression alterations may contribute to cancer progression and therapy resistance, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker in OSCC (Kuk2024Prognostic).

Additionally, a TEX10-NTRK2 fusion has been identified in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, retaining the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK2. This fusion represents a potential target for therapies like larotrectinib and entrectinib, underscoring TEX10's role in cancer pathogenesis (Ju2021Genomic).

## Interactions
TEX10 is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), TEX10 interacts with the pluripotency factor Sox2, forming part of the Sox2 interactome, which includes proteins like Wdr18 and Las1L. This interaction is crucial for maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal in ESCs (Ding2015Tex10). TEX10 also recruits the histone acetyltransferase p300 and the DNA demethylase Tet1 to super-enhancer regions, facilitating histone acetylation and DNA demethylation, which are essential for pluripotency gene expression (Ding2015Tex10).

In the context of colorectal cancer, TEX10 interacts with the NF-κB pathway, particularly with the transcription factors RELA and p50. TEX10 enhances NF-κB activity by promoting RELA's nuclear localization and binding to target gene promoters, thereby influencing cancer cell proliferation (Wang2020RNAi). TEX10's interaction with RELA is significant for the activation of NF-κB target genes, such as TNFAIP8, SAT1, and IL6ST, which are crucial for cancer progression (Wang2020RNAi).

TEX10 is also part of the Five Friends of Methylated Chtop (5FMC) complex, interacting with proteins like Las1L and Pelp1, and is associated with Polycomb group ring finger proteins 3 and 5 (Pcgf3/5) in non-canonical PRC1 complexes, which are involved in transcriptional activation in ESCs (Zhao2017Polycomb).
