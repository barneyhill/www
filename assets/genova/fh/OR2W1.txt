# OR2W1

## Overview
The OR2W1 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily W member 1, a protein that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a critical role in the olfactory system by binding to specific odorants and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Chatelain2014Deorphanization). OR2W1 is characterized by its broad tuning, capable of interacting with a diverse array of ligands, including esters, alcohols, and aldehydes, which underscores its importance in the complex coding of olfactory signals (Yoshikawa2015Olfactory; Chatelain2014Deorphanization). Beyond its olfactory functions, OR2W1 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, such as small lung cancer and preeclampsia, highlighting its potential relevance as a biomarker in disease processes (Jabeen2021Machine; Hirata2023Exploring).

## Structure
The olfactory receptor OR2W1 is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure typical of GPCRs. The primary structure of OR2W1 consists of amino acid sequences that form these transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function in odorant detection (Jabeen2021Machine). The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices, which are common in GPCRs, facilitating the receptor's ability to span the cell membrane.

The tertiary structure of OR2W1 involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, allowing the receptor to form a functional binding pocket for odorant molecules. Specific binding pocket positions for OR2W1 have been identified, including residues G108, S109, C112, N155, I206, and Y252, which are important for ligand interactions (Jabeen2021Machine). These structural features enable OR2W1 to interact with a wide range of ligands, reflecting its broad tuning and ability to be activated by over 100 different molecules (Chatelain2014Deorphanization).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, although specific modifications for OR2W1 are not detailed in the available context. The receptor's structure supports its role in olfactory signaling and potential involvement in non-olfactory functions.

## Function
The OR2W1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Chatelain2014Deorphanization). OR2W1 is characterized as a broadly tuned receptor, capable of being activated by a wide range of ligands, including esters, alcohols, aldehydes, thiols, and carboxylic acids, which suggests its involvement in the perception of diverse odors (Yoshikawa2015Olfactory; Chatelain2014Deorphanization).

The receptor's functional expression is enhanced by specific chaperones and tags, which improve its cell-surface expression and response to ligands (Chatelain2014Deorphanization). OR2W1's broad ligand spectrum is attributed to weak hydrophobic interactions in its ligand binding mode, allowing it to respond to a variety of odorant molecules (Yoshikawa2015Olfactory). This receptor's ability to interact with numerous odorants highlights its potential role in the complex coding of olfactory signals, contributing to the organism's ability to detect and differentiate a wide array of smells (Chatelain2014Deorphanization).

## Clinical Significance
The OR2W1 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its mutations and alterations in expression levels. Recurrent mutations in OR2W1 have been reported in small lung cancer, suggesting a potential link between these mutations and the disease (Jabeen2021Machine). Additionally, OR2W1 is differentially expressed in conditions such as preeclampsia and mild gestational hypothyroidism. It shows a loss of expression with high sensitivity for predicting preeclampsia, indicating its potential relevance in this condition (Hirata2023Exploring). The gene is also part of a group of olfactory receptors that exhibit differential expression in preeclampsia, with a high prediction capability for the condition (Hirata2023Exploring).

In the context of rheumatoid arthritis, OR2W1 was included in a study exploring genetic variants, although it did not exhibit significant de novo mutations specific to the disease (Ham2019Epigenetic). Furthermore, OR2W1 is listed among genes subject to natural selection, which may influence its role in olfaction and potentially in pathological states (Puzyrev2011Evolutionary). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in various disease processes and its potential as a biomarker for certain conditions.
