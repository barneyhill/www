# ETFA

## Overview
The ETFA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF), a crucial component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain involved in fatty acid β-oxidation and amino acid metabolism. The protein product, electron transfer flavoprotein subunit alpha, forms a heterodimer with the beta subunit, facilitating the transfer of electrons from acyl-CoA dehydrogenases to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This process is essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, underscoring the protein's role as a key player in cellular energy metabolism (Chautard2020A). Located on chromosome 15q23-25, the ETFA gene's expression and function are influenced by various regulatory mechanisms, including interactions with cofactors like flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and regulatory proteins such as EZH2 and NBPF4, which have implications in metabolic disorders and cancer (Chautard2020A; Chen2021NBPF4).

## Function
The ETFA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF), a heterodimeric protein crucial for mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation and amino acid metabolism. In healthy human cells, ETF plays a vital role in the electron transport chain by transferring electrons from acyl-CoA dehydrogenases to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This process begins with the oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondrial matrix, where electrons are first transferred to ETF and then to electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETFDH), also known as ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase or ETF-QO. Finally, these electrons are transported to coenzyme Q in the inner mitochondrial membrane, contributing to oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production (Chautard2020A).

The ETFA gene is located on chromosome 15q23-25 and contains 12 exons. It is involved in the synthesis of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), a cofactor essential for the assembly and stability of the ETF complex. FAD prevents proteolytic digestion of ETF and facilitates the interaction between the alpha and beta subunits of ETF, ensuring normal mitochondrial function and energy production through fatty acid metabolism (Chautard2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ETFA gene are associated with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), also known as glutaric acidemia type II. This autosomal recessive disorder affects fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, leading to a range of clinical presentations from severe neonatal forms to milder late-onset forms. Symptoms can include muscle weakness, hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and lipid storage myopathy, characterized by the accumulation of lipid droplets in muscle fibers (Lupica2022Diagnostic; Ohkuma2009Clinical). 

The α-T171 variant of the ETFA gene, which displays decreased thermal stability, is overrepresented in patients with very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency, particularly those with a mild childhood presentation. This variant may negatively modulate the disease phenotype by affecting the stability and function of the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF), potentially influencing the clinical severity of VLCAD deficiency (Bross1999A).

Alterations in ETFA expression have also been implicated in colorectal cancer. The NBPF4 gene, through its interaction with EZH2, regulates ETFA expression, suggesting a complex regulatory network that may influence tumor progression (Chen2021NBPF4).

## Interactions
ETFA, the electron transfer flavoprotein subunit alpha, is a component of the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) complex, which plays a critical role in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. ETFA forms a heterodimer with the beta subunit (ETFB) without covalent bonds, and this interaction is essential for the stability and function of the ETF complex (Chautard2020A). The ETF complex interacts with flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), a cofactor necessary for its assembly and stability, preventing proteolytic digestion (Chautard2020A).

ETFA is involved in electron transfer processes within mitochondria, where it interacts with ETF dehydrogenase (ETFDH) to facilitate the transfer of electrons from fatty acid oxidation to the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Chautard2020A). This interaction is crucial for energy metabolism and the oxidation of fatty acids and amino acids.

In the context of colorectal cancer, ETFA expression is regulated by the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) through methylation of its promoter. The long non-coding RNA NBPF4 also influences ETFA expression by regulating EZH2 at the post-transcriptional level, forming a complex with miR-17-3p that affects ETFA expression (Chen2021NBPF4).
