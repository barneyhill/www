# ISCA2

## Overview
The ISCA2 gene encodes the iron-sulfur cluster assembly 2 protein, which is integral to the mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster assembly machinery. This protein is categorized as a mitochondrial assembly factor and plays a pivotal role in the maturation of [4Fe-4S] proteins, which are essential for various cellular processes, including electron transport and enzymatic functions. The ISCA2 protein forms both homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes, notably with ISCA1 and IBA57, facilitating the conversion of [2Fe-2S] clusters into [4Fe-4S] clusters within the mitochondria (Weiler2020Mitochondrial; Nasta2019Structural). Mutations in the ISCA2 gene are linked to severe mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Alaimo2018Lossoffunction; Alfadhel2019Multiple).

## Structure
The ISCA2 protein is involved in the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery and forms a homodimer in solution, as confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data (Nasta2019Structural). The quaternary structure of ISCA2 is characterized by its dimeric form, which is essential for its function in cluster assembly. The dimerization involves specific cysteine residues that are crucial for coordinating the [2Fe-2S] cluster, with Cys 79, Cys 144, and Cys 146 of ISCA2 playing key roles (Nasta2019Structural).

The ISCA2 protein also forms a heterodimeric complex with IBA57, where the [2Fe-2S] cluster is shared between the two proteins. This interaction is stabilized by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, particularly involving Arg146 of IBA57, which is critical for the complex's stability (Nasta2019Structural). The mutation Arg146Trp in IBA57 disrupts this interaction, highlighting its importance in the structural integrity of the complex (Nasta2019Structural).

The ISCA2-IBA57 complex is organized as a "dimer of dimers," with ISCA2 providing the homodimerization core interface (Nasta2019Structural). This structural arrangement is vital for the maturation of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins, which are essential for various cellular processes (Sheftel2012The).

## Function
The ISCA2 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster assembly process, which is essential for various cellular functions, including redox reactions, catalysis, and DNA synthesis. In healthy human cells, ISCA2, along with ISCA1 and IBA57, is involved in the late stages of Fe/S cluster synthesis, specifically in the conversion of [2Fe-2S] clusters into [4Fe-4S] clusters. This conversion is crucial for the maturation of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins, which are vital for cellular viability (Weiler2020Mitochondrial; Sheftel2012The).

ISCA2 is localized to the mitochondria, where it forms a heterodimeric complex with ISCA1. This complex facilitates the reductive coupling of [2Fe-2S] clusters to form [4Fe-4S] clusters, a process that requires electron transfer from mitochondrial ferredoxin FDX2 (Weiler2020Mitochondrial; CiofiBaffoni2018Protein). The proper functioning of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins, such as aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase, depends on this process (Sheftel2012The).

Depletion of ISCA2 leads to significant physiological and morphological changes in cells, including defects in mitochondrial cristae membranes and reduced activities of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Sheftel2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ISCA2 gene are associated with severe mitochondrial disorders, primarily characterized by neurological and muscular symptoms. One such condition is Multiple Mitochondrial Dysfunctions Syndrome 4 (MMDS4), which manifests as neurodevelopmental regression, optic atrophy with nystagmus, and diffuse white matter disease. Patients with MMDS4 typically experience rapid deterioration between 2 and 7 months of age, with MRI often revealing cerebellar white matter abnormalities and spinal cord involvement. Biochemical abnormalities in these patients may include elevated glycine and lactate levels in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma, although these findings are not consistent across all cases (Alfadhel2019Multiple).

ISCA2 mutations also lead to a fatal leukodystrophy characterized by hyperglycinemia and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion. This condition is marked by infantile-onset leukodystrophy, developmental regression, spastic tone, and optic atrophy. The loss of ISCA2 affects mitochondrial bioenergetics, reducing mitochondrial membrane potential, respiration, ATP production, and the activity of electron transport chain complexes II and IV (Alaimo2018Lossoffunction). 

Neonatal mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy, another condition linked to ISCA2 mutations, presents with brain and spinal involvement and high lactate levels. This disorder is characterized by severe hypotonia, nystagmus, and a rapidly fatal clinical course (Toldo2018Neonatal).

## Interactions
ISCA2 is involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters in mitochondria, primarily through its interactions with other proteins. It forms a heterodimeric complex with ISCA1, which is crucial for the conversion of [2Fe-2S] clusters into [4Fe-4S] clusters. This complex is thermodynamically favored over homodimeric forms and is essential for the maturation of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins (Weiler2020Mitochondrial; CiofiBaffoni2018Protein). 

ISCA2 also interacts with IBA57, forming a complex that is necessary for the proper assembly and insertion of [4Fe-4S] clusters into target apoproteins (Weiler2020Mitochondrial). In vivo, ISCA2 interacts with IBA57, although this interaction is not observed with ISCA1 (CiofiBaffoni2018Protein).

The protein GLRX5 transfers [2Fe-2S] clusters to the ISCA1-ISCA2 complex, suggesting that GLRX5 might be the cluster donor for the formation of [4Fe-4S] proteins (Weiler2020Mitochondrial; Piccioli2020Paramagnetic). ISCA2 also interacts with the reduced ferredoxin FDX2, which is essential for the reductive fusion of [2Fe-2S] clusters into [4Fe-4S] clusters (Weiler2020Mitochondrial; Piccioli2020Paramagnetic). 

These interactions highlight ISCA2's role in the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster assembly process, crucial for cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function.
