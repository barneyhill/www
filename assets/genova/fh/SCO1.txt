# SCO1

## Overview
SCO1 is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial copper-binding protein, which is integral to the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), a critical enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The protein synthesized from the SCO1 gene functions as a metallochaperone, facilitating the delivery of copper to the CuA site of the CcO subunit Cox2, thereby ensuring proper enzymatic activity and efficient cellular respiration (Stiburek2009Loss; Banci2007Human). SCO1 is characterized by a thioredoxin-like fold and contains a conserved CXXXC motif essential for copper coordination and transfer (Banci2007Human). It interacts with other copper-binding proteins, such as Cox17 and SCO2, to maintain cellular copper homeostasis and mitochondrial function (Leary2004Human; Banci2007Human). Mutations in SCO1 can lead to severe mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its critical role in cellular metabolism and health (Stiburek2009Loss).

## Structure
The human SCO1 protein is characterized by a thioredoxin-like fold, which is integral to its function in copper binding and redox activity (Banci2007Human). The protein contains a conserved CXXXC motif, where copper(I) is coordinated by cysteine residues, specifically Cys-169 and Cys-173, and a histidine residue, His-260 (Banci2007Human). This motif is crucial for the protein's role in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase by facilitating copper transfer.

The secondary structure of SCO1 includes β-strands and α-helices, maintaining a similar configuration in both the wild-type and mutant forms (Banci2007Human). The tertiary structure involves hydrophobic interactions that are essential for maintaining the protein's stability and copper-binding affinity. Mutations, such as P174L, can disrupt these interactions, leading to reduced copper affinity and altered structural properties (Banci2007Human).

SCO1 is known to form both monomeric and homooligomeric complexes, which are important for its stability and function (Stiburek2009Loss). The protein's oligomeric state is affected by mutations, which can impair its ability to form these complexes, impacting its role in mitochondrial function (Stiburek2009Loss).

## Function
The SCO1 gene encodes a mitochondrial copper-binding protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), a key component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. SCO1 is involved in the biogenesis of the Cu A site in the CcO subunit Cox2, facilitating copper delivery essential for CcO's enzymatic activity (Stiburek2009Loss; Banci2007Human). SCO1 functions as a metallochaperone, working cooperatively with SCO2 to ensure the proper maturation of COX2 by facilitating the formation of its Cu A site (Bourens2014Human). This process is critical for the proper assembly and function of CcO, which is necessary for efficient cellular respiration and energy production (Banci2007Human).

SCO1 also plays a role in maintaining cellular copper homeostasis, potentially through its association with the CcO holoenzyme complex (Stiburek2009Loss). The protein's activity is primarily located in the mitochondria, where it interacts with other copper-binding proteins such as Cox17 to facilitate copper transfer (Banci2007Human). Mutations in SCO1 can lead to impaired CcO assembly and significant mitochondrial dysfunction, highlighting its essential role in cellular metabolism (Stiburek2009Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCO1 gene are linked to several severe mitochondrial disorders, primarily due to its role in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly and copper homeostasis. These mutations can lead to conditions such as fatal infantile encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. For instance, the p.P174L mutation results in a significant COX deficiency and is associated with liver impairment, while the p.G132S mutation is linked to heart issues (Leary2013Novel; Banci2007Human). 

SCO1 mutations also cause tissue-specific copper deficiencies, affecting the liver, heart, and brain, leading to symptoms like encephalopathy, hypotonia, and hepatopathy (Stiburek2009Loss; Baker2017Thea). The p.M294V mutation, although milder, impacts brain function and retains some SCO1 function as a COX assembly factor (Leary2013Novel). 

Alterations in SCO1 expression can disrupt copper homeostasis, as seen in mouse models where SCO1 deletion in heart tissue leads to lethal COX and copper deficiencies, resulting in dilated cardiomyopathy (Baker2017Thea). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SCO1 in maintaining mitochondrial and cellular health.

## Interactions
The SCO1 protein is involved in several interactions crucial for its function in mitochondrial copper delivery and cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) assembly. SCO1 interacts with Cox17, a copper chaperone, to facilitate copper transfer to the CuA site of CcO. This interaction is essential for the proper assembly and function of CcO, as evidenced by the impact of mutations like P174L, which disrupts SCO1's ability to bind copper and affects its redox properties, leading to inefficient copper transfer (Banci2007Human).

SCO1 also interacts with SCO2, another protein involved in copper delivery to CcO. These interactions are suggested to be cooperative, with SCO1 potentially facilitating the transfer of copper from SCO2 to the CuA site. The interaction between SCO1 and SCO2 is supported by dominant-negative phenotypes observed when either protein is overexpressed in the reciprocal patient background, indicating a physical interaction between their homodimers (Leary2004Human).

In human muscle mitochondria, a fraction of SCO1 is found to physically associate with the CcO holoenzyme complex, suggesting a role in maintaining cellular copper homeostasis rather than direct CuA site formation (Stiburek2009Loss).
