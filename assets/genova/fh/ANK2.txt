# ANK2

## Overview
The ANK2 gene encodes ankyrin-B, a cytoskeletal protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular organization and stability by anchoring integral membrane proteins to the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton. Ankyrin-B is categorized as a scaffolding protein, facilitating the proper localization and function of ion channels and transporters, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and electrical signaling, particularly in cardiac and neuronal tissues. The protein's modular structure, characterized by ankyrin repeats, ZU5 domains, and a death domain, allows for diverse protein interactions and functional versatility. Mutations in ANK2 have been implicated in various cardiac and neurological disorders, including type 4 long QT syndrome and autism spectrum disorders, underscoring its significance in human health (Hashemi2009Cardiac; Stevens2021Ankyrins; Cunha2009Ankyrin).

## Structure
The ANK2 gene encodes ankyrin-B, a protein characterized by a modular structure comprising several distinct domains. The primary structure includes 24 ankyrin repeats, each consisting of 33 amino acids arranged as two anti-parallel α-helices followed by a loop, forming a superhelical spiral (Cunha2009Ankyrin). These repeats create an elongated solenoid structure with a conserved inner groove, allowing for diverse protein interactions (Wang2014Structural).

The secondary structure of ankyrin-B features a β-sandwich fold in the ZU5 domains, while the UPA domain has a distinct topology with two antiparallel β-sheets (Wang2012Structure). The death domain (DD) adopts a typical death domain fold, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure (Wang2012Structure).

Ankyrin-B's quaternary structure involves the formation of a ZZU supramodule, comprising ZU5 N, ZU5 C, and UPA domains, which are tightly packed together, while the DD domain remains accessible (Wang2012Structure). This supramodule is essential for ankyrin-B's function, providing interaction surfaces for various targets (Wang2012Structure).

Ankyrin-B undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity across different tissues (Sharma2020Human).

## Function
The ANK2 gene encodes ankyrin-B, a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and structural integrity by linking integral membrane proteins to the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton. In healthy human cells, ankyrin-B is involved in the regulation of ion channels and transporters, which are essential for maintaining normal cardiac rhythm and function. It ensures the proper expression and membrane localization of proteins such as the Na/Ca exchanger, Na/K ATPase, and IP3 receptor, which are involved in calcium signaling and membrane potential regulation (Hashemi2009Cardiac).

Ankyrin-B is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, where it is critical for the organization of ion channel and transporter signaling complexes. This organization is vital for maintaining proper ion balance and electrical signaling in cardiomyocytes, supporting normal cardiac excitability and rhythm (Hashemi2009Cardiac; Cunha2008Exon). In the sinoatrial node, ankyrin-B is necessary for the correct targeting of ion channels involved in calcium influx and efflux, which is vital for normal pacemaker activity (Cunha2009Ankyrin). Disruption of ankyrin-B function can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other heart-related issues, highlighting its essential role in cardiac health (Sharma2020Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANK2 gene, which encodes ankyrin-B, are associated with a range of neurological and cardiac conditions. In the neurological domain, ANK2 mutations are linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), with specific variants like AnkB-440 kDa and ANK2-013 being implicated. These mutations can lead to increased axonal branching and cortical connectivity, as well as an increased number of excitatory synapses during development (Yang2019ANK2; Stevens2021Ankyrins). ANK2 is also a shared genetic risk factor for schizophrenia, with certain isoforms being upregulated in affected individuals (Stevens2021Ankyrins).

In the cardiac realm, ANK2 mutations are linked to type 4 long QT syndrome (LQT4), characterized by prolonged QT intervals and associated with arrhythmias and other cardiac dysfunctions. Specific mutations, such as E1425G, can lead to severe bradycardia and ventricular arrhythmias (Mohler2007Defining; Sharma2020Human). The ANK2 p.S646F variant is associated with structural heart disease and increased risk of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (Swayne2017Novel). ANK2 variants also play a role in metabolic conditions, influencing glucose and fat metabolism, and are linked to type 2 diabetes (York2022Mechanisms).

## Interactions
Ankyrin-B, encoded by the ANK2 gene, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular organization and stability. In cardiac muscles, ankyrin-B interacts with ion channels and transporters, such as Na/K ATPase, L-type Ca2+ channels, IP3 receptors, and ryanodine receptors, to maintain heart rhythm by regulating ion flow and electrical signaling (Sharma2020Human). It also acts as a binding partner for B56a, the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which modulates these ion channels and transporters (Sharma2020Human).

In the brain, ankyrin-B interacts with the Na V 1.2 channel, playing a critical role in its localization to dendrites of neocortical neurons. This interaction is essential for maintaining dendritic excitability and synaptic function, with ankyrin-B serving as a primary scaffold for Na V channels (Nelson2022Physical). The 220 kDa isoform of ankyrin-B is particularly important for this process, as it correlates with Na V 1.2 expression in dendrites (Nelson2022Physical). Ankyrin-B's interaction with Na V 1.2 is mediated by a conserved nine amino acid motif in the Na V 1.2 II-III loop, which is crucial for binding (Nelson2022Physical).
