# ARL10

## Overview
The ARL10 gene encodes the ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 10, a member of the ARF family of GTP-binding proteins. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal organization. ARL10, in particular, is categorized as a small GTPase, which plays a crucial role in intracellular signaling pathways. The protein's function is characterized by its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP, a process essential for its role in cellular dynamics and signaling (Qiu2020aarFDC). While the specific biological functions of ARL10 are still under investigation, its involvement in cellular processes suggests potential implications in various physiological and pathological contexts.
