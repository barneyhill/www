# H4C15

## Overview
H4C15 is a gene that encodes the H4 clustered histone 15 protein, a core component of the nucleosome, which is essential for the packaging of DNA into chromatin in eukaryotic cells. As a histone protein, H4 clustered histone 15 plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression by influencing chromatin structure and accessibility. This protein is involved in nucleosome formation and chromatin remodeling, processes that are crucial for DNA replication, repair, and transcription. H4C15 has been implicated in various biological pathways, including those related to cancer, where its expression levels and interactions with other proteins, such as ribosomal protein S6, have been associated with disease progression and patient prognosis (Shetty2023Peripheral; DíazCampos2024Functional). Despite its recognized importance, the specific interaction partners and mechanisms of H4C15 remain an active area of research, highlighting the need for further studies to fully understand its role in cellular and pathological processes (Arjmand2023Evaluation).

## Clinical Significance
The H4C15 gene, encoding a histone protein, has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromatin structure and gene expression regulation. In lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), H4C15 is associated with ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) and core histone proteins H3C1 and H4C1. This association is significantly correlated with patient survival, suggesting that alterations in H4C15 expression may impact lung cancer prognosis (DíazCampos2024Functional).

In colorectal cancer, high expression of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3 tyr705) is linked to worse outcomes and is associated with the upregulation of H4C15. This suggests that H4C15 may play a role in the progression of colorectal cancer, particularly in stromal-rich tumors (Pennel2024JAKSTAT3).

While the specific role of H4C15 in diseases is not fully detailed, its interactions with other histone proteins and involvement in cancer-related pathways indicate its potential significance in oncogenesis. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which H4C15 contributes to cancer development and progression.

## Interactions
H4C15, a histone H4 protein, is involved in various interactions within chromatin structures. Although specific physical interactions of H4C15 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed extensively, it is known to participate in nucleosome formation and chromatin remodeling. In the context of systemic lupus erythematosus, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, and alcoholism, H4C15 is upregulated and interacts within networks that impact these pathways, suggesting its involvement in protein-protein interactions (Shetty2023Peripheral). 

In lung cancer research, H4C15 is associated with ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6), although this relationship is not as significant as with other proteins like SRCIN1. The study suggests a potential involvement of H4C15 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) progression, indicating its role in cancer-related pathways (DíazCampos2024Functional). 

Despite these associations, H4C15 remains isolated in some protein interaction networks, indicating no identified interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in certain studies (Arjmand2023Evaluation). This suggests that while H4C15 is implicated in various biological processes, its specific interaction partners and mechanisms require further investigation.
