# B3GALNT1

## Overview
B3GALNT1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme beta-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1, which is a glycosyltransferase involved in the glycosylation of glycolipids and glycoproteins. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids, particularly in the formation of globoside blood group antigens, by transferring N-acetylgalactosamine to specific substrates. The activity of beta-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell-cell interactions, signaling, and immune responses, due to its involvement in the synthesis of complex carbohydrates on cell surfaces (Yamamoto2019ABO; Cid2019Amino). The enzyme is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus and is associated with the production of the FORS1 antigen, a component of the Forssman blood group system, underscoring its significance in antigen synthesis (Yamamoto2019ABO). Alterations in the expression of B3GALNT1 have been linked to clinical conditions such as non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Umeyama2014TINAGL1).

## Structure
B3GALNT1 encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in glycosylation by adding N-acetylgalactosamine to glycolipids and glycoproteins. The primary structure of B3GALNT1 consists of amino acid sequences that form specific domains, including the glycosyltransferase domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. The secondary structure of the protein includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to its stability and function.

The tertiary structure of B3GALNT1 involves the three-dimensional folding of these secondary structural elements, allowing the enzyme to achieve its functional conformation. This folding is critical for the enzyme's ability to interact with its substrates and perform its glycosylation function effectively. While the quaternary structure of B3GALNT1 is not detailed in the provided context, it may involve interactions with other proteins, which is common for enzymes involved in complex biochemical pathways.

Post-translational modifications of B3GALNT1 can include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and stability. These modifications are important for the enzyme's function and can influence its interactions with other cellular components. The presence of splice variant isoforms is not mentioned in the context, so no information is provided on this aspect.

## Function
The B3GALNT1 gene encodes the enzyme β1,3-N-acetyl-d-galactosaminyltransferase 1, which plays a crucial role in glycosylation processes within human cells. This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of glycosphingolipids, specifically by catalyzing the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to glycolipids and glycoproteins. This process is essential for the formation of complex carbohydrates on cell surfaces, which are important for cell-cell interactions, signaling, and immune responses (Yamamoto2019ABO; Cid2019Amino).

In the cellular context, the enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the biosynthesis of globoside blood group antigens. The B3GALNT1 gene product is particularly important for the efficient synthesis of globoside (Gb4) from its precursor, lactosylceramide (LacCer). This synthesis is enhanced when β1,3-N-acetyl-d-galactosaminyltransferase 1 is co-expressed with α1,4-galactosyltransferase, indicating its role in providing necessary substrates for glycosyltransferase activity (Yamamoto2019ABO).

The enzyme's activity is also linked to the production of the FORS1 antigen, a component of the Forssman blood group system, highlighting its involvement in antigen synthesis and the complexity of glycosylation in different cell types (Yamamoto2019ABO).

## Clinical Significance
B3GALNT1 has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in glycosylation processes. Altered expression of B3GALNT1 is associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it is considered a potential therapeutic target. Inhibiting B3GALNT1 could suppress metastasis in NSCLC, as its upregulation is linked to cancer progression (Umeyama2014TINAGL1). The gene's involvement in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis also suggests a role in resistance to Escherichia coli F18 in piglets, although its direct impact on human diseases related to glycosphingolipid pathways remains less clear (Dong2016Expression).

Mutations in B3GALNT1, while uncommon, have been identified in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, although no fusion transcripts involving B3GALNT1 have been reported (Aubry2015Chromosomal). The gene is part of the GT31 family, which includes other genes associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), but specific diseases directly linked to B3GALNT1 mutations are not detailed in the available literature (Hansen2014A). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical significance of B3GALNT1 in human diseases.
