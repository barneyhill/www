# FAIM2

## Overview
FAIM2 (Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein belonging to the BAX inhibitor motif-containing (TMBIM) family, which plays a pivotal role in regulating apoptosis and autophagy. The protein encoded by FAIM2 is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains and is predominantly expressed in the adult central nervous system, where it contributes to neuroprotection by inhibiting Fas-mediated apoptotic pathways (Hong2019Fas‐apoptotic; Cai2022FAIM2). FAIM2 interacts with various cellular components, including the Fas receptor and the pro-apoptotic protein p53, to modulate cell survival and stress responses (Pawar2017FAS; Besirli2012ERKMediated). Its involvement in critical cellular processes and its dysregulation in several cancers highlight its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker in oncology (She2021FAIM2; Kang2016FAIM2).

## Structure
FAIM2 (Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2) is a member of the transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif-containing (TMBIM) family, characterized by its seven transmembrane domains located in the C-terminal part of the protein (Hong2019Fas‐apoptotic). This structure is evolutionarily conserved and predominantly expressed in the adult central nervous system. FAIM2 contains a functional LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, identified as SWAYV (amino acids 64-68), which is crucial for its interaction with the lipidated form of LC3, MAP1LC3B-II, facilitating autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Hong2019Fas‐apoptotic). 

The protein is involved in autophagy and apoptosis regulation, localizing to lysosomes and late endosomes, and its lysosomal localization increases upon autophagy induction (Hong2019Fas‐apoptotic). FAIM2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which enhances its binding to the FAS receptor, crucial for its neuroprotective function (Pawar2017FAS). The protein is also subject to ubiquitination, with deubiquitination occurring under stress conditions, preventing its degradation and leading to its accumulation (Pawar2017FAS). These structural features and modifications underscore FAIM2's role in cellular processes, particularly in autophagy and apoptosis inhibition.

## Function
FAIM2, also known as Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2, is a protein that plays a crucial role in inhibiting apoptosis, particularly in neuronal cells. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in the regulation of cell survival by interfering with Fas-mediated apoptotic pathways (Cai2022FAIM2). FAIM2 is located in the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and plasma membrane, where it contributes to maintaining calcium balance in the ER, which is essential for its resistance to FAS-mediated apoptosis (Cai2022FAIM2). This protein is part of the Lifeguard (LFG) family and acts as an anti-apoptotic molecule by interacting with Fas upstream of Fas-associated death domain containing protein (FADD) to suppress apoptosis, enhancing resistance to Fas-regulated apoptosis (She2016lncRNASNHG7).

In addition to its role in apoptosis inhibition, FAIM2 supports axonal growth, indicating its involvement in neuroprotection and the maintenance of healthy neural function (PlanellsFerrer2014MYCN). The protein's anti-apoptotic activity is crucial for the survival of neuronal cells, contributing to the overall health and function of the nervous system (Cai2022FAIM2).

## Clinical Significance
FAIM2 (Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2) plays a significant role in various cancers and other diseases through its expression levels and interactions. In small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and atypical carcinoid tumors, FAIM2 is overexpressed, inhibiting Fas-mediated apoptosis and contributing to tumor survival. This overexpression is associated with reduced expression of pro-apoptotic genes, suggesting FAIM2 as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for these cancers (Kang2016FAIM2).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), FAIM2 is highly expressed, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis. Its role in enhancing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and bone metastasis highlights its potential as a therapeutic target (She2021FAIM2).

FAIM2 is also implicated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where hyper-methylation leads to down-regulation of the gene, correlating with poor prognosis. This altered methylation status is linked to reduced gene expression and poorer survival outcomes (Chatterjee2022DNA).

In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), FAIM2 is upregulated, suggesting a role in disease progression and potential as a biomarker (Shahpouri2023Upregulation). These findings underscore FAIM2's involvement in cancer progression and its potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
FAIM2 (Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2) is involved in several protein interactions that contribute to its role in inhibiting apoptosis. It interacts with the pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor protein p53 and the chaperone protein HSP90. This interaction forms a complex that plays a role in inhibiting apoptosis by stabilizing the p53/HSP90 complex, which in turn inhibits p53-mediated Fas transcription and caspase activation (Pawar2017FAS). FAIM2's interaction with HSP90 is dependent on FAIM2 phosphorylation, and inhibition of HSP90 activity can prevent the increase of FAIM2 levels following FAS receptor activation (Pawar2017FAS).

FAIM2 also interacts with the Fas receptor, a key player in apoptosis signaling, and acts early in the Fas signaling pathway to inhibit apoptosis. This interaction is crucial for preventing caspase activation and apoptosis in response to Fas receptor activation (Besirli2012ERKMediated). FAIM2 is also involved in autophagy, where it interacts with the lipidated form of MAP1LC3B-II through a functional LC3 interaction region (LIR) motif. This interaction is essential for autophagosome-lysosome fusion, a critical step in autophagy (Hong2019Fas‐apoptotic). These interactions highlight FAIM2's multifaceted role in regulating cell survival and stress responses.
