# ZNF649

## Overview
ZNF649 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 649, a member of the Kruppel-type zinc-finger protein family, which functions primarily as a transcriptional suppressor. The protein is characterized by an N-terminal Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and multiple C2H2 zinc-finger motifs, which are typical features of transcription factors involved in gene regulation (Yang2005ZNF649). Zinc finger protein 649 is predominantly expressed in the heart, skeletal muscle, and brain, indicating its potential role in transcriptional regulation during development and in maintaining cellular functions across various tissues (Yang2005ZNF649). The protein's involvement in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway suggests its significance in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell death (Yang2005ZNF649). Additionally, ZNF649 has been implicated in maintaining DNA methylation levels in retroelements, highlighting its role in epigenetic regulation (Fukuda2021Transcriptional; Fukuda2022Potential).

## Structure
The ZNF649 gene encodes a Kruppel-type zinc-finger protein that functions as a transcriptional suppressor. The primary structure of ZNF649 consists of 505 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 59 kDa (Yang2005ZNF649). The protein features an N-terminal Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, spanning amino acids 8-68, which is a classical KRAB-AB box known for its role in transcriptional repression (Yang2005ZNF649). The KRAB domain is enriched in charged amino acids and can fold into amphipathic alpha helices, contributing to its function as a transcriptional repressor when tethered to DNA (Yang2005ZNF649).

The secondary structure of ZNF649 includes 10 C2H2 zinc-finger motifs, which extend to the end of the protein sequence. These motifs are characteristic of transcription factor proteins and are involved in DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions (Fernandes2018KRAB; Yang2005ZNF649). The zinc-finger domains facilitate specific DNA binding, which is crucial for the protein's role in gene expression regulation (delahaye2018characterisation).

ZNF649 is expressed in most human adult and embryonic tissues, with predominant expression in the heart, skeletal muscle, and brain (Yang2005ZNF649). The protein's evolutionary conservation is demonstrated by its similarity to other C2H2 type zinc-finger proteins, such as ZNF613, ZNF615, and ZNF350 (Yang2005ZNF649).

## Function
ZNF649 encodes a Kruppel-type zinc-finger protein that functions primarily as a transcriptional suppressor in healthy human cells. The protein is characterized by an N-terminal Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and 10 C2H2 zinc-finger motifs, which are typical features of transcription factors involved in gene regulation (Yang2005ZNF649). ZNF649 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and influences gene expression, particularly by suppressing transcriptional activity. This suppression is evident in its ability to inhibit the transcriptional activities of serum response element (SRE) and activation protein 1 (AP-1) when overexpressed in COS-7 cells (Yang2005ZNF649).

The KRAB domain within ZNF649 acts as a basal repression domain, suggesting its role in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, which is crucial for cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell death (Yang2005ZNF649). ZNF649's expression is widespread in both adult and embryonic tissues, with predominant expression in the heart, skeletal muscle, and brain, indicating its potential role in transcriptional regulation during development and in maintaining cellular functions across various tissues (Yang2005ZNF649).

## Interactions
ZNF649 is a transcriptional suppressor that functions as part of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which is involved in the repression of gene expression. It has been shown to interact with DNA elements, particularly in the context of maintaining DNA methylation levels in retroelements. ZNF649 binds to the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of L1 transposable elements, where its binding motifs correlate with higher DNA methylation levels, suggesting a role in DNA demethylation resistance (Fukuda2021Transcriptional; Fukuda2022Potential).

In the context of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, ZNF649 acts as a transcriptional repressor. It inhibits the transcriptional activities of serum response element (SRE) and activation protein 1 (AP-1) in COS-7 cells, indicating its role in modulating cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (Lim2015Transcriptional; Yang2005ZNF649).

While specific protein-protein interactions involving ZNF649 are not detailed in the available literature, its function as a transcriptional suppressor suggests it may interact with other proteins involved in transcriptional regulation. The KRAB domain within ZNF649 is known to facilitate protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for its repressive functions (Yang2005ZNF649).
