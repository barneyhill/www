# GREB1L

## Overview
The GREB1L gene encodes a protein known as GREB1-like retinoic acid receptor coactivator, which functions as a nuclear coactivator involved in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. This protein plays a pivotal role in modulating transcriptional activity, particularly in pathways influenced by retinoic acid, thereby impacting processes such as cell differentiation and organogenesis. GREB1L is crucial for the development of various tissues, including the peripheral nervous system, craniofacial structures, and the inner ear. It is also a significant player in kidney development, where it is implicated in congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) due to its role in retinoic acid signaling pathways (Lasić2021GREB1L; Schrauwen2020Autosomal). Mutations in GREB1L have been associated with a range of congenital disorders, including Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome and sensorineural hearing loss, underscoring its importance in normal developmental processes (Kyei2021GREB1L; Schrauwen2020Autosomal).

## Function
The GREB1L gene encodes a protein that functions as a coactivator for retinoic acid receptors, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression during development. This protein is involved in the modulation of transcriptional activity, impacting processes such as cell differentiation and organ development. GREB1L is active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcription of genes essential for the development of various tissues, including the peripheral nervous system, craniofacial structures, and the inner ear (Schrauwen2018De; Schrauwen2020Autosomal).

In the context of kidney development, GREB1L is a target of retinoic acid signaling, a pathway critical for renal morphogenesis. Mutations in GREB1L have been linked to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), highlighting its importance in maintaining kidney homeostasis (Lasić2021GREB1L). The gene's expression is also significant during early craniofacial and inner ear development, where it is involved in the formation of the cochleovestibular nerve and sensory epithelia innervation (Schrauwen2018De). These roles underscore GREB1L's critical function in normal cellular and developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GREB1L gene are associated with a range of congenital anomalies, particularly affecting the renal and urogenital systems. GREB1L mutations have been implicated in Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, especially in cases involving renal agenesis and dysgenesis, where the absence of one or both kidneys can lead to severe outcomes, including fetal or neonatal death (Kyei2021GREB1L). The gene is also linked to renal hypodysplasia/aplasia-3 (RHDA3), a severe form of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), characterized by abnormal kidney development (Wu2022A).

GREB1L mutations are associated with inner ear malformations and congenital hearing impairment, including sensorineural hearing loss and vestibulocochlear anomalies (Kyei2021GREB1L; Schrauwen2020Autosomal). The gene's variants have been found in individuals with profound sensorineural hearing impairment, with some variants linked to bilateral cochlear aplasia and cochlear nerve aplasia (Schrauwen2020Autosomal).

The gene is also involved in reproductive tract anomalies, such as agenesis of the uterus and ovaries, and is frequently associated with familial congenital uterine malformations (Jacquinet2020GREB1L). These findings suggest that GREB1L plays a significant role in the development of multiple organ systems, with mutations leading to a broad spectrum of congenital disorders.
