# PRR33

## Overview
PRR33 is a gene that encodes the proline-rich protein 33, which is primarily involved in muscle differentiation and mitochondrial organization. The protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein due to its interaction with DESMIN, an intermediate filament protein. PRR33 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissues, where it functions as a pro-myogenic factor, promoting the differentiation of myocytes and enhancing the expression of myogenic markers such as MyoD and MyoG. It plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which is essential for energy production during myogenesis. The interaction between PRR33 and DESMIN is vital for maintaining mitochondrial organization and function, as well as the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton in muscle cells (Fu2024Adapting).

## Function
The PRR33 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in muscle differentiation and mitochondrial organization. In healthy cells, PRR33 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissues, where it acts as a pro-myogenic factor, promoting myocyte differentiation and enhancing the expression of myogenic markers such as MyoD and MyoG (Fu2024Adapting). PRR33 interacts with DESMIN, an intermediate filament protein, to facilitate mitochondrial transport and localization, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial organization and function in muscle cells (Fu2024Adapting).

The protein is involved in regulating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, a key energy source during myogenesis, and its depletion leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired muscle performance (Fu2024Adapting). PRR33's interaction with DESMIN also influences the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton, impacting intracellular mitochondrial organization and potentially affecting gene regulation in muscle cells (Fu2024Adapting). Overall, PRR33 is essential for proper muscle development and function, contributing to the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton and the connections between the cytoskeleton and mitochondria (Fu2024Adapting).

## Interactions
PRR33 is known to interact with the cytoskeletal protein DESMIN, which plays a crucial role in muscle differentiation and mitochondrial function. This interaction has been confirmed through various experimental approaches, including Turbo-ID-based proximal labeling, Mass Spectra (Turbo-ID-MS) proteomic analysis, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays, and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments. These studies have demonstrated that PRR33 forms complexes with DESMIN and co-localizes with it in muscle cells, suggesting a regulatory role in myoblast differentiation and mitochondrial organization (Fu2024Adapting).

The interaction between PRR33 and DESMIN is significant for the proper localization of DESMIN in cells, which affects the expression of myogenic genes such as MYOD and MYOGENIN. PRR33's role in modulating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and morphology is also highlighted, with its depletion affecting the expression of these key myogenic transcription factors (Fu2024Adapting). The dependency of DESMIN-mitochondria association on PRR33 is evident, as PRR33 deficiency results in abnormal distribution of DESMIN and mitochondria in muscle cells, indicating its role in maintaining the organization of these structures (Fu2024Adapting).
