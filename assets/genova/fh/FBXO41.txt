# FBXO41

## Overview
FBXO41 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 41, a neuron-specific protein that is part of the F-box family, known for their role in protein ubiquitination and degradation. This protein is a component of the SCF (Skp1/Cullin1/F-box) E3-ligase complex, which is crucial for targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (King2019Fbxo41). F-box protein 41 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a significant role in the regulation of neuronal primary cilia, sensory organelles essential for neuronal signaling (King2019Fbxo41). The protein is involved in the disassembly of these cilia, influencing key signaling pathways such as the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway, which is vital for brain development (King2019Fbxo41). Additionally, FBXO41 is implicated in neuronal migration and survival, particularly within the cerebellum, and its dysfunction is associated with neurological disorders characterized by motor deficits and cerebellar degeneration (Mukherjee2015Loss).

## Function
FBXO41 encodes a neuron-specific F-box protein that is part of the SCF (Skp1/Cullin1/F-box) E3-ligase complex, which is involved in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (King2019Fbxo41). This protein is enriched in the brain and plays a crucial role in the disassembly of neuronal primary cilia, which are sensory organelles important for signaling in neurons (King2019Fbxo41). FBXO41's function is linked to its F-box and coiled-coil domains, which are necessary for its targeting to centrioles, where it regulates cilia structure and signaling capacity (King2019Fbxo41).

The presence of FBXO41 at neuronal centrioles inversely correlates with the length of neuronal cilia, suggesting that it promotes cilia disassembly (King2019Fbxo41). This disassembly affects the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, a key pathway in brain development, by preventing the increase in Gli1 expression in response to Shh signaling (King2019Fbxo41). FBXO41 is also involved in neuronal migration and survival, particularly in the cerebellum, where its loss leads to delayed neuronal migration and ataxia-like motor deficits (Mukherjee2015Loss). These findings highlight FBXO41's significant role in maintaining neuronal function and structure.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the FBXO41 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders. The loss of FBXO41 in mice models results in an ataxia-like phenotype characterized by motor deficits, including a severely ataxic gait, impaired balance, and tremors. These symptoms are linked to defects in cerebellar development and neuronal migration, leading to cerebellar degeneration and abnormal architecture (Mukherjee2015Loss). The absence of FBXO41 causes delayed neuronal migration in the cerebellum, resulting in increased apoptosis and neurodegeneration, which can be rescued by expressing an RNAi-resistant form of FBXO41 (Mukherjee2015Loss).

FBXO41 is also associated with the regulation of neuronal primary cilia, which are crucial for brain development. Alterations in FBXO41 expression can impact ciliary structure and function, potentially leading to ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by dysfunctional cilia and associated with neurological deficits (King2019Fbxo41).

In the context of Parkinson's disease, genetic analysis of FBXO41 in Chinese Han patients identified several coding variants, but these did not show a strong association with the disease, suggesting that while FBXO41 may be involved, its role in Parkinson's disease requires further investigation (Cai2018Identifying; Liang2013Genetic).

## Interactions
FBXO41 is a CNS-specific F-box protein that participates in several critical interactions, particularly in the context of cerebellar development. It forms a non-canonical E3 ligase complex with Skp1 and cullin7, distinct from the typical SCF (Skp1-cullin1-F-box) complexes, as it does not interact with cullin1 (Mukherjee2024Functional). The interaction with Skp1 is mediated through its F-box domain, while its binding to cullin7 is independent of this domain and involves its N-and C-terminal domains (Mukherjee2024Functional).

FBXO41 also interacts with the neurofilament medium polypeptide (NFM) as part of the FBXO41-Cul7 complex. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination of NFM via K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are associated with non-proteolytic outcomes, stabilizing NFM and promoting axon growth (Mukherjee2024Functional). The presence of FBXO41 is necessary for the association of NFM with cullin7, indicating that FBXO41 specifically recruits NFM to the complex (Mukherjee2024Functional).

FBXO41's interactions extend to other proteins involved in neuronal migration, such as DISC1 and potentially NDEL1, suggesting a role in regulating these processes (Mukherjee2024Functional). These interactions highlight FBXO41's multifaceted role in cerebellar development and neuronal health.
