# TBCK

## Overview
The TBCK gene encodes the TBC1 domain containing kinase, a protein that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which is essential for cell growth, proliferation, and cytoskeletal organization (Liu2013TBCK). The protein is characterized by three conserved domains: an N-terminal Serine/Threonine kinase domain, a central TBC domain, and a C-terminal rhodanese homology domain (RHOD) (Wu2020Multiple; Liu2013TBCK). Although the kinase domain suggests a role as a Serine/Threonine protein kinase, it may function as a pseudokinase due to the absence of some conserved motifs necessary for kinase activity (Wu2020Multiple; Liu2013TBCK). TBCK is involved in intracellular vesicle transport and autophagy regulation, with its dysfunction linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders and muscle diseases (Saredi2020Myopathic; Ortiz‐González2018Homozygous). The gene's mutations are associated with conditions such as infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies type 3 (IHPRF3) and severe infantile syndromic encephalopathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Chong2016Recessive; Tan2022Identification).

## Structure
The TBCK protein, encoded by the TBCK gene, is characterized by three conserved domains: the N-terminal Serine/Threonine kinase domain, the central TBC domain, and the C-terminal rhodanese homology domain (RHOD) (Wu2020Multiple; Liu2013TBCK). The kinase domain is capable of binding GTP and exhibits protein kinase activities, suggesting a role as a Serine/Threonine protein kinase, although it may function as a pseudokinase due to the lack of some conserved motifs necessary for kinase activity (Wu2020Multiple; Liu2013TBCK). The TBC domain, typically involved in GTPase-activating functions, does not interact with known Rab proteins, indicating a unique function within TBCK (Wu2020Multiple). The RHOD domain's function remains unclear, though it is homologous to rhodanese (Wu2020Multiple).

TBCK exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with long isoforms containing all three domains and short isoforms lacking the kinase domain (Wu2020Multiple). These isoforms contribute to the protein's diverse cellular roles and localization patterns, including associations with the mitotic apparatus and potential localization to the plasma membrane, nucleus, and mitochondrion (Wu2020Multiple).

## Function
The TBCK gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in several cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth, proliferation, and actin organization (Liu2013TBCK). TBCK influences mTOR signaling at the transcriptional level, affecting the expression of mTOR complex components and downstream substrates, thereby promoting cell proliferation and growth (Liu2013TBCK). It is also involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton, as its depletion disrupts actin organization without significantly affecting microtubule structures (Liu2013TBCK).

TBCK is implicated in intracellular vesicle transport, particularly in the endocytic and early secretory pathways, where it shows high colocalization with proteins such as STAM, RAB5A, COPII, and clathrin (Moreira2022Neuroprogenitor). It is also associated with the regulation of autophagy and lysosomal function, as its loss leads to increased autophagosome accumulation and impaired oligosaccharide degradation (Ortiz‐González2018Homozygous). TBCK is expressed in various cell types and is localized near the nucleus and around centrosomes, indicating its involvement in maintaining normal cell function and structure (Liu2013TBCK).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBCK gene are linked to several severe neurodevelopmental disorders. One such condition is infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies type 3 (IHPRF3), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by global developmental delay, profound hypotonia, and distinctive facial features (Tan2022Identification; Dai2022A). Patients with TBCK mutations often exhibit severe intellectual impairment, epilepsy, and progressive neuromuscular weakness, which can lead to chronic respiratory failure (Sabanathan2023Expanding; Ortiz‐González2018Homozygous).

TBCK mutations are also associated with severe infantile syndromic encephalopathy, characterized by developmental delay, brain atrophy, and seizures. This condition is linked to impaired mTOR signaling, a pathway crucial for cell growth and proliferation (Chong2016Recessive). The gene's dysfunction can lead to mitochondrial abnormalities, including reduced mitochondrial biogenesis and increased reactive oxygen species levels, contributing to neurodegeneration (TintosHernández2021Lysosomal).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, TBCK mutations have been implicated in muscle disease, with affected individuals showing myopathic changes and severe psychomotor delay (Saredi2020Myopathic). The gene's role in both tumor suppression and promotion in various cancers has also been noted, though its exact function in oncogenesis remains unclear (Wu2020Multiple).

## Interactions
TBCK (TBC1 domain containing kinase) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It contains three functional domains: an N-terminal Serine/Threonine kinase domain, a central TBC domain, and a C-terminal rhodanese homology domain (RHOD) (Wu2020Multiple). The TBC domain is part of the RabGAP family, although TBCK does not physically interact with known Rab proteins (Wu2020Multiple). Despite this, the TBC domain is crucial for modulating mTOR signaling and Rab GTPase activity, with mutations in this domain affecting its GAP activity (Chong2016Recessive).

TBCK interacts with components of the mTOR signaling pathway, influencing the phosphorylation of downstream substrates such as 4E-BP1, p70S6K, and Akt (Liu2013TBCK). It also shows colocalization with proteins involved in endocytic and secretory pathways, including caveolin, RAB5A, COPII, GM130/GOLGA2, clathrin, and STAM, indicating its role in intracellular vesicle transport (Moreira2022Neuroprogenitor). The protein's interactions suggest its involvement in regulating cell proliferation, growth, and actin organization through the mTOR signaling network (Chong2016Recessive). These interactions highlight TBCK's role in critical cellular processes and its potential impact on neurodevelopmental disorders and tumorigenesis.
