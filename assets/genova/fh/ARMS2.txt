# ARMS2

## Overview
The ARMS2 gene encodes the age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 protein, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a prevalent cause of vision impairment in the elderly. Located on chromosome 10q26, ARMS2 is primarily associated with the extracellular matrix of the eye, particularly in regions critical for drusen formation, a hallmark of AMD (Kortvely2010ARMS2). The ARMS2 protein is secreted and interacts with matrix proteins such as fibulin-6, suggesting a role in maintaining matrix integrity (Kortvely2010ARMS2). Additionally, ARMS2 functions as a surface-bound complement activator, enhancing immune responses through interactions with the complement system, notably properdin, which may influence the clearance of cellular debris in the retina (Micklisch2017Agerelated). Variants in the ARMS2 gene, such as rs10490924, are strongly linked to increased AMD risk, although the exact mechanisms remain under investigation (Shughoury2022Molecular).

## Structure


## Function
The ARMS2 gene is associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and is located in the chromosomal region 10q26. The ARMS2 protein is believed to play a significant role in the extracellular matrix, particularly in the choroid pillars of the human eye, which are principal sites of drusen formation. It is suggested that ARMS2 is a secreted protein that interacts with several matrix proteins, including fibulin-6 (hemicentin-1), which is implicated in familial AMD (Kortvely2010ARMS2). Despite lacking a classic targeting sequence, ARMS2 is translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum before secretion, indicating its involvement in extracellular matrix function, crucial for AMD progression (Kortvely2010ARMS2).

ARMS2 is primarily located in the cytosol and is secreted extracellularly, challenging previous notions of its mitochondrial function (Kortvely2010ARMS2). The protein's interaction with extracellular matrix components, such as fibulin-1 and fibulin-6, suggests it may be necessary for proper matrix function, which is crucial in the progression of AMD (Kortvely2010ARMS2). ARMS2 is strongly localized around the capillaries of the choroid, particularly in the intercapillary pillars, with the highest concentration near Bruch's membrane (Kortvely2010ARMS2).

## Clinical Significance
The ARMS2 gene is significantly associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss in older adults. Variants in ARMS2, such as the missense variant rs10490924, are strongly linked to an increased risk of AMD, particularly in certain populations like East Asians and Caucasians (Shughoury2022Molecular; Kim2013Gene–Gene). This variant is associated with a younger onset of AMD and may influence the response to anti-VEGF therapy in neovascular AMD (Shughoury2022Molecular).

The ARMS2 gene is located on chromosome 10q26, near the HTRA1 gene, and both are part of a major susceptibility locus for AMD. The high linkage disequilibrium between ARMS2 and HTRA1 variants complicates the determination of the specific causal factor for AMD risk (May2021Ongoing; Ismail2024Association). The ARMS2 rs10490924 variant is thought to affect the complement system, potentially enhancing complement activation and contributing to retinal inflammation and damage (Micklisch2017Agerelated).

Despite its association with AMD, the precise mechanisms by which ARMS2 variants contribute to the disease remain unclear. The gene's weak expression in retinal tissues and its debated localization further complicate understanding its role in AMD pathogenesis (May2021Ongoing).

## Interactions
The ARMS2 protein is involved in several interactions with components of the complement system, particularly with the complement activator properdin. ARMS2 binds to properdin in a dose-dependent manner, a relationship confirmed through biolayer interferometry, which identified the C-terminal part of ARMS2 as the binding domain for properdin. This interaction facilitates the recruitment of C3b, enhancing C3b opsonization on cell surfaces, which is crucial for complement activation and the clearance of cellular debris (Micklisch2017Agerelated).

ARMS2 does not bind to C3, factor B, or the cleavage products C3b, iC3b, and C3d directly. Instead, it acts as a surface molecule that enhances C3b opsonization via properdin binding, which may aid in the opsonization and phagocytosis of dead cells by microglia cells with the non-risk ARMS2 gene (Micklisch2017Agerelated). ARMS2 also binds to cell surfaces through glycosaminoglycans, specifically heparan sulfate, and this binding is associated with complement activation, a process implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (Micklisch2017Agerelated). These interactions highlight ARMS2's role as a surface-bound complement activator, influencing immune responses in the retina.
