# GMPS

## Overview
Guanine monophosphate synthase (GMPS) is a gene that encodes the enzyme guanine monophosphate synthase, which is crucial in the purine biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of xanthosine monophosphate (XMP) to guanosine monophosphate (GMP), a vital step in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. These nucleotides are essential for the synthesis of DNA and RNA, thereby playing a significant role in cell proliferation and maintenance. GMPS is active in the cytoplasm of healthy human cells, where it helps maintain nucleotide pool balance, influencing cellular replication and energy balance (BianchiSmiraglia2015Pharmacological; Sommerville2019Identification). The enzyme also interacts with monothiol glutaredoxins, such as human Glrx3, which are involved in the regulation of the integrated stress response pathway and iron homeostasis (Mechoud2020Interactions). These interactions underscore the enzyme's broader role in cellular homeostasis and metabolic regulation.

## Function
Guanine monophosphate synthase (GMPS) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, which are essential for DNA and RNA synthesis. GMPS catalyzes the conversion of xanthosine monophosphate (XMP) to guanosine monophosphate (GMP), a key step in purine biosynthesis. This process is vital for cell proliferation and maintenance, as it provides the necessary building blocks for nucleic acid synthesis, impacting cellular replication and energy balance (BianchiSmiraglia2015Pharmacological).

In healthy human cells, GMPS is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining the balance of nucleotide pools. This balance is crucial for proper cell function, as it influences the synthesis of DNA and RNA, thereby affecting cell growth and division (Sommerville2019Identification). The enzyme's activity ensures that cells have adequate supplies of guanine nucleotides, which are necessary for various cellular processes, including signal transduction and energy transfer.

The role of GMPS in nucleotide metabolism highlights its importance in cellular homeostasis and genetic material replication. By facilitating the production of GMP, GMPS supports the overall metabolic and proliferative needs of the cell, ensuring efficient cellular function and organismal health (BianchiSmiraglia2015Pharmacological).

## Interactions
Guanine monophosphate synthase (GMPS) interacts with monothiol glutaredoxins, specifically human Glrx3 and yeast Grx3 and Grx4. These interactions are evolutionarily conserved and play a significant role in the regulation of the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. GMPS interacts with Glrx3/Grx3/Grx4 through specific residues that affect binding to iron/sulfur clusters, which are essential for the interaction. Mutations in Glrx3 that impair its ability to bind iron/sulfur clusters prevent the formation of the Glrx3/GMPS complex (Mechoud2020Interactions).

The interaction between GMPS and Glrx3 is suggested to be involved in the regulation of guanine metabolism, ISR activation, and iron homeostasis. Glrx3/Grx3/Grx4 proteins may function as iron chaperones, potentially transferring iron to GMPS or other proteins involved in guanine metabolism. The formation of the Glrx3/GMPS complex might be necessary for sensing or synthesizing GTP or regulating GMPS function under nutritional limitation (Mechoud2020Interactions).

In yeast, the deletion of both GRX3 and GRX4 leads to increased phosphorylation of eIF2α, indicating activation of the ISR pathway. This effect is linked to iron homeostasis and nutrient deprivation, suggesting that the interaction between Glrx3 and GMPS modulates the ISR pathway, potentially affecting purine metabolism (Mechoud2020Interactions).
