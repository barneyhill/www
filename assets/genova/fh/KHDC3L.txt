# KHDC3L

## Overview
KHDC3L is a gene that encodes the KH domain containing 3 like protein, which is a crucial component of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC) involved in early embryonic development. This protein is primarily expressed in oocytes and early embryos, where it plays a significant role in maintaining genomic integrity and facilitating proper embryogenesis. As a cytoplasmic protein, KHDC3L interacts with other SCMC components, such as NLRP5, OOEP, and TLE6, to ensure the structural and functional integrity of the complex (Zhu2014Identification). The gene is essential for DNA repair mechanisms, which are critical for trophoblast cell proliferation and differentiation, thereby influencing placental development (Rockenbach2023Revealing). Mutations in KHDC3L have been linked to reproductive failures, including recurrent pregnancy loss and hydatidiform moles, due to its pivotal role in genomic stability and placental development (Zhang2019KHDC3L; Rockenbach2023Revealing).

## Structure


## Function
KHDC3L is a gene encoding a protein that is a component of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), which plays a crucial role in early embryonic development. The protein is primarily active in oocytes and early embryos, where it is involved in maintaining genomic integrity and facilitating proper embryogenesis (Zhu2014Identification). KHDC3L is enriched in the human ovary, specifically in oocytes, and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm (Zhu2014Identification). It is part of a network of proteins that co-localize in the subcortex of oocytes and early embryos, interacting with other SCMC components such as NLRP5, OOEP, and TLE6 (Zhu2014Identification).

The gene is implicated in safeguarding genome integrity through DNA repair mechanisms, which are essential for proper trophoblast cell proliferation and differentiation, affecting placental development (Rockenbach2023Revealing). Variants in KHDC3L are associated with reproductive failures, such as recurrent pregnancy loss and hydatidiform moles, due to its role in maintaining genomic stability and proper placental development (Rockenbach2023Revealing). The protein's expression and co-expression patterns with other SCMC genes are altered in reproductive failure conditions, indicating its potential role in early embryonic development and fertility (Rockenbach2023Revealing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KHDC3L gene are associated with several reproductive health issues, particularly recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and recurrent hydatidiform moles (RHMs). KHDC3L mutations can lead to genomic instability in early embryonic cells, contributing to RPL by impairing DNA repair mechanisms and causing apoptosis (Zhang2019KHDC3L). Specific deletions in KHDC3L, such as p.E150_V160del and p.E150_V172del, have been identified in female RPL patients, highlighting the gene's critical role in maintaining genomic stability (Zhang2019KHDC3L).

In the context of RHMs, KHDC3L mutations result in abnormal growth of trophoblastic tissue during pregnancy. These mutations are often protein-truncating and can be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (Rezaei2016Two; Reddy2012Report). The c.1A>G mutation in KHDC3L has been linked to genome-wide DNA methylation loss in oocytes, leading to imprinting defects post-fertilization (Demond2019A). This mutation disrupts normal methylation patterns, contributing to the development of RHMs (Demond2019A).

KHDC3L is also implicated in conditions like Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome and pseudohypoparathyroidism 1b, where its variants may contribute to imprinting disturbances and aneuploidies (Pignata2022Novel).

## Interactions
KHDC3L is a component of the human subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), where it interacts with several other proteins crucial for early embryonic development. It physically interacts with NLRP5, OOEP, and TLE6, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. These interactions are essential for the proper localization and function of the SCMC in human oocytes and early embryos (Zhu2014Identification). KHDC3L also co-localizes with NLRP7, another maternal-effect gene, suggesting a potential role in intracellular trafficking and cytokine secretion, although this specific function was not directly assessed (Reddy2012Report).

In addition to its role in the SCMC, KHDC3L interacts with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), a key enzyme in the DNA damage response. This interaction is crucial for regulating homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability in early embryonic cells. Mutations in KHDC3L can impair these processes, leading to increased genomic instability and reproductive issues such as recurrent pregnancy loss (Zhang2019KHDC3L). These interactions highlight KHDC3L's critical role in both the structural integrity of the SCMC and the maintenance of genomic stability during early embryogenesis.
