# CBX7

## Overview
CBX7 is a gene that encodes the chromobox protein homolog 7, a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which are critical for chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. The CBX7 protein is characterized by its chromodomain, which facilitates the recognition of methylated histones, particularly the repressive histone mark H3K27me3, thereby playing a pivotal role in maintaining the transcriptionally repressive state of genes (Ren2015SmallMolecule; Yap2010Molecular). As a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), CBX7 is involved in regulating cell proliferation, senescence, and differentiation by modulating the expression of key genes (Yap2010Molecular). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), underscore its role in gene expression and cancer progression (Federico2009Chromobox; Federico2019The). Alterations in CBX7 expression have been linked to various cancers, where it can function as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, depending on the cellular context (Li2021CBX7; Scott2007Role).

## Structure
The CBX7 protein is characterized by its chromodomain, which plays a crucial role in recognizing methylated histones, particularly the repressive histone mark H3K27me3. The chromodomain contains an aromatic cage formed by conserved residues such as Phe11, Trp32, and Trp35, which are essential for binding interactions with trimethyllysine residues (Ren2015SmallMolecule; Ren2016StructureGuided). The structure of CBX7 includes a hydrophobic clasp involving Val10 and Leu49, contributing to its binding interactions (Kaustov2011Recognition).

The secondary structure of CBX7 features β-sheets and possibly α-helices, inferred from hydrogen bonding and cation-π interactions (Simhadri2014Chromodomain). The tertiary structure is defined by the aromatic cage and hydrophobic clasp, which are critical for its function in gene regulation (Ren2015SmallMolecule; Simhadri2014Chromodomain). The quaternary structure involves dimerization, as seen in the binding of suramin, which acts as a 'glue' between two CBX7 chromodomain molecules (Ren2015SmallMolecule).

CBX7 is part of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. It may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which can influence its function and interactions (Ren2016StructureGuided).

## Function
CBX7 (chromobox 7) is a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), which plays a crucial role in maintaining the transcriptionally repressive state of genes in healthy human cells. It is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing by binding to histone H3 tails methylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a modification essential for the repression of target genes (Yap2010Molecular). CBX7 is active in the nucleus, where it influences cell proliferation, senescence, and differentiation by regulating the expression of key genes.

In healthy cells, CBX7 is involved in the repression of gene transcription by associating with facultative heterochromatin and the inactive X chromosome. It positively regulates CDH1 expression, crucial for maintaining normal epithelial cell morphology, by interacting with histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and inhibiting its activity on the CDH1 promoter (Forzati2012CBX7). CBX7 also negatively regulates the CCNE1 promoter activity, which is important for controlling cell proliferation (Forzati2012CBX7).

CBX7's interactions with methylated histone H3 lysine 27 and RNA are critical for its role in regulating cell growth and senescence, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Yap2010Molecular). Its expression is often reduced in certain cancers, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Federico2011Abstract).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CBX7 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it can function as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, depending on the context. In breast cancer, low CBX7 expression is associated with poor survival, lymph node metastasis, and P53 mutations. This reduced expression may be due to interactions with lncRNA NEAT1 and miR-181b, which target CBX7 mRNA, leading to its downregulation (Li2021CBX7). In colon cancer, CBX7 expression is typically reduced compared to normal tissues, and its absence correlates with poor prognosis. It is involved in inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by regulating E-cadherin expression (Li2021CBX7). 

In thyroid cancer, CBX7 expression is significantly down-regulated, correlating with a more aggressive phenotype. This down-regulation is observed across various thyroid carcinoma types, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for CBX7 in this context (Pallante2008Loss). In lung cancer, the loss of CBX7 expression is linked to increased cyclin E levels, facilitating malignant transformation (Forzati2012CBX7). Conversely, in lymphomas, particularly follicular lymphoma, CBX7 is highly expressed and may act as an oncogene, promoting lymphomagenesis through interactions with c-MYC and repression of the INK4a/ARF locus (Scott2007Role).

## Interactions
CBX7, a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), is involved in various protein interactions that influence gene expression and cancer progression. It interacts with histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), inhibiting its activity and positively regulating E-cadherin expression by increasing histone acetylation at the E-cadherin promoter. This interaction is significant in the context of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process critical in cancer metastasis (Federico2009Chromobox).

CBX7 also forms a complex with Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), which is crucial for regulating PRMT1 enzymatic activity and E-cadherin expression. This interaction is independent of other PRC1 components and suggests a role in modulating gene expression related to cancer progression (Federico2019The).

In addition to these interactions, CBX7 binds to the E-cadherin promoter, counteracting the inhibitory effects of HDAC2 and promoting transcriptional activity through histone modifications. It increases methylation of H3K4 and decreases methylation of H3K9 and H4K20, which are associated with gene activation and repression, respectively (Federico2009Chromobox; Federico2011Abstract).
