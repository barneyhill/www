# SH3BP2

## Overview
SH3BP2, or SH3 domain binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes a scaffold protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The SH3BP2 protein is characterized by its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, proline-rich (PR) region, and Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in signal transduction (Foucault2005The). As a scaffold protein, SH3BP2 is integral to the organization of neuromuscular synapses, particularly in clustering acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, which is essential for synaptic transmission and muscle function (Pradhan2024SH3BP2). Additionally, SH3BP2 is implicated in bone metabolism and immune cell signaling, interacting with proteins such as SYK, PLCγ, VAV, SRC, and ABL (Mukai2019Tankyrase). Mutations in the SH3BP2 gene are associated with cherubism, a genetic disorder affecting bone remodeling, highlighting its clinical significance (Levaot2011Loss).

## Structure
The SH3BP2 protein, also known as 3BP2, is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in signal transduction pathways. It contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a central proline-rich (PR) region, and a C-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain (Foucault2005The). The proline-rich region is subdivided into three domains (PR1, PR2, PR3), with the PR1 domain being crucial for interactions with Vav proteins and CIN85, while the PR3 domain interacts with HIP-55 (Foucault2005The; Le2007Abl‐SH3). The PR1 domain contains a PVPTPR motif essential for binding to the SH3 domains of CIN85 (Le2007Abl‐SH3).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in SH3BP2's function. Key phosphorylation sites include Tyr 174, Tyr 183, and Tyr 446, with Tyr 446 being critical for binding to the Lyn-SH2 domain (Maeno2003Adaptor). These modifications are mediated by kinases such as Syk and Fyn, influencing SH3BP2's interactions and signaling capabilities (Foucault2005The).

SH3BP2 is known to exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may result in variations in its signaling roles (Foucault2005The).

## Function
SH3BP2 (SH3 domain binding protein 2) is a scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in the organization of neuromuscular synapses through protein-driven phase separation. It is involved in clustering acetylcholine receptors (AChR) at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), which is essential for effective synaptic transmission and muscle function. SH3BP2 interacts with components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and AChR subunits, particularly α and γ, facilitating the organization of AChR in high density on muscle fibers (Pradhan2024SH3BP2).

The protein contains several domains, including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a proline-rich region, and a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, which mediate its interactions with other proteins. These interactions are crucial for its recruitment to the NMJ and its role in synaptic organization (Pradhan2024SH3BP2). SH3BP2's ability to self-interact and undergo phase separation is facilitated by its intrinsically disordered region, which is necessary for clustering AChR and maintaining NMJ integrity (Pradhan2024SH3BP2).

In the absence of SH3BP2, mice exhibit impaired NMJ organization, reduced muscle strength, and defects in neuromuscular transmission, highlighting its importance in maintaining muscle health and function (Pradhan2024SH3BP2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SH3BP2 gene are primarily associated with cherubism, a rare genetic disorder characterized by symmetrical, multilocular, radiolucent, expansile lesions in the jawbones, leading to facial deformities. These mutations, such as P416R and R415Q, result in a gain-of-function effect, causing the stabilization and accumulation of the 3BP2 protein. This leads to hyperactivation of signaling pathways involving SRC, SYK, and VAV, which are crucial for osteoclast function, resulting in excessive bone resorption and remodeling (Levaot2011Loss; Lietman2010SH3BP2).

The pathogenic mechanism involves the disruption of Tankyrase-mediated degradation of 3BP2, leading to its accumulation and enhanced osteoclastogenesis. This is due to the inability of cherubism mutants to bind to Tankyrase, preventing ADP-ribosylation and subsequent ubiquitylation of 3BP2 (Levaot2011Loss). The mutations also potentiate TNF-α-induced osteoclastogenesis via NFATc1, contributing to inflammatory bone loss (Mukai2014SH3BP2).

Cherubism can vary in severity, with some cases leading to systemic inflammation and bone loss beyond the jaw, as seen in severe cases with elevated TNF-α levels and myelomonocytic infiltration (Levaot2011Loss; Morice2020Cherubism).

## Interactions
SH3BP2 is a scaffold protein that participates in various protein-protein interactions, playing a significant role in signal transduction pathways. It contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a proline-rich domain, and a C-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins. SH3BP2 interacts with α-dystrobrevin-1 (αDB1) in a phospho-dependent manner, specifically binding to the phosphorylated Y713 site of αDB1. This interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of SH3BP2 and is crucial for its localization at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (Pradhan2024SH3BP2).

SH3BP2 also interacts with components of the dystroglycan complex (DGC) and acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunits α and γ, influencing AChR clustering at the NMJ. Each domain of SH3BP2 interacts with different parts of the AChRα cytoplasmic loop, indicating multiple binding sites (Pradhan2024SH3BP2). The protein can self-aggregate and undergo liquid-liquid phase separation, forming dynamic protein droplets that recruit AChRα, highlighting its role in synapse organization (Pradhan2024SH3BP2).

In addition to its role in neuromuscular synapses, SH3BP2 interacts with proteins involved in bone metabolism and immune cell signaling, such as SYK, PLCγ, VAV, SRC, and ABL, acting as a scaffold to transduce intracellular signaling pathways (Mukai2019Tankyrase).
