# OR9K2

## Overview
OR9K2 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 9 subfamily K member 2, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR9K2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and has been identified in other tissues, such as the brain, where it may have additional signaling roles. The protein's expression in non-olfactory tissues suggests broader biological functions beyond olfaction, potentially contributing to various physiological and pathological processes, including multiple sclerosis, cancer progression, and sensory processing disorders (Ambekar2013Proteomic; Guruceaga2017Enhanced; Ibragimova2022Whole; enz2020chronic).

## Function
OR9K2 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein belonging to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is primarily involved in detecting odor molecules. These receptors are integral to the olfactory system, where they initiate signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR9K2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, contributing to the diversity of odor detection and olfactory signaling (Ambekar2013Proteomic).

In addition to its role in the olfactory system, OR9K2 has been identified in other tissues, such as the brain. In the context of multiple sclerosis, OR9K2 is expressed in neurons and blood vessels within the cerebral cortex. It is upregulated in blood vessels in both demyelinated and normally myelinated areas, suggesting potential local or systemic signaling roles (enz2020chronic). The presence of proteins involved in transporting olfactory receptors to the cell surface supports the hypothesis of functional expression of ORs in the human cortex, although the specific function of OR9K2 in healthy cells remains unclear (enz2020chronic). The expression of OR9K2 in non-olfactory tissues indicates that it may have broader biological roles beyond olfaction.

## Clinical Significance
The OR9K2 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, has been implicated in several clinical contexts. In breast cancer, OR9K2 is among the differentially expressed genes identified during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. It is notably upregulated in patients with hematogenous metastasis compared to those without, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression and metastasis (Ibragimova2022Whole). This upregulation indicates that OR9K2 could be part of a gene panel used to predict the likelihood of metastasis in breast cancer patients.

In the context of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), OR9K2 is part of the olfactory transduction pathway, which was found to be significantly overrepresented in patients with varying disease durations. Although the specific role of OR9K2 in RA is not detailed, its inclusion in this pathway suggests it may have a functional impact on the disease (Li2017Identification).

Additionally, the OR9K2 gene has been associated with neurological conditions such as autism and schizophrenia, as part of a broader analysis of olfactory receptors. This association highlights the potential for OR9K2 to be involved in sensory processing disorders beyond its primary olfactory function (Guruceaga2017Enhanced).

## Interactions
The human gene OR9K2, an olfactory receptor, is involved in several interactions within the olfactory receptor pathways. OR9K2 expression is positively correlated with the olfactory binding protein OBP2A and the olfactory receptor pathway components RTP2 and UGT1A6, suggesting potential interactions with these proteins (enz2020chronic). Specifically, the correlation coefficients for RTP2 and UGT1A6 are 0.78 and 0.85, respectively, both with significant p-values less than 0.001, indicating a strong association (enz2020chronic).

Conversely, OR9K2 expression shows a negative correlation with REEP1 and RTP1, which may imply inhibitory interactions or a lack of direct interaction with these proteins (enz2020chronic). The presence of proteins involved in olfactory receptor signaling pathways, such as RTP1, RTP2, REEP1, ADCY3, and GNAL, supports the hypothesis of functional OR expression in the human cortex, although the specific role of OR9K2 in these pathways remains to be fully elucidated (enz2020chronic). These interactions suggest that OR9K2 may play a role in olfactory signaling and potentially in broader physiological processes related to multiple sclerosis pathology.
