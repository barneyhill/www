# AKTIP

## Overview
AKTIP (AKT interacting protein) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis and telomere maintenance. The AKTIP protein is categorized as a ubiquitin E2 variant enzyme, characterized by its ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain and ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) domain, which facilitate interactions with components of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery (Merigliano2021AKTIP; Burla2015AKTIP/Ft1). These interactions are crucial for the abscission phase of cell division and maintaining genome stability. AKTIP is also associated with the nuclear lamina, where it plays a role in telomere integrity and nuclear envelope processes (La2022Combined). Clinically, alterations in AKTIP are linked to conditions such as cancer and cellular senescence, highlighting its significance in cell survival and proliferation pathways (Khalil2021Interaction; Burla2016The).

## Structure
The AKTIP protein is characterized by a ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, a core feature of E2 proteins, consisting of approximately 150 amino acids and composed of a four-stranded, anti-parallel curled β-sheet (Burla2015AKTIP/Ft1). It also contains a ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) domain located in its central region, spanning amino acids 78-220, which is crucial for its interaction with the N-terminus of VPS28, a component of the ESCRT I complex (Merigliano2021AKTIP). The UEV domain is characterized by two C-terminal helices (H5 and H6) that are not present in the TSG101 protein, another ESCRT I component (Merigliano2021AKTIP).

Structurally, AKTIP has α-helices present on three sides of the UEV domain, unlike its Drosophila orthologue Peo, which has α-helical segments on four sides (Burla2015AKTIP/Ft1). A notable structural feature is the presence of an additional N-terminal disordered region in AKTIP, which is absent in Peo (Burla2015AKTIP/Ft1). The protein is divided into three regions: the N-terminal disordered region (amino acids 1-70), the central UEV portion (amino acids 70-189), and the C-terminus consisting of two alpha-helices and a distal disordered portion (amino acids 190-292) (Burla2016The). AKTIP does not have the conserved cysteine residue necessary for E2 catalytic activity, indicating it belongs to the ubiquitin E2 variant enzyme subfamily (Burla2016The).

## Function
AKTIP (AKT interacting protein) plays a crucial role in cytokinesis, the final step of cell division, by interacting with the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery. During mitosis, AKTIP is recruited to the midbody, a structure that connects two daughter cells, where it forms a circular structure in proximity to ESCRT I components like TSG101 and VPS28. This interaction is essential for recruiting ESCRT III subunits, such as CHMP4B and IST1, which are necessary for the abscission step that cleaves the intercellular bridge between daughter cells (Merigliano2021AKTIP).

AKTIP's recruitment to the midbody is dependent on the centralspindlin subunit MKLP1 but is independent of other proteins like CEP55, TSG101, and ALIX (Merigliano2021AKTIP). Beyond its role in cytokinesis, AKTIP is enriched at the nuclear lamina during interphase, where it is involved in maintaining telomere integrity and genome stability. Its depletion can lead to telomeric defects, DNA damage, and increased cancer aggressiveness (La2022Combined; Merigliano2021AKTIP). AKTIP's association with the nuclear lamina and its interaction with lamin A suggest a role in nuclear envelope processes (La2022Combined).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the AKTIP gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions, particularly those related to cellular senescence and cancer. AKTIP interacts with lamin proteins, and its mislocalization is observed in cells with mutations in the LMNA gene, such as those from patients with Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) and Mandibuloacral Dysplasia type A (MADA). In these conditions, AKTIP shows reduced cytoplasmic presence and weaker nuclear rim staining, which is associated with increased cellular senescence and nuclear distortion (Burla2016The).

In cancer, AKTIP is linked to the regulation of cell survival and telomere integrity. Its mislocalization is associated with alterations in lamin expression and nuclear morphology in tumor cells, suggesting a role in cancer progression (La2022Combined). Specifically, in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), AKTIP is involved in the activation of AKT, a key player in cell proliferation and survival. The interaction between TLK1 and AKTIP enhances AKT phosphorylation, which is crucial for prostate cancer cell growth (Khalil2021Interaction).

AKTIP depletion also leads to telomere dysfunction and DNA replication defects, contributing to genomic instability, which is a hallmark of cancer and age-related diseases (Burla2015AKTIP/Ft1).

## Interactions
AKTIP interacts with components of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery, particularly the ESCRT I subunit VPS28. This interaction is mediated through the ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) domain of AKTIP and the N-terminal domain of VPS28, as confirmed by pull-down assays and yeast two-hybrid screens (Merigliano2021AKTIP). AKTIP also forms complexes with TSG101, another ESCRT I subunit, and VPS28, suggesting the possibility of a complex involving AKTIP, VPS28, and TSG101, or independent complexes of AKTIP/VPS28 and TSG101/VPS28 (Merigliano2021AKTIP).

AKTIP is crucial for the recruitment of ESCRT III subunits, such as CHMP4B and IST1, to the midbody during cytokinesis. It cooperates with TSG101 in this recruitment process, although they do not compete for binding to VPS28 and are recruited independently to the midbody (Merigliano2021AKTIP). AKTIP does not interact with other ESCRT I subunits like VPS37A to D or ESCRT II subunits, nor does it interact with SEPT9, a protein known to interact with TSG101 (Merigliano2021AKTIP).

In addition to its role in cytokinesis, AKTIP is enriched at the nuclear rim and interacts with nuclear lamins, particularly lamin A/C. Its localization is influenced by lamin A levels, and it co-localizes more with lamin A/C than with lamin B1 (La2022Combined).
