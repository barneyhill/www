# KAT7

## Overview
KAT7, or lysine acetyltransferase 7, is a gene that encodes a member of the MYST family of acetyltransferases, which are enzymes involved in the acetylation of histones, a key process in the regulation of gene expression. The protein product of KAT7, also referred to as lysine acetyltransferase 7, plays a pivotal role in modifying chromatin structure by acetylating histone H3 at lysine 14 (H3K14ac), thereby facilitating transcriptional activation (Kueh2020HBO1). This acetyltransferase is particularly significant in endothelial cell function, influencing processes such as cell migration, adhesion, and response to growth factors, which are essential for vascular development and integrity (Yan2018Histone). KAT7 is also implicated in various cancers, where it contributes to tumor progression and resistance to therapy, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Wang2023Histone; Au2020KAT7).

## Function
KAT7, also known as lysine acetyltransferase 7, is a crucial enzyme involved in histone acetylation, specifically targeting histone H3 at lysine 14 (H3K14ac). This acetylation is essential for regulating gene expression by modifying chromatin structure, thereby facilitating transcriptional activation (Kueh2020HBO1). KAT7 is active in the nucleus and plays a significant role in endothelial cell (EC) gene regulation, particularly influencing the expression of genes like VEGFR-2, which are vital for vascular development and function (Yan2018Histone).

In endothelial cells, KAT7-dependent histone acetylation is crucial for maintaining normal cell functions, including cell migration and signal transduction in response to growth factors such as VEGF-A (Yan2018Histone). The enzyme's activity is also linked to the regulation of cell adhesion and morphology, impacting cellular differentiation and proliferation (Kueh2020HBO1). KAT7's role extends to broader biological processes, including cell cycle regulation and DNA replication, although it is not essential for these processes in all cell types (Kueh2020HBO1; Yan2018Histone). Overall, KAT7 is integral to maintaining endothelial cell physiology and vascular integrity (Yan2018Histone).

## Clinical Significance
KAT7, also known as lysine acetyltransferase 7, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in histone acetylation and gene expression regulation. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly those driven by MLL rearrangements, KAT7 is identified as a genetic vulnerability. Its loss in AML cell lines leads to decreased proliferation, increased differentiation, and apoptosis, highlighting its essential role in leukemic cell survival and proliferation (Au2020KAT7). KAT7 is crucial for maintaining the transcriptional program driven by MLL-AF9, and its knockout results in the down-regulation of key target genes necessary for leukemia maintenance (Au2020KAT7).

In B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), KAT7, also known as HBO1, is overexpressed and associated with poor disease-free survival. It activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting leukemogenesis. Knockdown of KAT7 in B-ALL cells reduces tumor growth and increases apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2023Histone).

In breast cancer, KAT7 is implicated in promoting radioresistance by upregulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Its expression is higher in breast tumor tissues and negatively correlates with patient survival, indicating its role in cancer progression and resistance to therapy (Ma2023KAT7).

## Interactions
KAT7, also known as lysine acetyltransferase 7, is a member of the MYST family of acetyltransferases and is involved in various protein-protein interactions. It forms multisubunit complexes that include JADE1/2/3, ING4/5, hEAF6, and Brpf1/2/3, which are crucial for its function in histone acetylation and transcriptional regulation (Yan2018Histone). KAT7 is part of a complex with the HBO1 acetyltransferase, Ing4/5, Eaf6, and either Brpf1/2/3 or Jade1/2/3, primarily acetylating histones H4 at positions 5, 8, and 12 (Sbardella2019Histone). 

KAT7 interacts with subunits of the origin of replication complex, playing a role in DNA replication (Sbardella2019Histone). It is also recruited by transcription factors such as NF-B and the androgen receptor to regulate transcription, suggesting interactions with these proteins (Yan2018Histone). The activity and specificity of KAT7 are highly determined by the composition of its protein complexes, and recombinant KAT7 shows no significant acetyltransferase activity, indicating that protein-protein interactions and in vivo modifications are crucial for its function (Sbardella2019Histone).
