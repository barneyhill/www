# PLEKHA8

## Overview
PLEKHA8 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology domain containing A8, also known as FAPP2, which is a member of the glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP) superfamily. This protein is characterized by its unique structural domains, including an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a GLTP-homology (GLTPH) domain, which facilitate its role in intracellular lipid transfer and glycolipid biosynthesis. FAPP2 is primarily involved in the transport of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) within the Golgi apparatus, contributing to the synthesis of complex glycosphingolipids. The PH domain's interaction with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI-4P) is crucial for its localization and function in vesicular trafficking. While the clinical significance of PLEKHA8 is not fully established, it has been implicated in cancer research and metabolic processes, suggesting potential roles in tumorigenesis and metabolic disorders (Lu2022A; Shinohara2020Inherited; Mishra2020Emerging).

## Structure
The PLEKHA8 gene encodes the FAPP2 protein, which is a member of the glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP) superfamily. FAPP2 is characterized by a unique structural organization that includes an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a GLTP-homology (GLTPH) domain. This configuration allows FAPP2 to specifically bind and transfer glucosylceramide (GlcCer) rather than ceramide, distinguishing it from other proteins like CERT, which utilize a START domain (D’Angelo2012Connecting; Mishra2020Emerging).

The PH domain of FAPP2 interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI-4P), which is crucial for its localization within the Golgi apparatus. This interaction regulates the protein's function in vesicular anterograde trafficking and glycolipid biosynthesis (Mishra2020Emerging). The GLTPH domain is highly conserved and exhibits selectivity for uncharged monoglycosylated ceramides like GlcCer and GalCer (Mishra2020Emerging).

The full-length FAPP2 protein is 519 amino acids long, and its glycolipid transfer activity was confirmed after cloning the complete protein, which includes 12 residues that were missing in earlier clones due to a cloning artifact (Mishra2020Emerging). The evolutionary appearance of FAPP2 coincides with increased complexity in the glycolipid system, suggesting its role in controlling this complexity (D’Angelo2012Connecting).

## Function
PLEKHA8, also known as FAPP2, is a protein involved in the intracellular transfer of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) within the Golgi apparatus, playing a crucial role in glycolipid biosynthesis. It facilitates the transport of GlcCer to the trans-Golgi, which is essential for the synthesis of complex glycosphingolipids like globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). This function is mediated by its N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which binds phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI-4P), and its C-terminal GLTP-homology (GLTPH) domain, which binds GlcCer (Mishra2020Emerging).

In healthy human cells, PLEKHA8 is active in the cytoplasm and associated with cellular processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis, contributing to cellular homeostasis and communication. It is involved in membrane trafficking and lipid transfer, particularly in the context of vesicle maturation and cytoplasmic lipid transfer (Lu2022A; Hollingsworth2024Spatiotemporal). Knockout studies in mice have shown that PLEKHA8 is crucial for maintaining normal glycolipid levels, as its absence leads to decreased levels of Gb3 and upstream glycolipids in tissues where it is highly expressed (Mishra2020Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the PLEKHA8 gene, also known as pleckstrin homology domain containing A8, is not fully established, but it has been implicated in several disease processes. In leukemia cells, genetic variants associated with PLEKHA8 have shown a strong correlation with NR3C1 gene expression, although there is weak evidence linking these variants to glucocorticoid sensitivity, such as prednisolone sensitivity in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) (Shinohara2020Inherited). Despite this association, PLEKHA8 expression levels have not been linked to disease relapse in childhood BCP-ALL, suggesting its clinical significance in this context remains unclear (Shinohara2020Inherited).

In cancer research, PLEKHA8 overexpression has been shown to promote human colon cancer cell growth through active Wnt signaling, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis (Lu2022A). The gene is also involved in glycolipid metabolism, which could have implications for metabolic disorders, although specific diseases related to PLEKHA8 mutations have not been directly addressed (Mishra2020Emerging). In colorectal cancer, PLEKHA8 is associated with intracellular trafficking, but it is not directly linked to colorectal cancer according to pathway analysis (Eldai2013Novel). Further research is needed to clarify the clinical implications of PLEKHA8 mutations and expression alterations.
