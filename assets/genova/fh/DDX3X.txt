# DDX3X

## Overview
DDX3X is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the DEAD-box helicase 3 X-linked protein, a member of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases. This protein is characterized by its conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif, which is essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis, facilitating its role in RNA metabolism (Toyama2024NMR). The DDX3X protein is involved in various cellular processes, including transcription, mRNA splicing, export, and translation initiation, and plays a significant role in the innate immune response and stress granule formation (Mo2021DDX3X:; Park2022The). It is predominantly cytoplasmic but shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating its involvement in both nuclear and cytoplasmic functions (Lee2008Human). Mutations in the DDX3X gene are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, intellectual disabilities, and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cell growth (Lennox2018PathogenicDDX3Xmutations; Radford2022Saturation).

## Structure
The DDX3X protein is a member of the DEAD-box helicase family, characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Toyama2024NMR). The primary structure of DDX3X includes a helicase core composed of two RecA-like domains, D1 and D2, which are crucial for its helicase activity and ATP binding (Toyama2024NMR; Högbom2007Crystal). These domains are flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal tails, which are largely unstructured but contain motifs responsible for the unique functions of the DDX3X subfamily (Ji2020RNA).

The secondary structure of DDX3X features a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices, forming RecA-like folds in both domains (Högbom2007Crystal). A unique insertion between motifs I and Ia in domain 1 forms a helical element that extends a positively charged sequence, enhancing the RNA-binding surface (Högbom2007Crystal).

In terms of tertiary structure, DDX3X adopts a less compact and more open conformation compared to other RNA-bound DEAD-box helicases, with flexibility in the P-loop and disordered regions between domains (Högbom2007Crystal). The quaternary structure involves cooperative interactions between two DDX3X molecules, which are significant for RNA duplex recognition and unwinding (Ji2020RNA).

DDX3X is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions (Toyama2024NMR). The protein also has several splice variant isoforms, potentially affecting its function and localization (Toyama2024NMR).

## Function
The DDX3X gene encodes a DEAD-box RNA helicase that plays a crucial role in various aspects of RNA metabolism in healthy human cells. It is involved in transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA export, and translation initiation (Schröder2010Human; Park2022The). DDX3X facilitates translation by interacting with translation initiation factors such as eIF3, eIF4E, and eIF4F, promoting both cap-dependent and cap-independent translation mechanisms (Zhang2024DDX3X; Lee2008Human). It is particularly important for the translation of mRNAs with long or structured 5' untranslated regions, such as cyclin E1, which is essential for cell cycle progression (Lai2010DDX3).

DDX3X is predominantly located in the cytoplasm, where it promotes translation, but it also shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting roles in both cytoplasmic and nuclear processes (Schröder2010Human; Lee2008Human). It is involved in the formation of stress granules under stress conditions and plays a role in the innate immune response by activating the IFN-β promoter (Mo2021DDX3X:). DDX3X's multifunctionality is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cell growth (Mo2021DDX3X:; Lai2010DDX3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DDX3X gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders and conditions. De novo germline mutations in DDX3X account for 1-3% of unexplained intellectual disability (ID) cases in females and are linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), brain malformations, and epilepsy (Lennox2018PathogenicDDX3Xmutations; Wang2018Phenotypic). DDX3X syndrome, characterized by diverse neurological phenotypes such as microcephaly, corpus callosum hypoplasia, and ventricular enlargement, is also associated with these mutations (Lennox2018PathogenicDDX3Xmutations). In males, protein-truncating variants are presumed lethal, but some missense variants may cause neurodevelopmental disorders, although they are less frequent (Radford2022Saturation).

DDX3X mutations are linked to structural brain changes, including abnormalities of the corpus callosum and cortical dysplasias (Tang2021Prospective). The gene is also implicated in various cancers, acting as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, with mutations observed in cancers such as medulloblastoma and lymphoma (Lennox2018PathogenicDDX3Xmutations; Radford2022Saturation). The phenotypic spectrum of DDX3X-related disorders includes respiratory problems and congenital heart disease (Wang2018Phenotypic). The gene's role in RNA metabolism and neurogenesis is crucial, with mutations leading to conditions like polymicrogyria and microcephaly (Lennox2018PathogenicDDX3Xmutations).

## Interactions
DDX3X, a member of the DEAD-box helicase family, is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions that are crucial for its function in RNA metabolism. DDX3X interacts with RNA through its D1D2 core, which is essential for substrate recognition and unwinding of RNA duplexes. This interaction involves significant conformational changes driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis, facilitating the transition from a pre-unwound to a post-unwound state (Ji2020RNA).

DDX3X also forms part of the eIF4F complex, interacting with eIF4G and Poly A-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABP), which allows it to bind directly to the 5' end of target mRNAs. This interaction is crucial for the translation initiation of mRNAs with complex secondary structures (Soto-Rifo2012DEAD-box). DDX3X's interaction with eIF4G is direct and occurs through the middle domain of eIF4G, independent of PABP (Soto-Rifo2012DEAD-box).

In stress conditions, DDX3X interacts with eIF4E and PABP1, facilitating stress granule assembly. These interactions are protein-protein based and are crucial for DDX3X's role in stress response and SG dynamics (Shih2011Critical). DDX3X acts as a scaffold in SGs, forming multimeric complexes and potentially affecting viral mRNA metabolism (Shih2011Critical).
