# MC1R

## Overview
The MC1R gene encodes the melanocortin 1 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of pigmentation in humans. This receptor is primarily expressed in melanocytes, where it influences the production and type of melanin, thereby affecting skin and hair color. The melanocortin 1 receptor is activated by melanocyte-stimulating hormones, which trigger intracellular signaling pathways that lead to increased melanin synthesis. The receptor's activity is crucial for determining the balance between eumelanin and pheomelanin, impacting photoprotection and susceptibility to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Beyond pigmentation, MC1R is involved in cellular stress responses, including DNA repair and antioxidant defenses, highlighting its broader biological significance (Herraiz2017MC1R; Sturm2002Skin). Variants of the MC1R gene are associated with phenotypic traits such as red hair and fair skin, as well as an increased risk of skin cancers, underscoring its clinical importance (Box2001Melanocortin1; Bastiaens2001Melanocortin1).

## Structure
The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a common feature of GPCRs (Yang2011Structure). The primary structure of MC1R consists of 317 amino acids in humans, with an extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminal extension (García‐Borrón2005Melanocortin‐1). The secondary structure includes these transmembrane helices, which are integral to its function (Prusis1997Modeling).

The tertiary structure of MC1R involves the folding of these helices into a functional receptor, with specific motifs such as the DRY motif at the junction of the third transmembrane domain, which is crucial for receptor function (Wolf2016Melanocortin). The receptor's quaternary structure can involve dimerization, which affects its properties and function (García‐Borrón2005Melanocortin‐1).

Post-translational modifications include N-linked glycosylation at the extracellular N-terminus and palmitoylation at the intracellular C-terminus, which are important for receptor function and membrane localization (Wolf2016Melanocortin; Yang2011Structure). An alternative splice form of MC1R adds 65 amino acids to the C-terminal tail, though it does not significantly affect signaling (García‐Borrón2005Melanocortin‐1).

## Function
The MC1R gene encodes the melanocortin 1 receptor, a crucial protein in the regulation of skin and hair pigmentation. It is primarily expressed in melanocytes, where it plays a significant role in determining skin and hair color by influencing the production of melanin. The receptor is activated by the binding of melanocyte-stimulating hormones, which leads to a cascade of intracellular signaling events. These events include the activation of adenylate cyclase, which increases the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and subsequently activates protein kinase A (PKA). This signaling pathway results in the upregulation of enzymes involved in melanin production, leading to increased melanin synthesis and pigmentation (Herraiz2017MC1R; Sturm2002Skin).

MC1R is also involved in the regulation of skin and hair color by influencing the type of melanin produced. It determines the balance between eumelanin, which is dark and provides photoprotection, and pheomelanin, which is lighter and less protective. The receptor's activity is crucial for the pigmentation process, affecting skin and hair color and influencing susceptibility to UV radiation (Herraiz2017MC1R; Sturm2002Skin). Additionally, MC1R plays a role in cellular stress responses, contributing to DNA repair and antioxidant defenses (Herraiz2017MC1R).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MC1R gene are associated with several skin-related conditions, primarily influencing pigmentation and increasing the risk of skin cancers. Variants of the MC1R gene, such as Asp84Glu, Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, and Asp294His, are linked to an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancers, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Box2001Melanocortin1; Bastiaens2001Melanocortin1). These variants are also associated with phenotypic traits like red hair, fair skin, and increased sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light, which are known risk factors for skin cancer (Box2001Melanocortin1).

MC1R variants are also implicated in melanoma risk, independent of skin type and hair color. Specific variants such as Asp84Glu, Arg142His, Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, and Asp294His have been identified as significant risk factors for melanoma (Matichard2004Melanocortin; Kennedy2001Melanocortin). These genetic alterations can lead to impaired receptor function, affecting melanin production and potentially contributing to carcinogenesis by increasing pheomelanin levels, which may generate free radicals after UV exposure (Kennedy2001Melanocortin).

The MC1R gene's role extends beyond pigmentation, as its variants may influence DNA repair pathways and genomic stability, further contributing to skin cancer susceptibility (Manganelli2021Behind).

## Interactions
The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is a G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with various intracellular partners, influencing multiple signaling pathways. MC1R interacts with neurofibromin (Nf1), a GTPase-activating protein, through its GTPase-activating protein-related domain (GRD). This interaction is crucial for regulating the Ras-MAPK pathway and cAMP cascade, which are important for melanogenesis and pigmentation (Deraredj2021The).

MC1R also interacts with β-arrestins, particularly β-arrestin 2 (ARRB2), which mediates receptor desensitization and internalization. This interaction is modulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mahogunin Ring Finger-1 (MGRN1), which facilitates ARRB ubiquitination, affecting MC1R signaling (Abrisqueta2018Human).

The receptor is involved in cAMP-dependent and independent pathways, interacting with proteins such as PTEN and KSR1, which influence the ERK signaling pathway. MC1R's interaction with PTEN helps stabilize it, thereby downregulating AKT signaling (Herraiz2017MC1R).

MC1R also forms complexes with G proteins, as revealed by cryo-EM structures showing interactions with peptide hormones and the Gβ subunit, which are important for G protein coupling (Ma2021Structural). These interactions highlight MC1R's role in regulating pigmentation and its potential implications in skin cancer susceptibility.
