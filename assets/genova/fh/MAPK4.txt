# MAPK4

## Overview
MAPK4, or mitogen-activated protein kinase 4, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the atypical MAP kinase family. Unlike conventional MAP kinases, MAPK4 features a unique SEG motif in its activation loop, distinguishing it from the typical TxY motif found in other family members (Coulombe2007Atypical). The protein product of MAPK4 is involved in the noncanonical activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is pivotal for regulating cell survival, growth, and metabolism (Wang2019MAPK4). MAPK4's ability to phosphorylate AKT at threonine 308 independently of the PI3K/PDK1 pathway underscores its unique role in cellular signaling (Wang2019MAPK4). This kinase is implicated in various cancers, where it contributes to tumor progression and therapy resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Wang2022MAPK4; Shen2021MAPK4).

## Structure
MAPK4, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase 4, is a serine/threonine kinase with a distinct molecular structure. The primary structure of MAPK4 includes a unique N-terminal kinase domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity and interaction with other proteins, such as AKT1 (Wang2019MAPK4). This kinase domain spans amino acids 20 to 312 and contains a unique SEG motif in the activation loop, replacing the conventional TxY motif found in other MAP kinases (Coulombe2007Atypical). 

The secondary structure of MAPK4 includes a conserved C34 region shared with MAPK6/Erk3 and a C-terminal tail (Wang2019MAPK4). The tertiary structure of MAPK4 has not been fully elucidated, but it is known to contain specific motifs and residues crucial for its function, such as the EEDKDE motif, which is important for binding to AKT1 (Wang2019MAPK4). 

MAPK4 is part of the atypical MAP kinase family, characterized by a single phospho-acceptor site in the activation loop and a unique sequence in subdomain VIII of the kinase domain (Coulombe2007Atypical). These features contribute to its distinct regulatory mechanisms and substrate specificity.

## Function
MAPK4, or mitogen-activated protein kinase 4, plays a significant role in the noncanonical activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival, growth, and metabolism. MAPK4 directly phosphorylates AKT at threonine 308, a critical site for AKT activation, independently of the traditional PI3K/PDK1 pathway (Wang2019MAPK4). This phosphorylation event promotes AKT activation, influencing various cellular processes such as metabolism, proliferation, and survival (Wang2019MAPK4). MAPK4 also interacts with mTORC2, facilitating the phosphorylation of AKT at serine 473, further enhancing AKT activity (Wang2019MAPK4).

MAPK4 is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with AKT1, as demonstrated by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays (Wang2019MAPK4). The protein's activity is not significantly affected by the presence of the PI3K pathway inhibitor PTEN, indicating its ability to activate AKT through a PI3K-independent mechanism (Wang2019MAPK4). This suggests that MAPK4 may play a role in cellular contexts where PI3K/PDK1 signaling is compromised or inhibited, maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to growth signals (Wang2019MAPK4).

## Clinical Significance
MAPK4 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in promoting cell proliferation and survival through the AKT signaling pathway. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), MAPK4 is highly expressed and acts as an oncogene, contributing to tumor growth and resistance to therapies such as PI3K inhibitors. Knockdown of MAPK4 in TNBC cells reduces AKT activation and tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2022MAPK4; Zeng2021MAPK4). MAPK4 overexpression in TNBC is associated with poor prognosis and increased cell proliferation, while its silencing enhances the efficacy of PARP1 inhibitors like olaparib, indicating a strategy to overcome drug resistance (Zeng2021MAPK4).

In prostate cancer, particularly castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), MAPK4 promotes tumor progression by activating both the androgen receptor and AKT signaling pathways. This dual activation is crucial for cancer cell growth and resistance to castration therapy. Knockdown of MAPK4 significantly inhibits tumor growth in xenograft models, highlighting its role in therapy resistance and its potential as a therapeutic target (Shen2021MAPK4).

MAPK4 also influences the tumor microenvironment in gastric cancer by modulating tumor-associated macrophages, which can enhance cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Li2023MAPK4).

## Interactions
MAPK4 interacts with AKT1, playing a significant role in tumor progression through the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. It directly binds to AKT1, facilitating its phosphorylation and activation. This interaction is crucial for MAPK4's ability to promote tumor growth, as demonstrated by the loss of growth-promoting activity in MAPK4-high HCT116 cells when the AKT1 K386A mutant is overexpressed (Wang2019MAPK4). MAPK4 can phosphorylate AKT1 at the T308 site, identifying it as a novel AKT T308 kinase. This phosphorylation is independent of the PI3K/PDK1 pathway, highlighting a noncanonical mechanism of AKT activation (Wang2019MAPK4).

MAPK4 also interacts with mTORC2, which mediates AKT phosphorylation at the S473 site, further enhancing AKT signaling (Wang2019MAPK4). In prostate cancer, MAPK4 enhances the expression and activation of GATA2, a transcription factor essential for androgen receptor (AR) signaling. This interaction stabilizes GATA2 by inhibiting its proteasome-mediated degradation, thereby promoting prostate cancer growth and castration resistance (Shen2021MAPK4). In triple-negative breast cancer, MAPK4's interaction with the AKT pathway reduces tumor sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors, underscoring its role in modulating cancer cell growth and treatment response (Wang2022MAPK4).
