# ZNF462

## Overview
ZNF462 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 462, a C2H2-type zinc finger protein involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization. This protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and is highly conserved across vertebrate species, underscoring its essential role in cellular processes (Cosemans2018ZNF462; Zhao2022A). Zinc finger protein 462 is implicated in the regulation of gene expression by modulating chromatin structure, particularly through the formation of heterochromatin, and plays a significant role in early embryonic development and neuronal differentiation (Yelagandula2021ZFP462; Zhou2022Case). Mutations in ZNF462 are associated with Weiss-Kruszka syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by developmental delays and craniofacial abnormalities, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (GonzálezTarancón2020A; Zhao2022A).

## Function
ZNF462 is a gene that encodes a C2H2-type zinc finger protein, which is involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization. This protein is localized in the nucleus and is highly conserved across vertebrates, indicating its essential role in cellular processes (Cosemans2018ZNF462; Zhao2022A). ZNF462 is implicated in the regulation of gene expression by modulating chromatin structure and accessibility, particularly through the formation of heterochromatin. It targets transposon-derived enhancers, restricting transcription factor binding and the expression of lineage-specifying genes, which is crucial for maintaining proper gene expression during development and differentiation (Yelagandula2021ZFP462).

In healthy human cells, ZNF462 is thought to play a significant role in early embryonic development and neuronal differentiation. It interacts with proteins such as ASXL2 and VPS13B, potentially forming a complex important for normal development (Zhou2022Case). Although the precise molecular functions of ZNF462 in healthy cells are not fully understood, its involvement in transcriptional regulation and chromosomal remodeling suggests it is critical for normal cellular function and organismal development (Zhao2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF462 gene are associated with Weiss-Kruszka syndrome (WSKA), a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delays, craniofacial abnormalities, and other congenital anomalies. Common features of WSKA include ptosis, downslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, arched eyebrows, and a short upturned nose. Additional symptoms may include hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and corpus callosum abnormalities (GonzálezTarancón2020A; Zhao2022A). The syndrome is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with most cases resulting from de novo mutations in ZNF462 (GonzálezTarancón2020A).

ZNF462 haploinsufficiency is linked to craniofacial anomalies, corpus callosum dysgenesis, and developmental delay, with variable expressivity among affected individuals (Weiss2017Haploinsufficiency). Disruptions in ZNF462, such as deletions and translocations, have been associated with syndromic intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with clinical features including metopic craniosynostosis, ptosis, and corpus callosum dysgenesis (Cosemans2018ZNF462). The gene's disruption is believed to be primarily responsible for these phenotypes, although contributions from other genes cannot be entirely ruled out (Cosemans2018ZNF462).

## Interactions
ZNF462 is known to interact with several proteins, forming complexes that play crucial roles in gene regulation and development. It interacts with ASXL2 and VPS13B, proteins involved in epigenetic regulation and developmental syndromes, respectively. ASXL2 is linked to Shashi-Pena syndrome, while VPS13B mutations are associated with Cohen's syndrome, both of which share symptoms with conditions linked to ZNF462 mutations, suggesting a potential complex important for normal development (Zhou2022Case).

In birds, ZNF462 has been identified as a tissue-specific interactor with the H3K9me3 histone mark, indicating its role in chromatin modification and gene silencing. This interaction is conserved across species, highlighting its evolutionary significance (Bluhm2016Reader).

The murine homolog of ZNF462, ZFP462, interacts with the G9A/GLP histone methyltransferase complex, targeting heterochromatin to transposon-derived enhancers. This interaction restricts transcription factor binding, crucial for maintaining cell identity and proper neurodevelopment. ZFP462 also associates with proteins like HP1 and WIZ, further implicating it in chromatin dynamics and gene silencing (Yelagandula2021ZFP462). These interactions suggest that ZNF462 plays a significant role in regulating gene expression through chromatin modification.
