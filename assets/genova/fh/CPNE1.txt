# CPNE1

## Overview
CPNE1 is a gene located on human chromosome 20q11.21 that encodes the protein copine 1, a member of the copines family. Copine 1 is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein characterized by its two C2 domains and a von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain, which facilitate its role in cellular processes such as signal transduction and membrane trafficking (Su2022CPNE1; Su2021Exploring). The protein is involved in various intracellular signaling pathways, including the AKT-mTOR pathway, and plays a significant role in neural development and differentiation (Kim2018Copine1). Additionally, copine 1 interacts with several proteins, such as 14-3-3γ and JAB1, influencing neuronal differentiation and other cellular functions (Cheal20171433γ; Yoo2018JAB1). Alterations in CPNE1 expression have been implicated in the progression of various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Su2022CPNE1; Wang2022CPNE1).

## Structure
CPNE1, or copine 1, is a protein encoded by the CPNE1 gene located on human chromosome 20q11.21. The protein consists of 537 amino acids and is a member of the copines family, characterized by its calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding properties (Su2022CPNE1; Su2021Exploring). Structurally, CPNE1 features two C2 domains at the N-terminus and a von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain at the C-terminus. The C2 domains are known for their calcium-binding capabilities and are involved in phospholipid binding, which may play a role in signal transduction and cell membrane transport (Choi2020CPNE1mediated; Su2021Exploring). The VWA domain is implicated in mediating interactions among extracellular proteins and may be involved in recruiting target proteins and regulating specific protein activities (Su2022CPNE1).

CPNE1 is known to have multiple splice variant isoforms, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the available context (Su2021Exploring). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific sites and effects are not detailed in the context (Alves2022Cells).

## Function
CPNE1 (copine 1) is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in neural development. It plays a significant role in the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and immature neurons, being expressed during neural lineage cell differentiation but not in embryonic stem cells. This suggests its involvement in the development of human neural lineage cells (Kim2018Copine1). CPNE1 is active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it participates in intracellular signaling pathways, including the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for NSC functions. CPNE1 deficiency in NSCs leads to decreased proliferation and multi-lineage differentiation potential, highlighting its role in NSC regulation (Kim2018Copine1).

CPNE1 also interacts with 14-3-3γ, a protein that regulates various cellular processes, enhancing AKT phosphorylation and promoting neuronal differentiation. This interaction is specific to the Ser54 residue in the C2A domain of CPNE1 and is crucial for CPNE1-related differentiation activities, such as activation of neural marker proteins and neurite outgrowth (Cheal20171433γ). CPNE1's functions in the brain are not fully understood, but its role in neuronal differentiation and interaction with 14-3-3γ suggest it may influence learning and memory (Cheal20171433γ).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CPNE1 gene are associated with the progression of several cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CPNE1 is highly expressed and linked to tumor progression, including proliferation and metastasis. It activates signaling pathways such as Src, FAK, AKT, and ERK, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Zhang2021The). CPNE1 also interacts with RACK1 to activate the MET signaling pathway, promoting cancer progression in NSCLC (Wang2022CPNE1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CPNE1 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. It is involved in the AKT/P53 signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation and migration, and is linked to immune infiltration in liver cancer tissues (Su2022CPNE1). CPNE1's overexpression in gastric adenocarcinoma correlates with poor survival and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (Li2024Comprehensive).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), CPNE1 is significantly overexpressed and promotes tumorigenesis and radioresistance via the AKT signaling pathway. High CPNE1 expression is linked to larger tumor size, distant metastases, and poorer overall survival in TNBC patients (Shao2020CPNE1). These findings suggest that CPNE1 could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
CPNE1 (copine 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It directly interacts with Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (JAB1) in hippocampal progenitor HiB5 cells. This interaction enhances CPNE1's ability to induce neuronal differentiation by increasing AKT phosphorylation and neuronal marker expression, with JAB1 binding to the C2A domain of CPNE1 through its MPN domain (Yoo2018JAB1).

CPNE1 also interacts with HAX1 (HCLS1-associated protein X-1), which negatively regulates CPNE1-mediated neuronal differentiation. The interaction occurs through the C2A and A domains of CPNE1 and the N1 region of HAX1, leading to reduced AKT phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth (Choi2020CPNE1mediated).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CPNE1 interacts with RACK1, activating the MET signaling pathway. This interaction promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to cancer progression. The CPNE1/RACK1 complex is crucial for MET pathway activation, and targeting this interaction may offer therapeutic potential (Wang2022CPNE1).

Additionally, CPNE1 has been shown to interact with protein phosphatase 5 and MEK1, suggesting its involvement in intracellular signaling pathways (Tomsig2003Identification).
