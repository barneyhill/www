# KCND3

## Overview
The KCND3 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member 3, commonly referred to as Kv4.3, which is a crucial component of voltage-gated potassium channels. These channels are integral membrane proteins that play a significant role in regulating neuronal excitability and cardiac action potentials. Kv4.3 is characterized by its six transmembrane segments and is primarily involved in the transient outward A-type potassium current, which is essential for maintaining the electrical excitability of neurons and proper synaptic transmission (Duarri2012Mutations; Zanni2021Novel). The protein is predominantly expressed in the cerebellum and heart, where it influences dendritic excitability and cardiac repolarization, respectively (Hsiao2021Rare). Mutations in KCND3 have been linked to various neurological and cardiological disorders, including spinocerebellar ataxia and Brugada syndrome, highlighting its critical role in both neuronal and cardiac function (Pollini2020KCND3Related; Takayama2019A).

## Structure
The KCND3 gene encodes the Kv4.3 protein, a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit. The Kv4.3 protein is composed of six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) and two intracellular tails, forming a membrane protein structure (Smets2015First; Pollini2020KCND3Related). The S1-S4 segments constitute the voltage-sensing domain, while the S5-S6 segments, along with the pore loop, form the ion-selective pore, also known as the H5 region (Pollini2020KCND3Related; Zanni2021Novel). 

The quaternary structure of Kv4.3 involves the assembly of four identical monomers to form a functional channel, with the pore domain created by the S5-S6 helices (Ågren2023An; Zanni2021Novel). The channel's structure is crucial for its role in neuronal excitability, as it rapidly activates and inactivates in response to membrane depolarization (Smets2015First; Zanni2021Novel).

Kv4.3 channels are subject to modulation by auxiliary β-subunits known as Kv Channel Interacting Proteins (KChIPs), which can influence protein trafficking, channel expression, and activity (Smets2015First; Zanni2021Novel). The protein's structure and function can be affected by various mutations, which may lead to neurological disorders such as cerebellar ataxia (Hsiao2019Novel; Zanni2021Novel).

## Function
The KCND3 gene encodes the Kv4.3 protein, a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit that plays a critical role in regulating neuronal excitability and action potential firing patterns in human cells. Kv4.3 channels are involved in the transient outward A-type potassium current, which is essential for maintaining the electrical excitability of neurons and proper synaptic transmission (Duarri2012Mutations; Zanni2021Novel). These channels are predominantly expressed in the cerebellum, where they contribute to the regulation of dendritic excitability and calcium influx, influencing neuronal subthreshold A-type potassium currents (Zanni2021Novel).

In healthy human cells, Kv4.3 channels are properly localized on the plasma membrane, where they function to regulate potassium ion flow, crucial for maintaining neuronal excitability (Duarri2012Mutations). The Kv4.3 channel is composed of pore-forming voltage-gated α-subunits that associate with auxiliary β-subunits known as Kv Channel Interacting Proteins (KChIPs), which can modify protein trafficking, channel expression, and activity (Zanni2021Novel). This channel is also significantly expressed in the heart, where it mediates the transient outward K+ current that shapes the early repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential (Hsiao2021Rare).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCND3 gene, which encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily D member 3 (Kv4.3), are associated with several neurological and cardiological disorders. Neurologically, KCND3 mutations are linked to spinocerebellar ataxia types 19 and 22 (SCA19/22), characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, cognitive impairment, and other symptoms such as epilepsy, movement disorders, and peripheral neuropathy (Pollini2020KCND3Related; Duarri2012Mutations). These mutations often result in loss-of-function phenotypes, leading to impaired Kv4.3 channel function and disrupted neuronal excitability (Hsiao2019Novel; Zanni2021Novel).

In addition to neurological disorders, KCND3 mutations are implicated in cardiological conditions such as Brugada syndrome and early-onset atrial fibrillation. These conditions are typically associated with gain-of-function mutations, which alter the normal electrical signaling in cardiac cells (Pollini2020KCND3Related; Takayama2019A). The clinical presentation of KCND3-related disorders can vary significantly, with early-onset forms often showing neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy, while late-onset forms are more likely to present with ataxia and cognitive decline (Pollini2020KCND3Related). The diverse phenotypic spectrum underscores the critical role of KCND3 in both neuronal and cardiac function.

## Interactions
The KCND3 gene encodes the Kv4.3 protein, which is a component of voltage-gated potassium channels. Kv4.3 interacts with several proteins that modulate its function and expression. One significant interaction is with the auxiliary subunit KChIP2, a calcium-sensing protein that enhances Kv4.3 protein expression and localization to the cell surface. Despite this interaction, certain KCND3 mutations still result in reduced stability and surface expression of Kv4.3 (Hsiao2019Novel).

Kv4.3 also interacts with voltage-gated sodium channels, particularly Nav1.5, encoded by the SCN5A gene. Co-immunoprecipitation assays have demonstrated a direct interaction between Kv4.3 and Nav1.5, suggesting that these proteins reside in close proximity at the membrane and within intracellular compartments. This interaction is significant for regulating the balance between sodium (INa) and transient outward (Ito) currents, which are crucial for cardiac and neuronal function (Clatot2020InterRegulation).

The presence of different Nav1.5 variants can modulate Kv4.3 function and expression, indicating a complex interplay between these channels. For instance, the R878C variant of Nav1.5 increases the cell surface expression of Kv4.3, while the G1743R variant affects its inactivation properties (Clatot2020InterRegulation). These interactions highlight the role of Kv4.3 in forming macromolecular complexes that influence cardiac and neuronal excitability (Abriel2015Ion).
