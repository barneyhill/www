# IFT46

## Overview
IFT46 is a gene that encodes the intraflagellar transport 46 protein, a critical component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically within the IFT-B complex. This protein is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia and flagella, cellular structures that play vital roles in motility and signaling. IFT46 is involved in the transport of outer dynein arms into cilia, a process crucial for ciliary motility and function. The protein interacts with other IFT-B complex proteins, such as IFT88 and IFT52, to stabilize the complex and facilitate the movement of protein cargo along microtubules. Mutations in the IFT46 gene are linked to various ciliopathies, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper ciliary function and structure (Lee2023IFT46; Lucker2010Direct; Hou2007Functional).

## Structure
IFT46 is a protein involved in intraflagellar transport, primarily as a component of the IFT-B complex. The protein is composed mainly of alpha helices and random coils, with the N-terminus and glycine-rich tail predicted to be intrinsically unstructured and disordered (Lv2017Intraflagellar). The N-terminal domain of IFT46 is crucial for the transport of outer dynein arms (ODAs) into cilia, interacting directly with the transport adaptor protein ODA16 (Taschner2017Structural; Bhogaraju2013Intraflagellar). The C-terminal domain is necessary for the stability of the IFT complex, interacting with IFT52 to form a stable subcomplex (Lv2017Intraflagellar; Bhogaraju2013Intraflagellar).

IFT46 does not contain any identifiable structural domains or motifs, but it is highly conserved from amino acids 100-315 across various species (Hou2007Functional). The protein is known to undergo phosphorylation, as indicated by the recognition of a 64-kD doublet in Western blots (Hou2007Functional). IFT46 forms a ternary complex with IFT52 and IFT88, which is essential for the assembly of cilia and flagella (Lucker2010Direct).

## Function
IFT46 is a protein that plays a critical role in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, which is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia and flagella. In healthy human cells, IFT46 is part of the IFT complex B, where it is involved in the transport of outer dynein arms into cilia, a process crucial for ciliary motility and function (Hou2007Functional). IFT46 interacts with other complex B proteins, such as IFT88 and IFT52, stabilizing the complex and facilitating the movement of protein cargo along microtubules (Lucker2010Direct). This interaction is vital for the proper assembly of flagellar components and the stability of the IFT complex B (Hou2007Functional).

The protein is localized to the basal body and cilia, where it is recruited by IFT52, indicating its role in basal body targeting and ciliary localization (Lv2017Intraflagellar). The absence of IFT46 leads to defects in flagellar assembly, resulting in nonmotile cilia due to the lack of outer dynein arms, highlighting its importance in ciliary function and cellular processes such as motility and signaling (Hou2007Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFT46 gene are associated with a range of ciliopathies, which are genetic disorders caused by defects in cilia structure and function. These conditions include polycystic kidney disease (PKD), nephronophthisis, retinitis pigmentosa, polydactyly, primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), and developmental syndromes such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Joubert syndrome, and Meckel syndrome (Lee2023IFT46). IFT46 is crucial for the assembly of outer dynein arms on axonemal microtubules, and its absence can lead to short, paralyzed flagella, highlighting its role in flagellar assembly (Lucker2010Direct; Hou2007Functional).

In zebrafish models, knockdown of IFT46 results in fewer and shorter cilia, and knockout mice exhibit defects in left-right axis patterning and short cilia, which are indicative of its essential role in ciliary function (Lee2023IFT46). The use of transgenic zebrafish models has demonstrated that alterations in IFT46 expression can mimic ciliopathy phenotypes, such as body axis curvature, cystic kidneys, and defective left-right patterning, providing insights into the etiology and potential therapeutic approaches for human ciliopathies (Lee2023IFT46).

## Interactions
IFT46 is a component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex B, where it plays a crucial role in the transport of outer dynein arms into flagella. It physically interacts with several other proteins within the IFT-B complex, including IFT88, IFT57, IFT81, IFT52, and IFT70, forming a stable subcomplex essential for ciliary function (Taschner2012Architecture; Hou2007Functional). IFT46 does not interact with complex A proteins such as IFT140, indicating its specific association with complex B (Hou2007Functional).

IFT46 also interacts with the protein ODA16, which acts as a cargo adaptor for the transport of outer dynein arms. The N-terminal 147 residues of IFT46 are sufficient for high-affinity interaction with ODA16, forming a stable complex with a dissociation constant of approximately 200 nM (Taschner2017Structural). This interaction is crucial for the recognition and transport of outer dynein arms, although IFT46 does not directly bind to the dynein arms themselves (Taschner2017Structural).

The absence of IFT46 leads to instability in the IFT-B complex, resulting in the degradation of its core proteins, except for IFT172, highlighting its role in maintaining complex stability (Hou2007Functional).
