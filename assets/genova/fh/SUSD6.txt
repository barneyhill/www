# SUSD6

## Overview
SUSD6 is a gene that encodes the sushi domain-containing 6 protein, which is characterized by the presence of a complement control protein (CCP) domain, also known as a Sushi domain. This domain is integral to the protein's role in protein-protein interactions and complement regulation. The SUSD6 protein is a transmembrane protein with extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains, suggesting its involvement in cellular signaling and interactions (Gialeli2018Novel). It is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, and plays a role in processes such as immune response regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. As a p53 responsive gene, SUSD6 is implicated in tumor suppression and immune modulation, with potential roles in cancer progression and immune evasion (Zhao2020N6methyladenosine; Gialeli2018Novel). The protein's stability and function are influenced by post-translational modifications, including N-terminal cysteine oxidation, although structural constraints may limit these effects in vivo (Heathcote2024Nterminal).

## Structure
SUSD6, also known as DRAGO, is a protein characterized by the presence of a complement control protein (CCP) domain, also referred to as a Sushi domain. This domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and plays a role in complement regulation (Gialeli2018Novel). The protein also includes extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains, indicating its potential involvement in signaling or cellular interactions (Gialeli2018Novel).

SUSD6 is highly expressed in various tissues, including the brain, gallbladder, heart, skeletal muscle, testis, endometrium, and placenta, and is moderately expressed in the lung, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and skin (Gialeli2018Novel). The protein's expression in the human primary motor cortex, particularly in excitatory neurons, suggests a role in brain development and function (GonzálezCalvo2022Synapse).

Post-translational modifications of SUSD6 may include N-terminal cysteine acetylation and oxidation, which can influence protein stability. The enzyme cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO) has been shown to oxidize the N-terminal cysteine of SUSD6, although this modification does not appear to affect its stability in vivo, possibly due to structural constraints that limit access to the N-terminus (Heathcote2024Nterminal). Specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of SUSD6 are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
SUSD6 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling pathways, immune response regulation, and cellular adhesion. The protein is characterized by the presence of sushi domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, contributing to its role in maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal homeostasis (Gialeli2018Novel).

In healthy human cells, SUSD6 is associated with DNA repair and apoptosis, particularly in response to stress conditions. It is a p53 responsive gene, suggesting it may mediate some tumor-suppressive activities of p53, such as cell growth suppression and apoptosis (Zhao2020N6methyladenosine; Gialeli2018Novel). The gene is also involved in the production of chemokines in endothelial cells, indicating a role in immune response modulation (Gialeli2018Novel).

SUSD6 expression is modulated in response to pro-inflammatory conditions, which may be linked to cellular aging and inflammageing, a process that could influence age-related diseases (Alexakou2023Biological). The protein's stability is influenced by N-terminal modifications, although its regulation by ADO-catalyzed oxidation is limited due to structural constraints (Heathcote2024Nterminal).

## Clinical Significance
SUSD6 is implicated in cancer through its role in modulating immune evasion and tumor suppression. In the context of cancer immunosurveillance, SUSD6 is part of an inhibitory axis that includes TMEM127 and WWP2, which negatively regulates HLA-I expression. This regulation allows tumor cells to evade immune detection by altering antigen processing and presentation, crucial for CD8+ T cell recognition (Liu2024Massively). 

SUSD6 is also described as a p53 responsive gene, induced by DNA damage, and involved in cell growth suppression and cell death, aligning with the tumor suppressive activity of p53. This suggests that SUSD6 may contribute to tumor suppression by promoting cell death in response to DNA damage (Gialeli2018Novel). 

The dual role of SUSD6 in cancer is further highlighted by its involvement in the complement system, where it may act as a complement inhibitor. This function could either mediate tumor cell killing or promote tumor growth by creating an immunosuppressive environment, depending on the context (Gialeli2018Novel). Understanding the precise mechanisms by which SUSD6 influences cancer progression and immune evasion remains an area of active research.

## Interactions
SUSD6, a member of the sushi domain-containing protein family, is implicated in various cellular processes, including tumor suppression and immune response regulation. While specific protein-protein interactions involving SUSD6 are not extensively detailed, it is known to be a p53 responsive gene, suggesting a role in pathways related to cell growth suppression and apoptosis (Gialeli2018Novel). SUSD6 is also involved in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway and is a transcriptional target of p53, indicating potential interactions with components of the apoptotic machinery (Roberts2020PERPing).

In the context of protein stability, SUSD6 has been identified as a potential substrate for cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO), which catalyzes the oxidation of N-terminal cysteine sequences. This interaction suggests that SUSD6 may be subject to ADO-mediated regulation, influencing its stability and function (Heathcote2024Nterminal). However, studies have shown that despite being a good substrate in vitro, SUSD6's stability does not significantly change under hypoxic conditions in certain cell lines, possibly due to the inaccessibility of its N-terminus for ADO-catalyzed oxidation (Heathcote2024Nterminal). These findings highlight the complexity of SUSD6's interactions and its potential regulatory roles in cellular processes.
