# LAMB3

## Overview
LAMB3 is a gene that encodes the laminin subunit beta 3, a critical component of the laminin-332 complex, also known as laminin-5. This protein complex is integral to the structure and function of the basement membrane, particularly in epithelial tissues. Laminin-332, composed of α3, β3, and γ2 chains, plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, and signaling, thereby maintaining the structural integrity of tissues (Marinkovich2007Laminin; Mcgowan2000Laminins). The laminin subunit beta 3 is categorized as an extracellular matrix protein, and its interactions with other proteins and pathways are significant in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, such as cancer and genetic skin disorders. Mutations in LAMB3 are notably associated with junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a severe skin disorder, while its altered expression is implicated in the progression of various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Wang2023Multiomics; Kivirikko1996Mutational).

## Structure
The LAMB3 gene encodes the laminin subunit beta 3, which is a component of the laminin-332 complex, also known as laminin-5. This complex is crucial for the structure of the basement membrane and is composed of three chains: α3, β3, and γ2 (Marinkovich2007Laminin; Mcgowan2000Laminins). The primary structure of LAMB3 includes a specific amino acid sequence that forms part of the laminin-332 heterotrimeric protein (Di2014A).

The secondary structure of LAMB3 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of laminin proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a stable three-dimensional shape, which is essential for its function in cellular adhesion and basement membrane integrity (Mcgowan2000Laminins).

In terms of quaternary structure, LAMB3 assembles with the α3 and γ2 chains to form the laminin-332 complex, which is involved in maintaining epithelial-mesenchymal cohesion and is implicated in various diseases, including junctional epidermolysis bullosa and squamous-cell carcinoma (Marinkovich2007Laminin; Mcgowan2000Laminins).

LAMB3 contains specific domains such as the laminin N-terminal (LN) domain and laminin EGF-like domains, which are important for its interaction with other extracellular matrix molecules and cell surface receptors (Marinkovich2007Laminin). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, influencing the protein's stability and function. Splice variants of LAMB3 can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its role in tissue development and disease (Yamada2020Tissue).

## Function
LAMB3 encodes the laminin subunit beta 3, which is a component of laminin-332, a crucial protein in the basement membrane of epithelial tissues. Laminin-332 is composed of alpha, beta, and gamma chains, specifically containing the α3, β3, and γ2 chains (Marinkovich2007Laminin). This protein plays a significant role in cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, and signaling, contributing to the structural integrity and function of epithelial tissues (Marinkovich2007Laminin). In the skin, laminin-332 is essential for maintaining the cohesion between the epidermis and dermis, as it forms part of the hemidesmosome-anchoring filament complex (Mcgowan2000Laminins). 

In the liver, LAMB3 is specifically expressed in biliary epithelial cells, where it is involved in the development and function of bile ducts. However, studies using liver-specific Lamb3 knockout mice have shown that LAMB3 is not essential for the development and function of intrahepatic biliary epithelial tissue under normal physiological conditions (Yamada2020Tissue). The expression of LAMB3 is also associated with the laminin-332 complex, which is crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating cell-matrix interactions (Yamada2020Tissue).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LAMB3 gene are primarily associated with junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB), a group of genetic skin disorders characterized by skin fragility and blistering. The Herlitz type of JEB (H-JEB) is a severe form caused by mutations in LAMB3, leading to premature termination codons in both alleles. This results in the absence of functional laminin 5, a critical component for skin integrity, causing severe blistering and early mortality (Kivirikko1996Mutational; Pulkkinen1999Mutation). Two recurrent nonsense mutations, R42X and R635X, are identified as mutational hotspots in LAMB3, accounting for a significant portion of H-JEB cases (Varki2006Epidermolysis; Kivirikko1996Mutational).

Alterations in LAMB3 expression are also implicated in cancer progression. LAMB3 is identified as an independent risk factor for various cancers, including lung cancer, where its expression is higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. These alterations are linked to worse prognosis and are associated with changes in immune cell infiltration and immune response regulation (Wang2023Multiomics). High LAMB3 expression is generally associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and target for cancer therapy (Wang2023Multiomics).

## Interactions
LAMB3, a component of the laminin-332 complex, interacts with various proteins and pathways, playing a significant role in cancer progression. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), LAMB3 interacts with LAMC2 and KRT17, as identified through co-immunoprecipitation and LC-MS analysis. LAMC2 is directly predicted to interact with LAMB3, and their co-localization in the cytoplasm of PDAC cells has been confirmed (Lin2022S100A10). LAMB3 is also involved in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival, proliferation, and migration. This interaction is evidenced by increased phosphorylation of Akt in PDAC cells with LAMB3 overexpression (Zhang2019LAMB3).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), LAMB3 is transcriptionally regulated by the interaction between ELK4 and BRD2. This interaction is acetylation-dependent, with ELK4 binding directly to the LAMB3 promoter region. The acetylation of ELK4 at lysine 125 is crucial for its interaction with BRD2, and the BET inhibitor JQ1 can disrupt this interaction, leading to decreased LAMB3 expression (Zhu2020LAMB3). LAMB3 also interacts with integrins, affecting downstream signaling pathways such as FAK/Src/Rac1 and Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk, which contribute to cancer cell migration and tumor progression (Zhu2020LAMB3).
