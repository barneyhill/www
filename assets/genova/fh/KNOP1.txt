# KNOP1

## Overview
KNOP1, or lysine-rich nucleolar protein 1, is a gene that encodes a nucleolar protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar organization. The protein encoded by KNOP1 is characterized by its lysine-rich composition and is primarily localized in the nucleolus, where it plays a pivotal role in the assembly and maturation of ribosomal subunits, essential for protein synthesis and cellular growth (Reshetnikov2024Maternal). Beyond its fundamental role in ribosome assembly, KNOP1 is implicated in chromatin remodeling and the regulation of developmental genes, contributing to cellular growth and differentiation (Reshetnikov2024Maternal). The protein's interactions with other nucleolar components, such as zinc finger 106 protein (ZFP106), suggest its involvement in broader nucleolar functions related to gene expression and chromatin structure (Harper2023Genome‐Wide). In pathological contexts, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, KNOP1 expression is associated with poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhang2023Identification).

## Function
KNOP1, or lysine-rich nucleolar protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein primarily active in the nucleolus, where it plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar organization. This protein is involved in the assembly and maturation of ribosomal subunits, which are essential for protein synthesis and cellular growth (Reshetnikov2024Maternal). In healthy human cells, KNOP1 is linked to chromatin remodeling and the regulation of developmental genes, processes that are vital for cellular growth and differentiation (Reshetnikov2024Maternal).

KNOP1 interacts with zinc finger 106 protein (ZFP106), facilitating its translocation into the nucleolus, which suggests a role in nucleolar functions related to gene expression and chromatin structure (Harper2023Genome‐Wide). The protein's involvement in chromatin remodeling indicates its participation in the regulation of DNA-binding transcription factor activity, which is crucial for the transition of cells through the mitotic phase (Gockley2021Multitissue). Although KNOP1's specific functions in healthy cells are not fully elucidated, its interactions and roles in chromatin dynamics and ribosome assembly underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting normal cellular functions.

## Clinical Significance
The KNOP1 gene has been identified as having significant clinical implications in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). High expression levels of KNOP1 are associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients, as indicated by poorer overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI) (Zhang2023Identification). The study by Zhang et al. found that KNOP1 is overexpressed in HCC tissues compared to normal tissues, and this overexpression correlates with various clinical features such as TNM stage, pathological stage, histologic grade, tumor status, Child-Pugh grade, and vascular invasion (Zhang2023Identification).

KNOP1 expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration, particularly T helper 2 (Th2) cells, and correlates with various immune checkpoints, suggesting a role in immune escape mechanisms in HCC (Zhang2023Identification). Genetic alterations in KNOP1 were found in a small percentage of HCC patients, with a significant impact on disease-free survival (Zhang2023Identification). These findings highlight KNOP1 as a potential biomarker for evaluating HCC prognosis and as a target for therapeutic interventions (Zhang2023Identification).

## Interactions
KNOP1 (lysine-rich nucleolar protein 1) is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It participates in ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar organization, potentially interacting with ribosomal proteins, nucleolar proteins, and RNA molecules. These interactions contribute to the assembly and function of ribosomal subunits (Zhang2023Identification).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KNOP1 has been shown to have significant interactions with cell cycle-related genes. There is a notable positive correlation between KNOP1 expression and genes such as MCM2, MCM3, MCM4, MCM5, MCM6, MCM7, and PCNA, which are crucial for DNA replication and cell cycle progression (Zhang2023Identification). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis using the STRING database identified 26 nodes, including KNOP1, and 97 edges, indicating potential interactions and pathways involving KNOP1 (Zhang2023Identification).

Gene-gene interaction (GGI) network analysis using GeneMANIA further supports the involvement of KNOP1 in complex interaction networks, comprising 20 genes and 73 links. These analyses highlight KNOP1's role in various signaling pathways, including those related to DNA replication, cell cycle, and immune response, particularly in the context of HCC (Zhang2023Identification).
