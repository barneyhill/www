# SIRT3

## Overview
SIRT3 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial protein sirtuin 3, which is a member of the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases. Sirtuin 3 plays a pivotal role in regulating mitochondrial function and energy metabolism by deacetylating and activating various metabolic enzymes. This protein is characterized by its classical sirtuin fold and is involved in processes such as fatty acid oxidation, ATP production, and the management of oxidative stress. SIRT3 is highly expressed in tissues with significant oxidative capacity, including the liver, brain, and skeletal muscle, where it contributes to cellular protection against oxidative damage and supports mitochondrial integrity. The gene's expression and activity have been linked to longevity and protection against age-related diseases, as well as implications in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Ansari2016Function; Giralt2012SIRT3; Hirschey2011SIRT3).

## Structure
SIRT3 is a mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase with a well-defined molecular structure. The primary structure of SIRT3 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein, with multiple splice variant isoforms contributing to its functional diversity (Zhang2019Molecular). The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are part of its conserved sirtuin core domain (Rumpf2015Seeding). 

The tertiary structure of SIRT3 is characterized by a Rossmann fold, a common feature in NAD+-binding proteins. This fold is composed of a larger NAD+-binding domain and a smaller zinc-binding domain, which together form the catalytic core of the enzyme (Rumpf2015Seeding; Zhang2019Molecular). The protein adopts a classical sirtuin fold, with a cleft at the interface of these two lobes where substrate binding occurs (Zhang2019Molecular).

SIRT3 can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure (Rumpf2015Seeding). It undergoes post-translational modifications such as acetylation, which can influence its activity and function (Zhang2019Molecular). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in histone de-β-hydroxybutyrylation, with specific residues and domains facilitating substrate recognition and catalysis (Zhang2019Molecular).

## Function
SIRT3 is a mitochondrial deacetylase that plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial functions and energy metabolism in healthy human cells. It is involved in the deacetylation and activation of key metabolic enzymes, such as acetyl-CoA synthetase, long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase 2, enhancing their enzymatic activity and promoting fatty acid oxidation and energy production (Giralt2012SIRT3; Hirschey2011SIRT3). SIRT3 also regulates the acetylation status of proteins within the electron transport chain, particularly Complex I, which is essential for maintaining ATP levels and energy homeostasis (Ahn2008A).

SIRT3 is highly expressed in tissues with high oxidative capacity, such as the liver, brain, kidney, skeletal muscle, and brown adipose tissue, where it helps manage oxidative stress by deacetylating and activating enzymes like superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), which are involved in detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Giralt2012SIRT3). This activity is crucial for protecting cells from oxidative damage and maintaining mitochondrial integrity (Ansari2016Function). SIRT3's role in energy metabolism and oxidative stress management is linked to increased longevity and protection against age-related diseases (Giralt2012SIRT3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SIRT3 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), SIRT3 is overexpressed, but its enzymatic activity is reduced due to a mutation near the active site, specifically the p.Val208Ile mutation. This mutation is associated with decreased catalytic efficiency, affecting the redox balance and potentially contributing to cancer development (Chen2013Role).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), high SIRT3 expression is linked to shorter survival times, as it suppresses apoptosis signals and decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, aiding cancer cell growth (Ansari2016Function). Conversely, in gastric cancer, SIRT3 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression inversely correlated with tumor progression factors (Ansari2016Function).

SIRT3 also plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer's disease, changes in SIRT3 expression have been observed, with increased expression in early stages and decreased expression as the disease progresses. SIRT3 overexpression has been shown to prevent tau accumulation in neurons, suggesting a neuroprotective role (SidorovaDarmos2018The). In Parkinson's disease, SIRT3 overexpression alleviates oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (Tyagi2023A).

## Interactions
SIRT3, a mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase, interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial function and metabolism. It is known to deacetylate and activate several mitochondrial enzymes, including components of the respiratory chain such as NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) and succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (complex II), which are essential for ATP production and oxidative phosphorylation (Giralt2012SIRT3; Nahálková2020The). SIRT3 also interacts with ATP synthase, specifically the Fo unit subunit B, influencing ATP synthesis (Nahálková2020The).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, SIRT3 regulates mitophagy through the SIRT3-PINK1-PARKIN pathway, which is vital for the removal of damaged mitochondria (Nahálková2020The). It also interacts with and deacetylates manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), enhancing its activity to reduce oxidative stress (Giralt2012SIRT3).

SIRT3's interaction with cyclophilin D (CypD) is significant in preventing the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, thereby reducing the release of pro-apoptotic factors and ATP depletion (Giralt2012SIRT3). Additionally, SIRT3 deacetylates and activates enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, such as long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), and regulates ketone body production by activating 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS2) (Hirschey2011SIRT3).
