# SMR3B

## Overview
SMR3B, or submaxillary gland androgen regulated protein 3B, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of salivary gland function. The protein encoded by SMR3B is primarily expressed in response to androgen hormones and is categorized as a secretory protein due to its role in the extracellular space, where it contributes to the composition and function of saliva. This protein is significant for its involvement in the secretion processes of the submaxillary glands, impacting oral health and digestion by influencing the biochemical environment of the mouth. The expression and regulation of SMR3B are crucial for maintaining oral hygiene and initiating the digestive process, highlighting its importance in both oral and systemic health (RiveraMulia2019Variable; RiveraMulia2019Replication).

## Function
SMR3B (submaxillary gland androgen regulated protein 3B) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of salivary gland function. This protein is expressed in response to androgen hormones and plays a significant role in the secretion processes of the submaxillary glands. It is active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to the composition of saliva. The presence of SMR3B in saliva suggests its potential influence on oral health and digestion by affecting the biochemical environment of the mouth. The protein's activity in the extracellular space indicates its involvement in molecular processes that facilitate the secretion and function of saliva, which is crucial for maintaining oral hygiene and initiating the digestive process. The regulation of salivary gland function by SMR3B underscores its importance in the physiological processes that support both oral and systemic health.

## Clinical Significance
The SMR3B gene has been implicated in various cancer types due to alterations in its expression levels. In breast cancer, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer patients, SMR3B is expressed at higher levels in those with poor prognosis compared to low-risk patients. This differential expression is linked to the regulatory role of the GATA3 transcription factor, where mutations in GATA3 result in lower SMR3B expression levels in tumor tissues (Afzaljavan2021GATA3). 

In adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), SMR3B is identified as a salivary gland-specific gene that is overexpressed in a subgroup of salivary ACC tumors. However, it is not specifically associated with poor survival outcomes in these patients (Brayer2023Dominant). 

Additionally, SMR3B, along with other opiorphin family genes, is upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), suggesting a potential link between its expression and certain cancer types. However, the direct association with cellular phenotypes remains to be fully established (RiveraMulia2019Variable; RiveraMulia2019Replication). Further research is needed to clarify the clinical significance of SMR3B in these contexts.
