# CENPL

## Overview
CENPL, or centromere protein L, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a vital component of the centromere-kinetochore complex. This protein is integral to the proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division, specifically in processes such as mitosis and meiosis. As part of the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), CENPL plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability and specificity of the inner kinetochore by interacting with other centromere proteins, including CENPN, to identify CENPA nucleosomes. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of additional centromere components, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and preventing aneuploidy, a condition often linked to cancer (Zeng2021Highly; Cui2022Overexpression). The protein's function in stabilizing kinetochore microtubules and facilitating proper spindle attachment underscores its importance in genomic stability and its potential implications in tumorigenesis (Feng2022PanCancer).

## Function
Centromere protein L (CENPL) is a crucial component of the centromere protein family, playing a significant role in the assembly and function of the kinetochore, a structure essential for chromosome segregation during cell division processes such as mitosis and meiosis (Zeng2021Highly; Cui2022Overexpression). CENPL is part of the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), which is integral to the inner kinetochore's stability and specificity (Cui2022Overexpression). It combines with CENPN to identify CENPA nucleosomes, facilitating the recruitment of other centromere components necessary for centromere assembly (Zeng2021Highly).

CENPL's role in maintaining kinetochore microtubule stability and the kinetochore's pushing force is vital for normal cell division, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and preventing aneuploidy, a condition often associated with cancer (Reinhold2011Identification; Cui2022Overexpression). The protein is active in the centromere region of chromosomes, contributing to genomic stability by ensuring proper attachment of spindle microtubules to centromeres (Feng2022PanCancer). This function is critical for maintaining chromosomal stability and preventing tumorigenesis (Zeng2021Highly).

## Clinical Significance
CENPL (centromere protein L) has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and mutations. In several types of cancer, including breast, lung, colorectal, gastric, liver, cervical, and ovarian cancers, CENPL is upregulated, while it is downregulated in brain and CNS cancers and leukemia (Feng2022PanCancer). High expression of CENPL is associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as low-grade glioma, adrenocortical carcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but it is linked to better survival in thymoma (Feng2022PanCancer). In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, CENPL overexpression is correlated with poor prognosis and is considered a prognostic risk factor (Cui2022Overexpression).

In breast cancer, high CENPL expression is linked to increased cell proliferation and immune infiltration, correlating with worse outcomes such as distant metastasis-free survival and relapse-free survival (Gui2023Highly). In hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated CENPL levels are associated with poor survival outcomes and adverse clinicopathological features (Zeng2021Highly). CENPL mutations, although rare, are linked to worse prognosis in breast invasive carcinoma, affecting disease-free survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free survival (Feng2022PanCancer). These findings suggest that CENPL could serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
CENPL (centromere protein L) is a crucial component of the centromere-kinetochore complex, playing a significant role in chromosome segregation during cell division. It is part of the CENP-L-N complex, which is essential for centromere specificity and kinetochore stability. This complex is involved in the recruitment of other centromere components, such as CENP-A, CENP-C, and CENP-N, facilitating proper kinetochore function (Cui2022Overexpression). CENPL interacts with CENPN to identify CENPA nucleosomes, which is vital for the assembly of the centromere and kinetochore structures (Zeng2021Highly).

In the context of cancer, CENPL has been implicated in various types, including breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In HCC, CENPL is associated with pathways such as the cell cycle, DNA replication, and p53 signaling, which are crucial for maintaining genomic stability (Zeng2021Highly). The expression of CENPL is also linked to immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in modulating the tumor microenvironment (Zeng2021Highly). Despite its involvement in these processes, specific details on the transient or activating interactions of CENPL with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated.
