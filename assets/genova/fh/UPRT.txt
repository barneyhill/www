# UPRT

## Overview
Uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) is a gene that encodes the enzyme uracil phosphoribosyltransferase homolog, which is a key component of the pyrimidine salvage pathway. This enzyme is classified as a transferase, specifically involved in the conversion of uracil to uridine monophosphate (UMP), a critical step in nucleotide metabolism (Li2007Identification). The UPRT gene is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in blood leukocytes, liver, spleen, and thymus, indicating its significant role in these organs (Li2007Identification). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining nucleotide balance within cells, contributing to DNA and RNA synthesis, and ensuring genomic stability. Additionally, UPRT's involvement in the biochemical modulation of the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil underscores its potential as a target for drug development (Li2007Identification).

## Function
The human gene UPRT encodes the enzyme uracil phosphoribosyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in the pyrimidine salvage pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of uracil and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-R-diphosphate into uridine monophosphate (UMP), a key step in nucleotide metabolism (Li2007Identification). UPRT is involved in maintaining the nucleotide pool necessary for DNA and RNA synthesis, contributing to cellular nucleotide balance and genomic stability. The enzyme is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, but it is also found in the nucleus, indicating its potential involvement in nuclear processes (Li2007Identification).

Expression studies have shown that UPRT is strongly expressed in blood leukocytes, liver, spleen, and thymus, with lower expression levels in other tissues, suggesting its importance in these organs (Li2007Identification). Despite its conservation across various organisms, higher eukaryotes, including humans, lack two amino acids in the uracil-binding region, which may affect its enzymatic activity or suggest alternative roles in pyrimidine metabolism (Li2007Identification). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the biochemical modulation of 5-fluorouracil, a chemotherapeutic agent, highlighting its potential as a target for drug design (Li2007Identification).
