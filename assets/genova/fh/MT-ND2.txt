# MT-ND2

## Overview
The MT-ND2 gene is a mitochondrial gene that encodes the protein mitochondrially encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 2, a critical component of Complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a pivotal role in electron transfer, contributing to the proton gradient necessary for ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation. As a transmembrane protein, MT-ND2 is involved in forming the L-shaped structure of Complex I, which is essential for its function in energy production. Mutations in the MT-ND2 gene can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and are associated with various neurodegenerative and mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Yan2019Mitochondrial; Gaspar2015Genetic; Houštěk2012Nonsynonymous).

## Structure
The MT-ND2 gene encodes a subunit of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex, also known as Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a crucial role in electron transfer. The MT-ND2 protein is involved in forming the L-shaped structure of Complex I, which consists of a hydrophobic arm embedded in the lipid membrane and a hydrophilic arm protruding into the matrix (Houštěk2012Nonsynonymous).

The secondary structure of the MT-ND2 protein includes multiple transmembrane helices, with predictions indicating 11 transmembrane regions (Shi2017Genetic). These transmembrane domains are essential for the protein's function in the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons and contributing to the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane.

Mutations in the MT-ND2 gene can lead to changes in the protein's secondary structure, potentially affecting its function. For example, a missense mutation in the MT-ND2 gene has been associated with changes in the protein's secondary structure, which may have implications for its function (Wang2013Association). The protein's structure and function are critical for maintaining efficient electron transport and energy production in mitochondria.

## Function
The MT-ND2 gene encodes a core subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This complex is essential for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of NADH and the transfer of electrons to ubiquinone, a process crucial for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mitochondria (Yan2019Mitochondrial). MT-ND2 is part of the mitochondrial genome and contributes to the assembly and stability of complex I, which is vital for maintaining mitochondrial energy homeostasis (Houštěk2012Nonsynonymous).

In healthy human cells, MT-ND2 plays a significant role in the electron transport chain, specifically in complex I activity, which is the largest multi-protein enzyme complex of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain (Yan2019Mitochondrial). The protein encoded by MT-ND2 is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it facilitates the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, contributing to the proton gradient used for ATP synthesis (Mukherjee2020Molecular). Proper function of MT-ND2 is crucial for efficient oxidative phosphorylation, and disturbances in this process can lead to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell death (Yan2019Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MT-ND2 gene have been associated with several neurodegenerative and mitochondrial disorders. Notably, the m.5460G>A mutation in MT-ND2 has been linked to Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, where it may contribute to the development of dementia (Gaspar2015Genetic). Although many mutations in MT-ND2 are classified as benign, some may still play a role in disease processes, potentially influencing the risk or severity of these conditions (Gaspar2015Genetic).

MT-ND2 mutations are also implicated in mitochondrial cytopathies, which primarily affect nervous and muscular tissues. These disorders are characterized by defects in the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS), leading to increased oxidative stress and decreased ATP production. Such dysfunctions can result in conditions like mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) (Ryzhkova2018Mitochondrial).

In chickens, the expression of the mt-ND2 gene is influenced by dietary factors and age, which may have implications for understanding its role in human diseases. The gene's expression decreases with age, and different types of dietary fats can modulate its expression in specific tissues (Zhang2015The). These findings suggest that environmental factors may also impact MT-ND2-related disease processes.

## Interactions
MT-ND2, a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions within the oxidative phosphorylation system. A frameshift mutation in the MT-ND2 gene leads to a shorter, more hydrophilic C-terminus, which affects its interactions with other subunits of complex I, such as NDUFC2, ND4, ND4L, and ND5. This mutation results in promiscuous interactions, particularly with NDUFC2 and ND4, enhancing growth rates in certain yeast strains. However, the interaction with ND4L remains strong, suggesting that the specific interface between ND2 and ND4L is not disrupted by the mutation (Barshad2019Diseasecausing).

The frameshift mutation in MT-ND2 also causes the protein to interact with numerous mitochondrial proteins, disrupting normal interaction patterns and leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. This promiscuous interaction phenotype is primarily associated with the C-terminal region of ND2, while the N-terminal region's interaction with ND4L remains unaffected (Barshad2019Diseasecausing).

In addition to these interactions, MT-ND2 is part of the membrane domain of complex I, facilitating proton translocation through its structural role. It forms part of the antiporter-like subunits, which are crucial for the complex's function (Fiedorczuk2016Atomic).
