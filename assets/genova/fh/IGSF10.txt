# IGSF10

## Overview
IGSF10 is a gene that encodes the protein immunoglobulin superfamily member 10, which is a part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons during embryonic development, a critical process for the proper formation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, which is essential for puberty and reproductive health (Howard2016IGSF). IGSF10 is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is active in the extracellular matrix, where it interacts with other molecules to guide neuronal migration (Howard2016IGSF). Mutations in the IGSF10 gene have been linked to delayed puberty and other reproductive disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Howard2016IGSF). Additionally, IGSF10 has been implicated in various cancers, functioning as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts (Ling2021MicroRNA106b5p).

## Function
The IGSF10 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons during embryonic development. This process is essential for the proper development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, which regulates puberty and reproductive health (Howard2016IGSF). IGSF10 is part of a complex system of migratory cues that guide GnRH neurons from their origin in the nasal placode toward the hypothalamus. This migration occurs during a specific temporal window in embryogenesis, from embryonic day 10.5 to 17.5 in mice (Howard2016IGSF).

In healthy human cells, IGSF10 is involved in the regulation of GnRH neuronal migration, ensuring the timely arrival of these neurons at the hypothalamus, which is crucial for normal pubertal development (Howard2016IGSF). The protein is active in the extracellular matrix, where it likely interacts with other chemokines, such as Cxcl12, to guide the neurons (Howard2016IGSF). Mutations in IGSF10 can disrupt this migration, leading to conditions such as delayed puberty and potentially contributing to other reproductive disorders like hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Howard2016IGSF).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IGSF10 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. IGSF10 plays a crucial role in the migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, and mutations in this gene have been linked to delayed puberty. These mutations can disrupt the signaling necessary for the proper migration of GnRH neurons to the hypothalamus, leading to a functional defect in the GnRH neuroendocrine network and resulting in delayed pubertal timing (Howard2016IGSF). Variants in IGSF10 have also been identified in individuals with self-limited delayed puberty, suggesting an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance (Festa2020Genetic).

In addition to its role in reproductive development, IGSF10 has been implicated in various cancers. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), IGSF10 functions as a tumor suppressor via the integrin-β1/FAK signaling pathway. Its expression is significantly reduced in multiple cancer types, and low IGSF10 expression correlates with poor survival outcomes in LUAD patients. IGSF10 is also identified as an independent prognostic factor for LUAD (Ling2021MicroRNA106b5p). The downregulation of IGSF10 is associated with radiation-induced bone tumorigenesis and has been linked to endometrial and gastric cancers (Ling2021MicroRNA106b5p).

## Interactions
IGSF10 is known to participate in protein-protein interactions, particularly with SLAMF9, another orphan receptor. This interaction is significant as it represents a connection between two orphan receptors from distinct biological systems: the immune and nervous systems. SLAMF9 is part of the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule subfamily, which is expressed on most immune cells and plays roles in both co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory functions in immunity (Wojtowicz2020A).

The study by Wojtowicz et al. utilized a high-throughput protein-protein interaction screen to map interactions within the immunoglobulin domain superfamily (IgSF), identifying 380 previously unknown interactions. Although the study focused on a broad range of IgSF proteins, specific interactions involving IGSF10 beyond SLAMF9 were not detailed in the provided excerpts (Wojtowicz2020A).

Research on IGSF10 has primarily focused on its role in the migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, with mutations in the IGSF10 gene linked to delayed puberty. However, the physical interactions of the IGSF10 protein with other proteins or nucleic acids, aside from SLAMF9, have not been extensively documented in the available literature (Howard2016IGSF).
