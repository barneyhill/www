# COA8

## Overview
The COA8 gene encodes the protein cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 8, which plays a pivotal role in the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a critical component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV. This protein is categorized as an assembly factor, essential for the early stages of COX biogenesis. COA8 interacts specifically with COX10, a heme O synthase, to stabilize its structure and facilitate the synthesis of heme A, a vital component of the COX catalytic center. This interaction is crucial for the maturation of the MT-CO1 subunit and the proper assembly of complex IV, ensuring efficient mitochondrial energy production. Mutations in the COA8 gene are linked to mitochondrial disorders, including cavitating leukoencephalopathy and mitochondrial myopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity (Chapleau2023Neuropathological; Rimoldi2023Prominent; Brischigliaro2024COA8).

## Function
The human gene COA8, also known as cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 8, is integral to the early biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a key component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV. COA8 specifically interacts with COX10, a heme O synthase, stabilizing its structure and function, which is crucial for the synthesis of heme A, a vital component of the COX catalytic center (Brischigliaro2024COA8). This interaction is essential for the maturation of MT-CO1, a core subunit of COX, and the proper assembly and activity of complex IV (Brischigliaro2024COA8).

In healthy human cells, COA8 facilitates the correct incorporation of heme A and the release of chaperones during the maturation process, ensuring the proper assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (Brischigliaro2024COA8). The absence of COA8 leads to defects in COX assembly, characterized by the accumulation of partially assembled intermediates and decreased levels of COX10 and the cIV subunit MT-CO2 (Brischigliaro2024COA8). COA8 is also responsive to oxidative stress, with its intra-mitochondrial levels increasing under such conditions, highlighting its role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Brischigliaro2024COA8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COA8 gene, also known as APOPT1, are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders characterized by cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency. These mutations can lead to a rare condition known as cavitating leukoencephalopathy, which presents with symptoms such as developmental delay, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, and sensorimotor polyneuropathy. The disease typically follows a bi-phasic course with acute regression followed by long-term stabilization, and is marked by a characteristic brain MRI pattern of posterior predominant cavitating leukoencephalopathy (Chapleau2023Neuropathological).

COA8 mutations have also been linked to mitochondrial myopathy, with symptoms including muscle weakness, peripheral neuropathy, and cognitive impairment. Muscle biopsies in affected individuals often show ragged-red fibers and reduced COX activity (Rimoldi2023Prominent). The clinical spectrum of COA8-related diseases is broad, with some patients experiencing progressive ataxia and spastic tetraparesis (Rimoldi2023Prominent).

In Drosophila melanogaster, knockdown of the COA8 ortholog results in COX deficiency, neuromuscular impairment, and reduced resistance to oxidative stress, suggesting a crucial role for COA8 in mitochondrial function and its potential implications in neuromuscular and oxidative stress-related conditions (Brischigliaro2019Knockdown).

## Interactions
The COA8 protein, also known as cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 8, specifically interacts with the heme O synthase COX10. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization and catalytic activity of COX10, which is necessary for the synthesis of the heme A cofactor, a critical component of the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) catalytic center (Brischigliaro2024COA8). The interaction between COA8 and COX10 was identified using a SILAC approach and confirmed through mass spectrometry analysis of co-immunopurified fractions, indicating a specific interaction that is maintained even under oxidative stress conditions (Brischigliaro2024COA8).

Structural modeling suggests that COA8 interacts with COX10's central cavity catalytic domain through conserved residues, particularly involving aromatic residues in COA8. The interaction is thought to occur mainly between the second alpha helix of COA8 and a helix loop in COX10, with a specific residue, W174 in COA8, predicted to have a high contact score with P213 in COX10 (Brischigliaro2024COA8). This interaction is essential for the proper maturation of MT-CO1, a component of COX, and influences the assembly and activity of complex IV (cIV) (Brischigliaro2024COA8). Loss-of-function mutations in COA8 lead to mitochondrial encephalopathy and COX deficiency, underscoring its critical role in mitochondrial function (Brischigliaro2024COA8).
