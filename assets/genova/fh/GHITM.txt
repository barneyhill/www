# GHITM

## Overview
GHITM, or growth hormone inducible transmembrane protein, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial transmembrane protein involved in critical cellular processes. The protein encoded by GHITM is integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function. It is essential for the organization of mitochondrial cristae, which are crucial for the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation and cellular energy metabolism (Orliaguet2021Interferon). Additionally, GHITM is involved in regulating apoptosis by influencing the release of cytochrome c, thereby promoting cell survival under certain conditions (Than2016Analysis). The gene's expression and regulation have significant implications in various physiological and pathological contexts, including metabolic disorders, cancer, and neuroprotection (Harvey2010Proteomic; Orliaguet2021Interferon).

## Function
GHITM, or growth hormone inducible transmembrane protein, is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function. It is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is involved in regulating apoptosis and cellular energy metabolism. GHITM contributes to the organization of mitochondrial cristae, which are essential for the proper functioning of oxidative phosphorylation enzyme complexes (Orliaguet2021Interferon). By maintaining the structure of these cristae, GHITM supports efficient oxidative respiration, which is vital for energy production in cells (Orliaguet2021Interferon).

GHITM also influences the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, a key step in the apoptotic pathway. By controlling this release, GHITM can interfere with apoptosis, promoting cell survival (Than2016Analysis). This regulatory function is significant in various tissues, including the brain, where GHITM is implicated in neuroprotection by inhibiting pro-apoptotic actions (Harvey2010Proteomic).

In macrophages, GHITM is involved in metabolic adaptation, particularly under conditions of metabolic stress. It is negatively regulated by Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 (IRF5), which represses oxidative respiration by inhibiting GHITM, leading to a shift in macrophage metabolism towards glycolysis (Orliaguet2021Interferon).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GHITM gene, also known as growth hormone inducible transmembrane protein, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). In these conditions, GHITM expression is negatively regulated by the transcription factor IRF5, leading to impaired mitochondrial function and increased reliance on glycolysis, which contributes to inflammation in adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) (Orliaguet2022Early; Orliaguet2021Interferon). This interaction is significant in the metabolic adaptations associated with diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance (Orliaguet2022Early).

GHITM is also involved in cancer, where its expression is altered in various cancer cell lines. It is downregulated in many cancer types, which may affect mitochondrial integrity and apoptosis regulation (RojasRivera2014TMBIM). The downregulation of GHITM is associated with mitochondrial fragmentation and increased inflammation under lipotoxic stress, suggesting a role in the maladaptation of white adipose tissue to caloric excess (Orliaguet2022Early).

In genetically improved farmed tilapia, GHITM expression is regulated by miR-1338-5p, affecting growth hormone pathways and potentially influencing growth and metabolic processes (Qiang2017miR13385p). While specific diseases directly linked to GHITM mutations are not detailed, its altered expression and interactions are crucial in metabolic and cancer-related pathologies.
