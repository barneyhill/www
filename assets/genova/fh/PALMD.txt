# PALMD

## Overview
PALMD is a gene that encodes the protein palmdelphin, which is primarily involved in cytoskeletal organization and cellular signaling. Palmdelphin is a cytosolic protein associated with actin filaments, playing a significant role in maintaining cell shape and motility, and is categorized as part of the paralemmin protein family (Thériault2018A; Hu2001The). It is expressed in various tissues, with notable abundance in cardiac and skeletal muscle, where it contributes to myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration (Nie2017Palmdelphin; Thériault2018A). Additionally, palmdelphin is involved in apoptosis, particularly as a pro-apoptotic target of the tumor suppressor protein p53, highlighting its role in cell death pathways (Dashzeveg2014Palmdelphin). The gene has clinical significance, being associated with calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) and potentially influencing other cellular processes through its interactions with proteins such as NEXN and Pdlim5 (Guo2024In; Srivastava2024Role).

## Function
PALMD (palmdelphin) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, primarily related to cytoskeletal organization and cellular signaling. The PALMD protein is predominantly cytosolic and is associated with actin filaments, playing a crucial role in maintaining cell shape and motility (Hu2001The). It is involved in plasma membrane dynamics and cell shape control, similar to other members of the paralemmin protein family (Thériault2018A).

In healthy human cells, PALMD is expressed in various tissues, with notable abundance in cardiac and skeletal muscle (Thériault2018A). It promotes myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration, as demonstrated by its upregulation during myogenic differentiation and its essential role in myotube formation during muscle repair (Nie2017Palmdelphin). PALMD's involvement in these processes suggests its importance in muscle development and regeneration.

PALMD also plays a role in apoptosis, particularly in response to DNA damage. It is a pro-apoptotic gene regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, specifically when p53 is phosphorylated at serine-46. This regulation is crucial for promoting apoptosis, highlighting PALMD's role in cell death pathways (Dashzeveg2014Palmdelphin).

## Clinical Significance
The PALMD gene has been identified as a susceptibility gene for calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS), a serious heart condition characterized by the narrowing of the aortic valve. Research indicates that genetic variants at the PALMD locus, particularly the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6702619, are associated with an increased risk of CAVS. This association is linked to decreased expression levels of PALMD in aortic valve tissues, which correlates with more severe symptoms of the disease, such as smaller aortic valve area and higher transvalvular gradients (Thériault2018A). The study suggests that the downregulation of PALMD in aortic valve tissues contributes to the pathogenesis of CAVS, and the population-attributable risk for the rs6702619 variant was estimated at 12.3% in the UK Biobank cohort (Thériault2018A).

In addition to its role in cardiovascular disease, PALMD is also implicated in cell death mechanisms. It is a pro-apoptotic target of the tumor suppressor gene p53, specifically when p53 is phosphorylated at serine-46. This interaction suggests that PALMD may play a role in apoptosis and potentially other forms of cell death, such as necroptosis, when its expression is altered (Dashzeveg2014Palmdelphin).

## Interactions
Palmdelphin (PALMD) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In cardiomyocytes, PALMD interacts with the protein NEXN, stabilizing it at the Z-line, which is crucial for maintaining systolic function and the integrity of the junctional membrane complex (JMC) and transverse tubules (TTs). This interaction is essential for cardiac protection under stress conditions, such as isoproterenol-induced cardiac injury (Guo2024In).

In neurons, PALMD forms a complex with Pdlim5, which is significant for dendritic morphology. This interaction is validated through various assays, including proximity ligation and co-immunoprecipitation, demonstrating a stable and specific association. The Pdlim5:PalmD complex is associated with delta-catenin, which enhances dendrite branching by inhibiting the small-GTPase RhoA. This interaction is influenced by a phospho-switch responsive to glutamate signaling, affecting dendritic morphology (Srivastava2024Role).

PALMD is also identified as a target of the tumor suppressor gene p53, specifically when p53 is phosphorylated at serine-46. This interaction is crucial for p53's ability to promote apoptosis in response to DNA damage, with PALMD accumulating in the nucleus to induce apoptosis (Dashzeveg2014Palmdelphin).
