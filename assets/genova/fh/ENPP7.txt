# ENPP7

## Overview
ENPP7, or ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 7, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (NPP) family, specifically functioning as an ectoenzyme. The protein, also known as alkaline sphingomyelinase (alk-SMase), is primarily involved in lipid metabolism, where it catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to generate ceramide and sphingosine, key molecules in cellular signaling pathways (Cheng2007Identification). ENPP7 is predominantly active in the intestinal tract and human bile, contributing to the digestion and absorption of dietary fats (Cheng2007Identification). The enzyme's activity is optimal at an alkaline pH, and it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by generating antiproliferative molecules and inactivating proinflammatory agents (Cheng2007Identification). Variations in the expression and function of ENPP7 have been linked to several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, liver cancer, and cholesterol metabolism disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Alyamani2023Alkaline; Zhang2014Alkaline; Cheng2007Identification).

## Structure
ENPP7, or ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 7, is a protein involved in lipid metabolism. It features a catalytic domain characteristic of the ENPP family, which includes a phosphodiesterase domain. This domain is crucial for its enzymatic activity, allowing the protein to participate in the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its stability, localization, and function. ENPP7 is known to exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can result in variations in its structure and potentially its function. These isoforms may differ in the presence or absence of specific domains or sequences, influencing the protein's interaction with other molecules and its role in cellular processes. The precise details of the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ENPP7 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ENPP7, also known as alkaline sphingomyelinase (alk-SMase), is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to produce ceramide and sphingosine. These molecules are significant in cellular signaling, influencing processes such as apoptosis and cell proliferation (Cheng2007Identification). ENPP7 is primarily active in the intestinal tract and human bile, where it contributes to the digestion and absorption of dietary fats (Cheng2007Identification). The enzyme operates optimally at an alkaline pH and is a member of the nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (NPP) family, functioning as an ectoenzyme anchored to the plasma membrane (Cheng2007Identification).

In healthy human cells, ENPP7's activity is associated with the generation of antiproliferative molecules like ceramide, which can inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis, potentially acting as a tumor suppressor (Cheng2007Identification). It also inactivates platelet-activating factor, a proinflammatory molecule, and degrades lysophosphatidylcholine, reducing the formation of lysophosphatidic acid, which is involved in cell migration and angiogenesis (Cheng2007Identification). These functions highlight ENPP7's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in cancer prevention.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ENPP7 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. ENPP7, also known as alkaline sphingomyelinase, plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and immune regulation. Its deficiency or reduced activity has been linked to inflammatory bowel disease and colitis-associated colorectal cancer, as it is involved in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis and has anti-inflammatory effects (Alyamani2023Alkaline). 

In liver cancer, aberrant forms of ENPP7 due to alternative splicing have been identified, leading to reduced enzyme activity. These forms are associated with liver tumorigenesis, suggesting a potential role of ENPP7 as a tumor suppressor (Cheng2007Identification). 

ENPP7 is also implicated in cholesterol metabolism. Its absence in knockout mice results in reduced cholesterol absorption, which may affect lipid-related diseases (Zhang2014Alkaline). 

Additionally, genetic variants near the ENPP7 gene have been associated with type 2 diabetes-attributed end-stage kidney disease in African Americans, indicating a potential role in the pathogenesis of this condition through its impact on cholesterol metabolism (Guan2019Genomewide).
