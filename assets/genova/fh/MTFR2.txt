# MTFR2

## Overview
MTFR2, or mitochondrial fission regulator 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, specifically mitochondrial fission. The protein, also referred to as MTFR2, is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fission process, which is crucial during mitosis. Unlike a receptor, MTFR2 does not directly recruit DRP1 to the mitochondria but instead modulates its activity to ensure proper mitochondrial fragmentation. This regulation is essential for maintaining mitochondrial and cellular integrity, particularly during cell division. MTFR2's function is critical in coordinating mitochondrial fission and chromosome segregation, thereby preventing chromosomal instability. The gene's expression and the protein's activity have been linked to various cancers, where they are associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression, making MTFR2 a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhang2024MTFR2dependent; Luo2020MTFR2).

## Function
MTFR2, also known as DUFD1 or FAM54A, is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial fission, particularly during mitosis. It is primarily localized to mitochondria, as confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis in HeLa cells (Luo2020MTFR2). MTFR2 promotes mitochondrial fission by participating in DRP1-dependent processes, although it does not function as a mitochondrial receptor for DRP1. Instead, it regulates DRP1 activity, which is essential for mitochondrial fragmentation (Luo2020MTFR2).

During mitosis, MTFR2 is phosphorylated, a modification necessary for correcting prolonged mitotic duration and ensuring spindle integrity and chromosomal stability. This phosphorylation is influenced by kinases such as CDK1, AURORA, and PLK1 (Luo2020MTFR2). MTFR2's role in mitochondrial fission is critical for maintaining mitochondrial and cellular integrity, particularly during cell division processes like mitosis (Luo2020MTFR2).

MTFR2's function in healthy cells involves coordinating mitochondrial fission and chromosome segregation, which are vital for proper cell division and preventing chromosomal instability. Its activity is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function, impacting overall cellular health and function (Luo2020MTFR2).

## Clinical Significance
MTFR2 (mitochondrial fission regulator 2) has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), MTFR2 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. Its expression correlates with clinical features such as cancer stage, TP53 mutation status, and smoking history. High MTFR2 levels are linked to poor overall and progression-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in LUAD (Lian2022Prognostic; Chen2021Evaluation).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MTFR2 is overexpressed and promotes tumor progression through mitochondrial fission. It is associated with poor prognosis and increased immune cell infiltration, indicating a role in tumor immune escape and potential responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade therapy (Zhang2024MTFR2dependent).

MTFR2 is also upregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), where it enhances cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by shifting cellular metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. This metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer progression, highlighting MTFR2 as a potential target for metabolism-based therapies in OSCC (Wang2020MTFR2).

## Interactions
MTFR2 (mitochondrial fission regulator 2) is involved in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in promoting mitochondrial fission. It interacts with dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a key protein in the mitochondrial fission process. MTFR2 facilitates DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fission, although it is not required for the recruitment of DRP1 to the mitochondria (Luo2020MTFR2). The interaction between MTFR2 and DRP1 is crucial for the regulation of mitochondrial morphology, as demonstrated by experiments showing that MTFR2 expression leads to mitochondrial hyper-fission, which is abolished when a dominant negative DRP1 construct is co-expressed (Luo2020MTFR2).

In the context of cancer, MTFR2 has been identified as an upstream regulator of DNM1L, the gene encoding DRP1, suggesting that MTFR2 may enhance DRP1 activity to promote mitochondrial fission, which is associated with cancer progression (Zhang2024MTFR2dependent). Although direct physical interactions between MTFR2 and DRP1 are not strongly detected, the functional relationship between these proteins is evident in their co-expression and the impact on mitochondrial dynamics (Luo2020MTFR2). This interaction is particularly significant in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, where MTFR2 and DRP1 are overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis (Zhang2024MTFR2dependent).
