# OR51I2

## Overview
OR51I2 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 51 subfamily I member 2, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals within the olfactory epithelium. As a transmembrane receptor, it binds specific odor molecules and initiates a signal transduction cascade that ultimately leads to the perception of smell (Yin2020Functional). Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR51I2 has been implicated in various tissue-specific coexpression networks, although its precise functions in non-olfactory tissues remain to be fully elucidated (Cava2019Portrait). The gene has also been studied in the context of certain diseases, suggesting potential, albeit not yet fully understood, clinical significance (Nambou2021Weighted; Saeed2023Smell).

## Function
OR51I2 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. OR51I2 is active in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to olfactory transduction by binding specific odorants and initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Yin2020Functional). 

In addition to its role in olfactory transduction, OR51I2 is involved in GPCR downstream signaling pathways, as indicated by its inclusion in tissue-specific coexpression networks in various tissues, such as the fallopian tube (Cava2019Portrait). However, the specific function of OR51I2 in non-olfactory tissues remains unclear, and no known role has been established in the fallopian tube to date (Cava2019Portrait). 

Overall, OR51I2's primary function is associated with the detection of odor molecules, contributing to the complex process of olfactory perception, although its potential roles in other tissues warrant further investigation.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR51I2 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been explored in various studies, though specific clinical implications remain under investigation. In a study on the genetics of schizophrenia in Sudanese families, OR51I2 was identified as having unique variants in a single family, with a rare allele frequency of less than 0.1. This suggests a potential link between OR51I2 variants and schizophrenia, although the study did not provide detailed clinical significance (Saeed2023Smell).

In the context of malaria, OR51I2 was identified as a hub gene in a gene co-expression network associated with cerebral malaria in African children. However, the study did not specify the clinical significance of OR51I2 mutations or expression alterations in relation to malaria (Nambou2021Weighted).

Additionally, OR51I2 was mentioned in a study on combined D-2-and L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, a neurometabolic disorder, but the study primarily focused on the SLC25A1 gene, leaving the clinical implications of OR51I2 unclear (Nota2013Deficiency). Overall, while OR51I2 has been identified in various genetic studies, its specific clinical significance requires further research.
