# JPT1

## Overview
JPT1 (Jupiter microtubule associated homolog 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation and stabilization of microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. The protein encoded by JPT1 is crucial for maintaining cellular structure, facilitating intracellular transport, and ensuring accurate cell division. It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it associates with the microtubule network, playing a significant role in cellular integrity and function. JPT1's involvement in microtubule dynamics is vital for processes such as maintaining cell shape, intracellular trafficking, and chromosome segregation during mitosis. Beyond its fundamental cellular roles, JPT1 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in prostate cancer, where it influences glycolysis and radiosensitivity through interactions with microRNAs and circular RNAs (Chen2023Circular).

## Function
JPT1 (Jupiter microtubule associated homolog 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the stabilization and organization of microtubules within cells. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining cell structure, facilitating intracellular transport, and ensuring proper cell division. JPT1 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with the microtubule network, contributing to cellular integrity and function. The protein's involvement in microtubule dynamics is essential for various cellular processes, including the maintenance of cell shape, intracellular trafficking, and the segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. These functions are vital for the proper functioning and survival of cells, impacting overall organismal health by ensuring that cells can divide correctly and maintain their structural integrity. The specific role of JPT1 in healthy human cells is not detailed in the provided context, but its general functions in microtubule stabilization suggest its importance in cellular homeostasis and normal physiological processes. The context does not provide additional specific information about JPT1's function in healthy human cells beyond its role in microtubule dynamics (Chen2023Circular).

## Clinical Significance
JPT1 has been implicated in the progression of prostate cancer (PCa) through its role in glycolysis and radiosensitivity. Alterations in JPT1 expression levels are associated with cancer progression, as its mRNA is upregulated in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. This upregulation is negatively correlated with the levels of miR-513b-5p, a microRNA that targets JPT1. Inhibition of JPT1 in PCa cells results in suppressed cell growth and glycolysis, along with increased radiosensitivity, suggesting that JPT1 contributes to cancer cell survival and resistance to radiation therapy (Chen2023Circular). Conversely, overexpression of JPT1 can reverse the effects of downregulated circLPAR3 or upregulated miR-513b-5p, promoting cancer cell growth and glycolysis while reducing radiosensitivity (Chen2023Circular).

The interaction between circLPAR3 and JPT1, mediated by miR-513b-5p, is crucial in PCa progression. Elevated levels of circLPAR3, which targets JPT1, are linked to poor prognosis in PCa patients, including higher Gleason scores and advanced pathological stages (Chen2023Circular). These findings suggest that JPT1 could be a potential target for therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing radiosensitivity and inhibiting cancer cell growth in prostate cancer.

## Interactions
JPT1 (Jupiter microtubule associated homolog 1) is involved in interactions with microRNAs and circular RNAs that influence its expression and function in prostate cancer cells. JPT1 is a direct target of microRNA-513b-5p (miR-513b-5p), which binds to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of JPT1, leading to reduced expression of the JPT1 protein. This interaction was confirmed through experiments showing decreased luciferase activity in the presence of miR-513b-5p, indicating direct binding (Chen2023Circular).

JPT1 is also part of a regulatory axis involving circular RNA LPAR3 (circLPAR3) and miR-513b-5p. CircLPAR3 acts as a molecular sponge for miR-513b-5p, thereby modulating the availability of miR-513b-5p to interact with JPT1. This interaction affects glycolytic activation and radiosensitivity in prostate cancer cells. The knockdown of circLPAR3 reduces glycolysis and enhances radiosensitivity through the miR-513b-5p/JPT1 axis, highlighting the role of JPT1 in these processes (Chen2023Circular).

Elevated levels of JPT1 can reverse the effects of circLPAR3 knockdown or miR-513b-5p overexpression, suggesting that JPT1 is a critical component in the pathway regulated by these molecules (Chen2023Circular).
