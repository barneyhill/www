# FAM162A

## Overview
FAM162A is a gene that encodes the protein family with sequence similarity 162 member A, which is primarily localized in the mitochondria. This protein is categorized as a pro-apoptotic factor, playing a crucial role in the regulation of apoptosis, particularly under hypoxic conditions. It is involved in mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, potentially influencing mitochondrial permeability and integrity (Schuhmann2024Integrative; Do2017Hypoxic). The expression of FAM162A is upregulated in response to cellular stress, such as hypoxia, and is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders (Do2017Hypoxic; Liu2020Construction). Despite its recognized involvement in apoptosis and disease, the precise molecular mechanisms and interactions of FAM162A remain an active area of research (Schuhmann2024Integrative).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
FAM162A is implicated in various diseases, primarily through its role in apoptosis and cellular stress responses. In glioma cells, the inhibition of IRE1, a key enzyme in the unfolded protein response, leads to the up-regulation of FAM162A, which contributes to the suppression of cell proliferation and tumor growth by activating mitochondrial apoptotic cascades (Do2017Hypoxic). In ovarian cancer, high expression levels of FAM162A are associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Liu2020Construction). Similarly, in osteosarcoma, FAM162A is identified as a risk gene, with its expression linked to increased mortality and tumor metastasis (Huang2022Identification).

In neurological contexts, overexpression of FAM162A can lead to brain injury by activating caspase-3, which induces apoptosis and chromatin condensation, contributing to ischemia and hypoxia (Liu2020Construction). In pediatric acute myeloid leukemia, higher expression levels of FAM162A are associated with increased sensitivity to the drug Ara C, indicating its potential role in drug response (Cucchi2020Harnessing). Despite these associations, the specific mechanisms by which FAM162A influences these conditions remain under investigation, highlighting the need for further research to fully understand its clinical significance.

## Interactions
FAM162A is a mitochondrial protein with a significant interaction landscape, particularly within the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). It is closely associated with cristae proteins, as evidenced by its high cristae/IBM interaction ratio, suggesting a potential localization in the cristae (Schuhmann2024Integrative). The protein is speculated to be involved in apoptotic processes and maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity, although its exact function remains unknown (Schuhmann2024Integrative).

FAM162A is also known as a pro-apoptotic protein that may induce mitochondrial permeability transition, contributing to the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic cascades (Do2017Hypoxic). It is responsive to hypoxic conditions and is involved in hypoxia-induced apoptosis, potentially through caspase-3 activation and chromatin condensation (Liu2020Construction; Mazzio2012Whole). In the context of hypoxia, FAM162A expression is upregulated, which may suppress glioma cell proliferation and tumor growth (Do2017Hypoxic).

While specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, FAM162A's role in apoptosis and mitochondrial function suggests it may participate in multiprotein complexes or transient interactions influencing cellular stress responses (Schuhmann2024Integrative; Do2017Hypoxic).
