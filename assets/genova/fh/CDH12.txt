# CDH12

## Overview
CDH12 is a gene that encodes cadherin-12, a type II classical cadherin protein that plays a pivotal role in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. As a member of the cadherin superfamily, cadherin-12 is characterized by its five extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a conserved cytoplasmic domain, which collectively facilitate its function in cellular adhesion and communication (Charfeddine2020Identification). Predominantly expressed in the nervous system, cadherin-12 is crucial for neural development, influencing processes such as neurite outgrowth and synaptic formation (Guo2021Cadherin12; Mayer2010Expression). Beyond its developmental roles, CDH12 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and chemoresistance (Wang2023Chemotherapyinduced; Ma2016Cadherin12). The gene's involvement in both physiological and pathological processes underscores its significance in maintaining tissue integrity and cellular dynamics.

## Structure
The CDH12 gene encodes cadherin-12, a type II classical cadherin and member of the calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion cadherin superfamily. The molecular structure of cadherin-12 includes five extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, spanning amino acids 1-609, which are responsible for cadherin-cadherin interactions (Charfeddine2020Identification). These EC repeats are crucial for the protein's role in cell adhesion, as they facilitate calcium-dependent adhesive interactions (Charfeddine2020Identification). The protein also contains a transmembrane domain from amino acids 610-637 and a conserved cytoplasmic domain from amino acids 638-794, which interacts with catenins to link cadherins to the actin-based cytoskeleton (Charfeddine2020Identification).

The extracellular domain of cadherin-12 was modeled using the Robetta server, and its quality was validated with a Z-score of -8.04 from the ProSA server, indicating it is within the range of scores for experimental protein structures of similar size (Charfeddine2020Identification). The protein's structure is involved in pathways related to cell-cell adhesion and junction organization, and it interacts with other members of the cadherin superfamily (Charfeddine2020Identification).

## Function
The CDH12 gene encodes Cadherin-12, a type II classical cadherin involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue integrity and cellular communication, particularly in the nervous system. CDH12 is prominently expressed in the brain, where it is involved in neural development processes such as neurite outgrowth, axonal extension, and synaptic formation (Guo2021Cadherin12; Mayer2010Expression).

In cortical neurons, CDH12 regulates neurite outgrowth through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, which involves the phosphorylation of CREB, a transcription factor associated with axon growth. The protein also interacts with Rac1 and Cdc42, Rho family GTPases, to stimulate lamellipodium and filopodium formation, essential for axon elongation (Guo2021Cadherin12). Knockdown of CDH12 expression has been shown to inhibit axonal growth, highlighting its importance in promoting axonal development (Guo2021Cadherin12).

CDH12 is expressed in various regions of the brain, including the hippocampus and cortex, where it is found in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. Its expression in specific neuron types suggests a role in cell adhesion and differentiation, potentially influencing neural circuit formation and function (Mayer2010Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CDH12 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), CDH12 is expressed at higher levels in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, correlating with increased tumor invasion depth and poor prognosis. CDH12 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by targeting the transcription factor Snail, enhancing CRC cell proliferation and migration, suggesting its role as an oncogene in CRC (Zhao2013Cadherin12; Ma2016Cadherin12). 

In breast cancer, CDH12 is upregulated in cells that survive chemotherapy, contributing to increased malignancy through the ERK/CREB signaling pathway. This upregulation is associated with enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and chemoresistance, indicating that CDH12 plays a critical role in cancer progression and poor prognosis (Wang2023Chemotherapyinduced).

A novel heterozygous variant in CDH12 has been identified in a Tunisian family with an autosomal dominant form of transgrediens and progrediens palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK). This mutation is predicted to decrease protein stability, affecting cell-cell adhesion in skin tissues, and is associated with keratinocyte hyperproliferation (Charfeddine2020Identification).

## Interactions
CDH12, or cadherin 12, is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly within the cadherin superfamily. It interacts with various members such as CDH1, CDH7, CDH18, CDH9, CDH17, CTNNB1, CTNND1, and CDH24, which are involved in pathways related to cell-cell adhesion, adherens junctions, and cell-cell junction organization (Charfeddine2020Identification). CDH12 directly interacts with the JUP protein, which is expressed in the skin and plays a role in desmosome organization within adherens junctions (Charfeddine2020Identification).

In the context of neuronal development, CDH12 is implicated in regulating neurite outgrowth through the cAMP/PKA/Rac1/Cdc42 pathway in cortical neurons. Knockdown of CDH12 leads to reduced phosphorylation of CREB, a key transcription factor in this pathway, and affects Rac1/Cdc42 activity, which is crucial for neurite outgrowth (Guo2021Cadherin12). This suggests that CDH12's interactions are significant for cytoskeleton remodeling and neuronal growth (Guo2021Cadherin12).

While CDH12's role in cancer progression is noted, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed in the provided excerpts (Oldak2023Development).
