# EHHADH

## Overview
EHHADH is a gene that encodes the bifunctional enzyme enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which plays a pivotal role in the peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acids. This enzyme is crucial for the metabolism of long-chain dicarboxylic acids and very long-chain fatty acids, facilitating their breakdown into energy-rich compounds. The EHHADH protein is primarily active in the liver and kidney, where it contributes significantly to energy metabolism and lipid homeostasis. As a bifunctional enzyme, it possesses both hydratase and dehydrogenase activities, enabling it to catalyze consecutive steps in the β-oxidation pathway. EHHADH's function is essential for preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolic intermediates, which can lead to hepatic toxicity if not properly managed (RaneaRobles2023The; Houten2012Peroxisomal). The enzyme's activity is particularly important during fasting, when it aids in energy production by metabolizing medium-chain dicarboxylic acids (Houten2012Peroxisomal).

## Structure
The EHHADH protein is a bifunctional enzyme involved in fatty acid metabolism, characterized by its enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities. Its primary structure is composed of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the EHHADH gene. The secondary structure of EHHADH includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to its functional conformation. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a specific three-dimensional shape, essential for its enzymatic activities.

EHHADH may form quaternary structures through dimerization or oligomerization, which can influence its stability and function. The protein contains distinct domains, such as the hydratase and dehydrogenase domains, which are crucial for its bifunctional enzymatic roles. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can occur, potentially affecting the enzyme's activity and regulation.

Splice variant isoforms of EHHADH may exist, leading to alterations in its structure and function. These isoforms can result in variations in the enzyme's activity, localization, or interaction with other cellular components, thereby influencing metabolic pathways in which EHHADH is involved.

## Function
The EHHADH gene encodes a bifunctional enzyme that plays a critical role in the peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acids, particularly long-chain dicarboxylic acids (DCAs) and very long-chain fatty acids. This enzyme is involved in the second and third steps of the β-oxidation pathway, catalyzing the hydration of enoyl-CoA to 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA and the subsequent dehydrogenation to 3-ketoacyl-CoA (RaneaRobles2023The; Houten2012Peroxisomal). EHHADH is primarily active in the liver and kidney, where it is highly expressed and plays a significant role in energy metabolism and lipid homeostasis (Forst2021Distinct; RaneaRobles2023The).

In healthy human cells, EHHADH functions within peroxisomes, contributing to the breakdown of fatty acids, which is essential for energy production and maintaining normal cellular energy levels (Forst2021Distinct). The enzyme is part of a coordinated metabolic network that includes other genes involved in fatty acid ω-oxidation and DCA β-oxidation (RaneaRobles2023The). EHHADH's activity is crucial for preventing the accumulation of toxic intermediates, which can lead to hepatic toxicity if not properly metabolized (RaneaRobles2023The). The enzyme's role in fatty acid metabolism is particularly important during fasting, when it helps produce medium-chain DCAs, contributing to energy generation (Houten2012Peroxisomal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the EHHADH gene have significant clinical implications. EHHADH deficiency is linked to diabetic kidney disease (DKD), where its downregulation exacerbates tubulointerstitial injury. This deficiency leads to increased pexophagy, resulting in the loss of peroxisomes in renal tubular epithelial cells, contributing to kidney damage under diabetic conditions (Kan2024EHHADH). 

In the context of metabolic disorders, EHHADH deficiency in mice causes medium-chain 3-hydroxydicarboxylic aciduria and disrupts hepatic cholesterol homeostasis. This condition is characterized by increased expression of cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes and potential hepatic toxicity, particularly when mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation is inhibited (RaneaRobles2021Murine).

EHHADH mutations are also implicated in renal Fanconi's syndrome, where a specific mutation (p.E3K) leads to the mistargeting of the enzyme to mitochondria, disrupting mitochondrial function and impairing proximal tubular function. This mutation results in decreased oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis, although it does not cause progressive renal or liver dysfunction (Forst2021Distinct).

In bladder cancer, EHHADH expression is associated with cisplatin resistance. Knockdown of EHHADH can increase sensitivity to cisplatin, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in overcoming drug resistance (Okamura2021EHHADH).

## Interactions
EHHADH, a bifunctional enzyme involved in peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation, participates in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in lipid metabolism. It is known to interact with other proteins such as HADHA and ACAT1, which are involved in similar metabolic pathways, indicating its significant role in maintaining normal liver metabolism (Letian2020Protein). EHHADH also interacts with HSD17B4, another enzyme in the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway. These interactions suggest a functional redundancy between EHHADH and HSD17B4, as EHHADH can partially compensate for the loss of HSD17B4 in the oxidation of certain fatty acids (RaneaRobles2021Murine).

In the context of diabetic kidney disease, EHHADH is involved in the regulation of pexophagy, a selective autophagy process targeting peroxisomes. The protein interacts with NBR1, an autophagic receptor necessary for EHHADH-mediated pexophagy. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination of peroxisomal membrane proteins, which facilitates their degradation (Kan2024EHHADH). These interactions highlight EHHADH's role in both peroxisomal function and broader metabolic processes, impacting conditions such as fatty liver disease and diabetic nephropathy.
