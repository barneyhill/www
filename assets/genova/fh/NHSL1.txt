# NHSL1

## Overview
The NHSL1 gene encodes the Nance-Horan Syndrome-like 1 protein, which is a member of the Nance-Horan Syndrome (NHS) protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, playing a crucial role in cell migration and lamellipodia stability. NHSL1 functions as a negative regulator of the Scar/WAVE complex, influencing actin polymerization and cell motility by interacting with various components of the complex, including the Abi subunit and active Rac1. The protein's interactions are essential for modulating cell migration speed and persistence, with its activity localized at the leading edge of cells. NHSL1 also forms part of the WAVE Shell Complex (WSC), where it replaces the WAVE subunit, further contributing to its regulatory functions in cell migration (Law2020Nance-Horan; Wang2023PPP2R1A).

## Structure
The NHSL1 protein is part of the Nance-Horan Syndrome (NHS) protein family and contains a WAVE Homology Domain (WHD) at its N-terminus, which is similar to domains found in WAVE proteins. This domain is crucial for interactions with other proteins involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Brooks2010The; Wang2023PPP2R1A). NHSL1 interacts with the WAVE Shell Complex (WSC), where it replaces the WAVE subunit, forming a complex with other subunits such as CYFIP1, NCKAP1, ABI1, and BRK1 (Wang2022PPP2R1A; Wang2023PPP2R1A).

NHSL1 has been identified to have novel isoforms, X15 and X16, discovered through a proteogenomics approach. Isoform X15 includes a novel N-terminal sequence of 96 amino acids, while isoform X16 is similar but lacks one coding sequence (CDS) region (He2021Proteogenomics). These isoforms are evolutionarily conserved, indicating their potential functional significance (He2021Proteogenomics).

The NHSL1 protein also contains specific motifs that interact with the PPP2R1A protein, influencing cell migration persistence. These interactions are crucial for maintaining cell migration and actin polymerization, independent of PP2A phosphatase activity (Wang2023PPP2R1A).

## Function
The NHSL1 gene encodes the Nance-Horan Syndrome-like 1 protein, which plays a significant role in regulating cell migration and lamellipodia stability in healthy human cells. NHSL1 functions as a negative regulator of the Scar/WAVE complex, which is crucial for actin cytoskeleton dynamics and lamellipodia formation. By interacting with the Scar/WAVE complex through the SH3 domain of the Abi protein, NHSL1 reduces Arp2/3 activity, leading to decreased F-actin density in lamellipodia and impairing their stability. This regulation is essential for controlling cell migration speed and persistence (Law2020Nance-Horan).

NHSL1 is also involved in a Rac-NHSL1-Scar/WAVE-Arp2/3 pathway, interacting with active Rac at the leading edge of cells. This interaction suggests a role in modulating actin polymerization and cell motility (Law2020Nance-Horan). NHSL1's regulatory function is important for maintaining proper cell movement and structure, as evidenced by increased cell migration speed and persistence in NHSL1 knockout cells (Law2020Nance-Horan). The protein's activity is primarily localized at the edge of lamellipodia, where it co-localizes with other proteins involved in cell migration (Law2020Nance-Horan).

## Interactions
The NHSL1 protein interacts with several components of the Scar/WAVE complex, which is crucial for actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration. NHSL1 binds to the Abi subunit of the Scar/WAVE complex through the SH3 domain of Abi, a critical interaction for regulating cell migration. This interaction was confirmed through immunoprecipitation and GST-pulldown experiments, and mutations in the SH3 binding sites of NHSL1 can disrupt this interaction, affecting the function of the Scar/WAVE complex (Law2020Nance-Horan).

NHSL1 also interacts with active Rac1, a regulator of lamellipodia formation, through specific regions located at amino acids 410-563 and 946-1099. This interaction recruits NHSL1 to the leading edge of cells, where it co-localizes with the Scar/WAVE complex (Law2020Nance-Horan).

In addition to its role in the Scar/WAVE complex, NHSL1 is part of an alternative complex known as the WAVE Shell Complex (WSC), where it replaces the WAVE subunit. This complex includes interactions with CYFIP1, NCKAP1, ABI1, and BRK1, and is involved in regulating cell migration persistence (Wang2023PPP2R1A). NHSL1's interaction with PPP2R1A within the WSC is crucial for migration persistence, with NHSL1 acting as a negative regulator (Wang2023PPP2R1A).
