# GNG11

## Overview
GNG11 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit gamma 11, a component of heterotrimeric G-proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction. These proteins play a critical role in transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to various intracellular pathways, influencing cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The G protein subunit gamma 11 is categorized as a signaling protein and is predominantly active at the cell membrane, where it interacts with other G-protein subunits to facilitate signal transduction (Hossain2006Gprotein). GNG11 is expressed in most human tissues, excluding the brain, and is implicated in cellular senescence, a process that contributes to aging and cancer development (Hossain2006Gprotein). The gene's expression and regulation are linked to various clinical conditions, including several types of cancer, where its altered expression can influence disease progression and treatment outcomes (Zhang2019Evaluation; Haouas2010Identification).

## Function
The GNG11 gene encodes a gamma subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins, which are crucial for transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to intracellular effectors. In healthy human cells, GNG11 is involved in various signaling pathways that influence cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is active in the cell membrane, where it plays a role in regulating signal transduction (Hossain2006Gprotein).

GNG11 is expressed in all tissues except the brain and is modified by a farnesyl group, suggesting a unique role beneath the membrane (Hossain2006Gprotein). It forms a complex with the G β1 subunit and shuttles between the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus (Takauji2017GNG11). The gene is rapidly induced by senescence-inducing agents like hydrogen peroxide and activates ERK1/2 of the MAP kinase family, although it does not activate Ras, indicating its involvement in a novel senescence pathway (Hossain2006Gprotein).

GNG11's expression is linked to the induction of senescence-associated genes, and its overexpression in normal human fibroblasts leads to premature senescence, characterized by growth arrest and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining (Hossain2006Gprotein). This suggests that GNG11 is directly involved in controlling cellular lifespan and proliferation potential.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GNG11 gene have been associated with various cancers. In leukemia, GNG11 expression is significantly downregulated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and chronic leukemia (CL) compared to healthy individuals. This downregulation is significant across these leukemia types, although it does not distinguish between them (Haouas2010Identification).

In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), GNG11 is part of a ten-gene signature predictive of chemotherapy response. Its downregulation is linked to chemotherapy resistance, suggesting a role in the tumor microenvironment and cellular senescence (Buttarelli2022Identification). In serous epithelial ovarian cancer, high expression levels of GNG11 correlate with poor overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhang2019Evaluation).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), GNG11 is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transformation, contributing to cancer invasion and metastasis (Zhang2020ABCC9). Additionally, in gastric cancer, altered expression of GNG11 is associated with different tumor stages and survival outcomes, highlighting its potential role in prognosis (Li2020Identification).

## Interactions
GNG11, a G-protein γ subunit, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It forms a complex with the G β1 subunit, which allows it to shuttle between the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus (Takauji2017GNG11). This interaction is crucial for its role in signal transduction as part of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex, which includes α, β, and γ subunits. GNG11 is also involved in the mTOR signaling pathway in bovine mammary epithelial cells, where it is targeted by alfalfa xenomiR-162. This interaction occurs at the nucleic acid level, where xenomiR-162 binds to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of GNG11 mRNA, leading to its downregulation (Meng2024Alfalfa).

In human cells, GNG11 has been shown to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which is associated with growth suppression and abnormal nuclear morphology in SUSM-1 cells. This effect is linked to the downregulation of antioxidant enzymes and differential expression of NOX enzymes, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Takauji2017GNG11). Despite its involvement in these processes, specific physical interactions of GNG11 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond these regulatory interactions are not extensively documented in the provided context.
