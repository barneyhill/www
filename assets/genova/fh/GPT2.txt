# GPT2

## Overview
The GPT2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme glutamic--pyruvic transaminase 2, which is a key player in cellular metabolism. This enzyme is classified as a transaminase and is involved in the reversible transfer of amino groups, facilitating the conversion of glutamate and pyruvate into alanine and alpha-ketoglutarate. This reaction is pivotal for integrating amino acid metabolism with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glycolysis, thereby influencing broader metabolic pathways such as nucleotide metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway (Baytas2021Mitochondrial). The enzyme is particularly vital in neurons, where it supports energy production and protein biosynthesis, and is crucial for neuron growth and motor function (Baytas2021Mitochondrial). Mutations in the GPT2 gene are linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its importance in normal neurological development (Ouyang2019GPT2; Kaymakcalan2017Novel).

## Function
The GPT2 gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme known as glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2, which plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible transfer of an amino group from glutamate to pyruvate, resulting in the production of alanine and alpha-ketoglutarate. This reaction is essential for linking amino acid metabolism to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glycolysis, impacting broader metabolic networks such as nucleotide metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway (Baytas2021Mitochondrial).

In neurons, GPT2 is particularly important for synthesizing alanine from glucose or glutamine, supporting the TCA cycle, and maintaining energy production and protein biosynthesis. The enzyme's activity is crucial for neuron growth and motor function, as evidenced by the significant metabolic changes observed in Gpt2-null neurons, which show reduced enrichment of TCA cycle intermediates and increased apoptotic cell death without exogenous alanine (Baytas2021Mitochondrial).

GPT2 is more abundant in neurons compared to astrocytes, highlighting its critical role in neuronal metabolism. Its expression is upregulated during periods of high biosynthetic demand, such as postnatal brain development, indicating its importance in supporting neuronal growth and function (Baytas2021Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GPT2 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. These include intellectual and developmental disability (IDD), microcephaly, spastic paraplegia, and epilepsy. Specific mutations, such as homozygous and compound heterozygous variants, have been identified in affected individuals, leading to severe developmental delays and neurological symptoms (Ouyang2019GPT2; Hengel2018GPT2; Kaymakcalan2017Novel). 

In particular, a study on a consanguineous Turkish family identified novel compound heterozygous mutations in GPT2, linked to microcephaly and IDD, with some family members also experiencing spastic paraplegia and epilepsy (Kaymakcalan2017Novel). Another study found a loss of function mutation in GPT2 causing developmental encephalopathy, highlighting the gene's critical role in normal neurological development (Celis2015Loss).

The prevalence of GPT2 mutations is notably higher in certain populations, such as a Pakistani cohort, suggesting a significant role for this genetic syndrome in specific demographic groups (Ouyang2019GPT2). These mutations often result in impaired enzymatic activity, affecting neurotransmitter metabolism and potentially leading to various neurological and developmental disorders (LoboPrada2017A).
