# BMP7

## Overview
Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) is a protein encoded by the BMP7 gene, which is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including bone formation, kidney development, and immune system regulation. BMP7 is synthesized as a precursor protein that undergoes proteolytic processing to yield a mature glycoprotein, which functions primarily as a growth factor. It is characterized by its ability to form homodimers and heterodimers, which are essential for its biological activity (Wozney2002Overview; Aluganti2020The). The protein interacts with specific receptors to activate signaling pathways that regulate cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. BMP7's involvement in osteogenesis and its regulatory role in immune responses highlight its therapeutic potential in treating bone-related disorders and inflammatory diseases (Yasmin2013Identification; Sampath1992Recombinant). Additionally, BMP7's clinical significance is underscored by its protective effects in renal and cardiovascular diseases, as well as its implications in developmental abnormalities (Wang2014Bone; Aluganti2020The).

## Structure
BMP7 is synthesized as a pro-protein consisting of 431 amino acids, which includes an N-terminal signal peptide of 29 amino acids, a pro-peptide of 263 amino acids, and a mature peptide of 139 amino acids (Aluganti2020The). The mature BMP7 is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 35 kDa and features three N-glycosylation sites (Aluganti2020The). It contains seven cysteine residues that form three intramolecular disulfide bonds (Cys38-104, Cys67-136, and Cys71-138), contributing to its tertiary structure (Aluganti2020The). An intermolecular disulfide bond via the 103rd cysteine allows BMP7 to form dimers, which is crucial for its biological activity (Aluganti2020The).

In terms of quaternary structure, BMP7 can form both homodimers and heterodimers, particularly with BMP-2 and BMP-4, with heterodimers being more potent in osteogenic differentiation assays (Wozney2002Overview; Aluganti2020The). The protein is part of the TGF-beta superfamily and contains a cystine knot motif, which is a common structural feature in this family (Wozney2002Overview). The presence of disulfide bonds contributes to the stability and dimerization of BMP7, which is essential for its function (Wozney2002Overview).

## Function
Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) is a member of the TGF-β superfamily and plays a critical role in bone formation and osteoblast function. BMP7 is capable of inducing new bone formation in vivo and stimulating osteoblast proliferation and differentiation in vitro. It enhances cell growth, collagen synthesis, and the expression of osteoblast markers such as alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and parathyroid hormone-mediated cAMP production. BMP7 also increases mineralization in long-term osteoblast cultures, promoting the commitment of stem cells to osteoblastic lineages (Sampath1992Recombinant).

In addition to its role in bone biology, BMP7 is involved in the differentiation of Langerhans cells (LCs) in the human epidermis. It induces LC differentiation and proliferation by activating the ALK3 signaling pathway, part of the canonical BMP signaling pathway. This process occurs independently of TGF-β1 signaling, which is crucial for maintaining LC networks after birth. BMP7-generated LCs are potent inducers of T cell proliferation, which may be useful for inducing strong antiviral or antitumor T cell responses (Yasmin2013Identification).

BMP7's activity is enhanced by interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is necessary for osteoblast-specific gene expression and differentiation. The ECM facilitates BMP7's receptor activation, and the MAPK signaling pathway is essential for the BMP7-dependent induction of gene expression (Xiao2002Bone).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the BMP7 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of kidney development and disease, BMP7 is crucial for maintaining nephron progenitor cells and preventing premature differentiation. Mice lacking BMP7 exhibit severe kidney defects, highlighting its role in nephron proliferation and protection against chronic kidney disease (CKD) by reducing renal fibrosis and nephrocyte apoptosis (Tsujimura2016Roles; Wang2014Bone). BMP7's protective effects extend to reducing inflammation and apoptosis in renal diseases, where it inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and prevents monocyte attachment to tubular cells (Gould2002BMP7; Meng2012Role).

In cardiovascular diseases, BMP7 is under investigation for its potential to convert pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages into anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, which may reduce cardiac dysfunction (Aluganti2020The). BMP7 is also linked to urethral development, where mutations can lead to hypospadias, a condition affecting urethral development (Morgan2003Loss). Additionally, BMP7 deletion is associated with osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone mineral density and increased fracture risk (Aluganti2020The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of BMP7 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
BMP7 interacts with various proteins, particularly through its growth factor domain (gfd) and prodomain (pd). It forms complexes with type II receptors such as BMPRII and ActRIIA, which can displace the prodomain to bind the gfd, facilitating activation of signaling pathways (Sengle2008A). Type I receptors, like BMPRIA, interact differently, as they do not displace the prodomain (Sengle2008A). The prodomain of BMP7 also plays a role in targeting the BMP7 complex to the extracellular matrix by binding to fibrillin-1, a component of the matrix, which is crucial for its stability and solubility (Gregory2005The).

BMP7's interactions extend to antagonists such as Gremlin-1 and Noggin, which regulate its activity. These antagonists bind to BMP7, affecting its signaling capabilities. Gremlin-1, for instance, forms a complex with BMP7, which can be destabilized by specific mutations, impacting the interaction's stability and potentially influencing glioblastoma progression (Choudhuri2020Structural). These interactions highlight BMP7's role in cellular processes and its regulation by various proteins in the extracellular environment.
