# ORC1

## Overview
The ORC1 gene encodes the origin recognition complex subunit 1, a pivotal protein involved in the initiation of DNA replication. As a component of the origin recognition complex (ORC), ORC1 plays a crucial role in the early stages of DNA replication by binding to chromatin and facilitating the recruitment of other ORC subunits and mini-chromosome maintenance proteins to form the pre-replication complex. The protein is characterized by several domains, including a AAA+ ATPase domain and a C-terminal winged helix domain, which are essential for its ATPase activity and DNA binding capabilities, respectively (Gaudier2007Structural). ORC1 is also involved in various protein interactions that regulate its stability and function throughout the cell cycle, such as its interactions with CDC6, cyclin A-CDK2, and protein phosphatase PP1 (Hossain2021Multiple). Clinically, mutations in the ORC1 gene are linked to Meier-Gorlin syndrome, a disorder characterized by growth retardation and skeletal abnormalities, highlighting its significance in cell proliferation and development (Schmit2021Congenital; de2015MeierGorlin).

## Structure
The ORC1 protein is a key component of the origin recognition complex (ORC) involved in DNA replication initiation. Structurally, ORC1 contains several distinct domains, including a AAA+ ATPase domain and a C-terminal winged helix (WH) domain. The AAA+ domain is crucial for ATPase activity, which is essential for DNA binding and replication initiation (Gaudier2007Structural). The WH domain is responsible for DNA binding, interacting with DNA at replication origins by inserting into the major and minor grooves, causing the DNA to bend and unwind (Gaudier2007Structural).

In yeast, the N-terminal region of ORC1 includes a bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) domain, which is involved in transcriptional silencing and chromatin interactions. This domain forms a core structure of beta-strands and a helical domain, which is crucial for binding to Sir proteins and targeting them to silent chromatin domains (Zhang2002Structure). The BAH domain also interacts with nucleosomes, forming extensive contacts with histones, which are important for chromatin organization and gene regulation (De2019Structure).

ORC1 can form complexes with other ORC subunits, contributing to its quaternary structure. It also interacts with Cyclin A through a specific binding motif, which is important for regulating DNA replication (Wang2019Structural).

## Function
The ORC1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the origin recognition complex (ORC), which is essential for the initiation of DNA replication in human cells. ORC1 is the first subunit to bind to chromatin, beginning in early mitosis, and its levels increase as cells progress through mitosis, peaking during the G1 phase (Kara2015Orc1). This binding is crucial for the recruitment of other ORC subunits and the mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins onto chromatin, forming the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) necessary for DNA replication initiation (Ohta2003The; Kara2015Orc1).

ORC1's presence on chromatin is regulated throughout the cell cycle, with its levels oscillating; it accumulates during the G1 phase and is degraded in the S phase (Ohta2003The). This dynamic regulation is essential for the proper timing and order of origin firing, influencing the initiation of DNA replication (Ohta2003The). ORC1 also plays a role in centrosome regulation, where its depletion leads to centriole and centrosome re-duplication, indicating its function as an inhibitor of centrosome re-duplication (Hemerly2009Orc1). The expression of ORC1 is controlled by the E2F transcription factor, linking its activity to cell proliferation and growth (Ohtani1996Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ORC1 gene are primarily associated with Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by primordial dwarfism, microtia (small ears), and patellar aplasia or hypoplasia. These mutations impair the function of the pre-replication complex, crucial for DNA replication, leading to reduced cell proliferation and growth retardation (Schmit2021Congenital; de2015MeierGorlin). ORC1 mutations can result in severe short stature and microcephaly, with compound heterozygous missense and loss-of-function mutations having a more severe impact than homozygous missense mutations (de2015MeierGorlin).

ORC1 mutations also affect cilia formation and function, contributing to the clinical manifestations of MGS. Deficiencies in ORC1 lead to abnormalities in centrosome and centriole numbers and impaired cilia formation, which affects cellular signaling pathways such as sonic hedgehog and PDGF-mediated pathways (Stiff2013Deficiency). These defects in cilia formation and function may also impact neurogenesis and chondrogenesis, contributing to features like microcephaly and skeletal abnormalities (Stiff2013Deficiency).

Additionally, specific ORC1 mutations, such as R105Q, disrupt the inhibition of cyclin E-CDK2 kinase, leading to issues like reduplication of centrioles and slower cell proliferation, further contributing to the growth defects observed in MGS (Shen2013The).

## Interactions
The ORC1 protein is involved in several critical interactions during the initiation of DNA replication. It directly binds to CDC6, a key interaction that occurs during the mid-G1 phase and early S phase of the cell cycle. This interaction is ATP-dependent and involves specific domains within both proteins, including the Cy motif in ORC1's intrinsically disordered region (IDR) (Hossain2021Multiple). ORC1 also interacts with cyclin A-CDK2 and SKP2, which are involved in its degradation. The Cy motif of ORC1 is crucial for binding to cyclin A and SCF SKP2, regulating ORC1 protein levels (Hossain2021Multiple).

ORC1's interaction with protein phosphatase PP1 is mediated by the RVxF motif, which controls ORC1 phosphorylation and stability. This interaction is essential for the dephosphorylation of ORC1, affecting its chromatin association (Hossain2021Multiple). ORC1 also forms complexes with cyclin E-CDK2, which can remove the retinoblastoma protein from the ORC1-CDC6 complex (Hossain2021Multiple).

In addition to protein interactions, ORC1 is involved in liquid-liquid phase separation with CDC6 in the presence of DNA, forming liquid droplets that may play a role in regulating ORC1 levels and function (Hossain2021Multiple).
