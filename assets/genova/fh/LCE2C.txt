# LCE2C

## Overview
LCE2C, or late cornified envelope 2C, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is integral to the formation of the cornified envelope in the epidermis. This protein is categorized as a structural component of the epidermal barrier, playing a crucial role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes and contributing to the skin's protective functions. The LCE2C protein is predominantly expressed in the upper layers of the epidermis, specifically the granular layer and the stratum corneum, where it aids in maintaining skin integrity and defense against environmental insults, including pathogens (Niehues2016Late). The gene is part of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) on chromosome 1q21, which is activated during epidermal differentiation (Tomimatsu2020Locusspecific). LCE2C's expression is modulated by various factors, including cytokines and environmental stimuli, underscoring its dynamic role in skin health and disease (Niehues2016Late).

## Structure


## Function
LCE2C (late cornified envelope 2C) is a protein involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a critical component of the epidermal barrier in human skin. This protein is primarily expressed in the uppermost granular layer and the stratum corneum of the epidermis, where it plays a significant role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, contributing to skin barrier function (Niehues2016Late). The expression of LCE2C is associated with the defense against Gram-positive bacteria, suggesting a role in the immune response of the skin (Biondi2024Differential).

In healthy human cells, LCE2C is part of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) located on chromosome 1q21. This complex is typically inactive in non-epidermal tissues but becomes active during epidermal differentiation, indicating its role in maintaining skin integrity and preventing dehydration and pathogen entry (Tomimatsu2020Locusspecific). The protein's expression is regulated by various factors, including cytokines and environmental stimuli, which can influence its levels in response to skin damage or disease (Niehues2016Late). LCE2C's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining the protective functions of the skin barrier.

## Clinical Significance
The LCE2C gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels. In conditions such as periodontitis and tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), LCE2C is notably downregulated, suggesting a potential role in these diseases (gauran2024correlation). Aberrant expression of LCE2C has also been observed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), indicating its possible involvement in the pathogenesis of these cancers (Prasad2018Pathway; gauran2024correlation).

In psoriasis, LCE2C expression is reduced, which may contribute to the compromised skin barrier function characteristic of the disease (Niehues2016Late). The gene is also identified as one of the top genes involved in the cross-talk between periodontitis and hypothyroidism, highlighting its potential role as a crosstalk gene between various diseases (gauran2024correlation).

Furthermore, LCE2C has been associated with keratoconus, a condition affecting the cornea, through its involvement in processes like cellular ketone metabolism and response to oxidative stress (Wu2023Screening). These findings suggest that LCE2C may have clinical significance in a range of conditions, warranting further investigation into its role in disease mechanisms.
