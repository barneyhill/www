# APOD

## Overview
Apolipoprotein D (APOD) is a gene that encodes the protein apolipoprotein D, a member of the lipocalin family known for its role in lipid transport and metabolism. The protein is characterized by its conserved eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel structure, which facilitates the binding of small hydrophobic ligands such as progesterone and arachidonic acid (Eichinger2007Structural). Apolipoprotein D is primarily associated with high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in the plasma and is involved in various physiological processes, including lipid metabolism, oxidative stress regulation, and neuroprotection (Sanchez2021The). It is expressed in multiple tissues, notably in the nervous system, where it contributes to myelin maintenance and neuronal development (Ganfornina2010ApoD). The protein's expression is modulated by factors such as oxidative stress and hormonal changes, underscoring its role in cellular homeostasis and response to environmental stimuli (Sanchez2021The).

## Structure
Apolipoprotein D (APOD) is a member of the lipocalin protein family, characterized by a conserved eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel structure. This β-barrel forms the core of the protein and is flanked by an α-helix, typical of lipocalins (Eichinger2007Structural). The β-barrel supports a ligand-binding pocket that is hydrophobic and accommodates small hydrophobic ligands such as progesterone and arachidonic acid (Eichinger2007Structural).

The primary structure of APOD includes a signal peptide and two N-glycosylation sites at Asn45 and Asn78, which are important for its stability and function (Sanchez2021The; Nasreen2006Solubility). The protein contains four conserved cysteine residues that form two intramolecular disulfide bonds, contributing to its structural stability (Sanchez2021The).

APOD can form dimers and tetramers, indicating a quaternary structure. This oligomerization is influenced by the oxidation state of certain residues, such as Met93, which plays a role in its antioxidant function (Sanchez2021The). The protein's hydrophobic surface properties and glycosylation patterns affect its solubility and interaction with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles (Eichinger2007Structural; Nasreen2006Solubility).

## Function
Apolipoprotein D (APOD) is a multifunctional protein involved in lipid metabolism, oxidative stress regulation, and neuroprotection. It is part of the lipocalin family and primarily associates with high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in the plasma, where it binds small hydrophobic ligands within its β-barrel pocket (Sanchez2021The). APOD plays a crucial role in maintaining the redox state of lipid structures, such as cellular membranes and lipoprotein particles, by reducing lipid peroxides to non-reactive forms, thus protecting against oxidative stress (FyfeDesmarais2023Apolipoprotein; Sanchez2021The).

In the nervous system, APOD is expressed in glial cells and neurons, where it contributes to myelin maintenance and repair, influencing processes like myelin clearance and macrophage recruitment (Ganfornina2010ApoD; Sanchez2021The). It is involved in neurotransmission and neuronal development, promoting neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis, which are essential for neuronal plasticity and cognitive functions (Sanchez2021The).

APOD also modulates lipid composition and signaling, particularly involving arachidonic acid, which is crucial for maintaining membrane integrity and proper nervous system function (Ganfornina2008Apolipoprotein). Its expression is regulated by various factors, including oxidative stress and hormonal changes, highlighting its role in cellular homeostasis and response to environmental stimuli (Sanchez2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the APOD gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In neurological disorders, increased ApoD levels are observed in Alzheimer's disease, where they correlate with neurofibrillary tangles and the Braak degeneration stage, but not with senile plaques (Rassart2020Apolipoprotein). ApoD expression is also elevated in schizophrenia, particularly in patients treated with clozapine, suggesting a role in arachidonic acid membrane incorporation (Rassart2020Apolipoprotein). In Niemann-Pick type C disease, a genetic disorder affecting cholesterol transport, ApoD expression is significantly increased, potentially as a response to intracellular cholesterol disruption (Rassart2020Apolipoprotein).

ApoD is implicated in cancer, with its expression inversely correlated with the aggressiveness of several malignant tumors. It is downregulated in astrocytomas and colon cancers, with low levels associated with shorter survival in breast and colon cancer patients (van2006Identification). In metabolic conditions, certain missense mutations in the APOD gene are linked to elevated plasma triglyceride levels and reduced HDL-cholesterol levels, characteristic of metabolic syndrome (Perdomo2008Apolipoprotein). ApoD is also involved in oxidative stress response, with its expression induced under stress conditions, potentially conferring neuroprotective effects (Perdomo2008Apolipoprotein).

## Interactions
Apolipoprotein D (APOD) is known to participate in various protein interactions that influence its function in lipid metabolism and neuroprotection. APOD interacts with high-density lipoproteins (HDL) primarily through a disulfide bond with apolipoprotein A-II, facilitating its association with HDL in plasma (Eichinger2007Structural). It can also form intermolecular disulfide bridges with other apolipoproteins, such as apolipoproteins A-I and A-II, and Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), enhancing LCAT's esterification activity (Rassart2020Apolipoprotein).

APOD is internalized into cells via a receptor-dependent mechanism involving basigin (BSG), a cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein. This interaction is crucial for APOD's internalization, as downregulation of BSG significantly reduces APOD uptake (Najyb2015Apolipoprotein). Cyclophilin A, another protein that binds to BSG, can competitively inhibit APOD internalization, indicating a shared binding site on BSG (Rassart2020Apolipoprotein; Najyb2015Apolipoprotein).

APOD also interacts with the rabies virus glycoprotein (G protein), promoting viral replication by upregulating cholesterol levels, which suggests a role in facilitating rabies virus propagation (Zhang2024Apolipoprotein).
