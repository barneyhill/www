# IL22

## Overview
Interleukin 22 (IL-22) is a cytokine encoded by the IL22 gene, which is part of the IL-10 cytokine family. The IL22 gene is responsible for producing the IL-22 protein, a helical cytokine that plays a crucial role in immune regulation and inflammation. IL-22 is primarily produced by T-helper 17 (Th17) cells and innate lymphoid cells, and it acts on epithelial cells to promote tissue repair and antimicrobial defense. This cytokine is essential for maintaining mucosal barriers in various tissues, including the skin, gut, and lungs (Parks2016Interleukin22; Liang2006Interleukin). IL-22 functions through a receptor complex composed of IL-22RA1 and IL-10R2, activating signaling pathways such as Jak1, Tyk2, and STAT3, which are vital for immune homeostasis and tissue repair (Parks2016Interleukin22). The activity of IL-22 is tightly regulated by its interaction with IL-22 Binding Protein (IL-22BP), which inhibits its signaling (Zenewicz2021IL22). IL-22's involvement in various chronic inflammatory diseases and cancers underscores its dual role in both protective and pathogenic processes, depending on the context and tissue environment (Sabat2013Therapeutic; Zenewicz2011Recent).

## Structure
The IL-22 protein is a cytokine belonging to the IL-10 family, characterized by a helical structure composed of six helices (A-F) and a small N-terminal helix termed helix preA. These helices form a compact six-helix bundle, with helices A, C, D, and F creating a four-helix bundle typical of class II cytokines (Trivella2010Structure). The N-terminal portion of IL-22 forms a 3_10-helix secondary structure, stabilized by hydrogen bonds (Trivella2010Structure). The protein is stabilized by two disulfide bonds: Cys40-Cys132 and Cys89-Cys178 (Nagem2002Crystal).

IL-22 can form dimers and tetramers in solution, with the dimeric form being an open V-shaped molecule. The tetramer adopts a twisted X-shaped conformation, composed of two V-shaped dimers (de2008Interleukin22). The dimerization interface involves interactions in the loop DE, with specific residues contributing to hydrophobic, electrostatic, and hydrogen-bond interactions (de2008Interleukin22).

Glycosylation at Asn54 and Asn97 is observed in the D. melanogaster IL-22 structure, which is important for structural stability and receptor interactions (Trivella2010Structure). The IL-22/IL-22R1 complex involves interactions with two IL-22R1 receptors, suggesting a physiological relevance for the dimeric state (de2008Interleukin22).

## Function
Interleukin 22 (IL-22) is a cytokine primarily produced by T-helper 17 (Th17) cells and innate lymphoid cells, playing a significant role in immune regulation and inflammation. IL-22 acts on epithelial cells, promoting tissue repair and antimicrobial defense, and is crucial for maintaining mucosal barriers in tissues such as the skin, gut, and lungs (Liang2006Interleukin).

IL-22 signals through a receptor complex composed of IL-22RA1 and IL-10R2, activating signaling pathways like Jak1, Tyk2, and STAT3, which are essential for immune homeostasis and tissue repair (Parks2016Interleukin22). This cytokine enhances the expression of antimicrobial peptides, such as β-defensin 2, S100A7, S100A8, and S100A9, in keratinocytes, often working synergistically with IL-17A and IL-17F to bolster host defense mechanisms (Liang2006Interleukin).

In the intestine, IL-22 supports the integrity of the epithelial barrier by maintaining tight junctions, preventing bacterial translocation, and facilitating the elimination of enterobacterial pathobionts through the complement pathway (Parks2016Interleukin22). IL-22 also induces the production of acute-phase proteins in the liver, contributing to inflammatory responses (Kotenko2001Identification). Its activity is regulated by IL-22 Binding Protein (IL-22BP), which binds IL-22 to inhibit its signaling (Parks2016Interleukin22).

## Clinical Significance
IL22 is implicated in various chronic inflammatory diseases and cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In psoriasis, IL22 is overexpressed in lesional skin, contributing to inflammation and keratinocyte proliferation, which are hallmarks of the disease (Sabat2013Therapeutic). In rheumatoid arthritis, IL22 may promote osteoclastogenesis, leading to bone erosion (Zenewicz2011Recent). IL22 also plays a role in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), with increased expression in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, correlating with disease severity and promoting proinflammatory cytokine expression (Sabat2013Therapeutic; Brand2006IL-22).

In cancer, IL22 is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. It is linked to increased tumor stage and chemoresistance in gastric and colorectal cancers, and elevated levels in pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinomas correlate with poorer survival (Lim2014The). IL22 promotes lung tumorigenesis in Kras mutant lung cancer by inducing stemness properties and activating pro-tumor signaling pathways (Khosravi2018IL22). These findings suggest that IL22's role in disease is context-dependent, with both protective and pathogenic effects depending on the tissue and inflammatory environment (Zenewicz2011Recent).

## Interactions
Interleukin 22 (IL-22) interacts with a heterodimeric receptor complex composed of IL-22 receptor subunit 1 (IL-22R1) and IL-10R2. The binding of IL-22 to this receptor complex occurs in two steps: initially, IL-22 binds to IL-22R1, inducing a conformational change that allows subsequent binding to IL-10R2, stabilizing the complex (de2008Interleukin22; Sabat2013Therapeutic). This interaction activates signaling pathways, including the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), leading to the activation of STAT proteins, particularly STAT3, which translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression (Zenewicz2021IL22; Sabat2013Therapeutic).

IL-22 can also bind to a soluble receptor, IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP), which acts as a natural inhibitor by preventing IL-22 from interacting with its transmembrane receptor complex. IL-22BP binds IL-22 with higher affinity than IL-22R1, effectively blocking its activity (Zenewicz2021IL22; Sabat2013Therapeutic). Additionally, IL-22 interacts with CRF2-10, another soluble receptor that neutralizes its activity by inhibiting IL-22-induced signaling pathways (Kotenko2001Identification). These interactions highlight the regulatory mechanisms of IL-22 in immune responses and inflammation.
