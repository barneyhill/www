# TMA7B

## Overview
The TMA7B gene encodes the protein translation machinery associated 7 homolog B, which is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis. This protein is part of a larger complex that plays a critical role in the translation process, ensuring the proper assembly and function of ribosomes. TMA7B is categorized as a component of the translation machinery, contributing to the fidelity and efficiency of protein synthesis. Its function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to various physiological demands. Alterations in the expression or function of TMA7B may have implications in various diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in understanding and potentially targeting translational dysregulation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
