# CTXND1

## Overview
CTXND1, or cortexin domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by CTXND1 is characterized by the presence of a cortexin domain, which suggests a role in cellular signaling or structural organization, potentially categorizing it as a signaling or structural protein (Ferrasi2020New). Research has highlighted its differential expression in several pathological conditions, including various cancers and cardiac diseases, indicating its potential significance in disease pathogenesis and progression (Ferrasi2020New; Kiselev2022Novel). The gene's involvement in complex genetic interactions, such as those related to stroke, further underscores its importance in human health and disease (Aldridge2024Diversity).

## Clinical Significance
CTXND1 (cortexin domain containing 1) has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In the context of cancer, CTXND1 is notably down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric cancer, and hepatoblastoma, suggesting a potential role in tumor suppression or progression (Ferrasi2020New). This down-regulation is also observed in lung and papillary thyroid cancers, indicating a broader association with oncogenic processes (Ferrasi2020New).

In contrast, CTXND1 is upregulated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition characterized by the thickening of the heart muscle, which can lead to heart failure or sudden cardiac death. The gene's upregulation in HCM suggests it may play a role in the pathogenesis of this cardiac condition, although its specific function in heart tissue remains unclear (Kiselev2022Novel).

Additionally, CTXND1 has been associated with genetic risk factors for recurrent stroke, although no direct link to specific diseases was established in the study. The gene was identified among those with suggestive associations in a genome-wide association study, highlighting its potential involvement in complex genetic interactions related to stroke (Aldridge2024Diversity).
