# GADL1

## Overview
GADL1, or glutamate decarboxylase like 1, is a gene that encodes a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of β-alanine and carnosine peptides. The protein, categorized as a decarboxylase, plays a crucial role in antioxidant defense and pH buffering, particularly in the brain and skeletal muscle (Mahootchi2020GADL1). Structurally, GADL1 shares similarities with other decarboxylases and forms a homodimer, with its active site characterized by a high positive charge potential suitable for binding acidic amino acids (Raasakka2018Structure; Winge2015Mammalian). The gene's expression is associated with various physiological traits, including muscle strength and kidney function, and it has been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as bipolar disorder and oxidative stress-related diseases (CuéllarBarboza2020Potential; Mahootchi2020GADL1).

## Structure
The GADL1 protein is a member of the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme family, sharing structural similarities with other decarboxylases such as cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD) and glutamic acid decarboxylases (GAD65 and GAD67) (Raasakka2018Structure; Winge2015Mammalian). The active site of GADL1 features a Schiff base linkage between PLP and a lysine residue, specifically Lys333 in the homology model and Lys314 in the crystal structure (Raasakka2018Structure; Winge2015Mammalian). His219 is involved in base stacking with PLP, and the active site is characterized by a high positive charge potential, suitable for binding acidic amino acids (Raasakka2018Structure; Winge2015Mammalian).

GADL1 forms a homodimer, with each monomer contributing to the active site (Raasakka2018Structure). The protein's structure includes a flexible loop covering the active site, which is not well-defined in electron density maps but is important for catalysis (Raasakka2018Structure). The protein can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with human isoforms ranging from 418 to 521 amino acids (Winge2015Mammalian). The protein is involved in the biosynthesis of β-alanine and carnosine, with specific residues like Arg494 and Gln120 playing roles in substrate interactions (Mahootchi2020GADL1; Winge2015Mammalian).

## Function
The GADL1 gene encodes a multifunctional decarboxylase enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of β-alanine and carnosine peptides, which are crucial for antioxidant defense and pH buffering in tissues such as the brain and skeletal muscle (Mahootchi2020GADL1). GADL1's enzymatic activity is dependent on pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) and is characterized by low substrate specificity, allowing it to catalyze multiple reactions (Mahootchi2020GADL1). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it contributes to maintaining oxidative balance by regulating levels of β-alanine and carnosine (Mahootchi2020GADL1).

In healthy cells, GADL1 plays a role in muscle function and is upregulated during high-intensity exercise, highlighting its importance in carnosine synthesis and muscle physiology (Mahootchi2020GADL1). The gene is also associated with sensory organs, particularly the olfactory bulb, suggesting potential neuroprotective functions (Mahootchi2020GADL1). Genetic studies have linked GADL1 variants with traits such as muscle strength, kidney function, and subjective well-being, indicating its broader physiological significance (Mahootchi2020GADL1).

## Clinical Significance
The GADL1 gene has been implicated in several human traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Variants in the GADL1 locus have been associated with eating disorders, kidney function, and blood metabolites, with a particularly strong link to acetylcarnosine levels (Mahootchi2020GADL1). GADL1 is also associated with the response to lithium treatment in bipolar disorder, although this association has not been consistently replicated across different populations (CuéllarBarboza2020Potential; Higgins2015A). 

In animal models, GADL1 deficiency leads to increased oxidative stress markers and altered antioxidant enzyme levels, suggesting a role in oxidative stress response (Mahootchi2020GADL1). Gadl1 knockout mice exhibit behavioral changes, increased oxidative stress, and age-related changes, indicating the gene's involvement in maintaining normal physiological functions and potentially contributing to age-related degenerative conditions (Mahootchi2020GADL1). 

The gene's expression is linked to neuromuscular pain conditions, and its role in β-alanine and carnosine synthesis is crucial for muscle function and exercise performance (Liu2012Role). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of GADL1 in various physiological and pathological contexts.
