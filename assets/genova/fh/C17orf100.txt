# C17orf100

## Overview
C17orf100 is a gene located on chromosome 17, specifically at the 17p13.2 locus, and encodes a protein known as chromosome 17 open reading frame 100. While the precise biological function of the C17orf100 protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in various cellular processes through its involvement in regulatory networks. The gene has garnered attention in the context of disease, particularly in its potential role as a prognostic biomarker in alcohol-related esophageal cancer and adrenocortical carcinoma, where it is part of complex regulatory networks involving long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (Du2022Construction; Jin2021Analysis). Additionally, C17orf100 is situated within a chromosomal region associated with certain congenital anomalies, although its specific contribution to these conditions is not yet clear (Spreiz2013Chromosomal). Further research is needed to clarify the functional roles and clinical implications of C17orf100.

## Clinical Significance
C17orf100 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression or interactions. In alcohol-related esophageal cancer (EC), C17orf100 is identified as one of the eight prognostic long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with significant upregulation, suggesting its potential role in cancer progression and as a biomarker for prognosis (Du2022Construction). The study highlights the construction of competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks involving C17orf100, which may influence the expression of other genes involved in EC (Du2022Construction).

In the context of chromosomal microaberrations, C17orf100 is located within a mosaic duplication region on chromosome 17p13.2, identified in patients with epilepsy, intellectual disability, and congenital anomalies. However, the specific clinical significance of C17orf100 in these conditions remains unclear, as the study focuses on broader chromosomal variations rather than individual gene effects (Spreiz2013Chromosomal).

In adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), C17orf100 is part of a network of lncRNAs that may dysregulate the behavior of hsa-mir-211, potentially affecting the expression of the m6A gene HNRNPA2B1, which is associated with cancer prognosis (Jin2021Analysis). Despite these associations, the precise role and clinical significance of C17orf100 in these diseases require further investigation.
