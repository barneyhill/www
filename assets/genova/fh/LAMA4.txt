# LAMA4

## Overview
LAMA4 is a gene that encodes the laminin subunit alpha 4, a critical component of the extracellular matrix protein laminin. Laminins are heterotrimeric glycoproteins that play a pivotal role in cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, and signaling. The laminin subunit alpha 4 is particularly involved in the formation of basement membranes, contributing to tissue integrity and influencing processes such as angiogenesis and muscle function. It is categorized as an extracellular matrix protein and is ubiquitously expressed in endothelial basement membranes from early embryonic development. The protein interacts with various receptors, including integrins, syndecans, and dystroglycans, facilitating extracellular matrix remodeling and signal transduction. LAMA4's involvement in multiple tissues, including the heart, skeletal muscle, and peripheral nerves, underscores its significance in maintaining structural integrity and function across different biological contexts (Petäjäniemi2002Localization; Goddi2021Lamininα4; Miner2008Laminins).

## Structure
The LAMA4 gene encodes the laminin subunit alpha 4, which is a component of the extracellular matrix and part of the laminin heterotrimers. Laminins are heterotrimeric glycoproteins composed of one alpha, one beta, and one gamma chain. The primary structure of the LAMA4 protein includes a large COOH-terminal globular domain known as the G domain, which is subdivided into five laminin G (LG) modules (Miner2008Laminins). The alpha 4 chain also contains a long coiled-coil domain that facilitates the assembly of the heterotrimer (Miner2008Laminins).

The LAMA4 chain is unique in that it lacks a laminin N-terminal (LN) globular domain or laminin IV (LF) domain but contains four laminin-type epidermal growth factor-like (LE) domains (Goddi2021Lamininα4). This structure allows LAMA4 to interact with receptors such as integrins, syndecans, and dystroglycans, which are crucial for extracellular matrix remodeling and signal transduction (Goddi2021Lamininα4; Miner2008Laminins).

The quaternary structure involves the assembly of the alpha 4 chain with beta and gamma chains to form the complete laminin heterotrimer, which is essential for its function in the basement membrane (Miner2008Laminins).

## Function
LAMA4 encodes the laminin α4 subunit, a crucial component of the extracellular matrix protein laminin, which plays a significant role in cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, and signaling. Laminin α4 is involved in the formation of basement membranes, contributing to tissue integrity and influencing processes such as angiogenesis and muscle function. It is ubiquitously localized in endothelial basement membranes and is expressed from early embryonic development, playing a significant role in angiogenesis, including cell attachment, migration, and tubule formation (Shan2015The; Petäjäniemi2002Localization).

In endothelial cells, LAMA4 promotes functions such as migration and angiogenesis, which are essential for maintaining vascular health. It interacts with the MAPK signaling pathway, particularly the p38 MAPK, which is involved in various cellular events (Shan2015The). LAMA4 is also a primary component of the basement membranes in adipocytes, where it is involved in maintaining adipose tissue health and metabolic regulation (Bailey2022AdipocyteSpecific).

LAMA4 is active in various tissues, including the heart, skeletal muscle, and peripheral nerves, where it contributes to the structural integrity and function of basement membranes, potentially influencing tissue development and maintenance (Petäjäniemi2002Localization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the LAMA4 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of cardiovascular diseases, a novel LAMA4 p.Asp1309Asn variant has been associated with infantile dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). This variant is classified as 'likely pathogenic' and was identified in a patient with severe infantile DCM, highlighting the gene's role in cardiac function (Abdallah2019Digenic).

In cancer, LAMA4 expression is significantly altered in several types. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), LAMA4 is overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression. The microRNA miR-539 targets LAMA4, inhibiting its expression and affecting TNBC cell proliferation and migration, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies (Yang2018MiR539). In ovarian cancer, LAMA4 is downregulated, correlating with poorer survival outcomes, and its overexpression in cell lines reduces tumorigenic properties (Liu2020LncRNA). In pancreatic cancer, LAMA4 is upregulated and associated with high liver metastasis potential and poor survival outcomes. It influences the tumor microenvironment by promoting cancer-associated fibroblast recruitment, which is crucial for metastasis (Zheng2020LAMA4).

LAMA4 is also implicated in preeclampsia, where its reduced expression in placental tissues is linked to impaired trophoblast function and angiogenesis, contributing to the disease's pathophysiology (Ji2019Role; Shan2015Laminin).

## Interactions
LAMA4, the laminin subunit alpha 4, is involved in various interactions with proteins and signaling pathways. It acts as a ligand for integrin α6β1 and the melanoma cell adhesion molecule, promoting tumor cell migration in renal cell carcinoma (Li2019MicroRNA200b). LAMA4 also interacts with integrin α5β1, activating the ILK/FAK/ERK pathway, which enhances cell migration (Li2019MicroRNA200b). In endothelial cells, LAMA4 mediates survival signals through interactions with integrin heterodimers such as α3β1 and α6β1, but not αvβ3, indicating its role in anti-apoptotic signaling (DeHahn2004The).

In pancreatic cancer, LAMA4 is associated with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), influencing their recruitment and activation, which contributes to the tumor microenvironment and metastasis (Zheng2020LAMA4). LAMA4 also interacts with the Shh/Gli1 signaling pathway in knee arthrofibrosis, where its overexpression activates this pathway, promoting fibroblast proliferation and migration (Wan2020Overexpression). These interactions highlight LAMA4's role in cell adhesion, migration, and survival across different biological contexts.
