# CDH16

## Overview
CDH16 is a gene that encodes the protein cadherin 16, also known as Ksp-cadherin, which is a member of the cadherin superfamily involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. This protein is primarily expressed in the kidney and thyroid, where it plays a critical role in maintaining tissue integrity and cellular differentiation. Cadherin 16 is characterized by its seven extracellular cadherin repeats and a short cytoplasmic domain, distinguishing it from classical cadherins by its lack of a catenin-binding sequence (Wendeler2006Unique; Ye2019Molecular). Functionally, cadherin 16 is essential for the formation and maintenance of renal tubules and thyroid follicles, contributing to cell polarity and tissue homeostasis (Yang2022Cadherin‑16; Thomson1998cDNA). Clinically, alterations in CDH16 expression have been associated with various thyroid and renal carcinomas, where its downregulation is linked to tumor progression and metastasis, highlighting its potential role as a tumor suppressor and diagnostic marker (Lennartz2023Cadherin16; Yang2022Cadherin‑16).

## Structure
The human CDH16 gene encodes the Ksp-cadherin protein, a member of the cadherin superfamily involved in cell adhesion. The primary structure of Ksp-cadherin includes a short 17 amino acid N-terminal hydrophobic domain, a long hydrophilic domain of 759 to 761 amino acids, a single membrane-spanning domain, and a short 21 to 22 amino acid C-terminal hydrophilic domain (Thomson1998cDNA). The N-terminal hydrophobic domain contains a signal sequence that is cleaved posttranslationally, with a putative cleavage site at residue 18 (Thomson1998cDNA).

The protein structure features seven extracellular cadherin repeats, which are characteristic of the cadherin family, and a short cytoplasmic domain of about 25 amino acids (Wendeler2006Unique). The cadherin-specific sequence motifs PEN, DXD, LDRE, and DXND are mostly conserved, although the human isoform lacks a DXD motif in ectodomain C (Thomson1998cDNA). The protein also contains conserved cysteine residues in the last ectodomain, typical of cadherins (Thomson1998cDNA).

Ksp-cadherin has four potential N-linked glycosylation sites at conserved locations in ectodomains E, F, and G, indicating post-translational modifications (Thomson1998cDNA). The gene structure consists of 18 exons, and the protein does not bind to β-catenin, distinguishing it from classical cadherins (Wendeler2006Unique).

## Function
The CDH16 gene encodes Cadherin-16, a calcium-dependent cell adhesion protein primarily expressed in the kidney and thyroid. In the kidney, Cadherin-16, also known as Ksp-cadherin, is expressed on the basolateral surface of all tubular segments of the nephron and the collecting duct system, playing a crucial role in maintaining the differentiated renal phenotype and tissue integrity through homotypic, homophilic interactions (Thedieck2005Expression; Thomson1998cDNA). It is involved in the formation of renal tubules and is essential for the maintenance of epithelial cell integrity and function (Lennartz2023Cadherin16).

In the thyroid, Cadherin-16 is expressed in all follicular cells and is involved in the development and maintenance of thyroid follicles, contributing to cell polarity and follicle formation (Yang2022Cadherin‑16; de2012An). The expression of Cadherin-16 in thyroid cells is regulated by the transcription factor Pax8, which binds to its promoter, activating transcription and maintaining thyroid follicular integrity (de2012An). Cadherin-16's role in cell adhesion and polarity is crucial for normal thyroid function and tissue homeostasis (Yang2022Cadherin‑16).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDH16 gene have been implicated in various forms of thyroid carcinoma, including papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). CDH16 is significantly downregulated in these cancers compared to normal thyroid tissue, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. This downregulation is associated with larger tumor size, advanced disease stage, and lymph node metastasis in PTC patients (Yang2022Cadherin‑16). The loss of CDH16 expression is also linked to aggressive clinical features such as extrathyroidal extension, multifocality, and bilateral tumors, and is a strong independent predictor for lymph node metastasis in Middle Eastern PTC (Siraj2023Loss).

In addition to thyroid cancer, CDH16 expression is used as a diagnostic marker in renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), where it is highly expressed in certain subtypes like nephrogenic adenomas and oncocytomas. However, its expression is significantly reduced in papillary thyroid carcinomas, making it a potential diagnostic tool for distinguishing between these cancer types (Lennartz2023Cadherin16). The downregulation of CDH16 in thyroid carcinomas is not due to DNA copy number variation, indicating other regulatory mechanisms are involved (Yang2022Cadherin‑16).

## Interactions
CDH16, also known as cadherin 16, is a member of the cadherin superfamily, which is involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. While specific physical interactions of CDH16 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, some insights into its potential interactions can be inferred from its structural and functional characteristics.

CDH16 is part of the 7Dcadherins subfamily, characterized by seven extracellular cadherin homology repeats and a short cytoplasmic domain lacking a catenin-binding sequence. This suggests that CDH16 may not directly interact with catenins, which are common partners for classical cadherins in linking to the cytoskeleton (Ye2019Molecular). However, it is suggested that αB-crystallin might mediate signal transduction from CDH16 to the cytoskeleton, indicating a potential indirect interaction (Ye2019Molecular).

In the context of cancer, CDH16 is downregulated in thyroid carcinoma and renal cell carcinomas, where it is replaced by CDH6. The transcription factor Snail suppresses CDH16 expression by repressing the kidney differentiation factor HNF-1β, suggesting a regulatory interaction at the transcriptional level (Casal2018RGD). Despite the presence of an RGD motif, CDH16 does not induce integrin activation, unlike other cadherins with similar motifs (Casal2018RGD).
