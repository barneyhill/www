# RBM43

## Overview
RBM43, or RNA binding motif protein 43, is a gene that encodes an RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly within adipose tissue. The protein, categorized as an RNA-binding protein, plays a pivotal role in linking adipose inflammation to energy expenditure by modulating the translation of PGC1α, a critical regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism. Predominantly expressed in white adipose tissue, RBM43 is regulated by inflammatory cytokines and immune sensors, influencing cellular homeostasis and energy metabolism in response to inflammatory signals (Dumesic2023RBM43). The protein's activity in both the nucleus and cytoplasm involves interactions with RNA molecules, affecting their stability, splicing, and translation, which are essential for maintaining cellular function and metabolic regulation (Dumesic2023RBM43).

## Structure


## Function
RBM43 (RNA binding motif protein 43) is an RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in adipose tissue. It plays a crucial role in linking adipose inflammation and energy expenditure through the translational regulation of PGC1α, a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism. RBM43 is predominantly expressed in white adipose tissue and is regulated by inflammatory cytokines and immune sensors (Dumesic2023RBM43).

In healthy cells, RBM43 functions as a negative post-transcriptional regulator of Ppargc1a mRNA, which encodes PGC1α. This regulation suppresses mitochondrial and thermogenic gene expression, thereby influencing oxidative metabolism and energy expenditure. Knockdown of RBM43 in adipocytes leads to increased PGC1α protein levels, enhanced mitochondrial function, and improved glucose tolerance, suggesting its role in modulating thermogenesis and insulin sensitivity (Dumesic2023RBM43).

RBM43 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it interacts with RNA molecules to influence their stability, splicing, and translation. This activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating energy metabolism in response to inflammatory signals (Dumesic2023RBM43).

## Clinical Significance
RBM43 has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels playing a significant role in disease progression and prognosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RBM43 is significantly downregulated, and this reduction is associated with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages. The protein acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating Cyclin B1 expression, which is crucial for cell-cycle control. Loss of RBM43 leads to increased Cyclin B1 levels, promoting cell proliferation and tumor growth (Feng2020RNAbinding). In mouse models, RBM43 deficiency results in enhanced liver carcinogenesis and reduced survival, further supporting its protective role against liver cancer (Feng2020RNAbinding).

In contrast, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), RBM43 is overexpressed, and high levels are linked to poorer overall survival and disease-free survival, particularly in early-stage patients. This suggests that RBM43 may have a context-dependent role in cancer, acting as a prognostic biomarker for ESCC (Li2021Elevated).

RBM43 has also been associated with other conditions, including type 2 diabetes, endometriosis, esophageal adenocarcinoma, and Barrett's esophagus, indicating its broader significance in disease pathogenesis (Feng2020RNAbinding).

## Interactions
RBM43 is known to interact with Cyclin B1 mRNA, specifically binding to its 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). This interaction negatively regulates the stability and expression of Cyclin B1 mRNA, leading to decreased Cyclin B1 mRNA and protein levels in cells overexpressing RBM43. Conversely, RBM43 knockdown results in increased Cyclin B1 levels. This regulatory mechanism is significant in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where RBM43 acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating Cyclin B1 expression, thereby affecting cell-cycle progression and tumor growth (Feng2020RNAbinding).

In adipose tissue, RBM43 interacts with PGC1α mRNA, suppressing its translation. This interaction affects mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism, as PGC1α is a key regulator of these processes. The knockdown of RBM43 in adipocytes leads to an increased PGC1α protein:mRNA ratio, enhancing mitochondrial function and thermogenesis. This suggests that RBM43 plays a role in linking adipose inflammation and energy expenditure through its regulatory effects on PGC1α translation (Dumesic2023RBM43).
