# TAGLN3

## Overview
TAGLN3 is a gene that encodes the protein transgelin 3, a member of the calponin family, which is primarily expressed in neuronal tissues. Transgelin 3 is characterized by its involvement in cytoskeletal dynamics, where it interacts with actin filaments and microtubules to maintain cellular structure and facilitate processes such as cell motility and signal transduction (Hsieh2023Evolution; Wu2021Biochemical). The protein is distinguished by its conserved domains, including an N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, an actin-binding site, and a C-terminal calponin-like (CLIK) segment, which are crucial for its function in cytoskeletal organization (Hsieh2023Evolution). Transgelin 3 plays a significant role in neural differentiation and plasticity, contributing to neuronal development and function (Wu2021Biochemical). Its expression is transient during the early stages of neuronal development, indicating its involvement in the transition from cell proliferation to differentiation (Wu2021Biochemical). Additionally, TAGLN3 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and cancer, where its altered expression affects cellular signaling pathways and disease progression (Zhou2016Transgelin; Arnaud2021The).

## Structure
Transgelin-3, encoded by the TAGLN3 gene, is a protein consisting of 199 amino acids and is characterized by a conserved structure that includes an N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, an actin-binding site (ABS), and a C-terminal calponin-like (CLIK) segment (Hsieh2023Evolution). The CH domain is involved in binding extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), while the ABS domain binds actin, and the CLIK domain binds ezrin (Hsieh2023Evolution). Transgelin-3 contains several phosphorylation sites, including Ser 11, Thr 128, Ser 134, Ser 163, Ser 180, Ser 185, and Thr 190, as well as a methylation site at Arg 196, indicating a role in cellular signaling and regulation (Hsieh2023Evolution).

The protein structure of transgelin-3 is conserved across species such as chicken, rat, mouse, and human, suggesting a role in cytoskeletal dynamics (Hsieh2023Evolution). Unlike calponin, which has two actin-binding sites and two CLIK motifs, transgelin-3 has only one of each, making it a more concise version of calponin (Hsieh2023Evolution). The structural simplicity of transgelin-3, lacking the isoform-specific C-terminal variable region found in calponins, suggests it retains the core functions of the calponin-transgelin family proteins (Hsieh2023Evolution).

## Function
Transgelin 3 (TAGLN3) is a protein encoded by the TAGLN3 gene, which is involved in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is a member of the calponin family of proteins and is neuron-specific, interacting with actin filaments and microtubules to contribute to cytoskeletal organization and stability (Wu2021Biochemical). TAGLN3 plays a significant role in promoting neural differentiation and enhancing neural plasticity, which are crucial for proper neuronal development and function (Wu2021Biochemical).

The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it participates in maintaining cell shape, motility, and signal transduction. Its involvement in these processes is linked to its actin-binding capabilities, which help stabilize the cytoskeleton and facilitate cellular activities such as adhesion and migration (Hsieh2023Evolution). TAGLN3 contains an N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, an actin-binding region, and a C-terminal CLIK sequence, which are essential for its interaction with the cytoskeleton (Hsieh2023Evolution).

The expression of TAGLN3 is transient as cells exit the cell cycle, indicating its involvement in the early stages of neuronal development (Wu2021Biochemical). This transient expression pattern suggests that TAGLN3 may play a role in the transition of cells from proliferation to differentiation, particularly in the nervous system.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TAGLN3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and certain cancers. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, TAGLN3 downregulation is notably observed in patients with the APOE4/E4 genotype, which is associated with increased neuroinflammation. This downregulation is linked to the activation of the NF-kB pathway, contributing to the pro-inflammatory environment in the brain. The repression of TAGLN3 by APOE4 is mediated through histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, and restoring TAGLN3 expression has been shown to reduce inflammatory markers, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in AD (Arnaud2021The).

In cancer, TAGLN3, also known as transgelin 3, has been associated with the metastatic potential of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Altered expression of transgelin, a protein homologous to TAGLN3, affects the expression of numerous genes involved in cytoskeletal and actin-binding processes, which are crucial for cell motility and metastasis. This suggests that TAGLN3 may play a role in regulating the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and influencing metastatic behavior in cancer cells (Zhou2016Transgelin).

## Interactions
TAGLN3, also known as transgelin 3, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It interacts with actin filaments and microtubules, similar to other proteins in the calponin family, such as SM22α and rat acidic calponin (Wu2021Biochemical). TAGLN3 has been shown to interact with IκBα, an inhibitor of the NF-kB pathway, suggesting a role in regulating inflammation in astrocytes. This interaction was demonstrated through thermal denaturation studies, indicating a direct physical interaction (Arnaud2021The). 

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, TAGLN3 is downregulated in astrocytes with the APOE4 genotype, leading to increased inflammation through the activation of the NF-kB pathway. The repression of TAGLN3 is mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs), which are upregulated in APOE4 astrocytes (Arnaud2021The). 

TAGLN3 also contains several phosphorylation sites, such as Ser 11, Thr 128, Ser 134, Ser 163, Ser 180, Ser 185, and Thr 190, and a methylation site at Arg 196, which suggest potential regulatory mechanisms for its interactions and functions (Hsieh2023Evolution). These interactions and modifications highlight TAGLN3's involvement in cytoskeletal organization and cellular signaling pathways.
