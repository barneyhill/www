# PSG8

## Overview
Pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein 8 (PSG8) is a gene that encodes a member of the pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein family, which is primarily expressed in the placenta. The protein product of PSG8 is involved in critical biological processes such as immune modulation, angiogenesis, and trophoblast invasion, all of which are essential for normal placental development and maternal-fetal tolerance. PSG8 functions by activating latent transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) through interactions with the latent TGF-β binding protein-1 (LTBP-1) and potentially with heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix (Warren2018Activation). Additionally, PSG8's regulatory interactions are influenced by the transcription factor CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which modulates its expression through changes in histone modifications (Jeong2021Depletion). The protein's role in cell signaling pathways, particularly those affecting regulatory T cell activity, suggests potential therapeutic applications in conditions where enhanced Treg activity is advantageous (Warren2018Activation).

## Function
PSG8, a member of the pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein family, plays a significant role in the activation of latent transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in human cells. This activation is crucial for various cellular processes, including immune modulation and angiogenesis, which are essential for placental development and maternal-fetal tolerance. PSG8 activates TGF-β1 by binding to the latent TGF-β binding protein-1 (LTBP-1) in the extracellular matrix and potentially interacting with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (Warren2018Activation).

The protein is primarily expressed in the placenta, where it contributes to immune regulation, angiogenesis, and trophoblast invasion, all of which are vital for normal placental development (Jeong2021Depletion). PSG8's interaction with the latency-associated peptide (LAP) of TGF-β1 has been studied using surface plasmon resonance, revealing a micromolar affinity, which suggests a common ability among PSGs to interact with LAP (Warren2018Activation).

In addition to its role in the placenta, PSG8 is involved in cell signaling pathways that may influence regulatory T cell (Treg) activity, offering potential therapeutic applications in diseases where increased Treg activity could be beneficial (Warren2018Activation).

## Interactions
PSG8, a member of the pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein family, interacts with the latency-associated peptide (LAP) of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). This interaction was analyzed using surface plasmon resonance, which revealed that PSG8, along with other PSGs, binds to LAP with similar kinetics and affinity, suggesting a common ability among human PSGs to interact with LAP (Warren2018Activation). PSG8 is also involved in the activation of the small latent complex of TGF-β1, a function shared by all members of the human PSG family (Warren2018Activation).

In terms of regulatory interactions, PSG8 expression is influenced by the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a transcription factor. Silencing CTCF in the human trophoblast cell line Swan 71 led to the upregulation of PSG8, indicating that CTCF binding is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of PSG8 (Jeong2021Depletion). This regulatory mechanism is associated with changes in histone modifications, specifically an increase in the active mark H3K4me3 and a decrease in the repressive mark H3K27me3 at the PSG8 promoter (Jeong2021Depletion).
