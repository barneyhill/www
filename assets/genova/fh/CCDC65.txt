# CCDC65

## Overview
The CCDC65 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 65 protein, which is a vital component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) involved in ciliary and flagellar motility. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for the structural integrity and function of motile cilia (Bower2018DRC2CCDC65). CCDC65 plays a crucial role in regulating dynein motor activity, maintaining the alignment of outer doublets, and limiting microtubule sliding during ciliary bending (Horani2013CCDC65). The protein undergoes several post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and N-glycosylation, which are important for its stability and function (Horani2013CCDC65). Mutations in the CCDC65 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function, and the gene has also been implicated as a tumor suppressor in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer (Horani2013CCDC65; Zhang2022CCDC65).

## Structure
The CCDC65 protein, also known as DRC2, is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to the protein's secondary structure (Bower2018DRC2CCDC65). These domains are crucial for the assembly of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), which is essential for ciliary and flagellar motility (Bower2018DRC2CCDC65). The C-terminal region of CCDC65 is particularly important for its function, as it is involved in the coassembly with DRC1 to form the N-DRC base plate and its attachment to the outer doublet microtubule (Bower2018DRC2CCDC65).

CCDC65 undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, N-glycosylation, and N-myristoylation, which are important for its stability and function (Horani2013CCDC65). These modifications are primarily located at the C'-terminus of the protein. Mutations in CCDC65 can lead to a loss of these modification sites, potentially affecting the protein's stability and function (Horani2013CCDC65).

The protein may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Zhang2022CCDC65). The structural integrity and function of CCDC65 are crucial for the proper assembly and maintenance of ciliary components, impacting ciliary motility and related disorders (Horani2013CCDC65).

## Function
The CCDC65 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), which is essential for the regulation of dynein motor activity in cilia. This protein plays a significant role in maintaining the alignment of outer doublets and limiting microtubule sliding during ciliary bending, which is crucial for proper ciliary motility (Horani2013CCDC65; Bower2018DRC2CCDC65). In healthy human cells, CCDC65 is localized to the cytoplasm and axoneme of ciliated airway epithelial cells, indicating its involvement in ciliary function (Horani2013CCDC65).

CCDC65 is not required for the initial formation of cilia, as cilia are present even when CCDC65 is silenced. However, its absence results in dyskinetic cilia with limited bending, affecting the ciliary beat pattern (Horani2013CCDC65). The protein is involved in post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, N-glycosylation, and N-myristoylation, which are important for its function (Horani2013CCDC65). CCDC65's role in the N-DRC is crucial for the proper assembly and function of this complex, impacting ciliary and flagellar motility (Bower2018DRC2CCDC65).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCDC65 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. One significant condition linked to CCDC65 mutations is primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function. Individuals with PCD often experience chronic respiratory infections, bronchiectasis, and other symptoms due to dysfunctional cilia. Studies have identified mutations in CCDC65 that lead to PCD with normal ciliary ultrastructure but hyperkinetic cilia, indicating a role in the nexin-dynein regulatory complex essential for proper ciliary motion (Horani2013CCDC65).

In the context of cancer, CCDC65 has been implicated as a tumor suppressor gene. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CCDC65 is expressed at lower levels in tumor tissues compared to normal lung tissues. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that CCDC65 may inhibit tumor growth by affecting the cell cycle and signaling pathways (Zhang2022CCDC65). Similarly, in gastric cancer, decreased expression of CCDC65 correlates with poor prognosis and advanced clinical features, indicating its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker (Deng2021CCDC65). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CCDC65 in both genetic disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
CCDC65 is involved in several critical protein interactions, particularly within the context of ciliary function and lung adenocarcinoma. In lung adenocarcinoma cells, CCDC65 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein FBXW7 and the oncoprotein c-Myc. CCDC65 recruits FBXW7 to mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of c-Myc, thereby reducing its nuclear transportation and transcriptional activity. This interaction is significant in the regulation of ENO1 transcription, as c-Myc binds to the ENO1 transcriptional regulatory region to promote its transcription. CCDC65 downregulates ENO1 expression by promoting its ubiquitin degradation, highlighting its role as a tumor suppressor (Zhang2022CCDC65).

In the context of ciliary function, CCDC65 is a component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), essential for ciliary and flagellar motility. It interacts with other N-DRC subunits, such as DRC1, to stabilize the assembly of the complex. Mutations in CCDC65 can lead to defects in the assembly of inner dynein arms and radial spokes, affecting ciliary motility. CCDC65's interaction with proteins like GAS8 (DRC4) is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of motile cilia (Horani2013CCDC65; Bower2018DRC2CCDC65).
