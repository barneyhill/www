# BUD13

## Overview
BUD13 is a gene that encodes the BUD13 homolog protein, which is a crucial component of the retention and splicing (RES) complex involved in RNA processing. The BUD13 protein plays a significant role in the retention and splicing of pre-mRNA within the nucleus, influencing gene expression and cellular function through mechanisms such as nonsense-mediated decay and micro-RNA mediated mRNA degradation (Andres2021FamilyBased). Additionally, BUD13 is implicated in lipid metabolism, with genetic variations linked to serum lipid levels, particularly triglycerides, suggesting its involvement in metabolic processes and cardiovascular health (Aung2014Association; Masjoudi2021Kernel). The protein's interactions within the RES complex and its role in stabilizing mRNA highlight its importance in RNA stability and processing, with potential implications in oncogenesis and other diseases (Wysoczański2014Cooperative; Liu2022The).

## Function
The BUD13 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the retention and splicing (RES) complex, which plays a critical role in RNA processing, specifically in the retention and splicing of pre-mRNA within the nucleus. This complex is involved in the regulation of intron retention, a process where unspliced introns are retained in messenger RNAs (mRNA), influencing the fate of mature mRNAs through mechanisms such as nonsense-mediated decay or micro-RNA mediated mRNA degradation (Andres2021FamilyBased). BUD13's involvement in these processes suggests its importance in the regulation of gene expression and cellular function.

BUD13 is also implicated in lipid metabolism, as genetic variations in this gene have been associated with serum lipid levels, particularly triglycerides, in various populations. This indicates a potential role in metabolic processes and cardiovascular health (Aung2014Association; Masjoudi2021Kernel). The gene is part of a cluster that includes other genes like APOA5, which are significant in metabolic pathways, including insulin sensitivity and cholesterol metabolism (Masjoudi2021Kernel). The BUD13 protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences the maturation of pre-mRNA, impacting gene expression and cellular function (Andres2021FamilyBased).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the BUD13 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of specific language impairment (SLI), rare variants in BUD13 have been identified through family-based whole-exome analysis. These variants, including non-synonymous changes, have been found in multiple individuals with SLI, suggesting a potential link to the condition. Some of these variants are predicted to be pathogenic, indicating their possible clinical significance in contributing to the genetic basis of SLI (Andres2021FamilyBased).

BUD13 has also been associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS), particularly in relation to lipid metabolism. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BUD13, such as rs11216129 and rs623908, have been linked to high triglyceride and low HDL levels, components of MetS. These genetic variants may interact with environmental factors like smoking, influencing the risk of MetS (Masjoudi2021Kernel; Lin2016Association).

In cancer research, BUD13 expression has been studied in hepatocellular carcinoma and other cancers. High BUD13 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to immune cell infiltration and tumor microenvironment interactions. This suggests BUD13's potential role as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in certain cancers (Han2023The).

## Interactions
BUD13 is a component of the RES complex, which plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing and retention. In yeast, BUD13 interacts with Snu17p and Pml1p to form the heterotrimeric RES complex. BUD13 binds to Snu17p with high affinity, primarily through its C-terminal region, which contains a UHM-ligand motif (ULM) that interacts with the U2AF-homology motif (UHM) in Snu17p's RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domain (Brooks2008Structure; Wysoczański2014Cooperative). This interaction is characterized by a cooperative assembly that enhances RNA binding efficiency within the spliceosome (Wysoczański2014Cooperative).

In human cells, BUD13 is involved in stabilizing CDK12 mRNA, which is crucial for its expression. This interaction has been confirmed through RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assays, indicating that BUD13 directly binds to CDK12 mRNA, enhancing its stability and promoting vasculogenic mimicry in glioblastoma cells (Liu2022The). BUD13's role in RNA processing is further supported by its interaction with METTL3, an m6A methylation regulator, which stabilizes BUD13 mRNA through m6A methylation (Liu2022The). These interactions highlight BUD13's significant role in RNA stability and processing, contributing to its potential oncogenic functions.
