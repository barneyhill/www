# CDCA7L

## Overview
CDCA7L, or cell division cycle associated 7-like, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cell cycle and tumor progression. The CDCA7L protein is characterized by its interaction with key oncogenic factors, such as the c-Myc transcription factor, and plays a significant role in modulating transcriptional activity and cellular growth pathways. It is categorized as a transcriptional regulator due to its influence on gene expression and cell proliferation. CDCA7L is notably upregulated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, where it contributes to tumorigenicity and cell cycle progression. The protein's interactions and regulatory functions make it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment (TIAN2013CDCA7L; Funabiki2023Coevolution).

## Clinical Significance
CDCA7L is significantly implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The gene is notably upregulated in HCC tissues compared to non-cancerous tissues, with overexpression observed in a substantial number of HCC cases. This overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumorigenicity, as demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo models. CDCA7L promotes cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase and activates the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, contributing to HCC progression. Knockdown of CDCA7L results in reduced proliferation and tumorigenicity, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for HCC (TIAN2013CDCA7L).

In contrast, CDCA7, a related gene, is involved in DNA repair processes and is associated with immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome. Mutations in CDCA7 can lead to defects in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), resulting in chromosomal instability, poor cell proliferation, and increased apoptosis. These mutations disrupt the interaction with HELLS, affecting chromatin binding and nucleosome remodeling, which are crucial for maintaining genomic stability (Unoki2018CDCA7; Jenness2018HELLS).

## Interactions
CDCA7L interacts with the c-Myc oncogene, a well-known transcription factor involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor progression. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, as CDCA7L is upregulated in various tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CDCA7L complements the c-Myc transformation-defective mutant W135E and enhances Myc-mediated transformation, indicating its role in promoting oncogenic processes (TIAN2013CDCA7L).

CDCA7L also interacts with the monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) promoter, suppressing its enzymatic activity. This suppression leads to increased expression of cell cycle enhancers such as E2F1 and cyclin D, further contributing to cell proliferation and tumor progression (TIAN2013CDCA7L).

The interaction between CDCA7L and c-Myc is facilitated through specific protein domains, with CDCA7L using a leucine zipper to bind c-Myc. This interaction is distinct from that of its paralog CDCA7, which uses a different region overlapping with a nuclear localization signal to interact with c-Myc (Funabiki2023Coevolution). These interactions highlight CDCA7L's role in modulating transcriptional activity and influencing cellular growth pathways.
