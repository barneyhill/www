# AMBP

## Overview
The AMBP gene encodes the alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor, a multifunctional protein that is cleaved into two distinct entities: alpha-1-microglobulin (A1M) and bikunin. A1M is a member of the lipocalin protein family, known for its role in binding small hydrophobic molecules and protecting cells from oxidative stress through its radical scavenging and heme-binding capabilities (Olsson2012Pathological; Kristiansson2020The). Bikunin, on the other hand, functions as a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor, contributing to inflammation regulation and tissue protection (Olsson2012Pathological). The AMBP gene is expressed primarily in the liver but is also found in various other tissues, where it plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and participating in immune responses (Kristiansson2020The). The gene's products are involved in numerous physiological processes, including neuroprotection and extracellular matrix interactions, highlighting their significance in both health and disease (Cheyuo2012The; Cinar2011Association).

## Structure
The AMBP gene encodes a precursor protein that is cleaved into two distinct proteins: alpha-1-microglobulin (A1M) and bikunin. A1M is a member of the lipocalin protein family, characterized by a common protein fold consisting of an antiparallel eight-stranded β-barrel with one closed and one open end, which serves as a binding site for small hydrophobic compounds (Olsson2012Pathological; Åkerström1990An). The protein is composed of 183 amino acids and is glycosylated at three positions: Asn 17, Asn 96, and Thr 5 (Åkerström1990An; Penders2004Alpha). A1M's structure includes a free reactive cysteine side chain at position Cys 34, which is involved in complex formation with plasma proteins (Penders2004Alpha).

Bikunin, the other product of the AMBP gene, is a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor and a structural component of the extracellular matrix (Olsson2012Pathological). The AMBP gene's precursor protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage by furin or other proprotein convertases in the Golgi system, separating A1M and bikunin before secretion (Olsson2012Pathological). The gene's structure includes a basic cleavage site, R-V-R-R, recognized by these convertases (Olsson2012Pathological).

## Function
The AMBP gene encodes a precursor protein that is cleaved into two distinct proteins: alpha-1-microglobulin (A1M) and bikunin. A1M is a small glycoprotein involved in protective functions such as reductase and radical-binding, and is part of the lipocalin protein family. It is primarily synthesized in the liver but is expressed in most nucleated cells. A1M acts as a radical scavenger and heme-binding protein, protecting cells and tissues from oxidative stress. It circulates in the bloodstream, where it can bind to IgA, prothrombin, and albumin, and is eventually filtered by the kidneys and reabsorbed in the proximal tubular cells. A1M's role in cell biology includes protecting against oxidative stress and maintaining mitochondrial function (Kristiansson2020The).

Bikunin functions as a protease inhibitor, playing a role in inflammation and tissue protection. Both proteins are primarily active in the extracellular space, contributing to various physiological processes, including immune response and tissue homeostasis (Cinar2011Association). The AMBP gene's expression is potentially regulated by the Nrf2 pathway, which responds to oxidative stress by activating cytoprotective genes (Kristiansson2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AMBP gene, which encodes the alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor, have been implicated in various diseases. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), AMBP is significantly underexpressed, and this underexpression is associated with poor prognosis, including higher rates of metastasis and lower overall survival. This suggests that AMBP could serve as a prognostic biomarker in OSCC (Sekikawa2018Underexpression).

In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), AMBP is upregulated in high-risk cases compared to controls, indicating its potential role in the severity of the disease. This upregulation aligns with its involvement in carcinogenesis and suggests that AMBP could be a biomarker for leukemia progression (Braoudaki2013Protein).

In the context of neurodegenerative disorders, AMBP-1, a form of AMBP, is involved in regulating the complement system, which is implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Altered AMBP-1 levels can lead to increased inflammation and neuronal apoptosis, highlighting its potential therapeutic role in these conditions (Cheyuo2012The).

## Interactions
The AMBP gene encodes a precursor protein that is cleaved into two distinct proteins: alpha-1-microglobulin and bikunin. These proteins are involved in various interactions that influence biological processes. AMBP, also known as complement factor H, interacts with adrenomedullin (AM) to form a complex that plays a crucial role in neuroprotection. This interaction is significant as AMBP-1 prevents the degradation of AM by matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and inhibits inflammation and neuronal apoptosis (Cheyuo2012The). The AM/AMBP-1 complex binds to its receptor on neuronal cell membranes, leading to increased intracellular cyclic AMP levels, which inhibit caspase-3-mediated apoptosis (Cheyuo2012The).

In addition to its role in neuroprotection, AMBP has been shown to interact with the protein GRB2, with a high confidence score of 5.8, indicating a reliable interaction supported by bioinformatics evidence such as shared GO annotations (Wang2008Protein). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of AMBP in various physiological processes, including its involvement in the immune system and extracellular matrix, influencing inflammation and protease inhibition.
