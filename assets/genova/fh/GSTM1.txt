# GSTM1

## Overview
The GSTM1 gene encodes the enzyme glutathione S-transferase mu 1, a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, which is crucial for cellular detoxification processes. This enzyme functions primarily in the cytoplasm, where it catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione to a variety of electrophilic compounds, aiding in the neutralization of toxins and carcinogens (Board2013Glutathione). The GSTM1 protein is characterized by its thioredoxin-like fold and typically forms homodimers, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Armstrong1997Structure; Hornby2000Equilibrium). GSTM1 plays a significant role in modulating cellular responses to oxidative stress by interacting with key signaling proteins, such as apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), thereby influencing apoptotic signaling and energy homeostasis (Tew2012GlutathioneSTransferases; Klaus2013Glutathione). Variations in the GSTM1 gene, particularly the null genotype, have been linked to altered susceptibility to various diseases, including certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (He2018CYP2E1; Vineis2007Evidence).

## Structure
GSTM1 is a member of the glutathione S-transferase family, which plays a crucial role in detoxification processes. The primary structure of GSTM1 consists of amino acid sequences that form specific secondary structures, including approximately 49% α-helices, 10% β-strands, and 15% β-turns (Hornby2000Equilibrium). The tertiary structure of GSTM1 features a thioredoxin-like fold, which is common among glutathione S-transferases (Armstrong1997Structure). This fold includes an N-terminal domain responsible for binding glutathione, characterized by a β-R-β-R-β-β-R structural motif, and a C-terminal domain that interacts with hydrophobic xenobiotic substrates (Malik2018Monomeric).

GSTM1 typically forms homodimers, representing its quaternary structure. The dimeric form is stabilized by a ball-and-socket hydrophobic interaction at the subunit interface, involving a phenylalanine residue (Armstrong1997Structure). This dimeric structure is essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity and stability (Hornby2000Equilibrium). Post-translational modifications such as acetylation have been observed in some GST subunits, although specific modifications for GSTM1 are not detailed (ROWE1997Subunit). Alternative splicing of GSTM1 can lead to different isoforms, which may have distinct functional roles (Ross1993Molecular).

## Function
The GSTM1 gene encodes an enzyme that is part of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, which plays a crucial role in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds by conjugating them with glutathione. This process is essential for neutralizing toxins and carcinogens, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Board2013Glutathione; Strange2001GlutathioneStransferase). GSTM1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is particularly important in the liver, where it aids in detoxification processes (Board2013Glutathione).

In healthy human cells, GSTM1 is involved in the regulation of stress kinase pathways, such as JNK and ASK1, which are part of the cellular response to oxidative stress. GSTM1 can bind to and inhibit ASK1, a kinase that activates the JNK and p38 pathways, thus playing a role in modulating apoptotic signaling and cell survival (Tew2012GlutathioneSTransferases). The enzyme also interacts with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), enhancing its activity through S-glutathionylation, which may affect energy homeostasis and signal transduction pathways (Klaus2013Glutathione).

## Clinical Significance
The GSTM1 gene is clinically significant due to its role in detoxifying carcinogenic compounds. Variations in GSTM1, particularly the null genotype, have been associated with increased susceptibility to several cancers. In lung cancer, the GSTM1 null genotype is linked to a higher risk, especially among smokers, due to impaired detoxification of carcinogens (He2018CYP2E1; Vineis2007Evidence). Similarly, the GSTM1 null genotype is associated with an increased risk of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), particularly when combined with smoking, and may affect treatment response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Rostami2019Influence).

In contrast, studies on breast cancer and gastric cancer have shown no significant association between the GSTM1 null genotype and increased risk, suggesting that the impact of GSTM1 polymorphisms may vary across different types of cancer and populations (GarciaGonzalez2012Relevance; LINHARES2005Genetic). The GSTM1 null genotype has also been investigated in relation to coronary artery disease, but findings have been inconclusive, with some studies suggesting a potential protective effect (Taspinar2012Impact). Overall, the clinical significance of GSTM1 polymorphisms highlights the importance of gene-environment interactions in disease susceptibility.

## Interactions
GSTM1 interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and stress responses. It forms a complex with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), inhibiting its activity and reducing apoptosis. Under oxidative stress, this complex dissociates, leading to ASK1 activation and promoting apoptosis (Wu2012Role; Mazari2023The). GSTM1 also interacts with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of energy homeostasis. This interaction involves the N-terminal domain of the AMPK beta subunit and leads to the enzymatic activation of both GSTM1 and AMPK through S-glutathionylation, enhancing AMPK activity (Klaus2013Glutathione).

GSTM1 is involved in the modulation of lung inflammation by interacting with kinases such as MEKK1, inhibiting its activity and suppressing MEKK1-mediated apoptosis (Wu2012Role). It also interacts with proteins involved in detoxification processes, such as CYP2E1 and NAT2, as part of a protein-protein interaction network that influences susceptibility to drug-induced liver injury (Chanhom2020GSTM1). These interactions highlight GSTM1's role in cellular detoxification and stress response pathways.
