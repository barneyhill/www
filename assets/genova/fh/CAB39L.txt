# CAB39L

## Overview
CAB39L, or calcium binding protein 39 like, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular signaling pathways. The protein functions primarily as a scaffold protein, facilitating the activation of liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), both of which are pivotal in regulating cellular energy homeostasis and maintaining cell polarity. Through its interactions, CAB39L plays a significant role in the modulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which is essential for controlling cell growth and proliferation. The protein's activity is predominantly cytoplasmic, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis and normal cellular functions. Alterations in CAB39L expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker (Pulito2017Metformininduced; Li2018CAB39L; Chakrabarti2024Metastatic).

## Function
CAB39L, also known as calcium binding protein 39 like, is a protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly through its interaction with the liver kinase B1 (LKB1) complex. In healthy human cells, CAB39L functions as an allosteric activator of LKB1, a kinase involved in various cellular processes, including energy metabolism and cell polarity (Chakrabarti2024Metastatic). CAB39L, along with other subunits such as STRADA, STRADB, and CAB39, forms a complex with LKB1 to activate it, which is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions (Chakrabarti2024Metastatic).

CAB39L is also involved in the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key player in cellular energy homeostasis. This activation is facilitated by CAB39L's role as a scaffold protein that binds to LKB1, enhancing the downstream activation of AMPK and subsequently inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway (Pulito2017Metformininduced). This pathway is important for regulating cell growth and proliferation, and its proper functioning is essential for preventing pathological processes such as fibrosis and cancer (Pulito2017Metformininduced). CAB39L is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal cellular functions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAB39L gene have been implicated in various cancers, including gastric cancer (GC) and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). In gastric cancer, CAB39L is frequently silenced due to promoter hypermethylation, which is associated with reduced mRNA and protein expression levels in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This silencing contributes to tumorigenesis by inhibiting the LKB1-AMPK pathway, which is crucial for tumor suppression. Overexpression of CAB39L in GC cell lines has been shown to reduce cell viability and promote apoptosis, while its knockdown enhances cell proliferation and metastasis. High promoter methylation of CAB39L correlates with poor survival outcomes, particularly in early-stage GC patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Li2018CAB39L).

In KIRC, CAB39L is downregulated due to hypermethylation, which correlates with advanced tumor grade and stage. This downregulation is linked to poorer clinical outcomes, including lower overall survival and progression-free survival. Overexpression of CAB39L in KIRC cell lines impairs cell proliferation and metastatic capacity, indicating its role as a tumor suppressor. CAB39L expression levels have significant diagnostic and prognostic value, with lower expression associated with worse outcomes in KIRC patients (Wu2023Bioinformatics).

## Interactions
CAB39L, also known as calcium-binding protein 39-like, is involved in several protein interactions that play a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It acts as a scaffold protein that binds to LKB1, facilitating the downstream activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This interaction is crucial for the activation of AMPK signaling pathways, which are important in regulating cellular energy homeostasis and have implications in cancer treatment (Pulito2017Metformininduced).

In the context of metformin treatment in breast cancer cells, CAB39L enhances the formation of the LKB1/CAB39L protein complex, leading to increased phosphorylation of AMPK. This interaction is associated with the anticancer effects of metformin, as it reduces clonogenicity and migration of cancer cells (Pulito2017Metformininduced). CAB39L is also involved in the modulation of the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway through the downregulation of miR-21-5p, which affects the levels of CAB39L and SESN1 proteins (Pulito2017Metformininduced).

While CAB39L's interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed, its role in protein complexes and signaling pathways highlights its importance in cellular processes and potential therapeutic applications (Pulito2017Metformininduced).
