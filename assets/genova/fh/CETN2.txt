# CETN2

## Overview
CETN2 is a gene that encodes the protein centrin 2, a member of the EF-hand superfamily of calcium-binding proteins. Centrin 2 is characterized by its helix-loop-helix motif and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including centrosome function, ciliogenesis, and DNA repair. As a multifunctional protein, centrin 2 is involved in centriole biogenesis and the nucleotide excision repair pathway, where it forms complexes with other proteins to maintain genomic stability. It is predominantly located at centrosomes and basal bodies but also participates in nuclear transport and DNA repair within the nucleus. The protein's interactions and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and SUMOylation, are essential for its diverse functions in cellular integrity and signaling pathways (Dantas2012Such; Ying2014Centrin; McClureBegley2017Nuclear).

## Structure
Centrin 2 (CETN2) is a calcium-binding protein that belongs to the EF-hand superfamily, characterized by its helix-loop-helix motif. The protein structure of CETN2 includes four EF-hand motifs arranged in pairs, which are crucial for calcium binding and facilitate target peptide recognition (Dantas2012Such). These EF-hand domains are responsible for the calcium-responsive actions of centrins, allowing them to undergo conformational changes essential for their function (Dantas2012Such).

The C-terminal domains of CETN2 have high-affinity calcium-binding sites, while the N-terminal domains exhibit lower affinity (Dantas2012Such). This differential affinity is significant for its role in various cellular processes, including centrosome function and microtubule organization. CETN2 also undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and SUMOylation. Phosphorylation at specific sites, like serine 170 and threonine 138, is important for its stability and function, influencing processes such as centriole separation and centrosome amplification (Dantas2012Such). SUMOylation affects CETN2's subcellular localization and enhances its interaction with the XPC protein, which is crucial for nucleotide excision repair (Dantas2012Such). These structural features and modifications underscore CETN2's role in maintaining cellular and genomic stability.

## Function
Centrin 2 (CETN2) is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in centriole biogenesis and ciliogenesis, essential for proper cell division and the formation of cilia, which are important for cellular signaling and movement (Dantas2012Such; Ying2014Centrin). CETN2 is also a component of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, where it forms a complex with XPC and HRAD23B to recognize and repair DNA lesions, thus maintaining genomic stability (Dantas2012Such; McClureBegley2017Nuclear).

In the context of ciliogenesis, CETN2 is crucial for the trafficking of proteins within olfactory cilia and the development of planar polarity in ependymal cilia, affecting processes like olfactory signaling and cerebrospinal fluid flow (Ying2014Centrin). It is also involved in regulating gene expression, particularly influencing fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways, which are important for embryonic development and mesoderm formation (Shi2015Centrin2).

CETN2 is predominantly located at centrosomes and basal bodies but is also found in the nucleus, where it participates in nuclear transport and DNA repair processes (McClureBegley2017Nuclear). Its dynamic distribution and interaction with various cellular components underscore its versatile role in maintaining cellular and genomic integrity.

## Clinical Significance
CETN2 (centrin 2) has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cell cycle regulation and centrosome function. In glioblastoma (GBM), CETN2 is overexpressed, and its high expression levels are associated with poor survival outcomes. This suggests that CETN2 could serve as a potential biomarker for identifying high-risk GBM patients (Lu2020Identification). The gene's involvement in nucleotide excision repair links it to cancer risk, as alterations in this pathway can lead to genomic instability (Katari2018Chromosomal).

In the context of reproductive health, CETN2 has been associated with idiopathic recurrent miscarriage (RM). Copy number variations (CNVs) involving CETN2 have been identified in individuals with a history of RM, suggesting that these genetic alterations may impact centrosome function and contribute to embryonic development issues (Sestari2022Copy). Additionally, CETN2 has been linked to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), where deletions in the Xq28 region, including CETN2, may lead to chromosomal instability and DNA repair deficiencies, affecting ovarian function (Katari2018Chromosomal).

In Alzheimer's disease, CETN2 is part of a predictive model for diagnosis, although its expression levels do not significantly differ between patients and controls, indicating its potential as a biomarker rather than a direct contributor to disease pathology (Liu2021Discovery).

## Interactions
Centrin 2 (CETN2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. CETN2 is a component of the nucleotide excision repair complex, specifically the XPC-RAD23-CETN2 complex, which is essential for DNA damage recognition and repair. It interacts directly with the xeroderma pigmentosum group C protein (XPC), stabilizing and localizing it to the nucleus, a process enhanced by calcium and SUMOylation (Dantas2012Such; McClureBegley2017Nuclear).

CETN2 also associates with the TREX-2 complex, which is linked to the Mediator complex, playing a role in gene expression regulation and mRNA export from the nucleus (McClureBegley2017Nuclear). In the context of ciliogenesis, CETN2 interacts with CP110, a known regulator of ciliogenesis, and is involved in the transport of signaling proteins such as adenylate cyclase III (ACIII) and cyclic nucleotide-gated channel A2 (CNGA2) in olfactory cilia (Dantas2012Such; Ying2014Centrin).

CETN2 is also phosphorylated by various kinases, including Aurora A, PKA, and CK2, which modulate its interactions and functions, such as binding to retinal G-protein complexes and ciliary microtubules (Dantas2012Such). These interactions highlight CETN2's multifaceted role in maintaining cellular integrity and function.
