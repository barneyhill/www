# LMTK2

## Overview
LMTK2, or lemur tyrosine kinase 2, is a gene located on human chromosome 7q21.3 that encodes a serine/threonine-specific kinase. The protein product, also referred to as LMTK2, is a transmembrane kinase involved in a variety of cellular processes, including intracellular transport, neuronal development, and signal transduction. It is characterized by a complex structure featuring transmembrane domains and a kinase domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in phosphorylation events. LMTK2 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, where it plays a crucial role in neuronal function and development. Its involvement in key signaling pathways and cellular processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (Manser2011Lemur; Cruz2019Unraveling; Bencze2018Biological).

## Structure
LMTK2, also known as lemur tyrosine kinase 2, is a serine/threonine-specific kinase encoded by a gene located on human chromosome 7q21.3. The protein is composed of 1503 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of approximately 250 kDa (Cruz2019Unraveling; Bencze2018Biological). Its primary structure includes a short soluble N-terminal domain, two hydrophobic transmembrane helices, and a kinase domain with an ATP binding site (Cruz2019Unraveling). The kinase domain is located between residues 137-407, and the ATP binding site spans residues 143-168 (Cruz2019Unraveling).

The secondary structure of LMTK2 features tandem amino-terminal transmembrane domains that anchor the protein in the membrane, positioning both its amino and carboxyl termini towards the cytoplasm (Bencze2018Biological). The tertiary structure includes a long carboxyl-terminal 'tail' rich in proline residues, forming seven PxxP motifs, which suggest potential interactions with proteins containing Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (Cruz2019Unraveling; Bencze2018Biological).

LMTK2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues, which is crucial for its kinase activity (Cruz2019Unraveling). The protein also contains a V1355TF motif that binds the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), necessary for inhibiting PP1 activity (Cruz2019Unraveling).

## Function
Lemur tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in regulating intracellular transport, particularly through its interactions with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C). LMTK2 phosphorylates PP1C at threonine 320, inhibiting its activity, which affects the phosphorylation state of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and kinesin-1 light chain-2 (KLC2) (Manser2011Lemur). This regulation is crucial for the transport of Smad2, a transcription factor involved in TGFβ signaling, by kinesin-1 motors (Manser2011Lemur).

LMTK2 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, where it is involved in neuronal development and differentiation. It interacts with proteins such as CDK5/p35 and myosin VI, indicating its role in neuronal functions and endocytic transport processes (Bencze2018Biological). LMTK2 also influences the kinesin-1 mediated transport along microtubules, impacting the TGF-β signaling pathway by modulating the phosphorylation of GSK3-β and KLC2 (Cruz2019Unraveling). These interactions highlight LMTK2's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential involvement in neurodegenerative diseases when disrupted (Bencze2018Biological).

## Clinical Significance
LMTK2 (lemur tyrosine kinase 2) is implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In prostate cancer, LMTK2 expression is significantly reduced in prostate adenocarcinoma tissues compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression. This reduction in expression is associated with increased androgen receptor activity, promoting tumor proliferation and potentially contributing to the castration-resistant phase of prostate cancer (Ferrari2021Lemur; Harries2010Alterations). Genetic variations, such as the rs6465657 variant, have been linked to altered LMTK2 expression, indicating a genetic influence on prostate cancer susceptibility (Harries2010Alterations).

In neurodegenerative diseases, LMTK2 is associated with disrupted axonal transport, tau hyperphosphorylation, and enhanced apoptosis, which are key features of disorders like Alzheimer's disease. Decreased LMTK2 expression in Alzheimer's models suggests its potential as a therapeutic target (Bencze2018Biological). LMTK2 is also involved in male infertility, where its knockout in mice leads to azoospermia, highlighting its role in spermatogenesis (Cruz2019Unraveling). These findings underscore the clinical significance of LMTK2 gene mutations and expression alterations across various diseases.

## Interactions
Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2 (LMTK2) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes and disease mechanisms. LMTK2 interacts with the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR), mediating its inhibitory phosphorylation and endocytosis, which affects CFTR-mediated chloride transport and the efficacy of CFTR-targeted therapies (Cruz2019Unraveling). It also interacts with the Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), inhibiting neuronal differentiation by affecting extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activation (Cruz2019Unraveling).

In the context of apoptosis, LMTK2 interacts with B-cell lymphoma (BCL) proteins, influencing the expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins, thereby enhancing the cytotoxic effects of apoptosis-inducing ligands (Cruz2019Unraveling). LMTK2 also interacts with the Androgen Receptor (AR), inhibiting its transcriptional activity, which is significant in prostate development and cancer (Cruz2019Unraveling).

LMTK2 is involved in axonal transport by interacting with kinesin light chains (KLC1 and KLC2) through a C-terminal WD motif, which is crucial for the anterograde transport of proteins like cdk5/p35 in neurons (Mórotz2019LMTK2). This interaction is essential for maintaining proper neuronal function and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathology due to reduced LMTK2 levels in affected brains (Mórotz2019LMTK2).
