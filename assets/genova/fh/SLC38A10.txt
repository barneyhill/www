# SLC38A10

## Overview
SLC38A10 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 38 member 10, also known as SNAT10. This protein is a member of the solute carrier family and functions as a sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter, primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. SLC38A10 plays a critical role in the transport and sensing of amino acids, impacting cellular metabolism and homeostasis. It is involved in the bidirectional transport of amino acids such as glutamine, glutamate, alanine, and aspartic acid, which are essential for protein synthesis and cell survival under stress conditions. The protein is categorized as a transceptor, a transporter with receptor-like functions, and is implicated in the mTOR signaling pathway, influencing protein synthesis and cellular growth. Dysregulation of SLC38A10 has been associated with various neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining neuronal homeostasis (Tripathi2019SLC38A10; Lindberg2023SLC38A10; Tripathi2022SLC38A10).

## Function
SLC38A10, also known as SNAT10, is a member of the solute carrier family 38 and functions as a sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter. It is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, where it plays a crucial role in amino acid transport and sensing, impacting cellular metabolism and homeostasis (Tripathi2019SLC38A10). SLC38A10 is involved in the bidirectional transport of amino acids such as glutamine, glutamate, alanine, and aspartic acid, which are essential for protein synthesis and cell survival under stress conditions (Lindberg2023SLC38A10; Tripathi2022SLC38A10).

The protein is suggested to function as a transceptor, a transporter with receptor-like functions, similar to other family members like SLC38A9, which is involved in signaling amino acid availability through the mTORC1 pathway (Tripathi2019SLC38A10). SLC38A10's role in the mTOR signaling pathway is significant, as it affects the phosphorylation of key regulators, thereby influencing protein synthesis and cellular growth (Tripathi2022SLC38A10). The absence of SLC38A10 can lead to dysregulation of glutamate homeostasis and mTOR signaling, which are critical for maintaining neuronal homeostasis and preventing neurodegenerative diseases (Tripathi2022SLC38A10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SLC38A10 gene have been associated with several neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. The gene plays a critical role in regulating glutamate homeostasis and the mTOR signaling pathway, and its dysfunction can lead to neurodegeneration. In particular, the absence of SLC38A10 has been linked to increased cell death and resistance to oxidative and glutamate toxicity, which are conditions associated with high glutamate levels under normal circumstances. This dysregulation is connected to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (Tripathi2022SLC38A10).

Lower expression of SLC38A10 has been detected in Alzheimer's disease brain lesions, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Tripathi2022SLC38A10). Genetic mutations in SLC38A10 have also been associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, indicating its involvement in neuropsychiatric conditions (Tripathi2022SLC38A10). The gene's role as a transceptor, sensing glutamate levels and modulating mTOR signaling, is crucial for maintaining neuronal homeostasis, and its dysfunction could contribute to the development of these disorders (Tripathi2022SLC38A10). The clinical significance of SLC38A10 mutations highlights its potential as a drug target and biomarker for these conditions (Tripathi2022SLC38A10).

## Interactions
SLC38A10, also known as SNAT10, is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments, where it plays a role in protein synthesis regulation. The protein has been shown to interact with the Golgi protein 58k, as demonstrated by proximity ligation assays, suggesting a functional role in the Golgi region of neuronal cells (Tripathi2019SLC38A10). Despite its intracellular localization, SLC38A10 does not co-localize with synaptic proteins such as SNAP25 or synaptophysin, indicating it is not expressed at synapses or the plasma membrane (Tripathi2019SLC38A10).

SLC38A10 is involved in the regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for protein synthesis and cell survival under stress. The absence of SLC38A10 affects the phosphorylation of proteins involved in the mTOR pathway, such as 4E-BP1 and P70S6K1, indicating its role in modulating mTOR signaling in response to amino acid availability (Tripathi2022SLC38A10). However, specific interactions of SLC38A10 with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies (Tripathi2019SLC38A10; Tripathi2022SLC38A10).
