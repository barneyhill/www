# FAM90A14

## Overview
FAM90A14 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, member A14. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by shared sequence motifs, which are often involved in various cellular processes, although the specific function of FAM90A14 remains to be fully elucidated. Proteins in this family are typically involved in regulatory roles within the cell, potentially influencing gene expression or signal transduction pathways. The FAM90A14 gene is located on chromosome 8, and its expression patterns and potential interactions with other cellular components are subjects of ongoing research. Understanding the precise role of FAM90A14 could have implications for elucidating its involvement in cellular homeostasis and disease mechanisms.
