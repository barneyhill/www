# ZBTB17

## Overview
ZBTB17 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 17, also known as MIZ-1. This protein is a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of peroxisome function and B cell development. As a zinc finger protein, MIZ-1 plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing pathways such as the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway in cardiac myocytes and the interleukin-7 receptor signaling in B cells (Buyandelger2015ZBTB17; Kosan2010Transcription). The gene's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in cellular metabolism, immune system development, and cardiac function. Mutations or alterations in ZBTB17 expression have been linked to diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and familial dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Sun2018ZBTB17; DoUmehara2020Epithelial).

## Structure


## Function
ZBTB17, also known as MIZ1, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating peroxisome function and B cell development in healthy human cells. In the context of peroxisomes, ZBTB17 acts as a transcriptional regulator, particularly influencing the import of peroxisomal proteins by modulating the expression of PEX13, a key protein involved in this process. This regulation is essential for maintaining peroxisome function, which is critical for metabolic processes such as purine metabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation, and reactive oxygen species metabolism (Liu2024CRISPR). ZBTB17's role in peroxisome regulation is independent of its ubiquitin ligase activity, as it retains function even without the BTB domain (Liu2024CRISPR).

In B cell development, ZBTB17 is involved in regulating interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) signaling, which is crucial for the survival and differentiation of B cell progenitors. It represses the expression of SOCS1, a negative regulator, and activates BCL2, a positive effector, thereby promoting the transition from pre-pro-B to pro-B cells (Kosan2010Transcription). ZBTB17's regulatory functions in these processes highlight its importance in cellular metabolism and immune system development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZBTB17 gene, also known as MIZ-1, have been linked to several diseases. In the context of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ZBTB17 acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling. Loss of ZBTB17 in lung epithelial cells leads to a COPD-like phenotype in mice, characterized by emphysema and chronic bronchitis. This is due to sustained NF-κB-dependent inflammation, which contributes to lung and airway destruction. The study also found that ZBTB17 protein levels are reduced in the lungs of COPD patients and mice exposed to cigarette smoke, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis (DoUmehara2020Epithelial).

In cardiac health, a heterozygous nonsense mutation in ZBTB17, specifically p.E243X, has been associated with familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). This mutation results in a truncated protein that lacks transcriptional activity, contributing to the disease's development. ZBTB17 is crucial for cardiac development and function, and its deletion in mice leads to cardiac defects and increased apoptosis (Sun2018ZBTB17; Buyandelger2015ZBTB17). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in both respiratory and cardiac conditions.

## Interactions
ZBTB17, also known as MIZ-1, is a zinc finger protein that engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with the MYC protein through a short helical domain located between zinc fingers 12 and 13 of MIZ-1. This interaction is significant in MYC-dependent tumorigenesis, as it mediates resistance to antimitogenic signals, which typically inhibit cell proliferation (Wiese2013The). MIZ-1 also forms heterodimers with Bcl-6, another POZ-domain oncoprotein, and interacts with Gfi-1 to repress cell-cycle inhibitors (Wiese2013The).

In the context of cardiac stress response, ZBTB17 interacts with CSRP3, a protein involved in cardiac myocyte survival and hypertrophy. This interaction is crucial for activating the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway, which is important for cardiac hypertrophy and cell survival (Buyandelger2015ZBTB17). 

ZBTB17 is also involved in the regulation of peroxisome protein import. It was identified as a significant factor in a CRISPR screen for peroxisome regulators, and its knockout resulted in defects in peroxisome protein import (Liu2024CRISPR). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of ZBTB17 in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
