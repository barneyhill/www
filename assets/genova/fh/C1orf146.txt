# C1orf146

## Overview
C1orf146 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 146. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not fully elucidated. It is categorized as a non-kinase protein, and current research suggests its involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which plays a role in cellular signaling and regulation (Qiu2020aarFDC). The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential implications in human health and disease, with ongoing studies aiming to further clarify their biological roles and interactions.
