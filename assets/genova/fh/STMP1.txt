# STMP1

## Overview
STMP1 is a gene that encodes the short transmembrane mitochondrial protein 1, a transmembrane protein localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane. This protein is integral to mitochondrial dynamics, including processes such as fission and fusion, which are essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity. It plays a significant role in regulating mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, both of which are crucial for cellular energy production and oxidative metabolism. The protein's interactions with components of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes suggest its involvement in enhancing oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, thereby supporting ATP production. Additionally, STMP1's regulatory role in ROS levels indicates its potential protective function against oxidative stress. Alterations in the expression of the STMP1 gene have been linked to various diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as Paget's disease of bone, retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury, and multiple sclerosis (CatalàSenent2021A; Zheng2023A).

## Function
STMP1, a short transmembrane mitochondrial protein, is involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly within the mitochondria. It is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane and plays a role in mitochondrial dynamics, including mitochondrial fission and fusion, which are essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity (Zheng2023A; Yamada2024Targeted). STMP1 is implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, both of which are crucial for cellular energy production and oxidative metabolism (Zheng2023A).

In healthy human cells, STMP1 is thought to interact with components of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes, potentially enhancing their activity and thus supporting efficient oxidative phosphorylation (Zheng2023A). This interaction is vital for ATP production, which is necessary for various cellular functions. The protein's role in regulating ROS levels also suggests a protective function against oxidative stress, which can damage cellular components if not properly managed (Zheng2023A).

STMP1's involvement in these mitochondrial processes indicates its importance in maintaining cellular metabolism and survival, although its specific functions in healthy human cells require further elucidation (Zheng2023A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the STMP1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Paget's disease of bone (PDB), a variant known as rs4294134 is associated with increased expression of STMP1 in osteoclasts, suggesting a regulatory role that may contribute to disease susceptibility (Mullin2019Genetic). Although the specific function of STMP1 in bone biology is unclear, its potential involvement in osteoclast activity highlights its clinical significance in PDB (Makaram2021Genetic).

In the context of neuroinflammation, STMP1, encoded by the lncRNA 181-Rik, has been shown to exacerbate microglia-mediated inflammation in retinal ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury. The micropeptide influences mitochondrial dynamics and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which are crucial for inflammatory responses (Zheng2023A). Knockdown of 181-Rik, which encodes STMP1, reduces inflammation and promotes retinal ganglion cell survival, indicating a potential therapeutic target for retinal IR injury (Zheng2023A).

In multiple sclerosis (MS), STMP1 is involved in the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and shows increased expression in females, suggesting a role in the disease's inflammatory processes (CatalàSenent2021A). These findings underscore the gene's involvement in immune dysregulation and its potential as a candidate for immunotherapies in MS.
