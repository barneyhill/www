# PAK1

## Overview
PAK1, or p21-activated kinase 1, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein involved in a variety of cellular processes. The PAK1 protein is a member of the PAK family of kinases, which are critical regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics, cell motility, and survival pathways. It is activated by small GTPases such as RAC1 and CDC42, which induce a conformational change that relieves autoinhibition and allows for its activation through autophosphorylation (Dummler2009Pak; Knaus1998The). PAK1 plays a significant role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cell movement and structure formation, such as lamellipodia and membrane ruffles (Bokoch2003Biology). Additionally, PAK1 is implicated in neuronal processes, including axonal guidance and synaptic plasticity, and is associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders when mutated (Kumar2017Structure; Harms2018Activating).

## Structure
PAK1 is a serine/threonine kinase with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein contains a C-terminal kinase domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain, which includes a p21-binding domain (PBD) and an autoinhibitory domain (AID) (Dummler2009Pak; Kumar2017Structure). The kinase domain is characterized by an N-lobe and C-lobe subdomain structure, typical of many kinases, and is involved in the catalytic activity of the protein (Jha20123D).

In its inactive state, PAK1 forms an obligate asymmetric homodimer, where the AID binds to the kinase domain, maintaining the protein in an autoinhibited conformation (Jha20123D). Activation of PAK1 occurs through the binding of small GTPases like RAC1 and CDC42, which disrupt the autoinhibitory interaction, allowing phosphorylation at Thr423 in the activation loop, a critical post-translational modification for its activation (Dummler2009Pak; Lei2005The).

PAK1 also exhibits structural flexibility, particularly in the N-lobe, which allows for the binding of various ligands and the design of specific inhibitors (Jha20123D). The protein can exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Kumar2017Structure).

## Function
PAK1 (p21-activated kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility in healthy human cells. It is activated by the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42, which induce a conformational change leading to PAK1 activation through autophosphorylation (Knaus1998The). PAK1 is involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, influencing the formation of structures such as lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, which are essential for cell movement (Bokoch2003Biology). It also affects the turnover of focal adhesions and the loss of actin stress fibers, crucial for cell motility (Bokoch2003Biology).

PAK1 regulates microtubule dynamics by phosphorylating stathmin/Op18, inhibiting its microtubule destabilizing activity, which is vital for microtubule function and cell motility (Bokoch2003Biology). It interacts with proteins like filamin A, enhancing its activity and contributing to cytoskeletal regulation (Bokoch2003Biology). PAK1 is also involved in cell survival pathways, participating in the phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic proteins and the activation of transcription factors associated with cell survival (Bokoch2003Biology). In the brain, PAK1 is crucial for neuronal processes such as axonal guidance and synaptic plasticity, influencing brain development and function (Kumar2017Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PAK1 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. De novo heterozygous missense variants in PAK1 have been linked to intellectual disability, macrocephaly, and seizures. These mutations often result in a gain-of-function effect, disrupting the normal autoinhibition of PAK1 dimers and affecting neuronal development by altering actin dynamics in neurite outgrowth (Harms2018Activating; Horn2019De). Specific mutations, such as p.Tyr131Cys and p.Tyr429Cys, have been identified in individuals with developmental delay, macrocephaly, seizures, and ataxic gait, suggesting enhanced kinase activity and dysregulated signaling pathways (Harms2018Activating).

PAK1 mutations are also implicated in severe regressive autism and epilepsy, with studies showing altered phosphorylation of downstream targets like JNK and ERK, and decreased β-catenin levels (Kernohan2019p21). These mutations are thought to lead to constitutive or higher basal kinase activity, contributing to the phenotypic consequences observed in affected individuals (Dobrigna2023The). The PAK1-LIMK1 pathway, activated by these mutations, is also involved in conditions like Fragile X Syndrome, which shares phenotypic similarities with PAK1-related disorders (Horn2019De).

## Interactions
PAK1 (p21-activated kinase 1) is involved in various protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. It interacts with the Nck adapter protein through the second SH3 domain of Nck, which binds to the first proline-rich motif of PAK1. This interaction is crucial for linking PAK1 to cell activation by growth factor receptors (Bokoch1996Interaction). PAK1 also forms a complex with Bam32 and PLC-γ1, which is essential for Erk activation independent of Ras. This complex involves direct binding between Bam32 S141 and the PLC-γ1 C-SH2 domain (RouquetteJazdanian2012LATIndependent).

PAK1 interacts with Raf-1, where its kinase domain binds and phosphorylates Raf-1 at Ser 338, leading to Raf-1 activation and subsequent MAPK activation (Zang2002Interaction). It also associates with the PAK1-βPIX-GIT1-paxillin signaling complex, which is involved in cell motility and focal adhesion turnover. This complex includes proteins like C-Myc BP, Diaphanous, and Talin-2, identified through mass spectrometry (Mayhew2006Identification).

PAK1 is activated by small GTPases Rac and Cdc42, which facilitate its interaction with LIM-kinase, leading to the phosphorylation of cofilin and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics (Edwards1999Activation).
