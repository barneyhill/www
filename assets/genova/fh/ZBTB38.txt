# ZBTB38

## Overview
ZBTB38 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 38, a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, chromatin organization, and response to oxidative stress. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which enable it to bind specifically to methylated DNA, and a BTB/POZ domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions. These structural features categorize ZBTB38 as a member of the zinc finger and BTB domain family of transcription factors. ZBTB38 plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and cellular function by interacting with chromatin remodeling complexes and other transcription factors. It is also implicated in the regulation of oxidative stress through its stabilization by the deubiquitinase USP9X, which prevents its degradation. Alterations in ZBTB38 expression have been associated with various diseases, including cancer and idiopathic short stature, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker (Miotto2018Stabilization; Pozner2018The; Filion2006A).

## Structure
ZBTB38 is a protein characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs and a BTB/POZ domain, which are common features in the zinc finger and BTB domain family. The zinc finger motifs in ZBTB38 facilitate its binding to methylated DNA, a function it shares with related proteins such as ZBTB4 and Kaiso. Specifically, ZBTB38 contains Kaiso-like zinc fingers, which are crucial for its DNA-binding and transcriptional repression activities (Filion2006A). The zinc finger domains of ZBTB38 range from residues 418 to 612 (Filion2006A).

The BTB/POZ domain, located at the N-terminal of ZBTB38, is involved in protein-protein interactions and is 47% identical to that of Kaiso over 100 amino acids, indicating a close evolutionary relationship (Filion2006A). This domain is essential for the protein's repressive function, as it interacts with other proteins to mediate transcriptional repression (Filion2006A).

ZBTB38 is subject to post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, which affects its stability. The deubiquitinase USP9X interacts with ZBTB38, stabilizing it by preventing its degradation through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (Miotto2018Stabilization). This interaction primarily occurs in the nucleus, where ZBTB38 is localized (Miotto2018Stabilization).

## Function
ZBTB38 is a transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression through its interaction with methylated DNA. It contains zinc finger domains that allow it to bind specifically to methylated CpG sites, influencing transcriptional responses. The C-terminal zinc fingers of ZBTB38 are particularly important for recognizing and binding to methylated DNA sequences, such as the mCZ38BS motif, which is present in numerous human genomic promoter regions (Pozner2018The).

In healthy human cells, ZBTB38 plays a crucial role in managing oxidative stress. It limits the basal production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is essential for mounting a proper response to oxidative stress. The stability of ZBTB38 is regulated by the deubiquitinase USP9X, which deubiquitinates and stabilizes the protein, thereby helping to control ROS levels and mitigate oxidative stress toxicity (Miotto2018Stabilization).

ZBTB38 is also involved in chromatin organization and gene expression regulation during development. It interacts with chromatin remodeling complexes and other transcription factors, suggesting a role in DNA replication and repair. This regulation is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function (de2018DNA).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZBTB38 gene have been linked to various cancers, including prostate and bladder cancer. In prostate cancer, low ZBTB38 expression is associated with aggressive cancer features, such as higher Gleason scores, elevated PSA levels, and increased genomic instability. This low expression correlates with shorter disease-free survival and a higher likelihood of disease recurrence, making it a potential prognostic marker for prostate cancer aggressiveness and progression (de2020Molecular). In bladder cancer, ZBTB38 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process linked to cancer metastasis. Knockdown of ZBTB38 reduces EMT, suggesting its role in cancer cell migration and invasion (Jing2018The).

ZBTB38 expression is also implicated in idiopathic short stature (ISS) in the Chinese Han population, where specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the gene are associated with ISS susceptibility (Wang2013An). In rheumatoid arthritis, hypomethylation of the ZBTB38 promoter leads to its overexpression, which downregulates anti-inflammatory genes, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Ocskó2018Transcription). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZBTB38 in various diseases, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker.

## Interactions
ZBTB38 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is stabilized by the deubiquitinase USP9X, which prevents its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining ZBTB38's stability and function, particularly in limiting oxidative stress in human cells (Miotto2018Stabilization). USP9X interacts with a central region of ZBTB38, and its enzymatic activity is essential for this stabilization (Miotto2018Stabilization).

ZBTB38 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase RBBP6, which promotes its degradation. USP9X can counteract the destabilizing effects of RBBP6, highlighting a regulatory balance between these proteins (Miotto2018Stabilization). In the context of prostate cancer, ZBTB38 interacts with PRKDC, a protein that inhibits its tumor-suppressive function. This interaction affects the expression of DKK1, a WNT signaling pathway inhibitor, which is crucial for ZBTB38's role in suppressing cancer cell proliferation and migration (Ding2021ZBTB38).

ZBTB38's C-terminal zinc fingers selectively bind to methylated CpG sites in DNA, influencing gene transcription. This binding is methylation-dependent and involves specific hydrogen bonding interactions, which are crucial for its role in gene regulation (Pozner2018The).
