# SMARCA4

## Overview
SMARCA4 is a gene that encodes the protein SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 4, commonly referred to as BRG1. This protein is a pivotal component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which is ATP-dependent and plays a significant role in modulating chromatin structure to regulate gene expression. As a chromatin remodeler, BRG1 is involved in repositioning nucleosomes, thereby influencing DNA accessibility for transcription, replication, and repair processes (Fernando2020Functional; Barutcu2016SMARCA4). The protein is characterized by several functional domains, including an ATPase module and a bromodomain, which are essential for its role in chromatin remodeling and interaction with other proteins and DNA (Allen2020Structure). SMARCA4 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle control and differentiation, and its mutations are associated with several cancers and genetic disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function (Mardinian2021SMARCA4:; Bellini2019Study).

## Structure
The SMARCA4 protein, also known as BRG1, is a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes, which are ATP-dependent and play a crucial role in gene expression by repositioning nucleosomes (Allen2020Structure). The protein contains several domains, including an ATPase module, a bromodomain, an HSA domain, and a BRK domain (Allen2020Structure). The ATPase module is essential for the protein's function in chromatin remodeling, facilitating ATP hydrolysis (Mashtalir2018Modular).

The BRK domain, located between residues 610 and 659, is a highly conserved region with a beta-beta-alpha-beta fold, forming a hydrophobic core and a shallow groove that may serve as a peptide binding site (Allen2020Structure). This domain is suggested to mediate protein-protein interactions within the SWI/SNF complex or with transcription factors (Allen2020Structure).

SMARCA4 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. The protein also has multiple splice variants, contributing to its functional diversity. These structural features and modifications underscore SMARCA4's role in transcriptional regulation and its involvement in various cellular processes.

## Function
The SMARCA4 gene encodes a core catalytic subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which is crucial for regulating gene expression and higher-order chromatin structure in healthy human cells (Fernando2020Functional; Barutcu2016SMARCA4). This complex uses ATP hydrolysis to disrupt nucleosomes, thereby influencing DNA accessibility for transcriptional regulation, DNA replication, and repair (Barutcu2016SMARCA4). SMARCA4 is involved in maintaining the balance between chromatin packaging and accessibility, which is vital for various nuclear processes, including cell cycle control and DNA repair (Barutcu2016SMARCA4).

In healthy cells, SMARCA4 is active in the nucleus, where it modulates the transcription of specific genes by repositioning nucleosomes, impacting cell differentiation, proliferation, and development (Fernando2020Functional). It is enriched at promoter regions and super-enhancers, suggesting its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Barutcu2016SMARCA4). SMARCA4 also plays a role in the organization of chromatin into topologically associating domains (TADs) and is involved in inter-chromosomal interactions between tissue-specific promoters (Barutcu2016SMARCA4). Its function is essential for maintaining genome integrity and nuclear structure, as well as for proper gene regulation and cellular function (Barutcu2016SMARCA4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SMARCA4 gene are implicated in a variety of cancers and genetic syndromes. SMARCA4 functions as a tumor suppressor and is frequently altered in approximately 5-7% of all cancers, including lung, colon, bladder, and breast carcinomas (Mardinian2021SMARCA4:). In particular, SMARCA4 mutations are characteristic of small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT), where inactivating mutations are present in 75-100% of cases (Mardinian2021SMARCA4:). These mutations are also associated with aggressive rhabdoid tumors, especially in infants and young children, linked to rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome-2 (RTPS2) (Mardinian2021SMARCA4:).

In neuroblastoma, SMARCA4 is frequently altered, with variations often located in domains crucial for chromatin remodeling, such as the ATPase domain. These alterations are associated with poorer overall survival in patients (Bellini2019Study). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SMARCA4 mutations are linked to poor prognosis, particularly when co-mutated with KRAS, leading to worse overall and progression-free survival (Manolakos2024A).

SMARCA4 is also associated with Coffin-Siris syndrome, a congenital disorder characterized by developmental delays and distinct physical features. In this syndrome, SMARCA4 mutations are often non-truncating, suggesting dominant-negative or gain-of-function effects (Mardinian2021SMARCA4:).

## Interactions
SMARCA4, also known as BRG1, is a key ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and participates in various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. It is involved in the recruitment of Topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) to chromatin, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability during transcription. SMARCA4's ATPase activity is crucial for this recruitment, and its depletion leads to transcription-associated genomic instability (Husain2016Chromatin).

SMARCA4 is part of the ATPase module of the SWI/SNF complex, interacting with components such as b-actin, ACTL6A, and ARID1 subunits. These interactions involve the HSA domain and catalytic domains of SMARCA4, highlighting its role in the assembly of BAF, PBAF, and ncBAF complexes (Mashtalir2018Modular).

In colorectal cancer, SMARCA4 interacts with PRMT1 to activate transcription of TNS4 and EGFR, enhancing cell proliferation and migration. This interaction is mediated by the binding of SMARCA4 to the H4R3me2a histone mark, a modification associated with transcriptional activation (Yao2021PRMT1mediated).

SMARCA4 also interacts with CTCF, a key component of topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries, influencing chromatin architecture and nucleosome positioning (Barutcu2016SMARCA4).
