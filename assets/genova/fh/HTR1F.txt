# HTR1F

## Overview
The HTR1F gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1F, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in serotonin signaling. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains and is involved in modulating various physiological processes by inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity, thereby reducing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels within cells (Sun2021Molecular). The 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1F is expressed in several brain regions and is implicated in the regulation of migraines, potentially serving as a therapeutic target due to its high affinity for antimigraine drugs (Hoyer2002Molecular). Additionally, it interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, influencing cellular responses and physiological processes, including mood and cognition (Sun2021Molecular; Lee2024An). The receptor's involvement in the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade further underscores its significance in cellular proliferation and differentiation (Sun2021Molecular).

## Structure
The HTR1F gene encodes a 366-amino acid protein that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically involved in serotonin signaling. This receptor features seven transmembrane domains, which are characteristic of GPCRs, and includes a conserved 'DRY' motif at the C-terminal of the third transmembrane domain, essential for receptor function (Sun2021Molecular). The primary structure of HTR1F is highly conserved across species, showing significant sequence identity with orthologs in other vertebrates, such as mice and humans (Sun2021Molecular).

The secondary structure of HTR1F includes these transmembrane alpha-helices, which are crucial for its function as a receptor. The receptor also contains two cysteine residues that are important for disulfide bond formation, contributing to its structural stability (Sun2021Molecular). 

Post-translational modifications of HTR1F include potential N-glycosylation sites at the N-terminus, which may play a role in receptor folding and function (Sun2021Molecular). The receptor is hypothesized to function as a 5-HT autoreceptor, with high affinity for antimigraine drugs such as sumatriptan and naratriptan, indicating its potential role in migraine treatment (Hoyer2002Molecular).

## Function
The HTR1F gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1F, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in serotonin signaling. This receptor primarily functions by inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity, leading to a reduction in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels within cells (Sun2021Molecular). The decrease in cAMP levels subsequently affects various downstream signaling pathways, including the MAPK/ERK cascade, which plays a role in cellular responses such as proliferation and differentiation (Sun2021Molecular).

In humans, HTR1F is expressed in several brain regions and is implicated in the regulation of migraines. It is thought to exert its effects by modulating neurotransmission in the trigeminal nerve endings around blood vessels, which are involved in migraine pathophysiology (Sun2021Molecular). The receptor's activity in the central nervous system also suggests a role in mood and cognition, although specific functions in these areas are less well-defined. The receptor's ability to bind selective agonists, such as LY344864, highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for migraine treatment (Sun2021Molecular). Overall, HTR1F contributes to the complex regulation of serotonin-mediated physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
The HTR1F gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1F, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in serotonin signaling. This receptor participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing cellular responses and physiological processes. 

HTR1F has been shown to interact with transcription factors in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) family. Specifically, a binding site in the promoter region of the HTR1F gene exhibits matrix similarity to predicted glucocorticoid responsive elements (GRE), suggesting potential interactions with GR family members. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) confirmed sequence-dependent DNA-protein interactions, indicating that these interactions may involve different GR family members, dimerization of binding proteins, or conformational changes of the bound oligonucleotides (Falkenberg2010Identification).

In chickens, HTR1F is involved in the inhibition of prolactin secretion by affecting the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. The receptor is activated by serotonin and selective agonists, which down-regulate intracellular cAMP levels and stimulate the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade. This suggests that HTR1F interacts with G proteins to mediate these effects (Sun2021Molecular).

In human beta cells, HTR1F negatively regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and is involved in cell survival during transplantation. It is a Gi/o-coupled receptor, and its antagonism increases cAMP levels, indicating interactions with G proteins that affect cAMP signaling (Lee2024An).
