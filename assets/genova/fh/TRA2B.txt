# TRA2B

## Overview
TRA2B is a gene that encodes the transformer 2 beta homolog (Tra2β) protein, a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. The Tra2β protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) and is involved in the splicing of both constitutive and alternative exons, thereby influencing the expression of multiple mRNA isoforms from a single gene. This regulation is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell viability and the DNA damage response. Tra2β interacts with other splicing factors and binds specific RNA sequences to modulate exon inclusion, contributing to the diversity of protein isoforms in human cells. The gene's alternative splicing results in multiple isoforms, with TRA2β1 being the functional form. TRA2B's dysregulation has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Shatokhina2023TRA2B; Best2014Human).

## Structure
The human TRA2B gene encodes the Tra2β protein, which is a member of the serine/arginine-rich protein family and plays a crucial role in RNA splicing. The protein contains a single RNA recognition motif (RRM) that spans residues Asn110-Thr201, with the core RRM body comprising residues Leu120-Phe193. This RRM adopts a canonical fold characterized by a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet and two α-helices, along with an additional β-hairpin and loop structure (Tsuda2010Structural). The RRM is involved in binding specific RNA sequences, such as CAA and (GAA)2, through hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions (Tsuda2010Structural).

The Tra2β protein exhibits dual RNA-recognition modes, facilitated by its structural features, including an unusual alignment of aromatic amino acids on the β-sheet surface, which is distinct from canonical RRMs (Tsuda2010Structural). The N- and C-terminal extensions of the RRM are flexible in the absence of RNA but become structured upon RNA binding, contributing to RNA interaction (Tsuda2010Structural).

TRA2B is alternatively spliced to produce multiple isoforms, including TRA2β1 and TRA2β4. TRA2β1 is translated into the functional Tra2β protein, while TRA2β4 does not encode a full-length protein due to premature stop codons (Nishikawa2019HnRNPA1). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions.

## Function
The TRA2B gene encodes the Tra2β protein, a member of the serine/arginine-rich splicing factor-like family, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of alternative splicing in human cells. Tra2β is involved in the splicing of both constitutive and alternative exons, impacting the expression of multiple mRNA isoforms from a single gene. This regulation is essential for maintaining cell viability and proper DNA damage response, as Tra2β is particularly important in the splicing of exons in genes associated with chromosome biology, such as CHEK1, which is involved in the DNA damage response (Best2014Human).

Tra2β binds to specific RNA sequences, including AGAA-rich and CAA-rich motifs, to regulate splicing inclusion. It interacts with other splicing factors, such as Tra2α, to control the splicing of various target exons, including those in the ATRX, GLYR1, and CEP95 genes (Best2014Human). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences the inclusion or exclusion of specific exons during mRNA processing, contributing to the diversity of protein isoforms in human cells (Nishikawa2019HnRNPA1). Tra2β's role in splicing regulation is crucial for normal development and physiology, ensuring proper exon inclusion in healthy human cells (Best2014Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TRA2B gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. In ovarian cancer, TRA2B is overexpressed and correlates with disease progression. High levels of TRA2B are associated with shorter overall survival and progression-free survival in patients. It influences the expression and alternative splicing of genes involved in the mitotic cell cycle, DNA replication, and apoptosis, contributing to the malignant phenotype of ovarian cancer (ZHOU2023Transformer). 

In breast cancer, TRA2B, also known as Tra2-β1, is significantly upregulated and regulates the alternative splicing of the CD44 gene, which is linked to tumor progression and metastasis (Watermann2006Splicing). 

TRA2B mutations are also associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. A novel de novo splice variant in TRA2B has been linked to a syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, and epilepsy. This mutation leads to an aberrant transcript, causing a dominant-negative effect and resulting in a truncated protein (Shatokhina2023TRA2B). 

In lung squamous cell carcinoma, a TRA2B-DNAH5 fusion acts as an oncogenic driver, promoting tumor progression through the upregulation of MMP1 and activation of the ERK1/2 pathway (Li2016Identification).

## Interactions
TRA2B, also known as transformer 2 beta homolog, is a splicing factor that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is a member of the SR protein family, which is known for its role in pre-mRNA splicing. TRA2B interacts with other splicing factors such as SRSF1 and SRSF2, forming complexes that influence alternative splicing events (Liu2017Angulin). The protein contains a central RNA recognition motif (RRM) flanked by RS domains, allowing it to bind specific RNA sequences, including AGAA-rich and CAA-rich sequences (Best2014Tra2; Tsuda2010Structural).

TRA2B also interacts with ILDR1 and ILDR2 proteins, which are involved in regulating alternative pre-mRNA splicing. These interactions are mediated by the RS domain of TRA2B and are confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Liu2017Angulin). Additionally, TRA2B can bind cooperatively with other RNA binding proteins to exonic sequences, highlighting its role in splicing regulation (Grellscheid2011Identification). These interactions are crucial for TRA2B's function in splicing regulation, affecting processes such as brain development and chromatin remodeling (Grellscheid2011Identification).
