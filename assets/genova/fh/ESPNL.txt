# ESPNL

## Overview
The ESPNL gene encodes the espin-like protein, which is a crucial component in the maintenance and function of stereocilia in sensory hair cells, particularly within the cochlea and utricle. This protein is involved in actin filament bundling, although it does not crosslink actin filaments like its homolog, ESPN-1. Instead, ESPNL interacts with myosin III motors, specifically MYO3A and MYO3B, to regulate the length and spacing of stereocilia, which are essential for auditory function. The protein's role is particularly significant in the early postnatal stages, where its expression is critical for preventing high-frequency hearing loss by maintaining the structure of the shortest row of stereocilia in cochlear outer hair cells. Mutations in the ESPNL gene have been linked to hereditary forms of deafness, highlighting its clinical significance in auditory health (Boucher2020Ultrarare; Ebrahim2016Stereociliastaircase).

## Structure
The ESPNL protein, encoded by the ESPNL gene, is involved in actin filament bundling within hair bundles of the cochlea and utricle. Its primary structure includes specific peptide sequences that have been identified and analyzed, although detailed sequences are not provided in the context (Ebrahim2016Stereociliastaircase). The secondary structure of ESPNL is predicted using PSIPRED, with a focus on the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD), which shows an estimated sequence homology of 54% with ESPN-1, suggesting a similar folding pattern (Ebrahim2016Stereociliastaircase).

The ARD of ESPNL has been modeled using I-TASSER, with the human ankyrin R protein as a template, indicating a close structural similarity to ESPN-1, as evidenced by a root-mean-square deviation of 1.76 Å for 330 residues (Ebrahim2016Stereociliastaircase). ESPNL interacts with MYO3A and MYO3B through its ARD, which binds to their tail homology domain 1 (THD1), playing a crucial role in actin-protrusion elongation (Ebrahim2016Stereociliastaircase). However, specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures of ESPNL are not provided in the context. The protein does not crosslink actin, unlike ESPN-1, due to the absence of additional actin-binding modules (Ebrahim2016Stereociliastaircase).

## Function
The ESPNL gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the function and maintenance of stereocilia in sensory hair cells, which are essential for hearing and balance. ESPNL is localized at the tips of stereocilia, particularly in the second and shorter rows, and its expression levels vary between different stereocilia (Ebrahim2016Stereociliastaircase). It binds to actin filaments but does not crosslink them, unlike its homolog ESPN-1, due to the absence of additional actin-binding modules (Ebrahim2016Stereociliastaircase). ESPNL is transported by myosin IIIA and IIIB motors, which are critical for its localization at the stereocilia tips (Ebrahim2016Stereociliastaircase).

In the cochlea, ESPNL expression is transient, decreasing significantly after early postnatal stages, and its absence leads to high-frequency hearing loss due to the specific loss of the shortest row of stereocilia in cochlear outer hair cells (Ebrahim2016Stereociliastaircase). ESPNL is involved in regulating the length and spacing of stereocilia, which is vital for auditory function (Ebrahim2016Stereociliastaircase). It also plays a role in inhibiting filopodia elongation when MYO3A is present, indicating a regulatory function in actin process elongation (Ebrahim2016Stereociliastaircase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ESPNL gene are associated with hereditary forms of deafness, specifically DFNA/DFNB36. The ESPNL gene encodes a multifunctional actin-bundling protein found in inner and outer hair cells, which are critical for hearing. A specific mutation, c.2515C > A; p.(Pro839Thr), has been identified in this gene, suggesting its role in hereditary deafness (Boucher2020Ultrarare). This mutation affects the actin-binding domain of the espin protein, leading to defective targeting of coexpressed myosin-IIIa, which is crucial for proper auditory function (Boucher2020Ultrarare).

Alterations in ESPNL expression or function can disrupt the organization of actin filaments, impacting cellular processes essential for hearing. The gene's role in actin filament bundling is vital for maintaining the structure and function of hair cells in the cochlea, and mutations can lead to significant hearing impairments. The clinical significance of ESPNL mutations underscores the importance of genetic analysis in diagnosing and understanding hereditary hearing loss, as these mutations can lead to early-onset deafness and contribute to severe presbycusis (Boucher2020Ultrarare).

## Interactions
ESPNL (espin-like) is a protein that interacts with myosin III motors, specifically MYO3A and MYO3B, in hair bundles. It binds to the tail homology domain 1 (THD1) of both MYO3A and MYO3B, as demonstrated by experiments using GFP-tagged proteins and glutathione-agarose beads. This binding is specific, as pre-and post-THD1 constructs of MYO3A and MYO3B did not bind to ESPNL (Ebrahim2016Stereociliastaircase). ESPNL is transported to filopodia tips by MYO3A, but not by MYO3B, indicating a specific interaction with MYO3A in cellular transport processes (Ebrahim2016Stereociliastaircase).

ESPNL also interacts with actin filaments, although it does not crosslink them like its homolog ESPN-1. It contains a sequence with high homology to a region within the actin-binding module of ESPN-1, allowing it to co-localize with the actin filament network (Ebrahim2016Stereociliastaircase). In COS7 cells, ESPNL co-localizes with MYO3A at filopodia tips at low expression levels, but higher levels of ESPNL lead to the disappearance of filopodia and co-localization of MYO3A with actin structures in the cytoplasm (Ebrahim2016Stereociliastaircase). These interactions suggest that ESPNL plays a significant role in the structural organization and function of hair bundles through its interactions with myosin III proteins and actin.
