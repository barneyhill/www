# CLDN11

## Overview
The CLDN11 gene encodes the protein claudin 11, a member of the claudin family, which is integral to the formation and function of tight junctions in various tissues. Claudin 11 is a tetraspan transmembrane protein, characterized by its four transmembrane helices and two extracellular loops, which facilitate homophilic interactions essential for tight junction integrity (Gjervan2024Claudin11; Krause2015Assembly). This protein plays a crucial role in the central nervous system, particularly in oligodendrocytes, where it contributes to the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath, thereby ensuring efficient nerve conduction (Gjervan2024Claudin11). Additionally, claudin 11 is involved in the regulation of ion movement in the inner ear and the maintenance of the blood-testis barrier, highlighting its diverse physiological functions (Gjervan2024Claudin11). Alterations in the CLDN11 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including hypomyelinating leukodystrophy and certain cancers, underscoring its significance in both health and disease (Riedhammer2020De; Li2018Inactivation).

## Structure
Claudin 11 (CLDN11) is a member of the claudin family, characterized by its tetraspan transmembrane structure, which includes four transmembrane helices and two extracellular loops (ECL1 and ECL2) that are crucial for its function in tight junctions (Gjervan2024Claudin11; Krause2015Assembly). The protein is approximately 20-34 kDa in size and is classified as a non-classic claudin due to its lower sequence similarity with classic claudins (Gjervan2024Claudin11).

The extracellular loops of claudin 11 are involved in homophilic interactions, meaning they interact with the same claudin across opposing cell membranes, which is essential for the formation and function of tight junctions (Gjervan2024Claudin11). The second extracellular loop (ECL2) is shorter in claudin 11 compared to other claudins, which may influence its specific interaction properties (Krause2015Assembly).

Claudin 11 is known to form homophilic interactions, contributing to its role in maintaining the integrity of tight junctions in specific tissues such as the central nervous system, inner ear, and testes (Gjervan2024Claudin11). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its function in regulating ion diffusion and maintaining myelin permeability in the nervous system (Gjervan2024Claudin11).

## Function
Claudin 11 (CLDN11) is a critical component of tight junctions, which are essential for maintaining the integrity and function of various tissues. In the central nervous system (CNS), CLDN11 is predominantly expressed in oligodendrocytes, where it plays a vital role in the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath. This sheath insulates axons, facilitating efficient nerve conduction by maintaining electrochemical gradients and electrical resistance (Gjervan2024Claudin11). CLDN11 constitutes approximately 7% of total myelin protein and is localized within the radial component of the myelin sheath, regulating ion diffusion and myelin permeability (Gjervan2024Claudin11).

In the inner ear, CLDN11 is expressed in the basal cells of the stria vascularis, where it regulates ion movement and contributes to the generation of the endocochlear potential, which is essential for hearing (Gjervan2024Claudin11). In the testes, CLDN11 is a key component of the blood-testis barrier, crucial for spermatogenesis, as its absence results in infertility (Gjervan2024Claudin11).

CLDN11 also plays a significant role in bone homeostasis by regulating osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis. It interacts with EphrinB2 and EphB4, facilitating signaling pathways that maintain the balance between bone resorption and formation (Baek2018Claudin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CLDN11 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. De novo stop-loss variants in CLDN11 have been identified as a cause of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (HLD), specifically HLD22. These variants result in a 39-amino acid extension at the cytoplasmic C-terminal end of claudin-11, which is predicted to form an alpha helix that does not integrate into the cytoplasmic membrane. This leads to symptoms such as delayed developmental milestones, contractures, nystagmus, drooling, hypermetropia, and severe disarticulation in affected individuals (Riedhammer2020De; Gjervan2024Claudin11).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), the CLDN11 gene is frequently hypermethylated and downregulated, which contributes to cancer progression by promoting cell migration and invasion. This hypermethylation prevents the binding of transcription factors necessary for CLDN11 expression, thereby inactivating its tumor suppressor function. The gene's interaction with microtubule components is crucial for maintaining cell structure, and its downregulation is associated with increased cell motility and invasiveness in NPC and other cancers (Li2018Inactivation). The hypermethylation of CLDN11 may serve as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in these cancers (Li2018Inactivation).

## Interactions
Claudin 11 (CLDN11) is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in bone homeostasis and myelin formation. In the context of bone metabolism, CLDN11 interacts with the EphrinB2 ligand in osteoclasts (OCs) and the EphB4 receptor in osteoblasts (OBs). These interactions are part of a bidirectional signaling pathway that regulates osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis. CLDN11 selectively interacts with EphrinB2 in OCs, negatively controlling osteoclast function, while in OBs, it interacts with EphB4 to promote osteoblast differentiation (Baek2018Claudin).

In the central nervous system, CLDN11 is a component of tight junctions in myelin sheaths. It is crucial for the formation of the radial component of myelin, which is essential for proper nerve function. Mutations in CLDN11, such as de novo stop-loss variants, can lead to structural changes in the protein, potentially disrupting its interaction with intracellular proteins and contributing to conditions like hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (Riedhammer2020De).

CLDN11 expression is also regulated by microRNA-1275 in glioma stem-like cells, where miR-1275 targets the 3' UTR of CLDN11 mRNA, suppressing its expression and affecting cell proliferation (Katsushima2012Contribution).
