# GFOD1

## Overview
The GFOD1 gene encodes the Gfo/Idh/MocA-like oxidoreductase domain containing 1 protein, which is categorized as an oxidoreductase. This protein is primarily involved in redox reactions, playing a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy production through its activity in the cytoplasm. By facilitating the transfer of electrons between molecules, the GFOD1 protein helps regulate oxidative stress and maintain the cellular redox balance, which is essential for efficient energy production and the mitigation of reactive oxygen species. The involvement of GFOD1 in various metabolic pathways suggests its potential impact on cellular growth, differentiation, and broader organismal health, including tissue development and repair. While the exact mechanisms and extent of GFOD1's influence are still under investigation, its role in these fundamental processes underscores its importance in cellular and physiological contexts (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function
GFOD1 encodes a protein that is involved in oxidoreductase activity, which is essential for redox reactions within cells. These reactions are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy production. The protein encoded by GFOD1 is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it may influence various metabolic pathways. By participating in these pathways, GFOD1 plays a role in cellular growth and differentiation. The oxidoreductase activity of the GFOD1 protein involves the transfer of electrons between molecules, a process that is vital for the regulation of oxidative stress and the maintenance of cellular redox balance. This activity supports the proper functioning of cells by ensuring that energy production processes are efficient and that harmful reactive oxygen species are kept in check. The influence of GFOD1 on metabolic pathways suggests that it may have broader implications for organismal health, potentially affecting processes such as tissue development and repair. The precise mechanisms by which GFOD1 impacts these pathways and the extent of its influence on cellular and organismal outcomes remain areas of active research.
