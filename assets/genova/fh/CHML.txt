# CHML

## Overview
The CHML gene encodes the Rab escort protein-2 (REP-2), a critical component in the post-translational modification of Rab proteins, which are small GTPases involved in vesicular transport and membrane fusion. As a member of the Rab escort protein family, REP-2 facilitates the prenylation process by attaching geranylgeranyl groups to Rab proteins, thereby enabling their proper localization and function within cellular membranes (Cremers1994REP2). This protein plays a versatile role in intracellular trafficking, compensating for REP-1 deficiencies in non-retinal tissues and supporting the function of various Rab proteins, including RablA, Rab5A, and Rab6 (Cremers1994REP2). The CHML gene's expression and function have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer prognosis and potentially in other diseases, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and disease pathology (Zhang2019High).

## Function
The CHML gene encodes the Rab escort protein-2 (REP-2), which plays a crucial role in the prenylation of Rab proteins, a post-translational modification essential for their function in vesicular transport and membrane fusion. REP-2 facilitates the attachment of geranylgeranyl groups to Rab proteins, enabling their association with cellular membranes and proper functioning in intracellular trafficking processes (Cremers1994REP2). 

In healthy human cells, REP-2 can substitute for REP-1, particularly in tissues other than the retina, to support the Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (Rab GGTase) reaction. This compensatory mechanism is significant when REP-1 is deficient, as seen in conditions like choroideremia (Cremers1994REP2). While REP-1 is more effective with the Rab3 family, REP-2 supports the prenylation of other Rab proteins such as RablA, Rab5A, and Rab6, highlighting its versatile role in maintaining Rab protein function (Cremers1994REP2).

The activity of REP-2 is vital for the regulation of intracellular trafficking, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Cremers1994REP2). This process ensures the proper delivery of vesicles within cells, impacting various cellular and organismal functions.

## Clinical Significance
The CHML gene has significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of multiple myeloma (MM), a type of hematological cancer. High expression levels of CHML are associated with poor prognosis in MM patients, correlating with shorter event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). This association is especially pronounced in MM subtypes with poor prognosis, such as the proliferation subtype and those with chromosome 1q21 amplification (Zhang2019High). The study suggests that CHML may serve as an independent prognostic factor for MM, with its high expression linked to increased cell proliferation and division (Zhang2019High).

In addition to its role in MM, CHML is overexpressed in early-stage invasive urothelial carcinoma, indicating its potential involvement in other cancers (Zhang2019High). The gene's location on chromosome 1q43 and its sequence similarity to the Choroideremia (CHM) gene, which is involved in binding Rab proteins, suggest that alterations in CHML expression may impact cellular transport processes. Furthermore, CHML may be a susceptibility gene for asthma, potentially affecting the prenylation of specific Rab proteins (Zhang2019High). These findings highlight the gene's broader implications in disease progression and prognosis.

## Interactions
The CHML protein interacts specifically with Rab14, a small GTPase involved in vesicle trafficking. This interaction has been confirmed through various experimental approaches, including immunoprecipitation (IP) assays and GST pull-down assays. In IP assays, CHML was overexpressed in 293T cells, revealing a strong interaction with endogenous Rab14. Flag-Rab14 also interacted with endogenous CHML in several cell lines, such as PLC/PRF/5, YY-8103, CSQT-2, and LM3 cells (Chen2019CHML). The GST pull-down assay demonstrated that GST-Rab14 could bind to CHML, while Rab4A showed a weak interaction, and Rab7A did not bind to CHML. The interaction is mediated by the GDI domains of CHML (Chen2019CHML).

CHML facilitates the recycling of Rab14 by escorting it to the original membrane, which is crucial for vesicle transport. This process is significant because Rab14-positive vesicles carry proteins like Mucin13 and CD44, which are involved in tumor metastasis (Chen2019CHML). CHML preferentially binds to the GDP-loaded form of Rab14, suggesting its role as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) protein. However, CHML does not extract Rab14 from membranes but rather escorts it to the original membrane, facilitating Rab14 recycling (Chen2019CHML).
