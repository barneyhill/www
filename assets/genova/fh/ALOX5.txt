# ALOX5

## Overview
The ALOX5 gene encodes the enzyme arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase, a member of the lipoxygenase family, which plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, potent lipid mediators involved in inflammation and immune responses. This enzyme is primarily expressed in leukocytes and is integral to processes such as bronchoconstriction and chemotaxis, which are crucial for the body's defense mechanisms (Poirier2020LPS). Structurally, arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase is a 75 kDa protein with a two-domain architecture, including a C2-like β-sandwich domain and a helical domain containing the catalytic non-heme iron (Rådmark20155Lipoxygenase; Ivanov2019Mutations). The enzyme's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, such as FLAP and CLP, which are essential for its function in leukotriene biosynthesis (Rådmark20155Lipoxygenase). ALOX5 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including metabolic regulation and cancer, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Mehrabian2008Identification; Weigert2018mPGES1).

## Structure
The ALOX5 protein, also known as arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase, is a key enzyme in leukotriene biosynthesis. It is a 75 kDa protein composed of a single polypeptide chain that folds into a two-domain structure. The N-terminal domain is a C2-like β-sandwich composed of parallel and antiparallel β-sheets, which is involved in calcium and ATP binding and may play a role in membrane binding and regulatory activities (Rådmark20155Lipoxygenase; Ivanov2019Mutations). The C-terminal domain is mainly helical and contains the catalytic non-heme iron, crucial for the enzyme's activity. This domain forms the substrate-binding pocket, which is lined by hydrophobic amino acids and requires structural rearrangement for substrate binding (Rådmark20155Lipoxygenase; Ivanov2019Mutations).

ALOX5 can form homodimers, and its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glutathionylation (Rådmark20155Lipoxygenase; Adel2014Phosphorylation). Phosphorylation sites include Ser271, Ser523, and Ser663, which influence enzyme activity and localization (Adel2014Phosphorylation). The enzyme's quaternary structure involves interactions with other proteins like FLAP and CLP, which are important for its function in leukotriene biosynthesis (Rådmark20155Lipoxygenase).

## Function
The ALOX5 gene encodes the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), which is crucial for the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, pro-inflammatory lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid. These leukotrienes play a significant role in the immune response, particularly in mediating inflammation and host defense mechanisms (Poirier2020LPS). The enzyme is primarily expressed in leukocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages, and is involved in processes like bronchoconstriction and chemotaxis, which are essential for responding to pathogens and danger signals (Poirier2020LPS).

In human monocytic cells, ALOX5 expression is regulated by various factors, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which can enhance 5-LO expression and leukotriene biosynthesis. This regulation is complex and involves transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms (Poirier2020LPS). The ALOX5 promoter contains several transcription factor binding sites, such as Sp1 and Egr-1, which are necessary for its basal activity (Poirier2020LPS).

ALOX5 is also involved in metabolic processes, as its deficiency in mice leads to impaired glucose/insulin homeostasis and altered inflammatory gene expression in adipose tissue, suggesting a role in regulating insulin secretion and pancreatic function (Mehrabian2008Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ALOX5 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), polymorphisms in ALOX5, such as rs10507391 and rs4769874, have been associated with increased risk. The A allele of rs4769874 increases the risk of AD, with the AG genotype increasing the risk 1.29-fold and the AA genotype 1.79-fold compared to the GG genotype. This polymorphism is also linked to increased expression of 5-lipoxygenase (5′-LO) and its activating protein FLAP in the central nervous system, particularly in the hippocampus, which is crucial for learning and memory (Šerý2016Arachidonate).

ALOX5 is also associated with body mass index (BMI), where the GG genotype of rs4769874 is linked to a modest increase in BMI (Šerý2016Arachidonate). In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), ALOX5 is upregulated by the BCR-ABL oncogene and plays a critical role in leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Alox5 deficiency impairs LSCs' ability to induce CML, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2009The).

Additionally, copy number variations (CNVs) in ALOX5 have been associated with NSAIDs-induced urticaria and/or angioedema (NIUA), with a loss of copy number in ALOX5 linked to this condition (PlazaSerón2016Copy). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ALOX5 in various inflammatory and immune-related conditions.

## Interactions
ALOX5, or arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function and regulation. ALOX5 interacts with the ALOX5 promoter, where it binds with various proteins, including transcription factors such as Sp1 and Sp3, which are known to regulate gene expression (Schlag2020Analysis). The study by Schlag et al. identified 66 specific proteins that bind to the ALOX5 promoter, including novel potential regulators like zinc finger proteins and helicases (Schlag2020Analysis).

ALOX5 is also associated with G-quadruplex structures within its promoter region, which are secondary DNA structures that can regulate gene expression. Proteins such as MAZ, BLM, DHX36, hnRNPD, and hnRNPK interact with these G-quadruplex structures, potentially influencing ALOX5 gene regulation (Schlag2020Analysis).

In the context of cancer, ALOX5 interacts with tumor-associated macrophages, influencing the tumor microenvironment. It plays a role in the production of leukotrienes, which are involved in immune cell recruitment and activation, and can both promote and suppress tumor growth depending on the context (Weigert2018mPGES1). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving ALOX5 in both physiological and pathological processes.
