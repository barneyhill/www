# OR6A2

## Overview
The OR6A2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 6 subfamily A member 2, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the olfactory system, where it plays a crucial role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals, contributing to the sense of smell. OR6A2 is activated by specific odorant molecules, leading to a cascade of intracellular events that result in neuronal signaling to the brain. Beyond its olfactory functions, OR6A2 is expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, suggesting potential roles in other physiological processes, including chemosensory functions in the lung and human airway smooth muscle cells (Kerslake2020Co‑expression; Aisenberg2016Defining). The gene has also been implicated in pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis, where it may influence inflammatory pathways (He2022Olfactory).

## Structure


## Function
OR6A2 is an olfactory receptor that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, primarily known for its role in the detection of odorants in the olfactory epithelium. In this context, OR6A2 binds specific odorant molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. This process involves the coupling of OR6A2 to G proteins, which subsequently activate adenylyl cyclase, leading to the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The increase in cAMP opens cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, resulting in neuronal depolarization and the transmission of olfactory signals to the brain (Tong2021Ectopic).

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR6A2 is expressed at low levels in various non-olfactory tissues, including the lung, suggesting potential chemosensory functions outside the olfactory system (Aisenberg2016Defining). In human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells, OR6A2 may contribute to a broader chemosensory network, although its specific function in these cells remains to be fully elucidated (Aisenberg2016Defining). The expression of OR6A2 in multiple tissues indicates that it may have diverse roles in human physiology, potentially influencing cellular processes beyond smell perception (Kerslake2020Co‑expression).

## Clinical Significance
The OR6A2 gene has been implicated in the progression of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of plaques in the arterial walls. This gene is involved in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, leading to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β). The binding of octanal, a ligand for OR6A2 found in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), triggers this inflammatory response, promoting plaque formation and instability in atherosclerotic lesions (He2022Olfactory). Experimental studies have shown that octanal accumulates in the aorta of atherosclerotic mice, correlating with increased cholesterol levels in humans. Targeting OR6A2 signaling has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating cardiovascular conditions, as its activation is linked to increased inflammation and plaque formation (Beito2024Role).

Additionally, a missense mutation in the OR6A2 gene (p.R239C) was identified in a family with a proband diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the clinical significance of this mutation in relation to ASD or other diseases remains unclear, as the study did not provide specific details on its impact (Sjaarda2019Exome).
