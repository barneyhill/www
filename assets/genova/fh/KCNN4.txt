# KCNN4

## Overview
The KCNN4 gene encodes the potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily N member 4, a transmembrane protein that functions as a calcium-activated potassium channel. This channel, also known as KCa3.1, plays a critical role in various physiological processes, including the regulation of cell volume, membrane potential, and ion transport across epithelial cells (Barmeyer2010Cloning). The KCNN4 protein is characterized by its interaction with calmodulin, which confers calcium sensitivity essential for its function (Tian2013Potassium). It is involved in maintaining potassium efflux in red blood cells and modulating immune cell activity, as well as influencing vascular tone and blood pressure (Nam2022Channelopathy; RapettiMauss2017Red). Additionally, KCNN4 has been implicated in cancer progression, where its altered expression is associated with tumor proliferation and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xu2021KCNN4; Jiang2017Integrated).

## Structure
The KCNN4 gene encodes a protein that forms a calcium-activated potassium channel, which is crucial for various cellular functions. The primary structure of the KCNN4 protein includes multiple transmembrane domains, with the KCNN4b isoform having six membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) and the KCNN4c isoform having five due to a deletion of a 29 amino acid motif (Barmeyer2010Cloning). This deletion affects the membrane topology and potentially the function of the KCNN4c variant. The protein's secondary structure likely includes alpha helices that span the membrane, forming the channel's pore.

The KCNN4 protein is a homomeric tetramer, with each subunit binding to calmodulin (CaM), which is essential for its calcium sensitivity and plasma membrane expression (Tian2013Potassium). The interaction with CaM occurs following the sixth transmembrane domain, highlighting the importance of this domain in the channel's function. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in modulating the channel's activity and calcium sensitivity (Tian2013Potassium).

Splice variants of KCNN4, including KCNN4b and KCNN4c, exhibit distinct localization within cells, with KCNN4b associated with basolateral membranes and KCNN4c with apical membranes in colonic epithelial cells (Barmeyer2010Cloning). These isoforms also differ in their sensitivity to inhibitors like TRAM-34 (Barmeyer2010Cloning).

## Function
The KCNN4 gene encodes the KCa3.1 channel, a calcium-activated potassium channel that plays a significant role in various physiological processes. In epithelial cells, KCNN4 channels are involved in maintaining cell volume, regulating membrane potential, and facilitating potassium and chloride secretion, which are essential for fluid secretion in organs such as the colon, pancreas, and lungs (Barmeyer2010Cloning). These channels are expressed in both apical and basolateral membranes, with specific isoforms, KCNN4b and KCNN4c, localized to these regions in colonic epithelial cells (Barmeyer2010Cloning).

In red blood cells, the KCNN4-encoded Gardos channel is crucial for regulating potassium efflux, which is vital for maintaining cell volume and ion balance. This function is particularly important in preventing erythrocyte dehydration and maintaining red blood cell stability (Glogowska2015Mutations; RapettiMauss2017Red). The channel's activity is modulated by intracellular calcium levels, which activate the channel through the binding of calmodulin, a calcium-binding protein (Nam2022Channelopathy).

KCNN4 channels also play a role in immune cell function, influencing processes such as cell proliferation and migration, and are involved in regulating vascular tone and blood pressure by mediating endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization (Nam2022Channelopathy).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KCNN4 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions and cancers. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), KCNN4 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poor overall survival and suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target (Jiang2017Integrated). Similarly, in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), KCNN4 overexpression is associated with enhanced tumor proliferation and metastasis through the activation of the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling pathways, indicating its function as a proto-oncogene (Xu2021KCNN4).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KCNN4 promotes invasion and metastasis via the MAPK/ERK pathway, with high expression levels linked to aggressive tumor behavior and poorer clinical outcomes (Li2020KCNN4). In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), KCNN4 expression affects the tumor microenvironment and is associated with worse prognosis, influencing immune cell distribution and tumor progression (Chen2021KCNN4).

KCNN4 also plays a role in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), where its upregulation is linked to disease progression through epithelial-mesenchymal transition and suppression of apoptosis, making it a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker (Wen2020KCNN4). These findings underscore the clinical significance of KCNN4 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
KCNN4, also known as KCa3.1, is a potassium channel that interacts with various proteins and is involved in multiple cellular processes. It is known to interact with calmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein, which regulates its activity by binding to the channel in response to intracellular calcium levels (Barmeyer2010Cloning). This interaction is crucial for the channel's function in maintaining calcium homeostasis and cell volume regulation.

KCNN4 is also part of multiprotein complexes and interacts with other ion channels and signaling proteins. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), KCNN4 modulates the expression of the MET gene by controlling intracellular calcium concentration, which in turn affects the MET/AKT signaling pathway. This interaction is essential for promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration (Mo2021KCNN4mediated).

In colorectal cancer, KCNN4 channels are involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process induced by phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3). This involves interactions with signaling components such as CaM-kinase II and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta), which lead to increased Snail expression, a transcription factor that represses E-cadherin (Lai2013KCNN4). These interactions highlight the role of KCNN4 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
