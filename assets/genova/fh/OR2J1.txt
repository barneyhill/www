# OR2J1

## Overview
OR2J1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily J member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium. The OR2J1 gene is part of a larger cluster of odorant receptor genes associated with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), suggesting a potential link between olfactory perception and immune system functions (Santos2010Variation). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR2J1 is also expressed in human spermatozoa, where it may contribute to reproductive processes by detecting MHC peptides, thus influencing sperm behavior and potentially affecting fertilization outcomes (Flegel2016Characterization).

## Function
OR2J1 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR2J1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory responses (Santos2010Variation).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR2J1 is expressed in human spermatozoa, where it is suggested to play a role in detecting MHC peptides. This expression pattern indicates a potential function in reproductive processes, possibly influencing sperm chemotaxis and chemokinesis, which are essential for locating the oocyte in the female reproductive tract (Flegel2016Characterization). The presence of both sense and antisense transcripts of OR2J1 in spermatozoa suggests complex regulatory mechanisms that may impact its function (Flegel2016Characterization).

The gene is part of a cluster of odorant receptors linked to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which is known for its role in immune response and possibly in mate selection through olfactory cues (Santos2010Variation).
