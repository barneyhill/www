# ACAA1

## Overview
The ACAA1 gene encodes the enzyme acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1, a crucial component of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway involved in fatty acid metabolism. This enzyme, categorized as a thiolase, facilitates the thiolytic cleavage of 3-ketoacyl-CoA into acetyl-CoA and a shortened acyl-CoA, playing a significant role in energy production by breaking down fatty acids (Wanders2020Fatty). ACAA1 is predominantly active in peroxisomes, cellular organelles that handle the oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids, which are not processed by mitochondria (Wanders2020Fatty). The gene's expression and the enzyme's activity are vital for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and have implications in various physiological processes, including insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells (MacDonald2007Feasibility). Mutations in ACAA1 have been linked to early-onset Alzheimer's disease and asthma, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative and immune-related conditions (Sordillo2011Effects; Luo2021A).

## Structure
The ACAA1 protein, also known as acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1, is a peroxisomal enzyme involved in the final step of fatty acid β-oxidation. The primary structure of ACAA1 consists of a sequence of 424 amino acids in its precursor form, which is cleaved to a mature form of 398 amino acids (Wanders2020Fatty). The protein shares 86% identity with rat thiolase, indicating a conserved structure across species (Wanders2020Fatty).

ACAA1 contains thiolase domains, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity. These domains facilitate the cleavage of 3-ketoacyl-CoA into acetyl-CoA and a shortened acyl-CoA molecule. The protein is targeted to peroxisomes via a PTS2 signal, which is essential for its localization and function within the cell (Wanders2020Fatty).

The tertiary structure of ACAA1 forms a specific three-dimensional shape necessary for its function, and it may form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure. This dimerization is important for its enzymatic activity. ACAA1 may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and stability. Splice variant isoforms of ACAA1 can result in different functional forms of the protein, potentially affecting its role in fatty acid metabolism.

## Function
ACAA1, or acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the beta-oxidation pathway of fatty acid metabolism. It catalyzes the thiolytic cleavage of 3-ketoacyl-CoA into acetyl-CoA and a shortened acyl-CoA, a key step in the breakdown of fatty acids for energy production (Wanders2020Fatty). This enzyme is active in peroxisomes, which are cellular organelles involved in various metabolic processes, including the oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids that cannot be processed by mitochondria (Wanders2020Fatty).

In pancreatic beta cells, ACAA1 is involved in the conversion of acetoacetyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA, a reaction that can occur in both the mitochondria and the cytosol. This conversion is part of the pathway that allows carbon from insulin secretagogues to be incorporated into acyl-CoAs, which are important for insulin secretion (MacDonald2007Feasibility). The presence of ACAA1 in rat and human pancreatic islets and INS-1 832/13 cells has been confirmed through immunoblot analysis, indicating its role in these processes (MacDonald2007Feasibility). ACAA1's activity in peroxisomes and its involvement in lipid metabolism are essential for maintaining energy homeostasis in cells (Wanders2020Fatty).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACAA1 gene, particularly the novel missense variant p.N299S, have been associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOFAD). This variant has been identified in a Han Chinese family and is linked to impaired lysosomal function, which exacerbates amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology and cognitive decline. The p.N299S mutation is a loss-of-function variant that reduces enzymatic activity, leading to disrupted lysosomal and synaptic functions, increased Aβ accumulation, and neuronal loss (Luo2021A).

The ACAA1 p.N299S mutation has been shown to disturb synaptic function and increase extracellular levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42, peptides associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology. This mutation also affects excitatory synaptic transmission, as demonstrated in experiments with rat hippocampal neurons (Luo2021A). In mouse models, overexpression of ACAA1 p.N299S led to increased amyloid plaque burden and cognitive decline, further supporting its role in Alzheimer's disease progression (Luo2021A).

In addition to its role in Alzheimer's disease, a genetic polymorphism in the ACAA1 gene has been linked to asthma risk in children. The presence of a specific SNP in ACAA1 interacts with endotoxin exposure, providing a protective effect against asthma, highlighting the gene's involvement in immune response modulation (Sordillo2011Effects).

## Interactions
ACAA1, also known as acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1, is involved in the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway, where it interacts with other enzymes to facilitate the breakdown of long-chain fatty acids. While specific direct physical interactions of ACAA1 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, it has been identified as a potential partner in studies involving protein interactome profiling. In particular, ACAA1 was isolated from liver tissue and HepG2 cells during molecular-fishing experiments using microsomal cytochrome b5 (CYB5A) as a target protein. However, ACAA1 is suggested to be an indirect partner of CYB5A, as it appears in monomeric form in the size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) fraction, indicating no stable complex formation with CYB5A (Mezentsev2022Protein).

The study of protein interactomes often involves the use of various methods to detect protein-protein interactions and identify stable protein complexes. Techniques such as affinity isolation and mass spectrometry are employed to identify potential protein partners, although the specific interactions of ACAA1 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated (Mezentsev2022Protein).
