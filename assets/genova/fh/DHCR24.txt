# DHCR24

## Overview
The DHCR24 gene encodes the enzyme 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase, a member of the FAD-dependent oxidoreductases family, which is integral to cholesterol biosynthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the reduction of desmosterol to cholesterol, representing the final step in the Bloch pathway of cholesterol synthesis. The protein is characterized by its transmembrane domain, which anchors it to the endoplasmic reticulum, and a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain essential for its enzymatic activity. Beyond its primary role in cholesterol metabolism, DHCR24 exhibits antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties, particularly in neuronal cells, and is involved in cellular stress responses and inflammation modulation. Its interactions with proteins such as p53 and caspase-3 further underscore its multifaceted role in cellular health and disease. Mutations in DHCR24 are linked to desmosterolosis, while alterations in its expression are associated with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and various cancers (Cocciadiferro2024Exploiting; McGrath2009Role; Lu2011The).

## Structure
The DHCR24 protein, encoded by the DHCR24 gene, is a member of the FAD-dependent oxidoreductases family and plays a crucial role in cholesterol biosynthesis. It consists of 516 amino acids and features a potential N-terminal secretory signal sequence and at least one putative transmembrane helix, which anchors the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Lu2011The). The protein's N-terminal transmembrane domain is essential for ER membrane targeting, with an N-terminal luminal and C-terminal cytoplasmic orientation (Lu2011The).

The DHCR24 protein contains a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic function and interaction with reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Lu2011The; Cocciadiferro2024Exploiting). This domain is located in the C-terminal region, facing the cytoplasm, and is vital for the protein's role in cholesterol biosynthesis and its anti-apoptotic activity (Lu2011The). The protein's structure allows it to interact with p53, influencing cell growth and apoptosis (Lu2011The).

While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the protein's single-spanning membrane topology and its functional domains are well-characterized (Lu2011The).

## Function
The DHCR24 gene encodes the enzyme 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase, which plays a critical role in cholesterol biosynthesis by catalyzing the conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol, the final step in the Bloch pathway of cholesterol synthesis (Skubic2023HepG2; Wang2023Virtual). This process is essential for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis, which is vital for various cellular functions, including maintaining cell membrane fluidity and permeability, and serving as a precursor for steroid hormones and vitamin D (Wang2023Virtual). 

In healthy human cells, DHCR24 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it ensures the proper synthesis of cholesterol, a crucial component of cellular membranes (Wu2020Genkwadaphnin). The enzyme's activity is necessary for the formation and stability of cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains, known as lipid rafts, which are involved in cellular signaling and adhesion (Wu2020Genkwadaphnin). 

Beyond its role in cholesterol metabolism, DHCR24 exhibits antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties, particularly in neuronal cells, and is involved in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation (McGrath2009Role). These functions contribute to its protective role in cellular health and its potential as a therapeutic target for various conditions (McGrath2009Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DHCR24 gene are associated with desmosterolosis, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of desmosterol, a cholesterol precursor, in plasma and tissues. This condition leads to various clinical features, including intellectual disability, developmental delay, epilepsy, cataracts, skeletal abnormalities, and other congenital malformations. Brain abnormalities such as malformation of the corpus callosum and loss of white matter are common. The disorder is caused by biallelic mutations in DHCR24, which result in decreased cholesterol production, affecting brain cells that rely on cellular cholesterol production (Zolotushko2011The; Cocciadiferro2024Exploiting).

Alterations in DHCR24 expression are linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Downregulation of DHCR24 is associated with major risk factors for AD, such as aging, diabetes-related factors, amyloid-β, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. This downregulation can lead to brain cholesterol deficiency, contributing to the generation of β-amyloid, tau hyperphosphorylation, and other neuropathological impairments associated with AD (Bai2021DHCR24; Bai2022The).

In cancer, high expression levels of DHCR24 have been linked to poor survival outcomes in melanoma and other cancers, such as urothelial and endometrial carcinoma. In melanoma, higher DHCR24 expression is associated with resistance to apoptosis and increased metastatic potential (Pflugfelder2022GenomeWide).

## Interactions
DHCR24, also known as 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase, is involved in several interactions with other proteins that influence its function and cellular roles. One significant interaction is with the tumor suppressor protein p53. DHCR24 is suggested to stabilize p53, thereby regulating cell growth, senescence, and apoptosis. This interaction contributes to DHCR24's anti-apoptotic function, which is independent of its role in cholesterol biosynthesis (Lu2011The).

DHCR24 also interacts with caspase-3, a key mediator of apoptosis. Upon oxidative stress, DHCR24 is cleaved by caspase-3, leading to its diffusion throughout the cytoplasm. This cleavage occurs at predicted caspase-cleaving sites on the cytoplasmic side of DHCR24, highlighting its involvement in cellular stress responses (Lu2011The).

In the context of inflammation, DHCR24 plays a role in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) in endothelial cells. The expression of DHCR24 is upregulated by HDLs, which suppresses the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and its target genes, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). This suggests that DHCR24 is crucial in the anti-inflammatory processes mediated by HDLs (McGrath2009Role).
