# SLC10A1

## Overview
The SLC10A1 gene encodes the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a critical transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in the liver. NTCP plays a vital role in the sodium-dependent uptake of bile acids into hepatocytes, facilitating the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, which is essential for cholesterol metabolism and liver function (Kosters2008Bile; Ho2004Ethnicitydependent). Structurally, NTCP is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains and specific sodium-binding sites that are crucial for its transport function (Hagenbuch1994Molecular; Liu2022Structure). Beyond its physiological role, NTCP also serves as a receptor for hepatitis B and D viruses, implicating it in viral entry and infection processes (Zakrzewicz2023Interactions). Mutations in SLC10A1 can lead to clinical conditions such as hypercholanemia and influence susceptibility to viral infections, underscoring its significance in both health and disease (Liu2017Homozygous; Hu2015The).

## Structure
The SLC10A1 gene encodes the sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP), a membrane protein primarily involved in the transport of bile acids into liver cells. The human NTCP protein consists of 349 amino acids and is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains. Initial models suggested seven transmembrane domains, but recent evidence indicates the presence of nine membrane-spanning domains, including two re-entrant membrane sequences associated with a P-loop structure essential for its transport function (Hagenbuch1994Molecular; Alrefai2007Bile).

The tertiary structure of NTCP reveals a unique architecture with a tunnel connecting the external environment to the cytoplasm. This tunnel is lined with hydrophilic residues on the external side and hydrophobic residues on the cytoplasmic side, formed by the separation of transmembrane helices TM1 and TM6 from others (Liu2022Structure). The structure also includes two sodium-binding sites, Na1 and Na2, near the crossing motif of TM3 and TM8, which are crucial for the sodium-driven transport mechanism (Liu2022Structure).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation occur at specific residues, notably Asn5 and Asn11, which are important for NTCP's plasma membrane expression and function (Hagenbuch1994Molecular; Russell2020In).

## Function
The SLC10A1 gene encodes the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a critical transporter in the liver responsible for the uptake of bile acids from the portal circulation. NTCP is expressed exclusively in hepatocytes and is localized to the basolateral membrane, where it facilitates the sodium-dependent uptake of conjugated bile acids, such as taurocholate. This process is essential for maintaining the enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids, which is crucial for bile acid homeostasis, cholesterol elimination, and hepatocyte function (Kosters2008Bile; Ho2004Ethnicitydependent).

NTCP accounts for over 80% of the hepatic uptake of conjugated bile salts, driven by an inward sodium gradient maintained by Na+/K+ ATPase activity. This uptake is vital for recycling bile acids between the liver and intestine, minimizing fecal losses in healthy individuals (Kosters2008Bile; Eloranta2006The). The transporter also plays a role in the solubilization of cholesterol and dietary fats in the intestine and the absorption of lipid-soluble vitamins (Ho2004Ethnicitydependent). NTCP's function is regulated by glucocorticoids and bile acids, providing a feedback mechanism to coordinate bile acid uptake in the liver (Eloranta2006The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC10A1 gene, which encodes the sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), are associated with several clinical conditions. One notable mutation, p.Ser267Phe, is linked to a new type of hypercholanemia, characterized by elevated serum bile acid levels. Individuals with this homozygous mutation exhibit persistent hypercholanemia, low vitamin D levels, and deviations in sex hormones and blood lipids, although they are typically asymptomatic (Liu2017Homozygous). This mutation also affects the ability to support hepatitis B and D virus infections, suggesting a protective role against these viruses (Hu2015The).

The p.Ser267Phe variant is prevalent in East Asian populations and has been associated with a decreased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis B (Hu2015The). Additionally, NTCP deficiency, resulting from biallelic mutations in SLC10A1, can lead to neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia and hypercholanemia (Qiu2017Sodium). The clinical implications of these mutations highlight the importance of SLC10A1 in bile acid metabolism and liver function, as well as its potential role in personalized medicine (Li2019Clinical).

## Interactions
The SLC10A1 gene encodes the Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), which is involved in several protein-protein interactions crucial for its function and regulation. NTCP forms homodimers that are essential for its role as a bile salt transporter and as a receptor for hepatitis B and D viruses (HBV/HDV) (Zakrzewicz2023Interactions). It also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), facilitating the internalization of the virus-NTCP complex into host cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a critical step for HBV entry (Zakrzewicz2023Interactions). The interaction with EGFR involves a specific NTCP region between L131 and D150, with the 144 GXXXG 148 motif being critical for EGFR-NTCP heterodimerization (Zakrzewicz2023Interactions).

NTCP also interacts with interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), which is involved in endosomal protein sorting and enhances HBV/HDV infection (Zakrzewicz2023Interactions). Additionally, NTCP's interaction with E-cadherin influences its plasma membrane distribution and HBV entry (Zakrzewicz2023Interactions). These interactions suggest potential targets for antiviral therapy, particularly in blocking virus binding and NTCP/EGFR heterodimerization (Zakrzewicz2023Interactions).
