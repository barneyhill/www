# GUCY2C

## Overview
GUCY2C is a gene that encodes the guanylate cyclase 2C (GC-C) protein, a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed in the intestinal epithelium. This receptor plays a pivotal role in regulating intestinal fluid and electrolyte balance by converting guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) upon activation by ligands such as guanylin, uroguanylin, and bacterial heat-stable enterotoxins. The GC-C protein is characterized by its complex multidomain structure, which includes an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular domain responsible for its enzymatic activity (Bose2020Mutational; Basu2009Receptor). Through its signaling pathways, GUCY2C influences various physiological processes, including fluid secretion, epithelial barrier integrity, and potentially tumor suppression (Entezari2021Guanylyl; Prasad2022Receptor). Mutations in GUCY2C are linked to gastrointestinal disorders such as meconium ileus and familial diarrhea syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Fiskerstrand2012Familial; Romi2012Meconium).

## Structure
The GUCY2C gene encodes the guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) protein, which is a receptor with a complex multidomain architecture. The protein consists of an N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) that binds specific ligands, followed by a single helical transmembrane region, and a C-terminal intracellular region. The signal peptide of GC-C extends from amino acid 1 to 23, followed by the ECD up to amino acid 430. The transmembrane domain spans amino acids 431 to 454. The intracellular region includes a juxtamembrane domain (residues 455-489), a kinase homology domain (KHD, amino acids 490-735), a linker region (amino acids 740-810), a guanylyl cyclase domain (GCD, amino acids 810-1,010), and a C-terminal domain (CTD, amino acids 1,010-1,073) (Bose2020Mutational; Basu2009Receptor).

The guanylyl cyclase domain is highly conserved and responsible for the production of cyclic GMP (cGMP) upon ligand binding. The active site of the GC domain is located at the dimer interface and contains two aspartate residues that coordinate metal cofactors, facilitating the catalytic process (Basu2009Receptor). The protein is glycosylated, resulting in two forms: a 130 kDa form in the endoplasmic reticulum and a 145 kDa form on the plasma membrane (Basu2009Receptor). GC-C is a homodimeric protein, with a head-to-tail arrangement necessary for its function (Bose2020Mutational).

## Function
The GUCY2C gene encodes the guanylate cyclase 2C (GC-C) receptor, which is primarily expressed on the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells. This receptor plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal fluid and electrolyte homeostasis by regulating the conversion of GTP to cyclic GMP (cGMP) upon activation by endogenous ligands such as guanylin and uroguanylin, as well as by bacterial heat-stable enterotoxins (Romi2012Meconium; Prasad2022Receptor).

The increase in cGMP levels activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase II (PKGII), which in turn phosphorylates and opens the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel. This leads to increased secretion of chloride and bicarbonate ions into the intestinal lumen, facilitating the paracellular movement of sodium and water, thus regulating intestinal fluid balance (Romi2012Meconium; Prasad2022Receptor).

GUCY2C signaling also influences the inhibition of sodium hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3), reducing sodium absorption and further contributing to fluid homeostasis (Prasad2022Receptor). Beyond its role in fluid regulation, GUCY2C is involved in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier and may have implications in cell proliferation and differentiation (Prasad2022Receptor).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GUCY2C gene are associated with several gastrointestinal disorders. Loss-of-function mutations in GUCY2C can lead to meconium ileus, a type of intestinal obstruction in newborns, due to reduced or absent enzymatic activity of guanylyl cyclase 2C, which affects ion and fluid balance in the intestine (Waldman2018Guanylate; Romi2012Meconium). In contrast, gain-of-function mutations in GUCY2C are linked to familial diarrhea syndrome, characterized by chronic diarrhea due to increased cyclic GMP (cGMP) production and hyperactivation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) (Fiskerstrand2012Familial; Wolfe2021Novel).

GUCY2C mutations also have implications in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Activating mutations can increase susceptibility to IBD by causing electrolyte imbalances and affecting CFTR activation (Tronstad2018Genetic). Additionally, GUCY2C signaling is implicated in colorectal cancer, where loss of its endogenous ligands is observed in over 85% of colorectal tumors, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Entezari2021Guanylyl). The gene's signaling pathways are also involved in maintaining mucosal barrier integrity, with disruptions potentially leading to increased intestinal permeability and inflammation (Waldman2018Guanylate).

## Interactions
GUCY2C, or guanylate cyclase 2C, is a transmembrane receptor that interacts with several proteins to mediate its physiological functions. Upon activation by its ligands, such as guanylin and uroguanylin, GUCY2C catalyzes the conversion of GTP to cyclic GMP (cGMP), which acts as a second messenger in various signaling pathways (Entezari2021Guanylyl; Fiskerstrand2012Familial). 

One of the key interactions of GUCY2C is with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The cGMP produced by GUCY2C activation leads to the phosphorylation and activation of CFTR, promoting chloride and bicarbonate secretion into the intestinal lumen (Entezari2021Guanylyl; Fiskerstrand2012Familial). This interaction is crucial for maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance in the intestine.

GUCY2C also interacts with cGMP-dependent protein kinase II (PKGII), which phosphorylates CFTR and inhibits the Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3), reducing sodium absorption (Entezari2021Guanylyl). Additionally, cGMP produced by GUCY2C can regulate phosphodiesterases (PDEs), such as PDE5, which modulate intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP, influencing various signaling pathways (Entezari2021Guanylyl). These interactions highlight the role of GUCY2C in complex signaling networks that regulate intestinal homeostasis and potentially influence tumor suppression.
