# ZER1

## Overview
ZER1 is a human gene that encodes the zyg-11 related cell cycle regulator protein, which functions as a substrate receptor within the Cullin 2-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL2) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the N-degron pathway, a critical mechanism for protein quality control and cellular homeostasis. The zyg-11 related cell cycle regulator is characterized by its ARM (armadillo) repeats, which facilitate the recognition and binding of specific N-terminal degrons, such as glycine, serine, alanine, threonine, and cysteine, marking them for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Yan2021Molecular; Li2022CRL2ZER1ZYG11B). This process is essential for the regulation of mitosis and the maintenance of protein stability within the cell. The protein's activity is crucial in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it ensures proper cell division and the degradation of proteins with exposed N-terminal glycine degrons, particularly when N-myristoylation fails (Timms2019A; Li2022CRL2ZER1ZYG11B).

## Structure
The ZER1 protein is characterized by the presence of ARM (armadillo) repeats, which are crucial for its function in recognizing N-terminal degrons. These ARM repeats form a deep cavity that is essential for binding Gly/N-degrons, with specific structural features such as elongated loops in certain ARM repeats contributing to this binding (Yan2021Molecular). The protein adopts a conserved structural architecture similar to ZYG11B, despite only 26% sequence identity, utilizing a narrow cavity of its C-terminal ARM repeats to engage substrates through hydrogen bonding (Yan2021Molecular).

The primary structure of ZER1 includes key residues such as W552, D556, N597, and E600, which are critical for binding to peptides with small N-terminal residues like Ser, Ala, Cys, or Thr. Mutations in these residues impair substrate binding and degradation (Li2022CRL2ZER1ZYG11B). The secondary structure involves the formation of an arch-shaped conformation by ARM2-ARM8, creating a cavity for degron recognition (Yan2021Molecular).

ZER1 also shows a preference for small N-terminal residues over glycine, indicating its role in recognizing a broader range of substrates beyond Gly/N-degrons (Li2022CRL2ZER1ZYG11B). The protein's ability to recognize various N-terminal residues is facilitated by conserved hydrogen bonds and interactions within its binding pocket (Li2022CRL2ZER1ZYG11B).

## Function
The ZER1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a substrate receptor for the Cullin 2-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL2) complex, playing a crucial role in the N-degron pathway, which is essential for protein quality control and maintaining cellular protein homeostasis (Li2022CRL2ZER1ZYG11B). ZER1, along with ZYG11B, recognizes and targets proteins with specific N-terminal residues, such as glycine, serine, alanine, threonine, and cysteine, for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Li2022CRL2ZER1ZYG11B). This recognition is part of a broader substrate spectrum that includes both Gly/N-degrons and non-Ac/N-degrons, indicating a conserved mechanism of substrate recognition and degradation (Li2022CRL2ZER1ZYG11B).

In healthy cells, ZER1 is involved in the quality control of N-myristoylated proteins, ensuring that proteins with exposed N-terminal glycine degrons are degraded if N-myristoylation fails (Timms2019A). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to the regulation of mitosis and ensuring proper cell division (Li2022CRL2ZER1ZYG11B). Through these processes, ZER1 plays a vital role in maintaining protein stability and function within the cell.

## Interactions
ZER1, a human gene encoding a protein involved in cell cycle regulation, participates in several protein interactions, primarily as part of the Cullin 2-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL2) complex. ZER1 acts as a substrate receptor within this complex, interacting with Elongin B, Elongin C, and CUL2, which are essential components of the CRL2 complex (White2013Proteomic; Vasudevan2007TheCaenorhabditis). This interaction facilitates the recognition and degradation of proteins with specific N-terminal residues, such as glycine, serine, alanine, threonine, and cysteine, through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Yan2021Molecular; Li2022CRL2ZER1ZYG11B).

ZER1 is also involved in the degradation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB1) in cells expressing the HPV16 E7 oncoprotein. This interaction is specific to HPV16, as ZER1 contributes to the E7-mediated degradation of pRB1, a process that is inhibited when ZER1 is knocked down (White2013Proteomic). The protein's ability to recognize and bind to various N-terminal residues is mediated by conserved structural features, including ARM repeats that form a binding pocket, allowing ZER1 to engage in specific hydrogen bonding interactions (Yan2021Molecular; Li2022CRL2ZER1ZYG11B).
