# TRMO

## Overview
The TRMO gene encodes the tRNA methyltransferase O protein, a member of the class VIII AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases. This enzyme is integral to the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules, specifically through the methylation of nucleotides, which is essential for the stability and functionality of tRNA in human cells. The TRMO protein is characterized by a unique single-sheeted β-barrel structure, which distinguishes it from other methyltransferases and is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The methylation process facilitated by TRMO is vital for accurate protein synthesis, as it enhances the decoding ability of tRNA, thereby ensuring efficient translation and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Kimura2014Discovery).

## Structure
The TRMO protein, also known as tRNA methyltransferase O, is characterized by a unique single-sheeted β-barrel structure, which is a defining feature of its class VIII AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases. This β-barrel is composed of six consecutive β-sheets, distinguishing it from other methyltransferases that typically have antiparallel β-barrel structures (Kimura2014Discovery). The AdoMet binding pocket is located in the upper part of the β-barrel and is surrounded by additional loops, with key residues such as Arg92 and Lys136 playing crucial roles in the N6-methylation process (Kimura2014Discovery).

The C-terminal domain of TRMO contains a conserved DPRxxY motif, with Asp194 and Arg196 being essential for its methylation activity, suggesting a role in tRNA binding (Kimura2014Discovery). The primary structure of TRMO includes highly conserved residues in the N-terminal region, known as UPF0066, which is crucial for its function (Kimura2014Discovery). While the quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, the presence of additional domains suggests potential interactions that could influence the overall structure and function of the protein (Kimura2014Discovery).

## Function
The TRMO protein, also known as tRNA methyltransferase O, plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules in human cells. This enzyme is responsible for the methylation of specific nucleotides, a process essential for the proper functioning and stability of tRNA. In humans, TRMO is involved in the methylation of tRNA, which is critical for accurate protein synthesis. The enzyme enhances the decoding ability of tRNA, ensuring efficient translation and protein synthesis, which are vital for cellular function and homeostasis. The human homolog of TRMO has been identified and characterized, showing its role in the methylation of tRNA, which is crucial for maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis (Kimura2014Discovery). This modification process is essential for cellular function, as it ensures the proper translation of genetic information into proteins, which are necessary for various biological processes (Kimura2014Discovery).
