# MAP3K5

## Overview
MAP3K5, also known as apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in cellular stress response pathways. The protein product, ASK1, plays a critical role in mediating apoptosis and inflammation by activating the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways, which are essential for cellular responses to stressors such as reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Pressinotti2009Differential; Iriyama2009ASK1). ASK1 is regulated by interactions with thioredoxin and TNF-receptor-associated factors, and its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions (Weijman2017Structural; Obsil2017Structural). The gene's involvement in apoptosis and inflammation underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disorders (Stark2011Frequent; Nguyen2022MAP3K).

## Structure
MAP3K5, also known as apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), is a serine/threonine kinase involved in stress response pathways. The protein is composed of 1374 amino acids and features several distinct domains. The N-terminal region contains the thioredoxin-binding domain (TBD), which interacts with thioredoxin 1 (TRX1) under non-stress conditions, inhibiting ASK1 activity (Obsil2017Structural). The central regulatory region (CRR) includes a series of 14 α-helices forming seven tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which are crucial for TRAF binding and ASK1 activation (Weijman2017Structural; Obsil2017Structural). The PH domain interacts with TPRs through a hydrophobic interface, contributing to the protein's stability (Weijman2017Structural).

The catalytic domain (CD) of ASK1, located centrally, has a typical protein kinase fold with two lobes connected by a hinge region. This domain can autophosphorylate at three threonine sites, which may be important for recruiting binding partners (Obsil2017Structural). ASK1 can form homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with ASK2, suggesting a complex quaternary structure (Weijman2017Structural; Obsil2017Structural). The protein's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and interactions with proteins like 14-3-3, which modulate its function under stress conditions (Weijman2017Structural; Obsil2017Structural).

## Function
MAP3K5, also known as apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the cellular response to stress. In healthy human cells, MAP3K5 is primarily involved in the regulation of apoptosis and inflammation through the activation of the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways. These pathways are crucial for cellular responses to stressors such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Pressinotti2009Differential; Iriyama2009ASK1).

MAP3K5 is activated by ROS and is regulated by the redox protein thioredoxin (Trx) and TNF-receptor-associated factors TRAF2 and TRAF6. This activation is essential for the induction of apoptosis, serving as a defense mechanism against tumor initiation by promoting cell death in response to excessive stress (Iriyama2009ASK1). In addition to its role in apoptosis, MAP3K5 is involved in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, contributing to innate immune responses (Pressinotti2009Differential).

MAP3K5 is active in the cytoplasm, where it functions as an upstream regulator of the JNK and p38 pathways, impacting processes such as cell survival, differentiation, and inflammation. Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes (Wang2018Upregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAP3K5 gene, also known as ASK1, have been implicated in various diseases due to its role in the MAPK signaling pathway. In β-thalassemia, variations in MAP3K5 are associated with disease severity and the efficacy of hydroxyurea treatment. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a promoter short tandem repeat (STR) in MAP3K5 correlate with higher fetal hemoglobin levels and a better response to treatment, suggesting a potential role in modulating disease severity and treatment outcomes (Tafrali2013Genomic).

In cancer, MAP3K5 mutations are frequently observed in metastatic melanoma, where they contribute to chemoresistance. These mutations often result in decreased kinase activity, leading to impaired downstream signaling and increased cell viability after chemotherapy, such as temozolomide treatment (Stark2011Frequent). MAP3K5 expression is also altered in prostate cancer, where it is upregulated in tumor cells, particularly in more aggressive forms, indicating its involvement in reactive oxygen species-induced apoptosis and cancer progression (Pressinotti2009Differential).

MAP3K5's role in stress response and apoptosis makes it a critical factor in various pathologies, including neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, where its dysregulation can lead to altered cellular responses to stress (Nguyen2022MAP3K).

## Interactions
MAP3K5, also known as ASK1, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in the MAPK signaling pathway. It forms a heteromeric complex with ASK2, another MAP3K, which is essential for the stability and activity of both kinases. ASK1 stabilizes ASK2 by preventing its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a process that does not require ASK1's kinase activity. This stabilization is achieved through the C-terminal region of ASK1, which is necessary for binding to ASK2 (Takeda2007Apoptosis). 

ASK1 is also involved in the formation of oligomeric complexes known as ASK signalosomes, which are crucial for initiating signaling cascades in response to stress stimuli. The oligomerization is driven by sterile-alpha motif (SAM) domains located at the C-terminus of ASK proteins. ASK1 forms unstable oligomers but can form a stable heterocomplex with ASK2, which is more responsive to oxidative stress (Trevelyan2020Structure-based).

In addition to its interaction with ASK2, MAP3K5 is part of a ferroptosis-related competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network in benign prostatic hyperplasia, where it interacts with miRNAs and lncRNAs, such as hsa-miR-145-5p and CBR3-AS1, respectively (Zhou2024Multiomics).
