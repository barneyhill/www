# CC2D2A

## Overview
The CC2D2A gene encodes the coiled-coil and C2 domain containing 2A protein, which is integral to ciliary function and structure. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil and C2 domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are crucial for its role in cilia biogenesis. CC2D2A is involved in the assembly of subdistal appendages on the mother centriole, essential for anchoring microtubules and initiating ciliary axoneme formation. It interacts with various cilia-centrosomal proteins, including CEP290, and plays a role in critical signaling pathways such as Hedgehog signaling. Mutations in the CC2D2A gene are linked to ciliopathies, including Joubert and Meckel syndromes, highlighting its clinical significance in developmental disorders (BachmannGagescu2012Genotype–phenotype; Veleri2014Ciliopathyassociated; Gorden2008CC2D2A).

## Structure
The CC2D2A protein is encoded by the CC2D2A gene and is involved in ciliary function. It is composed of up to 1620 amino acids, depending on exon usage, and includes coiled-coil and C2 domains (Noor2008CC2D2A). The coiled-coil domains, which are predicted to form at amino acid residues 442-463, 472-492, and 533-580, facilitate protein-protein interactions (BachmannGagescu2015The; Noor2008CC2D2A). The C2 domain, located towards the C-terminus, is a conserved protein motif originally identified in calcium-dependent isoforms of protein kinase C (Jayarajan2024Joubert). However, the C2 domain of CC2D2A does not exhibit calcium-dependent phospholipid binding due to the absence of conserved aspartate residues necessary for this function (Jayarajan2024Joubert).

The protein is predicted to be soluble with an average hydrophobicity of -0.655, and its secondary structure is mainly composed of alpha helices and random coils, with some extended strands (Noor2008CC2D2A). CC2D2A is found in at least 13 different isoforms, with up to 38 exons, and mutations in the gene can lead to truncated proteins lacking the C2 domain, affecting ciliary structure and function (Jayarajan2024Joubert; Noor2008CC2D2A).

## Function
The CC2D2A gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in cilia biogenesis, particularly in the assembly of subdistal appendages on the mother centriole. These appendages are essential for anchoring cytoplasmic microtubules and initiating the formation of the ciliary axoneme, a process crucial for cilia function (Veleri2014Ciliopathyassociated). CC2D2A localizes to the subdistal appendages and is involved in the recruitment of proteins such as Odf2 and trichoplein, which are necessary for cilia formation (Veleri2014Ciliopathyassociated). The protein also interacts with other cilia-centrosomal proteins like CEP290, forming a multiprotein complex that regulates signaling pathways, including Hedgehog signaling (Veleri2014Ciliopathyassociated).

In healthy cells, CC2D2A is crucial for the proper localization of Rab8, a protein involved in vesicle docking and membrane tethering at the mother centriole, which is vital for ciliary structure and function (Veleri2014Ciliopathyassociated). The absence of CC2D2A disrupts cilia-dependent signaling pathways, leading to developmental abnormalities and conditions such as Meckel and Joubert syndromes (Veleri2014Ciliopathyassociated). The gene's role in organogenesis is underscored by the embryonic lethality observed in models lacking CC2D2A, highlighting its essential function in healthy human cells (Veleri2014Ciliopathyassociated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CC2D2A gene are associated with several ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome (JS) and Meckel syndrome (MKS). Joubert syndrome is characterized by developmental delays, hypotonia, ataxia, abnormal eye movements, and a distinctive mid-hindbrain malformation known as the 'molar tooth sign' on brain imaging (Gorden2008CC2D2A; Cabrita2023Exome). Mutations in CC2D2A account for a significant proportion of JS cases, particularly in consanguineous families, and are often missense mutations (BachmannGagescu2012Genotype–phenotype; Khan2020Whole).

Meckel syndrome, a more severe condition, is characterized by renal cystic dysplasia, polydactyly, and brain malformations such as occipital encephalocele. It is often associated with biallelic truncating mutations in CC2D2A, which lead to null alleles (MougouZerelli2009CC2D2Amutations; Barroso‐Gil2021Update). These mutations disrupt normal ciliary function, contributing to the phenotypic manifestations of these disorders (Gorden2008CC2D2A).

The gene's involvement in ciliary function is further supported by its interaction with other ciliopathy-associated proteins, such as CEP290, and its role in retinal photoreceptor development and function (Gorden2008CC2D2A). The variability in phenotypic expression suggests that genetic modifiers may influence the clinical presentation of CC2D2A-related disorders (MougouZerelli2009CC2D2Amutations).

## Interactions
The CC2D2A protein is involved in several critical interactions that are essential for ciliary function and structure. It directly interacts with the NINL protein, with this interaction being mediated through the coiled-coil domains of CC2D2A. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, particularly with NINL isoform B, and is crucial for vesicle trafficking at the base of cilia in mammalian cells and zebrafish models (BachmannGagescu2015The).

CC2D2A also plays a role in a chain of interactions involving RAB8A and MICAL3, where it acts as a docking point at the photoreceptor ciliary base, facilitating the binding of RAB8A-positive vesicles. This interaction is part of a larger complex involving the dynein 1-dynactin motor complex, which is essential for the transport of vesicles towards the ciliary compartment (BachmannGagescu2015The).

In addition to its interactions with NINL and MICAL3, CC2D2A is involved in the assembly of subdistal appendages on the mother centriole, interacting with proteins such as ninein, Odf2, and trichoplein. These interactions are crucial for microtubule nucleation and anchoring, which are essential for cilia biogenesis (Veleri2014Ciliopathyassociated).
