# FAM83D

## Overview
FAM83D is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 83, specifically member D. This protein is characterized by the presence of a conserved DUF1669 domain, which is crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly the activation of MAPK pathways (Liu2024FAM83D). FAM83D is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a significant role in mitotic processes, including spindle assembly and chromosome alignment, thereby ensuring proper cell division and genomic stability (Liu2024FAM83D). The protein interacts with the casein kinase 1 (CK1) family, influencing their activity and stability, which underscores its involvement in cell cycle regulation and signaling (Jin2022Comprehensive). FAM83D is also implicated in cancer progression, interacting with proteins such as FBXW7 to promote oncogenic activities (Jiang2024The). Its expression is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhang2021Comprehensive; Liao2015Upregulation).

## Function
FAM83D is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly during mitosis. The protein contains a highly conserved DUF1669 domain at its N-terminus, which is essential for the activation of MAPK signaling pathways (Liu2024FAM83D). FAM83D is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a vital role in spindle assembly and chromosome alignment, ensuring proper cell division and maintaining genomic stability (Liu2024FAM83D).

In healthy human cells, FAM83D is associated with the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly the G2/M transition of the mitotic cell cycle. It is involved in cell proliferation and the regulation of apoptosis, contributing to cellular proliferation and maintenance of genomic stability (Jin2022Comprehensive). The protein's interaction with the casein kinase 1 (CK1) family of Ser/Thr protein kinases influences their activity, stability, and substrate specificity, suggesting a role in regulating cellular processes such as the cell cycle and signaling pathways (Jin2022Comprehensive). Despite its significant role in these processes, the specific functions of FAM83D in non-cancerous contexts are not extensively detailed in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
FAM83D is implicated in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), breast cancer, and gastric cancer. In HCC, FAM83D is significantly upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels, correlating with poor clinical outcomes such as shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Its expression is associated with clinical parameters like alphafetoprotein levels and TNM stage, suggesting a role in tumor proliferation and invasion (Liao2015Upregulation). In breast cancer, FAM83D expression is elevated in cancerous tissues and is linked to shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), particularly in younger patients and those with aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer (Jin2022Comprehensive). The gene's expression is also associated with immune cell infiltration, indicating its involvement in the tumor microenvironment (Jin2022Comprehensive).

In gastric cancer, high FAM83D expression is linked to poor prognosis, with associations to shorter progression-free survival and post-progression survival. It is identified as a high-risk variable in prognostic models for gastric cancer and stomach adenocarcinoma (Zhang2021Comprehensive). Across various cancers, FAM83D's upregulation is often driven by DNA copy number alterations, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Snijders2017FAM83).

## Interactions
FAM83D is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cancer progression. One of its key interactions is with the tumor suppressor protein FBXW7. FAM83D binds to FBXW7 through specific amino acids, H343 and L344, which are crucial for this interaction. This binding facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of FBXW7, thereby promoting oncogenic activities such as cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in cancers like breast cancer (Jiang2024The). Mutations at these binding sites can disrupt this interaction, leading to reduced tumor-promotive effects of FAM83D (Jiang2024The).

In addition to its interaction with FBXW7, FAM83D is part of the FAM83 family, which is involved in various cancer-related signaling pathways. FAM83D, along with other family members, interacts with the casein kinase 1 (CK1) family through the DUF1669 domain. This interaction affects the subcellular localization, activity, and stability of CK1, influencing cellular processes such as the cell cycle (Jin2022Comprehensive). These interactions highlight the role of FAM83D in regulating key proteins and pathways involved in cancer progression.
