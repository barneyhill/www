# PCYT2

## Overview
The PCYT2 gene encodes the enzyme CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase 2, ethanolamine, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) through the CDP-ethanolamine Kennedy pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a cytidylyltransferase and is essential for converting phosphoethanolamine to CDP-ethanolamine, a key step in PE production, which is vital for maintaining cellular membrane integrity and function (Pavlovic2013Regulation). The protein encoded by PCYT2 is primarily localized in the cytosol and rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the synthesis of PE, a major phospholipid involved in various cellular processes such as membrane fusion, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (Pavlovic2013Regulation). The gene's expression results in multiple isoforms, which exhibit distinct catalytic properties and tissue-specific expression patterns, contributing to the regulation of lipid and energy homeostasis (Pavlovic2013Regulation). Mutations in PCYT2 have been associated with metabolic disorders and neurological conditions, underscoring its clinical significance (Vaz2019Mutations).

## Structure
The human PCYT2 gene encodes the enzyme CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine. The protein structure includes two conserved catalytic domains, each containing an HXGH motif essential for its enzymatic activity (Poloumienko2004Genomic; Pavlovic2014A). These domains are necessary for the protein's function, as mutations in these sites significantly reduce catalytic activity (Pavlovic2014A).

The human PCYT2 protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms. The primary human transcript, PCYT2b, is shorter than its mouse counterpart due to the absence of Exon 7, which encodes an 18-amino acid peptide present in the mouse protein (Poloumienko2004Genomic). This splicing results in the human protein lacking a central region between the two catalytic domains, which is present in the mouse and rat proteins (Poloumienko2004Genomic).

The protein's quaternary structure involves the formation of homo- and heterodimers, which are crucial for its catalytic activity (Pavlovic2014A). The presence of splice variants, such as Pcyt2γ, can modulate the activity of the active isoforms through dominant-negative interactions, affecting the overall enzyme function (Pavlovic2014A).

## Function
The PCYT2 gene encodes the enzyme CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Pcyt2), which is essential for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) via the CDP-ethanolamine Kennedy pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of phosphoethanolamine to CDP-ethanolamine, a critical step in the production of PE, a major phospholipid in cellular membranes (Fullerton2010Complementation; Pavlovic2013Regulation). Pcyt2 is primarily active in the cytosol and the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it channels CDP-ethanolamine for PE formation (Pavlovic2013Regulation).

PE is crucial for various cellular processes, including membrane fusion, cell cycle regulation, autophagy, and apoptosis (Pavlovic2013Regulation). The enzyme's activity is regulated by substrate availability, such as ethanolamine and diacylglycerol, and is influenced by factors like serum depletion, which increases its mRNA and protein levels (Pavlovic2013Regulation). Pcyt2 is expressed in multiple isoforms, including Pcyt2α and Pcyt2β, which differ in catalytic properties and tissue-specific expression, with Pcyt2α exhibiting higher activity (Pavlovic2013Regulation).

The proper functioning of Pcyt2 is vital for maintaining lipid and energy homeostasis, and its deficiency can lead to metabolic disorders such as hypertriglyceridemia and liver steatosis (Pavlovic2013Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PCYT2 gene, which encodes the enzyme CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase, are linked to a complex hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). This condition is characterized by global developmental delay, spastic para- or tetraparesis, epilepsy, and progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy (Vaz2019Mutations; Tavasoli2020Genetic). The mutations result in hypomorphic variants that lead to decreased enzyme activity, affecting lipid metabolism and causing significant abnormalities in etherlipid and etherphospholipid metabolism (Vaz2019Mutations). 

Patients with PCYT2 mutations exhibit neurological symptoms such as epilepsy, nystagmus, poor visual acuity, and growth delay, with the condition being classified as a 'grey matter disorder' due to progressive neuronal loss (Vaz2019Mutations). The complete loss of PCYT2 function is likely incompatible with life, as demonstrated by the lethality of Pcyt2 null mice (Vaz2019Mutations; Grapentine2022Pcyt2).

Alterations in PCYT2 expression can also lead to metabolic syndrome-like symptoms, including insulin resistance and obesity, due to the accumulation of diacylglycerol and subsequent triacylglycerol production (Vaz2019Mutations). In heterozygous Pcyt2 +/- mice, age-dependent development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and insulin resistance has been observed, highlighting the gene's role in metabolic regulation (Grapentine2022Pcyt2).

## Interactions
The PCYT2 gene encodes the enzyme CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine. This enzyme participates in several interactions that influence its function and regulation. One notable interaction is with its splice variant, Pcyt2γ, which acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor. Pcyt2γ interacts with the active isoform Pcyt2α, forming inactive complexes that reduce the availability of functional Pcyt2α homodimers. This interaction significantly decreases the enzymatic activity of Pcyt2α by about 65% when co-expressed, highlighting the inhibitory role of Pcyt2γ (Pavlovic2014A).

The interaction between Pcyt2α and Pcyt2γ is confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrate the association between these proteins. The resulting inactive complexes are targeted for degradation via the proteasomal pathway, as evidenced by the use of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which reduces protein degradation (Pavlovic2014A). These interactions underscore the regulatory mechanisms of PCYT2, particularly in the context of its splice variants, and suggest a complex interplay that modulates enzyme activity and stability within the cell.
