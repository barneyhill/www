# ABCB8

## Overview
ABCB8 is a gene that encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 8 (ABCB8) protein, a mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. This protein is integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane and functions as a homodimeric half-transporter, characterized by a type IV fold with six transmembrane helices. ABCB8 plays a pivotal role in cellular iron homeostasis and the biogenesis of cytosolic iron-sulfur clusters, although its specific substrates remain to be fully elucidated. The protein is essential for mitochondrial iron export, thereby preventing oxidative stress and maintaining mitochondrial integrity. It is also implicated in the maturation of cytosolic iron-sulfur proteins, which are crucial for cellular function. The gene's expression is regulated by the transcription factor Sp1, and its disruption has been linked to significant clinical conditions, such as cardiomyopathy, due to its role in maintaining cardiac function and cellular health (Sachrajda2010Mithramycin; Ichikawa2012Disruption).

## Structure
ABCB8 is a mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It functions as a homodimeric half-transporter and exhibits a typical type IV fold, which includes a conserved core of six transmembrane helices (Thomas2020Structurala). The protein is involved in cellular iron homeostasis and cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, although its native substrates are not fully identified (Thomas2020Structurala).

The structure of ABCB8 includes single transmembrane and nucleotide-binding domains, which are characteristic of half-molecule ABC proteins (Ichikawa2012Disruption). The transmembrane helices TM4-6 are crucial for substrate-binding interactions, as identified in crystal structures of related Atm1-type transporters (Thomas2020Structurala).

ABCB8 is encoded on the nuclear genome and imported into mitochondria via the TOM complex. Its N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence is longer than usual, which is a feature shared with other mitochondrial ABC transporters like ABCB7 and ABCB10 (Schaedler2015Structures). Post-translational modifications of ABCB8 include acetylation, although the functional significance of this modification is not fully understood (Czuba2018Posttranslational).

## Function
ABCB8 is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein that plays a critical role in mitochondrial iron export and is essential for maintaining mitochondrial iron homeostasis. It is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial iron levels, which is crucial for preventing oxidative stress caused by excess iron accumulation (Ichikawa2012Disruption). ABCB8 is necessary for the maturation of cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe/S) proteins, as its activity influences the export of iron from mitochondria, which is vital for the proper functioning of these proteins (Ichikawa2012Disruption).

In healthy cells, ABCB8's function is linked to the protection against oxidative damage by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, thereby maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Ichikawa2012Disruption). The protein may interact with other mitochondrial ABC proteins, such as ABCB7, to form a functional complex involved in iron transport, although the exact mechanism and form of iron exported by ABCB8 remain unclear (Ichikawa2012Disruption). Overall, ABCB8 is crucial for cardiac function and cellular health, as evidenced by its reduced levels in patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy (Ichikawa2012Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the ABCB8 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in relation to cardiomyopathy. Research has demonstrated that a reduction in ABCB8 expression leads to mitochondrial iron accumulation, which is associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased activity of cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe/S) proteins. These changes contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac pathology (Ichikawa2012Disruption). In mouse models, cardiac-specific deletion of ABCB8 results in compromised cardiac function, characterized by reduced heart pump function, lower fractional shortening, and reduced cardiac output. Histological analyses reveal distorted myofiber architecture and increased cardiac fibrosis, while electron microscopy shows mitochondrial disorganization and iron aggregation (Ichikawa2012Disruption).

The accumulation of mitochondrial iron due to ABCB8 disruption exacerbates oxidative stress, leading to oxidative damage in cardiac tissues. This oxidative stress is a contributing factor to the development of cardiomyopathy (Ichikawa2012Disruption). The study also found that ABCB8 protein levels were significantly reduced in explanted hearts from patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy, further supporting its role in maintaining normal cardiac function (Ichikawa2012Disruption). These findings underscore the critical role of ABCB8 in mitochondrial iron homeostasis and its potential impact on heart health.

## Interactions
ABCB8 is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein that participates in various interactions crucial for its function. It forms complexes with several other proteins, including succinate dehydrogenase, nucleotide translocators, inorganic phosphate carriers, and ATP synthase in mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channels. These interactions are likely involved in protecting cells against oxidative stress (Sachrajda2010Mithramycin).

ABCB8 is also suggested to be involved in mitochondrial iron homeostasis, potentially by forming a functional multimeric complex with other mitochondrial ABC proteins, such as ABCB7. Although ABCB8 may not directly export iron, it could act as a positive regulator of another transporter. The exact form of iron exported by ABCB8 is not known, but it is speculated to be in a chelator-bound form, as part of a Fe/S cluster, or in a complex with other ions (Ichikawa2012Disruption).

The transcriptional regulation of the ABCB8 gene involves the transcription factor Sp1, which binds to the ABCB8 promoter region. Mithramycin A, an inhibitor of Sp1 binding, downregulates ABCB8 expression, indicating a regulatory interaction at the transcriptional level (Sachrajda2010Mithramycin).
