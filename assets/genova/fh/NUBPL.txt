# NUBPL

## Overview
NUBPL, or nucleotide-binding protein-like, is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial protein known as NUBP iron-sulfur cluster assembly factor. This protein is integral to the assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters, which are vital cofactors for the proper functioning of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (CI). As an assembly factor, NUBPL facilitates the incorporation of Fe/S clusters into CI subunits, thereby playing a crucial role in mitochondrial energy production and cellular respiration (Stehling2014Mitochondrial; Calvo2010Highthroughput). Mutations in the NUBPL gene can lead to mitochondrial disorders, including complex I deficiency, which manifests in various neurological and systemic symptoms (Protasoni2020Novel; Kimonis2020NUBPL). The protein's function is not rate-limiting under normal conditions, highlighting its essential yet non-restrictive role in mitochondrial function (Stehling2014Mitochondrial).

## Function
The NUBPL gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in the assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters, which are essential cofactors for the proper functioning of respiratory chain complex I (CI) in mitochondria. This protein is involved in the maturation and assembly of CI by facilitating the incorporation of Fe/S clusters into its subunits, particularly those containing NDUFS7 and NDUFS8 (Stehling2014Mitochondrial; Calvo2010Highthroughput). 

NUBPL is crucial for the assembly and stability of CI, which is the largest complex in the oxidative phosphorylation system, responsible for generating intracellular energy (Tucker2011Nextgeneration). In healthy human cells, NUBPL ensures the proper assembly and function of CI, which is vital for mitochondrial respiratory function and cellular energy production (Stehling2014Mitochondrial). The protein localizes to mitochondria, where it binds a labile Fe/S cluster, playing a role similar to other Fe/S cluster assembly factors (Sheftel2009Human).

Mutations in the NUBPL gene can lead to CI deficiencies, resulting in mitochondrial disorders, but in healthy individuals, the gene supports normal CI assembly, indicating that its function is not rate-limiting under typical conditions (Stehling2014Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NUBPL gene are associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency, a condition that can lead to a range of clinical manifestations. Patients with NUBPL mutations often present with neurological symptoms, including developmental delays, cerebellar dysfunction, and ataxia. These mutations can result in leukoencephalopathy with multi-systemic involvement, characterized by developmental delay, renal tubular acidosis, and generalized hypotonia (Protasoni2020Novel). 

Specific pathogenic variants, such as p.Phe242Leu and p.Leu104Pro, have been identified in patients, leading to undetectable levels of complex I subunits and a significant reduction in enzyme activity (Protasoni2020Novel). The c.815-27T>C variant is particularly common among non-Finnish Europeans and is associated with cerebellar dysfunction symptoms like ataxia and dysarthria (Kimonis2020NUBPL). 

In some cases, NUBPL mutations have been linked to early-onset, autosomal recessive generalized dystonia, cerebellar atrophy, and bilateral striatal necrosis (Balint2019Mitochondrial). Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that NUBPL mutations may increase the risk for Parkinson's disease, as seen in a patient with a complex chromosomal rearrangement involving the NUBPL gene (Eis2020LossofFunction).
