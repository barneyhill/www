# ACTR10

## Overview
ACTR10 is a gene that encodes the actin-related protein 10, a critical component of the dynactin complex, which is involved in intracellular transport processes. This protein is categorized as part of the actin-related protein family and plays a pivotal role in facilitating retrograde transport within cells, particularly in neurons. Actin-related protein 10 is essential for the proper localization and function of mitochondria in axons, contributing to the maintenance of neural circuit health. It interacts with the dynein motor protein complex and is involved in capping the Arp1 filament, which is crucial for dynactin stability and dynein function. The protein is notably active in the cytoplasm and is enriched in the nervous system during developmental stages, underscoring its importance in neuronal function and intracellular transport (Drerup2017Regulation).

## Function
ACTR10 (actin-related protein 10) is a crucial component of the dynactin complex, which collaborates with dynein motor proteins to facilitate retrograde transport within cells. This protein plays a significant role in the retrograde transport of mitochondria in axons, ensuring proper mitochondrial localization and function, which is essential for maintaining neural circuit health. In the absence of ACTR10, mitochondria accumulate in axon terminals due to disrupted retrograde transport, although anterograde transport remains unaffected (Drerup2017Regulation; herbert2018role).

ACTR10 interacts with mitochondria independently of the dynactin complex, suggesting a specific role in linking mitochondria to the retrograde motor. It is also involved in capping the Arp1 filament, which is crucial for dynactin stability and dynein function (Drerup2017Regulation). The protein's interaction with Drp1, a GTPase associated with mitochondrial fission, indicates that ACTR10 may facilitate the connection of mitochondria to the dynactin complex, potentially linking mitochondrial movement with fission processes (Drerup2017Regulation; herbert2018role).

ACTR10 is active in the cytoplasm and is particularly enriched in the nervous system during developmental stages, highlighting its importance in neuronal function and intracellular transport processes (Drerup2017Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACTR10 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. In zebrafish models, mutations in ACTR10 lead to reduced myelination in the central and peripheral nervous systems, resulting in axonal swellings and neurofilament accumulation, which are indicative of neurodegenerative phenotypes (herbert2018role). These phenotypes are similar to those observed in human neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2), and distal myopathy (herbert2018role).

In humans, missense mutations in ACTR10 have been identified in patients with ALS, CMT2, and distal myopathy. These mutations affect conserved amino acids between zebrafish and humans, suggesting a critical role for these residues in ACTR10 function (herbert2018role). The mutations are heterozygous in human patients, aligning with the lethal nature of homozygous mutations in zebrafish, indicating that these mutations may contribute to disease in a dose-dependent manner (herbert2018role).

Research using zebrafish models and mouse dorsal root ganglion cultures has been conducted to further understand the role of ACTR10 mutations in these diseases, although challenges remain in modeling human conditions due to differences in protein sequences and the multigenic nature of neurological disorders (herbert2018role).

## Interactions
ACTR10 is involved in several protein interactions, particularly in the context of mitochondrial retrograde transport within axons. It is a component of the dynactin complex, which is essential for the function of the dynein motor protein complex. ACTR10 facilitates the attachment of mitochondria to the dynein-dynactin complex, a critical step for retrograde transport. This interaction is specific to ACTR10, as it can bind mitochondria independently of the dynactin complex, indicating a unique role in linking mitochondria to the retrograde motor (Drerup2017Regulation).

ACTR10 also interacts with Drp1, a GTPase involved in mitochondrial fission. This interaction suggests that ACTR10 may play a role in coordinating mitochondrial movement and fission, potentially facilitating the recruitment of the retrograde motor protein complex during mitochondrial fission events (Drerup2017Regulation; herbert2018role). The interaction between ACTR10 and Drp1 is enhanced with a specific Drp1 variant (K38A), which mimics a GDP-bound form, further supporting the functional relationship between these proteins in mitochondrial transport (Drerup2017Regulation).

In oligodendrocytes, ACTR10 is implicated in the transport of mbp mRNA, interacting with dynein and dynactin complexes to facilitate this process, which is crucial for proper myelination (Herbert2017Dyneindynactin).
