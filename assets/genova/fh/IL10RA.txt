# IL10RA

## Overview
The IL10RA gene encodes the interleukin 10 receptor subunit alpha, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of interleukin-10 (IL-10). This receptor is primarily expressed on immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes, where it forms part of the IL-10 receptor complex. The IL10RA protein is essential for the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, particularly STAT3, which leads to the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and helps maintain immune homeostasis (Sharifinejad2022The). Mutations in the IL10RA gene can result in severe immune dysregulation, contributing to conditions such as very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) (Sharifinejad2021Immune). The clinical significance of IL10RA extends to its involvement in various diseases, including cancer, where its expression levels can influence immune cell function and disease progression (Cheng2021Identification).

## Structure
The IL10RA protein, encoded by the IL10RA gene, is a critical component of the interleukin-10 receptor complex, which plays a significant role in immune response regulation. The primary structure of IL10RA consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-order structures (Oh2018Novel).

The secondary structure of IL10RA includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, essential for its interaction with interleukin-10 (IL-10) (AlAbbasi2018Computational).

The quaternary structure of IL10RA involves its association with other proteins, such as the IL-10 receptor subunit beta, to form a functional receptor complex. This complex is crucial for the binding of IL-10 and subsequent signal transduction (AlAbbasi2018Computational).

IL10RA contains specific domains, including an extracellular domain that binds IL-10, a transmembrane domain, and a cytosolic domain. The extracellular domain is particularly important for cytokine binding and is affected by various mutations that can disrupt its function (Aschenbrenner2022Pathogenic). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may influence the protein's stability and function (AlAbbasi2018Computational).

## Function
The IL10RA gene encodes the interleukin 10 receptor subunit alpha, which is a critical component of the IL-10 receptor complex. This receptor is essential for mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of interleukin-10 (IL-10), a cytokine that plays a significant role in immune regulation. IL10RA is primarily expressed on immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes, where it facilitates the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and helps maintain immune homeostasis (Sharifinejad2022The).

In healthy human cells, IL10RA is involved in the IL-10 signaling pathway, which activates the JAK-STAT signaling cascade, particularly STAT3. This activation leads to the downregulation of T-helper 1 cytokines, reduction in antigen presentation, and inhibition of T cell activation. The pathway also modulates macrophage activation and enhances B cell survival and proliferation (Sharifinejad2022The). IL10RA's role is crucial in controlling immune responses to commensal microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing excessive inflammation and maintaining intestinal homeostasis (Veenbergen2017Development). Defects in IL10RA can lead to a hyper-inflammatory state, contributing to conditions such as early-onset inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (Sharifinejad2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IL10RA gene are associated with severe immune dysregulation, particularly manifesting as very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD). These mutations can lead to conditions such as chronic diarrhea, colitis, and fistula formation, often presenting within the first year of life (Sharifinejad2021Immune; Shim2014Very). The most common mutations identified in IL10RA include c.301C>T (p.R101W) and c.537G>A (p.T179T), which are linked to severe phenotypes of infantile IBD (Sharifinejad2021Immune; Oh2016A). 

Patients with IL10RA mutations often exhibit elevated IL-10 levels due to defective receptor binding, leading to inappropriate immune responses (Sharifinejad2021Immune). These mutations can also result in elevated IgA levels and are associated with dermatologic issues and failure to thrive (Sharifinejad2021Immune). Conventional treatments for IBD are frequently ineffective, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is considered a curative option (LaBarba2016The; Mandola2017A). 

Alterations in IL10RA expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer. In metastatic melanoma, IL10RA is upregulated in certain T cells, affecting their expansion and function (Cheng2021Identification). These findings underscore the clinical significance of IL10RA in immune regulation and disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
The IL10RA protein, or interleukin 10 receptor subunit alpha, is involved in several critical interactions that facilitate its role in immune response regulation. It forms a high-affinity complex with IL10, which is essential for activating downstream anti-inflammatory responses. This interaction is crucial for the nuclear translocation of STAT3 and subsequent gene transcription, mediated through the JAK1 pathway (AlAbbasi2018Computational). IL10RA also interacts with IL10RB (interleukin 10 receptor subunit beta) to form a functional receptor complex for IL-10, which is vital for IL-10-mediated signaling (AlAbbasi2018Computational).

The protein-protein interaction network analysis using the STRING server has shown that IL10RA directly interacts with IL10, JAK1, and IL10RB with high confidence scores, indicating strong and significant interactions (AlAbbasi2018Computational). These interactions are essential for mediating signal transduction and maintaining the structural stability of the receptor complex. Mutations in IL10RA, such as R101W, Y91C, and R117H, can significantly alter the binding energies and efficacy of IL10 binding, impacting the protein's function and its ability to regulate immune responses effectively (AlAbbasi2018Computational).
