# SF1

## Overview
Splicing Factor 1 (SF1) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in the pre-mRNA splicing process. The SF1 protein is categorized as a splicing factor and is integral to the early stages of spliceosome assembly, a critical step in the maturation of pre-mRNA into functional mRNA. It specifically binds to the branch point sequence (BPS) within introns, facilitating the recognition and selection of this sequence, which is essential for accurate splicing (Berglund1998A). The protein's structure includes several domains, such as the KH-QUA2 domain, which is crucial for RNA binding, and the SURP-ID domain, which mediates interactions with other splicing factors (Crisci2015Mammalian; Liu2001Structural). SF1's interactions with U2AF65 and other components of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) are vital for the assembly and function of the spliceosome, highlighting its importance in gene expression regulation (Rino2008Splicing; RAIN1998Conservation).

## Structure
Splicing Factor 1 (SF1) is a protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing, characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The primary structure of SF1 includes a highly conserved central domain known as the 'mystery domain' (SF1md), which is approximately 100 amino acids long and is located between the U2AF ligand motif (ULM) and the KH-QUA2 domains (Gupta2011Purification). The KH-QUA2 domain is crucial for binding the branch point sequence (BPS) RNA, adopting an enlarged KH fold that facilitates specific RNA interactions (Liu2001Structural). This domain includes a Gly-Pro-Arg-Gly motif and a variable loop that specifically recognize parts of the BPS, while the QUA2 region forms an amphipathic helix interfacing with the KH domain (Liu2001Structural).

The tertiary structure of SF1 involves a hydrophobic core that stabilizes the KH domain, with the branch point adenosine deeply buried within a hydrophobic cleft, stabilized by hydrogen bonds (Liu2001Structural). SF1 also interacts with U2 snRNP-associated proteins through its SURP-ID domain, which is highly conserved in mammals and predicted to have a helical structure (Crisci2015Mammalian). These interactions are essential for the efficient recruitment of the U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA during spliceosome assembly (Crisci2015Mammalian).

## Function
Splicing factor 1 (SF1) is a crucial protein involved in the early stages of spliceosome assembly, a process essential for pre-mRNA splicing in human cells. SF1 binds to the branch point sequence (BPS) within introns, facilitating the recognition and selection of the BPS, which is a key step in the splicing process (Berglund1998A). The maxi-KH domain of SF1 is essential for its RNA-binding function, and mutations in this domain can significantly reduce RNA-binding activity, affecting pre-spliceosome assembly (RAIN1998Conservation).

SF1 interacts with U2AF65, a splicing factor that binds to the polypyrimidine tract adjacent to the BPS. This interaction is cooperative, enhancing the binding to RNA substrates containing both BPS and the polypyrimidine tract, which is crucial for the initial recognition of the BPS (Berglund1998A). SF1's interaction with U2AF65 is transient, as SF1 is displaced during the formation of the A complex, where U2 snRNP stably associates with the branch point (Rino2008Splicing).

SF1 is active in the nucleus, particularly in nuclear speckles, where it forms stable complexes with U2AF proteins. These complexes are necessary for SF1's localization and function in splicing (Rino2008Splicing).

## Interactions
Splicing factor 1 (SF1) is involved in several critical interactions during the spliceosome assembly process. SF1 interacts with U2AF65, a component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), which is essential for pre-mRNA splicing. This interaction is facilitated by the N-terminal region of SF1, which is crucial for binding to U2AF65 (RAIN1998Conservation). SF1 also binds directly to SF3a120 and CHERP, proteins associated with the U2 snRNP, through its SURP-ID domain. This interaction is vital for the efficient assembly of the early spliceosome complex, particularly when the pre-mRNA contains a weak branch point sequence (Crisci2015Mammalian).

In addition to its interactions with U2AF65 and U2 snRNP-associated proteins, SF1 forms a complex with U2AF65 and U2AF35, which is crucial for their retention in nuclear speckles. This complex formation is necessary for the proper localization and function of these splicing factors within the nucleus (Rino2008Splicing). The interactions between SF1 and these proteins are not only essential for spliceosome assembly but also influence the mobility and distribution of these factors within the nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles (Rino2008Splicing).
