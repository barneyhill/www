# DRAP1

## Overview
DRAP1, or DR1 associated protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional repression. The protein, also referred to as DRAP1, functions as a corepressor by forming a complex with the DR1 protein, which interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to inhibit the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex. This interaction is facilitated by a histone fold motif, which is crucial for the protein-protein interactions necessary for transcriptional repression. DRAP1 is expressed ubiquitously, with higher expression levels in tissues with low mitotic activity, such as heart and skeletal muscle, and plays a significant role in maintaining the differentiated state of cells by silencing specific genes. The DR1-DRAP1 complex is essential for maximal repression activity, highlighting its importance in regulating gene expression across various tissues (Mermelstein1996Requirement; Yeung1997Functional).

## Structure
DRAP1, also known as DR1 associated protein 1, is a polypeptide that plays a crucial role in transcriptional repression by interacting with the Dr1 protein. The primary structure of DRAP1 includes a polypeptide chain of 193 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 21.2 kD. An alternative splice variant from liver cells includes an insertion of 7 additional amino acids (Mermelstein1996Requirement).

The secondary and tertiary structures of DRAP1 are characterized by a region homologous to the yeast HAP5 protein, which includes a histone fold motif. This motif is essential for protein-protein interactions, particularly with Dr1, and is crucial for the repression of transcription. The histone fold is a common structural motif that facilitates the formation of heterodimers, such as the DR1-DRAP1 complex (Mermelstein1996Requirement).

In terms of quaternary structure, DRAP1 forms a heterotetrameric complex with Dr1, known as NC2, which efficiently represses class II transcription. This complex disrupts the interaction of transcription factors like TFIIA and TFIIB with the TATA-binding protein (TBP), thereby inhibiting transcription initiation (Yeung1997Functional). The carboxyl terminus of DRAP1 is rich in proline residues, which may influence its structural conformation and interaction capabilities (Mermelstein1996Requirement).

## Function
DRAP1 (DR1 associated protein 1) functions as a corepressor in transcriptional regulation by forming a complex with the DR1 protein. This complex interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to stabilize the DR1-TBP-TATA motif complex, thereby preventing the entry of transcription factors TFIIA and TFIIB into the preinitiation complex, which results in transcriptional repression (Mermelstein1996Requirement; Yeung1997Functional). DRAP1 enhances the repressive activity of DR1, requiring the histone fold/HAP3 motif in DR1 and the histone fold/HAP5 region in DRAP1 for their interaction and function (Mermelstein1996Requirement).

DRAP1 is expressed in all tissues analyzed, with higher levels in tissues with a low mitotic index, such as heart and skeletal muscle, and is particularly active in differentiated, non-dividing cells (Mermelstein1996Requirement). In the developing rat brain, DRAP1 is not expressed in neural stem cells but is present in differentiated neurons, suggesting a role in maintaining the differentiated state by silencing specific genes (Mermelstein1996Requirement). The DR1-DRAP1 complex is crucial for maximal repression activity, indicating its significant role in regulating gene expression in various tissues (Yeung1997Functional).

## Clinical Significance
DRAP1 (DR1 associated protein 1) has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in transcriptional repression. In breast invasive carcinoma, particularly among Black/African-American patients, increased expression of DRAP1 is associated with aggressive tumor biology and poorer prognosis. This is linked to its role as a master regulator in the immortalization gene set, which is inversely correlated with patient survival (Andey2020Enhanced).

In cardiovascular diseases, DRAP1 is identified as a key driver gene in regulatory gene networks associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). Its involvement in RNA processing and cholesterol ester accumulation in foam cells suggests a significant role in atherosclerosis (Joshi2020Systems; Markin2020Cellular).

DRAP1 also plays a role in neurodegenerative conditions such as tauopathy, where it acts as a modifier of tau toxicity, potentially influencing cellular stress responses (Ambegaokar2011Functional).

The Dr1-DRAP1 complex is crucial for transcriptional repression, and alterations in this interaction can disrupt normal gene regulation, potentially contributing to various diseases (Yeung1997Functional).

## Interactions
DRAP1 (DR1 associated protein 1) is known to interact with the DR1 protein to form a repressor complex that plays a crucial role in transcriptional repression. This complex binds to the TATA-binding protein (TBP), altering the TBP-TATA motif structure and preventing the association of essential transcription factors such as TFIIA and TFIIB, thereby inhibiting the formation of a functional preinitiation complex (Mermelstein1996Requirement; Yeung1997Functional). The interaction between DRAP1 and DR1 is facilitated by a histone fold motif, which is essential for their binding and the subsequent repression of transcription (Mermelstein1996Requirement).

DRAP1 also interacts with BTAF1, a protein that regulates TBP. This interaction stimulates the ATP-dependent association of BTAF1 with TBP, although it does not involve the ATPase activity of BTAF1 or phosphorylation of DRAP1 (Klejman2004NC2α). Additionally, DRAP1 has been shown to bind to the FoxH1 transcription factor, inhibiting its DNA binding ability (Klejman2004NC2α). These interactions highlight DRAP1's role in modulating transcription by forming complexes with various proteins and influencing their activity.
