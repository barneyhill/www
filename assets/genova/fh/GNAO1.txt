# GNAO1

## Overview
GNAO1 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit alpha o1, a critical component of the heterotrimeric G protein complex involved in intracellular signal transduction. The protein encoded by GNAO1, Gαo, is a member of the G protein family, which plays a pivotal role in transmitting signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to various intracellular pathways. Gαo is characterized by its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP, a function essential for its role in modulating signal transduction processes. The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it is involved in regulating neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability. Mutations in the GNAO1 gene have been linked to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including epileptic encephalopathy and movement disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal neurological function (Solis2024Neomorphic; Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

## Structure
The GNAO1 gene encodes the G protein subunit alpha o1, a key component of the heterotrimeric G protein complex involved in signal transduction. The GNAO1 protein is characterized by a long N-terminal intrinsically disordered protein region (IDPR) and multiple post-translational modification (PTM) sites, which are crucial for its function (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). Common PTMs include myristoylation and palmitoylation, which facilitate membrane localization.

The GNAO1 protein has an alternatively spliced isoform, GNAO Alpha-2, which differs from the canonical form by having a modified C-terminal region (residues 249-354) (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). This alternative splicing results in two isoforms that likely exhibit functional differences due to variations in the final two exons, affecting regions necessary for receptor-G protein interaction and activation (Lokits2018Tracing).

The R243H mutation in GNAO1 leads to constitutive activation of the Gαo protein by enhancing nucleotide exchange rates, although it does not impair GTPase activity. This mutation disrupts a conserved electrostatic interaction, contributing to its oncogenic potential (GarciaMarcos2011Molecular). The mutation highlights the importance of specific residues in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the protein.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GNAO1 gene are associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, including epileptic encephalopathy, movement disorders, and developmental delays. These mutations often result in early onset epilepsy and/or movement disorders, with seizures being a common presenting feature (Kelly2019Spectrum). The phenotypic spectrum includes severe intellectual disability, motor developmental delay, and involuntary movements, such as dystonia, chorea, and athetosis (Nakamura2013De). 

GNAO1 mutations can lead to both gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) effects. GOF mutations are often associated with movement disorders, while LOF mutations are linked to epileptic encephalopathy (Feng2017Movement). The mutations can impair the function of the Gαo protein, which is abundant in brain tissue, affecting pathways mediated by G-protein-coupled receptors (Saitsu2015Phenotypic). 

Clinical manifestations of GNAO1-related disorders include severe hypotonia, postural control disturbances, and paroxysmal exacerbations that may require intensive care (Novelli2023GNAO1related). MRI findings in affected individuals can show cerebral atrophy and delayed myelination, although major structural abnormalities are not typically observed (Kelly2019Spectrum).

## Interactions
The GNAO1 gene encodes the G protein subunit alpha o1, which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for signal transduction. GNAO1 interacts with Gβγ subunits, forming a complex that dissociates upon activation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), leading to independent signaling by Gα and Gβγ (Mihalek2017Molecular). It also interacts with several GPCRs, including those from the GABA, adrenergic, dopamine, and muscarinic systems, with a notable interaction with the DRD2 receptor (Mihalek2017Molecular).

Pathogenic mutations in GNAO1 result in neomorphic interactions with Ric8A and Ric8B proteins, which are not typical for the wild-type Gαo. These interactions are associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy-17 (DEE17) and neurodevelopmental disorder with involuntary movements (NEDIM) (Solis2024Neomorphic). The GNAO1 mutants, except for C215Y, show strong binding to Ric8A, leading to altered localization of Ric8A to the Golgi and plasma membrane (Solis2024Neomorphic). These interactions are significant as they can outcompete Ric8A/B from their other cognate Gα subunits, potentially affecting Ric8 chaperone activity (Solis2024Neomorphic). The neomorphic interaction with Ric8B is particularly noted as a strong predictor of disease severity (Solis2024Neomorphic).
