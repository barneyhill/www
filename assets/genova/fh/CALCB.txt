# CALCB

## Overview
The CALCB gene encodes the calcitonin gene-related peptide beta (CGRPβ), a neuropeptide that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including vasodilation, pain transmission, and neuromodulation. As a member of the calcitonin gene-related peptide family, CGRPβ is characterized by its 37-amino acid structure, which includes a conserved N-terminal circular region, an α-helical structure, and an amidated C-terminal residue (Sekiguchi2018The). The peptide is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and exerts its effects through G protein-coupled receptor complexes, specifically involving the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) (Dallmayer2019Targeting). These interactions facilitate its role in regulating vascular tone, blood flow, and sensory perception, making it significant in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis and modulating pain pathways (WIMALAWANSA1996Calcitonin). The clinical relevance of CALCB is underscored by its involvement in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where its expression and interactions contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (Dallmayer2019Targeting; Șerban2024Expression).

## Structure
The CALCB gene encodes the βCGRP (beta-calcitonin gene-related peptide), a 37-amino acid neuropeptide involved in various physiological processes, including vasodilation and pain transmission (Alkanli2018CalcitoninRelated; Zhao2020Sustained). The primary structure of βCGRP is highly similar to αCGRP, differing by only three amino acids in humans (Sekiguchi2018The). The molecular structure of βCGRP includes a conserved N-terminal circular region formed by a disulfide bond, an α-helical structure, and an amidated C-terminal residue, which are characteristic features of the calcitonin gene-related peptide family (Sekiguchi2018The).

The CALCB gene contains five exons that encode several domains in the βCGRP protein, including two propeptide domains, two unknown domains, and one signal peptide domain (Liu2017CALCB). The βCGRP protein is involved in hormone activity and neuropeptide hormone activity, with its immunoreactivity mainly found in inflammatory cells surrounding pancreatic nerve fibers and microvasculature (Liu2017CALCB). The peptide-receptor interaction is modulated by receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), which influence receptor selectivity (Sekiguchi2018The). The CALCB gene's expression results in the production of this peptide, which has various roles in the body, such as vasodilation, modulation of neurotransmitter release, and regulation of hormone secretion (Alkanli2018CalcitoninRelated).

## Function
The CALCB gene encodes the calcitonin gene-related peptide beta (CGRPβ), a neuropeptide primarily involved in vasodilation and pain transmission. CGRPβ is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and plays a significant role in regulating vascular tone and blood flow. It exerts its effects through G protein-coupled receptor complexes, specifically the CGRP receptor, which is formed by the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) (Dallmayer2019Targeting). This interaction leads to an increase in intracellular cAMP levels, promoting smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation (WIMALAWANSA1996Calcitonin).

CGRPβ is also involved in neuromodulation, acting at neuromuscular junctions and influencing sensory perception. It is coproduced with acetylcholine and is present in motor neurons, contributing to the regulation of multiple biological processes, including inflammation modulation and metabolic regulation (WIMALAWANSA1996Calcitonin). The peptide's presence in nervous tissues and blood vessels suggests its role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis and modulating pain pathways, which are crucial for processes like migraine pathophysiology (WIMALAWANSA1996Calcitonin).

## Clinical Significance
The CALCB gene, encoding calcitonin gene-related peptide beta (CGRPβ), is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In Ewing sarcoma (EwS), CALCB is highly overexpressed and is a direct target of the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion oncogene. This overexpression is linked to tumor proliferation and stemness, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Dallmayer2019Targeting). Knockdown experiments have shown that reducing CALCB expression can significantly decrease EwS cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Dallmayer2019Targeting).

In colorectal adenocarcinoma, increased expression of CGRP, the peptide encoded by CALCB, is associated with advanced tumor stages and poor differentiation. This expression correlates with increased tumor invasiveness and metastasis, indicating a role in cancer progression (Șerban2024Expression). The CGRP-RAMP1-CRLR complex, involving the receptor for CGRP, is implicated in promoting tumor cell motility and invasion, further supporting the significance of CALCB in cancer (Șerban2024Expression). These findings underscore the clinical importance of CALCB in cancer biology and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
CALCB, or calcitonin gene-related peptide beta, interacts with several proteins to form functional receptor complexes. It primarily signals through the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) in association with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), specifically RAMP1, RAMP2, and RAMP3. These interactions are crucial for determining ligand specificity and facilitating the physiological effects of CALCB, such as vasodilation and modulation of vascular responses (Chauhan2021Soluble).

In the context of maternal vascular smooth muscle cells, CALCB has been shown to increase cAMP synthesis and VEGF-A mRNA expression, counteracting the effects of soluble FLT-1 (sFLT-1), which decreases cAMP synthesis. This interaction suggests a protective role of CALCB against sFLT-1-induced vascular dysfunction during pregnancy (Chauhan2021Soluble).

In Ewing sarcoma, CALCB is highly overexpressed and interacts with the CGRP receptor complex, which includes RAMP1. This interaction is significant for the growth and proliferation of Ewing sarcoma cells. Knockdown of CALCB or RAMP1, or inhibition of the CGRP receptor, reduces tumor growth, highlighting the importance of the CALCB/RAMP1 axis in this cancer type (Dallmayer2019Targeting).
