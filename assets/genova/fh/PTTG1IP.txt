# PTTG1IP

## Overview
PTTG1IP, or pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 interacting protein, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly the regulation of the cell cycle. The protein, also referred to as PBF (PTTG1-binding factor), plays a pivotal role in the metaphase-anaphase transition by facilitating the nuclear translocation of securin, a key regulator of sister chromatid separation during mitosis (Repo2017PTTG1interacting). PTTG1IP is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular proliferation and maintenance (Repo2017PTTG1interacting). Beyond its involvement in normal cellular functions, PTTG1IP has been implicated in several cancers, where its expression levels and interactions with other proteins, such as p53, influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Repo2017PTTG1interacting; Grzechowiak2020The). The gene's regulatory interactions and expression patterns make it a significant focus of research in cancer biology and a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Function
PTTG1IP, also known as PTTG1-interacting protein, plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly during the metaphase-anaphase transition. It facilitates the translocation of securin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, enabling its interaction with separase, which is essential for the controlled release of sister chromatids during cell division (Repo2017PTTG1interacting). This protein is ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues, including the placenta, thyroid gland, lymph node, and bone marrow, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Repo2017PTTG1interacting).

In healthy cells, PTTG1IP is primarily associated with the regulation of mitosis through its interaction with securin, contributing to chromosome stability and segregation. It is active in the nucleus, where it is implicated in processes such as DNA repair and cellular proliferation, influencing tissue growth and maintenance (Repo2017PTTG1interacting). The protein has also been linked to the transactivation of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and the regulation of the human sodium symporter in thyroid cells, although the full range of its functions in healthy human cells is not yet fully understood (Repo2017PTTG1interacting).

## Clinical Significance
PTTG1IP has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, PTTG1IP expression is inversely related to cancer aggressiveness, with higher expression associated with better prognosis. PTTG1IP-negativity is linked to a higher risk of breast cancer death, particularly in triple-negative breast carcinomas (Repo2017PTTG1interacting). In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), high PTTG1IP expression correlates with a faster response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, suggesting its potential as a predictive marker for treatment outcomes (Christiani2023Gene).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PTTG1IP expression is significantly reduced due to hypermethylation of its promoter, which is associated with tumor progression. This downregulation may play a role in cancer development, highlighting the potential of PTTG1IP as a target for therapeutic intervention (Tan2019Hypermethylation). Additionally, in hepatocellular carcinoma, PTTG1IP is upregulated due to the repression of miR-122 by hepatitis B virus mRNAs, contributing to tumor growth and invasion (Li2013Hepatitis).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of PTTG1IP in cancer prognosis and treatment, with its expression levels serving as potential biomarkers for various malignancies.

## Interactions
PTTG1IP, also known as PBF, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function in cellular processes. It is known to bind with PTTG1 in the cytosol, facilitating its transport into the nucleus, which is crucial for the metaphase-anaphase transition during cell division (Repo2017PTTG1interacting; Nieuwenhuis2016PTTG1IP). This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, as PTTG1IP overexpression has been observed in various malignancies, including breast carcinoma, where it interacts with securin to regulate the cell cycle (Repo2017PTTG1interacting).

PTTG1IP also interacts with the TP53 signaling pathway, modulating interactions that can reduce p53 protein stability, thereby affecting downstream targets and potentially leading to worse outcomes in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (Grzechowiak2020The). In breast cancer, PTTG1IP is overexpressed in estrogen receptor-positive cases, possibly due to an estrogen response element in its promoter, and its interaction with p53 can dysregulate p53 function (Repo2017PTTG1interacting).

Additionally, PTTG1IP has been identified as a direct transcriptional target of the bone-specific transcription factor Runx2, with Runx2 binding to specific sites in the PTTG1IP promoter region, indicating a regulatory interaction (Stock2004Identification).
