# UNC119B

## Overview
UNC119B is a gene that encodes the protein unc-119 lipid binding chaperone B, which is a member of the guanine dissociation inhibitor-like solubilizing factors (GSFs) family. This protein is characterized by an immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich fold, which facilitates its role as a lipid-binding chaperone. UNC119B is primarily involved in the trafficking of myristoylated proteins to the primary cilium, a critical cellular organelle involved in various signaling pathways. The protein interacts with small GTPases, such as ARL3, to mediate the release and proper localization of its cargo, impacting cellular processes like photoreceptor function and immune cell signaling. Its function is crucial for maintaining normal cellular activities and is linked to ciliopathies and certain cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, where it may serve as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker (Yelland2021The; Wu2023Integrated; Wright2011An).

## Structure
UNC119B is a protein characterized by an immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich fold, which is a common structural motif in proteins involved in lipid binding. This fold forms a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates lipid modifications, crucial for its role in solubilizing and trafficking lipophilic cargoes (Yelland2021The; Zhang2011UNC119). The primary structure of UNC119B includes a unique stretch of negatively charged amino acids, particularly rich in glutamic acid residues, which may contribute to its specific cargo binding and release mechanisms (Yelland2021The).

The secondary structure of UNC119B includes beta-strands and alpha-helices, forming the beta-sandwich fold. The tertiary structure is characterized by the overall 3D shape of the protein, which includes a hydrophobic cavity for lipid interaction (Zhang2011UNC119). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of UNC119B with other proteins, such as ARL3, forming complexes that facilitate cargo release (Yelland2021The).

UNC119B also features an additional 2′ β-strand not observed in its paralog UNC119A, which may enhance its binding affinity for certain cargoes (Yelland2021The). This structural difference suggests a potential mechanism for the specific release of high-affinity cargoes.

## Function
UNC119B encodes a protein that functions as a lipid-binding chaperone, primarily involved in the trafficking of myristoylated proteins to the primary cilium, a critical cellular organelle involved in signaling pathways. This protein is part of the guanine dissociation inhibitor-like solubilizing factors (GSFs) family, which includes UNC119A and UNC119B, both of which share a beta sandwich immunoglobulin fold that forms a hydrophobic pocket. This structure allows UNC119B to bind and solubilize N-myristoylated proteins, facilitating their transport between cellular membranes by masking their hydrophobic lipid modifications from the hydrophilic cytosol (Yelland2021The).

UNC119B specifically interacts with the ARL3 GTPase pathway, which is essential for targeting myristoylated proteins like nephrocystin-3 (NPHP3) to the ciliary membrane. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization of these proteins, impacting ciliary function and, consequently, cellular signaling and development (Wright2011An). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and localizes to the transition zone and proximal cilium, indicating its role in ciliary protein trafficking (Wright2011An).

UNC119B's function is vital for normal cellular processes, including photoreceptor function and immune cell signaling, which are essential for vision and immune responses (Yelland2021The). Its role in ciliary targeting links it to ciliopathies, such as Senior Løken and Joubert syndromes, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health (Constantine2012Uncoordinated).

## Clinical Significance
UNC119B is implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). High expression levels of UNC119B are associated with poor immune function in HCC, affecting natural killer (NK) cell function and immune responses. This gene is linked to lower immune cell scores and impaired interferon responses, suggesting an inhibitory role in HCC immunotherapy (Wu2023Integrated). UNC119B is also related to chemotherapy resistance, including resistance to Carfilzomib, and is involved in the activation of signaling pathways such as the KEGG-MTOR-signaling-pathway, which are relevant to HCC tumorigenesis and progression (Wu2023Integrated). The gene is associated with accelerated proliferation, malignant pathological grade, and advanced tumor stage in HCC, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker (Wu2023Integrated).

In addition to its role in cancer, UNC119B is involved in the trafficking of myristoylated proteins, which is crucial for cellular processes. Alterations in its expression or interactions may impact protein transport and signal transduction, potentially leading to immune system dysfunctions and other cellular abnormalities (Yelland2021The). However, specific diseases directly resulting from UNC119B mutations have not been detailed in the provided context.

## Interactions
UNC119B, a lipid-binding chaperone, interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in the trafficking of myristoylated proteins. It binds to N-myristoylated proteins, facilitating their trafficking by masking the hydrophobic lipid from the hydrophilic cytosol. UNC119B interacts with the small GTPases ARL2 and ARL3, which are involved in the release of myristoylated cargo proteins. ARL3, in particular, binds to UNC119B in a GTP-specific manner, inducing conformational changes that facilitate cargo release (Yelland2021The; Wright2011An).

The interaction between UNC119B and ARL3 involves a parallel β-strand interaction, with an interface of approximately 1000 Å², and is characterized by conserved electrostatic interactions (Yelland2021The). This interaction is crucial for the proper localization of proteins such as NPHP3 to the primary cilium, highlighting the role of UNC119B in ciliary function (Wright2011An).

UNC119B also interacts with various myristoylated proteins, including LCK, FMNL1, PCMTD1, and GNAI2, with varying binding affinities. These interactions are essential for the cellular trafficking and localization of these proteins, with ARL3 consistently releasing peptides more efficiently than ARL2 (Yelland2021The).
