# CIBAR2

## Overview
CIBAR2, or CBY1 interacting BAR domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, most notably ciliogenesis. The protein, characterized by its BAR domain, is implicated in membrane dynamics and cytoskeletal organization, which are essential for the formation and function of cilia. CIBAR2 interacts with the ciliary protein Chibby1 (Cby1) and is recruited to mother centrioles and basal bodies, playing a crucial role in membrane remodeling processes necessary for ciliogenesis (Cyge2021Loss). The protein is localized at the base of cilia in several tissues, including the human fallopian tube, and is part of the protein repertoire involved in building and maintaining motile cilia (Lindskog2024A). Beyond its role in ciliogenesis, CIBAR2 is also associated with cellular signaling pathways, potentially influencing cell morphology and movement (Jiang2024SingleCell). Its involvement in neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy highlights its clinical significance, although further research is needed to fully understand its functions and interactions (Binder2022Machine; Timechko2023Mass).

## Function
CIBAR2, also known as CBY1 Interacting BAR Domain Containing 2, is a protein involved in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, through its interaction with the ciliary protein Chibby1 (Cby1). CIBAR2 is recruited to mother centrioles and basal bodies by Cby1, likely playing a role in membrane remodeling processes essential for ciliogenesis (Cyge2021Loss). The protein is localized at the base of cilia in various tissues, including the human fallopian tube, where it is part of the common repertoire of proteins involved in building and maintaining motile cilia (Lindskog2024A). 

CIBAR2 is also implicated in cellular processes such as membrane dynamics and cytoskeletal organization, which are typical functions of proteins with BAR domains. These proteins participate in membrane curvature and vesicle trafficking, suggesting that CIBAR2 may influence cellular signaling pathways and affect cell morphology and movement (Jiang2024SingleCell). Although specific functions of CIBAR2 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its involvement in ciliogenesis and potential roles in cellular signaling highlight its importance in maintaining normal cellular and tissue functions.

## Clinical Significance
CIBAR2, also known as CBY1 interacting BAR domain containing 2, has been identified as a gene of interest in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Studies utilizing machine learning models have highlighted CIBAR2 as a significant gene associated with AD, particularly in relation to immune response and tau pathology. It is ranked among the top genes with potential relevance to AD, suggesting its involvement in inflammation and amyloid-β processing pathways, which are critical in AD pathology (Binder2022Machine).

Alterations in the expression of CIBAR2 have been observed in AD brain tissues, with significant changes at the mRNA level and upregulation at the protein level in human autopsy samples. These findings indicate that CIBAR2 may play a role in the disease's progression, making it a candidate for further investigation as a potential drug target (Binder2022Machine).

While the specific clinical implications of CIBAR2 mutations or altered interactions are not fully understood, its involvement in ciliogenesis and interaction with proteins like Chibby1 suggests a potential link to ciliary function and related disorders. However, more research is needed to elucidate its precise role in disease mechanisms (Cyge2021Loss).

## Interactions
CIBAR2, also known as CBY1 interacting BAR domain containing 2, is involved in ciliogenesis, a process crucial for the formation and function of cilia. CIBAR2 is recruited by the protein Chibby1 (Cby1) to mother centrioles and basal bodies, which are essential structures in cilia formation. This recruitment likely involves membrane remodeling processes, although specific details of the physical interactions between CIBAR2 and other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively documented (Cyge2021Loss).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease research, CIBAR2 has been identified as a potential gene of interest due to its categorization as Tdark, indicating it is less well-studied. While the study highlights CIBAR2's potential role in ciliogenesis via cell projection organization, it does not provide specific details on its physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids (Binder2022Machine).

CIBAR2 has also been identified in studies related to epilepsy, where it was found to be overexpressed in a chronic stage of epilepsy induced by lithium-pilocarpine. However, the study does not elaborate on the specific interactions of CIBAR2 with other proteins or nucleic acids, focusing instead on expression patterns and potential roles in synaptic signaling and neurogenesis (Timechko2023Mass).
