# LYRM4

## Overview
The LYRM4 gene encodes the LYR motif containing 4 protein, also known as ISD11, which is a mitochondrial protein integral to the biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters. These clusters are essential cofactors for numerous mitochondrial proteins involved in critical cellular processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and the citric acid cycle. ISD11 is a component of the NFS1-ISD11-ACP complex, where it stabilizes the cysteine desulfurase NFS1, facilitating the early steps of Fe-S cluster assembly. This protein is crucial for the maturation of Fe-S proteins across various cellular compartments, including the mitochondria, cytosol, and nucleus (Braymer2017Iron–sulfur; Lim2013Mutations). Additionally, ISD11 interacts with other proteins such as frataxin and the acyl carrier protein, underscoring its role in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Cory2017Structure; Angerer2015Eukaryotic). The gene's clinical significance is highlighted by its association with mitochondrial disorders and its potential role in cancer pathogenesis (Pang2021Ironsulphur; Alfadhel2017Mitochondrial).

## Function
The LYRM4 gene encodes the ISD11 protein, which plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs) within mitochondria. ISD11 is part of the NFS1-ISD11-ACP complex, which is essential for the generation of persulfides on the active-site cysteine of NFS1, a key step in ISC synthesis (Braymer2017Iron–sulfur). These clusters are vital cofactors for various mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, the citric acid cycle, and other cellular processes (Lim2013Mutations).

ISD11 stabilizes the sulfur donor NFS1, facilitating the early steps of ISC assembly, which is necessary for the maturation of iron-sulfur proteins across different cellular compartments, including mitochondria, cytosol, and nucleus (Lim2013Mutations). The protein is also involved in the transfer of ISCs to target proteins through interactions with ISCU and other components (Angerer2015Eukaryotic).

In healthy human cells, ISD11 ensures the proper function of multiple respiratory chain complexes (OXPHOS complexes I, II, and III) by maintaining the assembly and stability of ISCs, which are crucial for energy production and cellular respiration (Lim2013Mutations). The protein's activity is linked to mitochondrial functions, including lipoic acid synthesis and cellular iron homeostasis (Pang2021Ironsulphur).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the LYRM4 gene, also known as ISD11, have significant clinical implications. Mutations in LYRM4 can lead to combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 19, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early-onset symptoms such as hypotonia, respiratory distress, and metabolic acidosis. This condition is associated with a homozygous missense mutation (c.203G>T, p.Arg68Leu) in LYRM4, which results in deficiencies in multiple respiratory chain complexes (OXPHOS complexes I, II, and III) and affects iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis (Lim2013Mutations; Alfadhel2017Mitochondrial).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), high expression of LYRM4 is linked to poor prognosis and is associated with cellular metabolic reprogramming and lipid metabolism disorders. LYRM4 overexpression may promote metastasis by regulating transcription factors and interacting with miRNAs, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in LIHC (Pang2021Ironsulphur). The gene's expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration, which impacts survival rates in LIHC patients (Pang2021Ironsulphur). These findings underscore the importance of LYRM4 in both mitochondrial disorders and cancer, highlighting its role in disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targeting.

## Interactions
LYRM4, also known as ISD11, is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters. It forms a stable complex with NFS1, a cysteine desulfurase, which is essential for the early steps of Fe-S cluster assembly. This interaction stabilizes NFS1 and facilitates the transfer of sulfur to the scaffold protein ISCU, which is necessary for the maturation of Fe-S proteins (Angerer2015Eukaryotic; Lim2013Mutations). 

LYRM4 also interacts with frataxin (FXN) and the acyl carrier protein (ACP), forming a complex that provides iron and sulfur atoms for Fe-S cluster assembly on ISCU (Cory2017Structure; Angerer2015Eukaryotic). The interaction with ACP is particularly significant, as it is involved in the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis pathway and stabilizes the Fe-S assembly complex (Majmudar20194′Phosphopantetheine; Cory2017Structure).

In addition to its role in Fe-S cluster biogenesis, LYRM4 is implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, interacting with various proteins involved in these processes (Pang2021Ironsulphur). These interactions highlight LYRM4's integral role in maintaining mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis.
