# PAAF1

## Overview
PAAF1, or proteasomal ATPase associated factor 1, is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in the modulation of proteasome activity. The PAAF1 protein is characterized by its seven WD repeat motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, forming a β-propeller structure crucial for its function. As a negative regulator of the proteasome, PAAF1 interacts with the 19S regulatory complex, influencing the assembly and activity of the 26S proteasome. This protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with notable expression in the kidney, brain, and testis, suggesting diverse physiological roles. PAAF1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and protein homeostasis, by protecting transcription factors like Spt6 from degradation. Its interactions extend to clinical contexts, where it is involved in the pathogenesis of diseases such as Parkinson's disease and cancer, as well as in the regulation of HIV-1 transcription (Park2005Proteasomal; Nakamura2012Spt6; Galka2024Inhibition).

## Structure
The PAAF1 protein is composed of 392 amino acids and features seven WD repeats, which are structural motifs known for facilitating protein-protein interactions (Park2005Proteasomal). These WD repeats form a series of four-stranded antiparallel β-sheets, which fold into a β-propeller structure, a common tertiary structure that allows for versatile interaction capabilities (Park2005Proteasomal). The β-propeller structure is crucial for the protein's function in interacting with the 19S regulatory complex of the proteasome, although PAAF1 does not associate with the 26S proteasome (Park2005Proteasomal).

PAAF1 is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues, with higher expression levels observed in the kidney, brain, and testis, suggesting potential tissue-specific roles or regulatory mechanisms (Park2005Proteasomal). The protein's interaction with proteasomal ATPases, particularly SUG1, is essential for its function as a negative regulator of proteasome activity, as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit the assembly of the 26S proteasome (Park2005Proteasomal). The study of PAAF1's interactions and regulatory mechanisms has been conducted using various techniques, including affinity purification, mass spectrometry, and coimmunoprecipitation (Park2005Proteasomal).

## Function
PAAF1 (proteasomal ATPase associated factor 1) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the proteasome, a complex responsible for degrading ubiquitinated proteins. In healthy human cells, PAAF1 functions as a modulator of proteasome activity, particularly influencing the assembly and function of the 26S proteasome. It acts as a chaperone for the 19S regulatory particle (RP), which is essential for the formation of the 26S proteasome complex (Tanaka2013The; Wang2020Exploring).

PAAF1 is involved in maintaining protein homeostasis by protecting certain transcription factors, such as Spt6, from proteasomal degradation. This protection is crucial for proper nucleosome reassembly and transcriptional elongation, particularly at the HIV-1 promoter (Nakamura2012Spt6). PAAF1's interaction with Spt6 and its localization to sites of active transcription suggest its role in stabilizing chromatin structure and suppressing cryptic transcription (Nakamura2012Spt6).

PAAF1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences processes such as cell cycle regulation and stress responses. Its role in modulating proteasome activity and stabilizing transcription factors highlights its importance in cellular homeostasis and transcriptional control (Ponnappan2007Lower; Wang2020Exploring).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or interaction of the PAAF1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Parkinson's disease, PAAF1, also known as Rpn14, interacts with α-synuclein, particularly when phosphorylated at S129, leading to the inhibition of 26S proteasome activity. This interaction disrupts cellular proteostasis and contributes to the accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates, exacerbating proteasome dysfunction and potentially advancing the pathology of Parkinson's disease (Galka2024Inhibition).

In cancer, PAAF1 is involved in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with the transcription factor Spt6. Knockdown of PAAF1 affects the transcription of genes involved in cell growth and proliferation, which are often deregulated in cancer. This suggests that PAAF1 may play a role in cancer progression by modulating the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors (Nakamura2012Spt6).

PAAF1 also plays a role in HIV-1 transcription regulation. It interacts with the HIV-1 Tat protein, enhancing Tat-mediated transcription by forming a 19S-like complex that inhibits proteasome activity. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of the 19S subcomplex to the HIV-1 promoter, affecting viral transcription (Lassot2007The).

## Interactions
PAAF1 (proteasomal ATPase-associated factor 1) is known to interact with components of the proteasome complex, particularly the 19S regulatory complex. It specifically binds to proteasomal ATPases, including SUG1, a component of the ATPase ring, but does not interact with unrelated proteins such as RuvB2. This interaction is crucial for PAAF1's role in inhibiting the stable association between the 19S regulatory complex and the 20S core, thereby affecting the assembly of the 26S proteasome (Park2005Proteasomal).

PAAF1 also interacts with Spt6, a transcription factor, protecting it from proteasomal degradation. This interaction is specific to the N-terminal region of Spt6 and is essential for maintaining proper histone occupancy at the HIV-1 promoter, thus preventing the synthesis of aberrant transcripts. The presence of PAAF1 modulates Spt6 levels in a proteasome-dependent manner, highlighting its role in transcriptional regulation (Nakamura2012Spt6).

Additionally, PAAF1, also known as Rpn14, mediates the inhibition of 26S proteasome activity by α-synuclein. This interaction affects proteasome assembly and activity, as Rpn14 is necessary for α-synuclein-induced proteasome inhibition (Galka2024Inhibition).
