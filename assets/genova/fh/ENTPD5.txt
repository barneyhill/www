# ENTPD5

## Overview
ENTPD5 is a gene that encodes the protein ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 5 (inactive), which is a member of the NTPDase enzyme family. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a crucial role in nucleotide metabolism by catalyzing the hydrolysis of UDP and GDP to UMP and GMP, respectively. This enzymatic activity is vital for the proper folding of glycoproteins within the ER, as it supports the import of UDP-glucose, a necessary substrate for glycosylation processes (Durst2019Identifying). ENTPD5 is also implicated in cellular processes such as N-glycosylation and cell proliferation, and it is associated with the Warburg effect, a metabolic shift observed in cancer cells (MacCARTHY2013The). The protein's interactions with other ER chaperones and its involvement in the calnexin/calreticulin cycle underscore its importance in maintaining protein homeostasis and its potential role in cancer progression (Shen2011ENTPD5; Pavlakis2023Mutant).

## Function
ENTPD5 is an enzyme that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is part of the NTPDase enzyme family. It specifically catalyzes the removal of the terminal phosphate of UDP and GDP to form UMP and GMP, respectively. This activity is crucial for the proper folding of glycoproteins within the ER, as it facilitates the import of UDP-glucose into the ER by providing UMP as a counter molecule for the ER UDP-glucose antiporter (Durst2019Identifying). This process is essential for glycoprotein folding, which is a critical function in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Durst2019Identifying).

In healthy cells, ENTPD5 is associated with processes such as N-glycosylation and cell proliferation. It is also linked to the Warburg effect, a metabolic alteration where cells rely on glycolysis for ATP production even in the presence of oxygen (MacCARTHY2013The). Although the normal function of ENTPD5 in healthy cells is not entirely clear, it is suggested to play roles in cell proliferation and metabolism (MacCARTHY2013The). ENTPD5's activity in hydrolyzing UDP suggests a role in nucleotide metabolism (Durst2019Identifying).

## Clinical Significance
ENTPD5 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in promoting tumor growth and survival. In prostate cancer, ENTPD5 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with AKT activation, a common feature in cancers with PTEN mutations. This suggests ENTPD5's involvement in cancer cell proliferation and the Warburg effect, making it a potential therapeutic target (Fang2010The). In lung cancer, ENTPD5 knockdown leads to decreased cell growth, increased apoptosis, and reduced invasion, indicating its role in cancer progression and potential as a prognostic marker (Xue2015ENTPD5).

ENTPD5 is also associated with resistance to chemotherapy in prostate cancer, where its interaction with protein kinase Cα stabilizes the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, contributing to cisplatin resistance (Villar2008PCPHENTPD5). In serous ovarian cancer, ENTPD5 overexpression correlates with tumor malignancy and metastasis, and its knockdown reduces tumor growth and metastasis by modulating the GRP78/p-eIF-2α/CHOP pathway (Chen2022Knockdown). These findings highlight ENTPD5's clinical significance in cancer progression and treatment.

## Interactions
ENTPD5, an endoplasmic reticulum UDPase, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in cellular processes. It forms a complex with UMP/CMP kinase-1 (CMPK1) and adenylate kinase 1 (AK1) to facilitate ATP hydrolysis in the presence of UMP, which is essential for the ATP-to-AMP conversion cycle (Fang2010The). ENTPD5 also interacts with the calnexin/calreticulin (CANX/CALR) cycle, a quality control mechanism in the endoplasmic reticulum that ensures proper folding of N-glycoproteins. This interaction is significant for the expression and function of integrins such as ITGA5 and ITGB1, which are involved in cell adhesion and migration (Pavlakis2023Mutant).

ENTPD5's role in the calnexin/calreticulin cycle involves the termination of the chaperone cycle by cleaving UDP to UMP, facilitating the exchange for new UDP-glucose molecules, thus enhancing the folding capacity of N-glycoproteins (Pavlakis2023Mutant). The protein also interacts with ER chaperones like calreticulin (CRT), calnexin (CNX), and BiP, which are involved in the proper folding and glycosylation of growth factor receptors such as EGFR and HER-2 (Shen2011ENTPD5). These interactions highlight ENTPD5's critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis and supporting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis.
