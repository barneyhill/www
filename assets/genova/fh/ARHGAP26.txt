# ARHGAP26

## Overview
ARHGAP26 is a gene that encodes the Rho GTPase activating protein 26, a member of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family. This protein plays a critical role in the regulation of Rho GTPases, specifically targeting Cdc42 and RhoA, which are pivotal in controlling various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, polarity, and movement. The ARHGAP26 protein is characterized by several functional domains, including the GAP domain, which facilitates GTP hydrolysis, and the SH3 domain, which mediates interactions with other proteins. Additionally, the BAR and PH domains are involved in membrane dynamics and endocytosis. ARHGAP26 is involved in the negative regulation of the RhoA-associated kinase (ROCK) pathway, influencing tissue remodeling and cellular architecture. Its dysregulation is associated with various cancers, including myeloid malignancies and diffuse gastric cancer, where it can form fusion proteins that alter normal cellular signaling pathways (Li2018Hypoxia‐induced; Zhang2021The; Zhang2024Recurrent).

## Function
ARHGAP26 is a GTPase-activating protein that specifically targets the Rho GTPases Cdc42 and RhoA, converting them from their active GTP-bound forms to inactive GDP-bound forms. This inactivation regulates downstream signaling pathways, which are crucial for maintaining normal cellular behavior and preventing tumorigenesis (Zhang2021The). The ARHGAP26 protein contains several domains, including the GAP domain, which enhances GTPase hydrolysis, and the SH3 domain, which interacts with regulatory molecules to modulate GAP activity. The BAR and PH domains are involved in endocytosis by inducing membrane curvature (Zhang2021The).

In healthy cells, ARHGAP26 plays a role in various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, polarity, morphology, movement, vesicle trafficking, cell cycle, division, and differentiation (Zhang2021The). It acts as a negative regulator of the RhoA-associated kinase (ROCK) pathway, which is significant for the structural remodeling of tissues, such as the ductus arteriosus, necessary for its permanent closure after birth (Li2018Hypoxia‐induced). ARHGAP26 is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cell shape, motility, and division by maintaining cellular architecture and signaling pathways (Li2018Hypoxia‐induced).

## Clinical Significance
The ARHGAP26 gene is implicated in various cancers due to mutations, altered expression levels, and abnormal interactions. In myeloid malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), ARHGAP26 expression is significantly reduced, with decreased expression linked to CML progression. This reduction is often due to methylation of the ARHGAP26 promoter. The MLL/ARHGAP26 fusion is a chromosomal abnormality found in infants with AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (Zhang2021The).

In diffuse gastric cancer, the CLDN18-ARHGAP26 fusion gene disrupts epithelial integrity and promotes RHOA activation, leading to increased tumor cell invasion and migration. This fusion is associated with poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance, particularly in signet-ring cell carcinoma (Yao2015Recurrent; Zhang2024Recurrent).

In ovarian cancer, reduced ARHGAP26 expression correlates with poor prognosis, while its upregulation decreases cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The regulation of ARHGAP26 by SMURF1 through the ubiquitination pathway is believed to promote ovarian cancer cell invasion via the β-catenin pathway (Zhang2021The).

In prostate cancer, the transcription factor SP1, which upregulates ARHGAP26, is significantly increased, although its impact on the cancer phenotype is not fully explored (Zhang2021The).

## Interactions
ARHGAP26, also known as Rho GTPase activating protein 26, participates in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It is known to bind directly to PTK2, also known as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is a key player in focal adhesion turnover and cytoskeletal dynamics (Okada2011SH3). The SH3 domain of ARHGAP26 facilitates its interaction with PTK2, as well as with other proteins such as MICAL1, ANKS1A, PKN3, and RAB11FIP5, through binding to proline-rich sequences containing a PXXP motif (Okada2011SH3).

ARHGAP26 also interacts with MICAL1, an actin filament disassembly factor, suggesting a role in axonal pathfinding and cytoskeletal reorganization (Okada2011SH3). The interaction with MICAL1 was validated using co-immunoprecipitation assays, confirming the specificity of this binding (Okada2011SH3).

In the context of cancer, the CLDN18-ARHGAP26 fusion protein retains the ability to regulate the RhoA pathway and integrin signaling, although it lacks certain domains affecting endocytosis (Zhang2021The). This fusion protein is implicated in the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and YAP-TEAD signaling pathways, contributing to tumor growth and progression in diffuse gastric cancer (Zhang2024Recurrent).
