# FBXW2

## Overview
FBXW2 is a gene that encodes the protein F-box and WD repeat domain containing 2, which is a member of the F-box protein family. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a critical component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. The primary role of FBXW2 is to regulate protein degradation pathways, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis by controlling the levels of proteins involved in cell cycle progression and signal transduction. The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it targets specific proteins such as SKP2 and β-catenin for ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation. This activity is crucial for preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation and regulating key signaling pathways, such as the Wnt signaling pathway. FBXW2's function as a tumor suppressor and its involvement in various cellular processes underscore its significance in both normal physiology and disease states, including cancer and metabolic disorders (Zhou2022FBXW2; Xu2017The; Yang2019FBXW2).

## Function
FBXW2 is a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the regulation of protein degradation pathways in healthy human cells. It is part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which tags specific proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating the levels of proteins involved in cell cycle progression and signal transduction (Zhou2022FBXW2; Xu2017The).

In healthy cells, FBXW2 targets proteins such as SKP2 and β-catenin for ubiquitylation and degradation. By promoting the degradation of SKP2, FBXW2 helps maintain low levels of this protein, which is crucial for keeping the levels of tumor suppressors like p21 and p27 high, thereby preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Xu2017The). FBXW2 also regulates β-catenin levels, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, by promoting its ubiquitylation and degradation. This regulation is important for controlling β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity, which impacts cell proliferation and migration (Yang2019FBXW2).

FBXW2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with its target proteins, facilitating their degradation and ensuring proper cell signaling and function (Yang2019FBXW2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FBXW2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and metabolic diseases. In lung cancer, FBXW2 functions as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation is associated with poor patient survival. Mutations such as S84C and E269K in FBXW2 can lead to a loss of tumor suppressor function, affecting the degradation of oncogenic proteins like SKP2, which promotes tumorigenesis (Xu2017The). High levels of FBXW2 correlate with better survival outcomes, while high levels of β-TrCP1 and SKP2 are linked to poorer survival, suggesting a potential therapeutic target in lung cancer (Xu2017The).

In prostate cancer, FBXW2 is also identified as a tumor suppressor, inhibiting cancer proliferation and metastasis by promoting the degradation of EGFR, an oncogenic protein. Downregulation of FBXW2 in prostate cancer is associated with increased tumor growth and metastasis (Zhou2022FBXW2).

FBXW2 is implicated in metabolic diseases such as obesity and atherosclerosis. It is involved in inflammatory responses in macrophages, and its deficiency can improve conditions like insulin resistance and reduce inflammation in these diseases. Targeting FBXW2 pathways may offer therapeutic potential for treating metabolic disorders (Wang2020E3).

## Interactions
FBXW2, a member of the F-box protein family, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in its function as a tumor suppressor. It interacts with β-catenin, a known oncogenic protein, promoting its ubiquitylation and degradation. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser 552 and is specific to FBXW2, as it does not occur with other F-box proteins like FBXW7 or SKP2 (Yang2019FBXW2).

FBXW2 also interacts with SKP2, a substrate of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complex, facilitating its degradation. The binding between FBXW2 and SKP2 is mediated by the C-terminal WD40 domain of FBXW2 and the N-terminal domain of SKP2, with a specific motif (TSXXXS) being crucial for this interaction (Xu2017The).

In addition, FBXW2 is a substrate of b-TrCP1, which binds to FBXW2 and promotes its degradation through a phosphor-dependent mechanism. This interaction is crucial for regulating FBXW2 levels and function (Xu2017The).

FBXW2 also interacts with the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), promoting its ubiquitylation and degradation, which is significant in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Zhou2021FBXW2; Zhou2022FBXW2).
