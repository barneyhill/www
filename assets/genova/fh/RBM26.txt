# RBM26

## Overview
RBM26 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 26, which is a crucial component in RNA metabolism. This protein is categorized as an RNA-binding protein and plays a significant role in the PAXT-mediated nuclear RNA decay pathway, essential for the turnover of polyadenylated RNA in mammalian nuclei (Silla2020The). The RBM26 protein interacts with various components of the PAXT complex, such as ZC3H3, MTR4, and PABPN1, and is involved in the assembly with the RNA exosome, highlighting its role as a nuclear exosome co-factor (Silla2020The). Beyond its involvement in RNA decay, RBM26 is implicated in regulating mitochondrial function and axon integrity, with mutations in the gene linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism (Chowdhury2023Autism). The protein's abundance in HeLa cells and its interactions with RNA suggest it may also function independently of the PAXT complex, influencing mRNA maturation and gene expression (Silla2020The).

## Function
RBM26 is a protein involved in the PAXT-mediated nuclear RNA decay pathway, which is crucial for the turnover of polyadenylated RNA in mammalian nuclei. It functions as part of the PAXT complex, interacting with components such as ZC3H3, MTR4, and PABPN1, and is involved in the assembly with the RNA exosome (Silla2020The). RBM26, along with its paralog RBM27, plays a role in regulating PAXT-sensitive transcripts, which are involved in nuclear RNA decay. The depletion of RBM26 and RBM27 leads to the upregulation of certain long non-coding RNAs, indicating their role as nuclear exosome co-factors (Silla2020The).

RBM26 is more abundant than ZFC3H1 in HeLa cells, suggesting that it may engage with RNAs independently of its PAXT linkage (Silla2020The). The protein is active in the nucleus, contributing to cellular processes like mRNA maturation and regulation of gene expression. It contains RNA-binding domains that facilitate interactions with RNA, influencing gene expression and playing a role in splicing, stability, and transport of RNA molecules (Silla2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RBM26 gene have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism. The gene is considered an autism candidate due to its role in regulating mitochondrial function and axon integrity during neurodevelopment. Mutations in RBM26, such as missense variants, can lead to decreased protein expression and defects in axon overlap and degeneration, which are associated with conditions like autism and intellectual disabilities (Chowdhury2023Autism).

RBM26 mutations can cause mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by reduced mitochondrial density and increased oxidative activity, contributing to axon degeneration. This dysfunction is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting that RBM26 is crucial for maintaining normal mitochondrial function in neurons (Chowdhury2023Autism).

The RBM26 gene also plays a role in the PAXT-mediated nuclear RNA decay pathway, which is essential for RNA stability and turnover. Disruptions in this pathway, due to RBM26 mutations or altered interactions, can lead to the accumulation of certain RNA substrates, potentially impacting cellular function and contributing to disease pathogenesis (Silla2020The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RBM26 in maintaining neuronal health and its potential link to neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
RBM26 is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA metabolism. It interacts with components of the PAXT complex, including ZC3H3, MTR4, and PABPN1, which are crucial for PAXT-mediated nuclear RNA decay. These interactions suggest that RBM26 is part of a higher-order assembly that mediates RNA decay, rather than just interacting with the MTR4-ZFC3H1 dimer (Silla2020The). Glycerol sedimentation analysis has shown that RBM26, along with its paralog RBM27 and ZC3H3, sediments in high molecular weight fractions, indicating their assembly with the RNA exosome (Silla2020The).

RBM26 is also involved in the turnover of polyadenylated (pA+) RNA in mammalian nuclei, where it is more abundant than other PAXT components like ZFC3H1 in HeLa cells, highlighting its significant role in RNA interactions (Silla2020The). The protein's interactions are not limited to the PAXT complex; it also binds to mals-1 mRNA, negatively regulating its expression, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and preventing axon degeneration during neurodevelopment (Chowdhury2023Autism). These interactions underscore RBM26's multifaceted role in RNA processing and regulation.
