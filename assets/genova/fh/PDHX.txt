# PDHX

## Overview
The PDHX gene encodes the E3-binding protein (E3BP), a non-catalytic but essential structural component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc), which plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism. The PDHc is responsible for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, a critical step linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle within the mitochondria. E3BP, encoded by PDHX, is integral to the structural assembly and stability of the PDHc, facilitating the anchoring of the E3 component to the E2 core subunits. This interaction is crucial for the proper enzymatic function and metabolic efficiency of the complex. Mutations in the PDHX gene can lead to significant metabolic disorders, including pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency and Leigh's disease, underscoring its clinical significance (MINE2006A; Schiff2006Leigh’s; Ivanov2014Founder).

## Structure
The PDHX gene encodes the E3-binding protein (E3BP) subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc), which is essential for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in mitochondria. The E3BP protein shares structural homology with the E2 subunit and includes several distinct domains: a lipoyl domain, a subunit-binding domain, and an inner-core domain. The lipoyl domain is involved in the binding of lipoic acid, which is crucial for the enzymatic activity of the complex. The subunit-binding domain anchors the E3 component to the E2 core subunits, facilitating the structural integrity of the PDHc. The inner-core domain, while lacking catalytic activity, plays a significant role in maintaining the structural framework of the complex (MINE2006A; Schiff2006Leigh’s).

The PDHX protein does not have catalytic activity but is vital for the structural assembly of the PDHc, integrating into the E2 core and binding E3 to E2, which is crucial for the transfer of acetyl groups. The protein's quaternary structure is integral to the function of the PDHc, ensuring proper enzymatic interactions and stability (Schiff2006Leigh’s).

## Function
The PDHX gene encodes the E3 binding protein (E3BP), a crucial structural component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) in human cells. This complex is essential for cellular energy production, as it catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, a key step linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle (Eastlack2018Suppression; Miné2007A). The PDHc is composed of three catalytic subunits (E1, E2, and E3), two regulatory subunits (E1 kinase and E1 phosphatase), and the E3BP, which is encoded by PDHX. Although E3BP does not have catalytic activity, it is vital for the assembly and stability of the PDHc, ensuring efficient metabolic function (Miné2007A).

In healthy human cells, the PDHc facilitates the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, producing acetyl-CoA that enters the citric acid cycle for further energy production. This process occurs in the mitochondria and is fundamental for maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Eastlack2018Suppression). The proper function of the PDHc, supported by PDHX, is critical for normal cellular metabolism, and its deficiency can lead to significant metabolic disruptions (Eastlack2018Suppression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PDHX gene, which encodes the E3-binding protein (E3BP) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc), are associated with several metabolic disorders. These mutations can lead to pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, a condition characterized by lactic acidosis, neurological dysfunction, and developmental delays. One notable mutation, p.Arg446*, is prevalent among Roma children and accounts for over half of congenital lactic acidosis cases in this population. This mutation results in severe neurological symptoms, including spasticity, intellectual deficits, and epileptic seizures (Ivanov2014Founder).

Another case involves a large deletion in the PDHX gene, leading to Leigh's disease, a severe neurological disorder. This mutation causes encephalopathy, psychomotor retardation, and spastic paraparesis, with biochemical analysis revealing PDHc deficiency (Schiff2006Leigh’s). Additionally, a novel gross deletion affecting exon 10 of the PDHX gene has been linked to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, resulting in lactic acidosis and various neurological disorders (MINE2006A).

These genetic alterations in PDHX disrupt the normal function of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, impairing energy metabolism and leading to the clinical manifestations observed in affected individuals.

## Interactions
The PDHX gene encodes the E3-binding protein (E3BP), a crucial component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). E3BP plays a structural role by anchoring the E3 component to the E2 core of the PDC, facilitating the complex's overall function in cellular respiration (MINE2006A). Although E3BP itself lacks catalytic activity, its presence is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the PDC, which is vital for the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA (PavluPereira2020Pyruvate).

PDHX is also involved in interactions with regulatory proteins that modulate PDC activity. For instance, microRNA-27b (miR-27b) targets PDHX, leading to its suppression and resulting in altered cell metabolism. This interaction is particularly significant in the context of cancer, where miR-27b-mediated suppression of PDHX contributes to a shift towards glycolytic metabolism, promoting cancer cell proliferation (Eastlack2018Suppression). Similarly, miR-26a targets PDHX, affecting glucose metabolism and energy production, as observed in both cancer cells and boar sperm (Chen2014MicroRNA26a; Wang2020miR26a). These interactions highlight the regulatory role of PDHX in cellular metabolism and its potential implications in disease contexts.
