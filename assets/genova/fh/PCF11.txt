# PCF11

## Overview
PCF11 is a gene that encodes the PCF11 cleavage and polyadenylation factor subunit, a protein integral to the process of mRNA 3'-end processing and transcription termination in eukaryotic cells. The PCF11 protein is a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, which is essential for the proper termination of RNA polymerase II transcription and subsequent mRNA processing. It plays a pivotal role in regulating alternative polyadenylation (APA) and polyadenylation site (PAS) usage, thereby influencing gene expression patterns (KamieniarzGdula2018Selective; West2007Human). The protein's structure includes a unique zinc-finger domain and a Clp1-binding domain, which are crucial for its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids involved in mRNA processing (Yang2016The; Noble2006Structure). PCF11's function and interactions are tightly regulated, and its expression levels have significant implications in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ogorodnikov2018PCF11; Chen2023RNA).

## Structure
The PCF11 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains essential for its function in mRNA processing. The C-terminal region of PCF11 contains a novel zinc-finger domain, which is crucial for mRNA 3'-end processing. This domain features a unique CCHC zinc finger fold, resembling a trillium flower, and is stabilized by zinc ion coordination involving specific cysteine and histidine residues (Yang2016The). The zinc-finger domain is essential for cell viability, as mutations in this region disrupt 3'-end processing and cause growth defects (Yang2016The).

The protein also includes a Clp1-binding domain, which consists of a region of approximately 25 amino acids located between two zinc-finger motifs. This domain forms a significant part of the Clp1-binding interface, involving both polar and apolar interactions (Noble2006Structure). The interaction with Clp1 is stabilized by conserved residues, such as R480, W482, and W489, which are crucial for the stability of the complex (Noble2006Structure).

PCF11's structure is further defined by its interaction with other components of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor I (CFIA) complex, linking the cleavage-polyadenylation machinery to the transcriptional elongation complex (Noble2006Structure).

## Function
PCF11 is a crucial component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, playing a significant role in transcription termination and mRNA processing in human cells. It is involved in the termination of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription by promoting the dissociation of Pol II elongation complexes from DNA, a process essential for proper gene expression (West2007Human). PCF11 enhances the degradation of nascent RNA associated with Pol II, facilitating efficient transcriptional termination and RNA processing (West2007Human).

PCF11 also influences polyadenylation site (PAS) usage, favoring proximal PAS usage and affecting alternative polyadenylation (APA) patterns. Its depletion leads to a shift towards distal PAS usage, particularly in protein-coding genes, indicating its role in regulating gene expression through APA (KamieniarzGdula2018Selective). PCF11 is involved in intronic polyadenylation (IPA), impacting mRNA expression of long genes and maintaining CPA activity homeostasis (Wang2019Regulation).

In the nucleus, PCF11 interacts with exonucleases like Xrn2 to degrade the 3' products of pre-mRNA cleavage, ensuring proper RNA processing and transcriptional termination (West2007Human). Its activity is tightly regulated through autoregulation mechanisms involving premature termination and APA (KamieniarzGdula2018Selective).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PCF11 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In neuroblastoma, a common pediatric cancer, PCF11 is a critical regulator of alternative polyadenylation (APA), influencing neurodifferentiation and tumor progression. High PCF11 expression is associated with poor prognosis and a lower likelihood of spontaneous tumor regression, as it maintains cells in an undifferentiated state. Conversely, low PCF11 levels are linked to favorable outcomes and spontaneous tumor regression, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in neuroblastoma (Ogorodnikov2018PCF11; Ogorodnikov2018Transcriptome).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), PCF11 expression is down-regulated, correlating with advanced clinical stages and tumor progression. This suggests that PCF11 may function as a tumor suppressor in OSCC, with its low expression linked to the activation of pathways related to tumor metabolism and proliferation (Chen2023RNA).

PCF11 also plays a role in the regulation of long genes, which are often involved in cell morphology, adhesion, and migration. Its overexpression can lead to significant alterations in gene expression patterns, potentially impacting cancer development and metastasis (Wang2019Regulation).

## Interactions
PCF11 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in transcription termination and mRNA processing. It binds to the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, and this interaction is modulated by phosphorylation. Specifically, the WNK1 kinase phosphorylates PCF11 at residues S120 and T121, which weakens its interaction with the Pol II CTD, facilitating mRNA export by promoting the release of mRNP from transcription sites (Volanakis2017WNK1).

PCF11 also interacts with the mRNA export factor Yra1, a relationship that is conserved in humans with the homologs Aly and Pcf11. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of Yra1 to actively transcribed genes, linking mRNA export with 3' end processing (Johnson2009Cotranscriptional).

Additionally, PCF11 is part of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) complex, interacting with subunits such as Clp1, Ysh1, and Ydh1. These interactions are essential for mRNA 3′-end processing, with specific mutations in PCF11 affecting its binding to these proteins and impacting mRNA processing (Yang2016The; Noble2006Structure). The interaction between PCF11 and Clp1 involves a conserved segment of PCF11, which forms extensive hydrogen bonds with Clp1, highlighting its importance in the stability of the complex (Noble2006Structure).
