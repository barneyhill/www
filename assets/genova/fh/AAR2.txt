# AAR2

## Overview
AAR2 is a gene that encodes the AAR2 splicing factor, a protein integral to the assembly and function of the spliceosome, specifically the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex. The AAR2 protein is categorized as a splicing factor and is involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process for mRNA maturation and gene expression. It interacts with the RNase H-like domain of PRPF8, a core component of the spliceosome, to maintain the appropriate conformational state necessary for the splicing process. This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation, highlighting the role of post-translational modifications in spliceosomal dynamics. The structural and functional characteristics of AAR2 underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and gene expression regulation (Preussner2022Structural; Malinová2017Assembly; Jehle2022A).

## Structure
The human AAR2 splicing factor protein is characterized by distinct structural domains. It features an N-terminal domain (NTD) primarily composed of β-strands and a C-terminal domain (CTD) with α-helices. The CTD also includes an irregularly structured tail (Preussner2022Structural). The protein interfaces between human AAR2 and the RNase H-like domain of PRPF8 involve two main interfaces. Interface I is dominated by hydrophobic interactions, while Interface II involves the C-terminal residues of AAR2 extending across the PRPF8 RH domain (Preussner2022Structural).

The AAR2 protein's interaction with PRPF8 RH is structurally different from its yeast counterpart, with the human AAR2 loop contacting the PRPF8 RH domain at a different angle. This interaction is crucial for the formation of a stable complex, as specific residues such as Trp1839 of PRPF8 RH and Met230 of AAR2 are essential for complex formation (Preussner2022Structural). The C-terminal tail of human AAR2 is necessary for stable binding to PRPF8 RH, unlike in yeast where it is dispensable (Preussner2022Structural). The structural differences between human and yeast AAR2 suggest a distinct mode of action in U5 snRNP or U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP assembly in humans (Preussner2022Structural).

## Function
The human AAR2 protein is a splicing factor involved in the assembly of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), a critical component of the spliceosome complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing. AAR2 interacts with the RNase H-like domain of PRPF8, a core spliceosomal protein, and plays a role in regulating the conformational state of PRPF8 during splicing. This interaction is crucial for maintaining PRPF8 in a conformation compatible with the first step of splicing, thereby preventing a premature switch to the second step conformation (Preussner2022Structural).

In human cells, AAR2 forms a complex with PRPF8 and other proteins such as EFTUD2 and SNRNP200, indicating its involvement in the early stages of U5 snRNP assembly. This process is regulated by phosphorylation, which can disrupt the interaction between AAR2 and PRPF8, highlighting the importance of post-translational modifications in spliceosomal assembly (Malinová2017Assembly; Jehle2022A).

AAR2 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the precise assembly and function of the spliceosome, ensuring accurate mRNA maturation. This activity is essential for proper gene expression and cellular homeostasis (Malinová2017Assembly).

## Interactions
The human AAR2 protein is involved in the assembly of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, a critical component of the spliceosome. AAR2 interacts with the PRPF8 protein, specifically binding to its RNase H-like (RH) domain. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of U5 snRNP assembly, as AAR2 locks PRPF8 in a conformation compatible with the first transesterification step of splicing, thereby blocking a conformational switch necessary for the second step (Preussner2022Structural).

In humans, AAR2 forms a complex with PRPF8 and SNRNP200, a helicase involved in spliceosome function. This interaction is regulated by phosphorylation, with the S284E phospho-mimetic mutation in AAR2 disrupting its binding to PRPF8, indicating a conserved regulatory mechanism (Preussner2022Structural; Jehle2022A). The phosphorylation-dependent interaction switch is mediated by kinases such as SGK2 and CK2a1, which modulate the interaction between AAR2 and PRPF8, potentially facilitating the transition from AAR2 to BRR2 in the spliceosomal assembly complex (Jehle2022A).

AAR2's interaction with PRPF8 is distinct from its yeast counterpart, as the human AAR2-PRPF8 RH complex does not stably bind the PRPF8 JM domain, allowing the formation of a trimeric AAR2-PRPF8-SNRNP200 complex (Preussner2022Structural).
