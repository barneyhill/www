# PPIP5K1

## Overview
PPIP5K1 is a gene that encodes the protein diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinase 1, a multi-domain kinase involved in various cellular processes. The protein plays a crucial role in the production of inositol pyrophosphates, which are important for cellular signaling and energy metabolism (Machkalyan2016PPIP5K1). Structurally, PPIP5K1 features an N-terminal kinase domain, a hybrid domain composed of histidine phosphatase and pleckstrin homology domains, and a C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) that facilitates interactions with other proteins (Machkalyan2016PPIP5K1). These interactions are significant for vesicle trafficking, actin dynamics, and cellular signaling pathways, including those involving the exocyst complex and lipid kinases (Machkalyan2016PPIP5K1). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various physiological and pathological conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chakraborty2017The; Gu2017KO).

## Structure
The PPIP5K1 protein is a multi-domain protein consisting of 1433 amino acids. It features an N-terminal kinase domain responsible for the production of inositol pyrophosphates, which are crucial for various cellular processes (Machkalyan2016PPIP5K1). This kinase domain is modular and shares a high sequence identity with PPIP5K2, suggesting similar structural characteristics, such as a deeply buried nucleotide within the ATP-grasp fold and a substrate-binding pocket with a staggered 'H'-shape (Shears2017The; Shears2013Structural).

The protein also includes a hybrid domain composed of histidine phosphatase and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, which is catalytically inactive but plays a role in membrane targeting (Machkalyan2016PPIP5K1). The C-terminal portion of PPIP5K1 is intrinsically disordered, lacking defined secondary structures, and is longer than that of its paralog PPIP5K2. This region facilitates interactions with multiple proteins, including components of the exocyst complex, and is involved in regulatory and signaling functions (Machkalyan2016PPIP5K1).

The protein's phosphatase-like domain, although not catalytically active, is specialized for binding to phosphoinositides, particularly PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, with high affinity (Gokhale2011Receptordependent). This domain is a novel hybrid structure, incorporating elements of PH domains, and is crucial for the receptor-dependent translocation of PPIP5K1 to the plasma membrane (Gokhale2011Receptordependent).

## Function
PPIP5K1, or diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinase 1, is a multi-domain protein involved in several critical cellular processes. It contains kinase and hybrid PH-phosphatase domains, with a C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) that facilitates interactions with multiple proteins, playing a significant role in regulatory and signaling functions (Machkalyan2016PPIP5K1). PPIP5K1 interacts with the exocyst complex, which is crucial for vesicle-mediated transport and cell motility. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal IDR, which is essential for binding to components of the exocyst complex, such as EXOC1, EXOC3, and EXOC7 (Machkalyan2016PPIP5K1).

The protein is involved in regulating actin dynamics, essential for cell migration, and plays a role in vesicle trafficking, impacting processes like exocytosis and endocytosis (Machkalyan2016PPIP5K1). PPIP5K1 also interacts with lipid kinases, generating PtdIns(4,5)P2, a critical component of cellular membranes involved in various cellular events, including vesicle exocytosis and actin cytoskeleton assembly (Machkalyan2016PPIP5K1). The protein's kinase activity is responsible for producing inositol pyrophosphates, which regulate cellular processes such as vesicle formation and energy metabolism (Machkalyan2016PPIP5K1). These functions suggest that PPIP5K1 plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular organization and signaling in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PPIP5K1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, particularly colon cancer, the knockout of PPIP5K1 in HCT116 cells leads to a hypermetabolic and growth-inhibited phenotype. This is characterized by increased ATP levels and enhanced mitochondrial biomass, suggesting that PPIP5K1 plays a role in regulating cellular energy metabolism and growth, making it a potential target for tumor therapy (Gu2017KO).

PPIP5K1 is also involved in the regulation of the mTORC2 signaling pathway, which is crucial for insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt. Knockdown of PPIP5K1 impairs this signaling, indicating its role in metabolic regulation and potential implications for metabolic disorders (Chakraborty2017The). Additionally, PPIP5K1 modulates the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-signaling cascade, affecting Akt phosphorylation and cell proliferation, which could link its expression alterations to conditions affecting these pathways (Gokhale2013PPIP5K1).

The involvement of PPIP5K1 in these critical signaling pathways suggests that its dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, cancer, and possibly other conditions related to cellular energy and growth regulation.

## Interactions
PPIP5K1 interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is known to interact with the exocyst complex, a crucial component for vesicle tethering to the plasma membrane. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of PPIP5K1, which is conserved in mammalian isoforms. The IDR facilitates interactions with all eight components of the exocyst complex, including EXOC1, EXOC3, and EXOC7, and is essential for regulating cell motility and vesicle trafficking (Machkalyan2016PPIP5K1).

PPIP5K1 also interacts with small GTPases such as Rab and Ral, which regulate the exocyst complex. These interactions are important for actin cytoskeleton organization and vesicle-mediated transport, impacting cell migration and polarity (Machkalyan2016PPIP5K1).

In addition to its role in vesicle trafficking, PPIP5K1 is involved in cellular signaling pathways. It competes with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 for binding to polyphosphoinositide-binding domains, influencing the recruitment of signaling proteins to the plasma membrane. This competition affects the activation of signaling cascades involving proteins like Akt and GRP1, which are crucial for cellular responses to stress and growth signals (Gokhale2013PPIP5K1).
