# PELO

## Overview
The PELO gene encodes the pelota mRNA surveillance and ribosome rescue factor, a protein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its involvement in ribosome recycling and mRNA surveillance. As a highly conserved protein, pelota is integral to the processes of ribosome rescue, particularly in cells with high protein synthesis demands, such as erythroid cells and platelets. It functions by facilitating the recycling of ribosomes and ensuring the fidelity of mRNA translation, thereby preventing the accumulation of defective mRNA and stalled ribosomes. Pelota's interactions with various proteins, including those associated with the actin cytoskeleton, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular organization and function. Additionally, pelota is implicated in critical cellular pathways, such as no-go decay and non-stop decay, which are essential for the degradation of aberrant mRNA, thus maintaining translational quality control (BurnickaTurek2010Pelota; O’Connell2019Mammalian; Mills2016Dynamic).

## Structure
The human PELO gene encodes a protein consisting of 385 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 43 kDa (Shamsadin2000Molecular). The protein includes a conserved nuclear localization signal (PRKRK), located at amino acids 168-172, which suggests a role in nuclear transport (Shamsadin2002Mouse; Shamsadin2000Molecular). The PELO protein is evolutionarily conserved and shares 70% homology with the Drosophila pelota protein, indicating a conserved function across species (Shamsadin2000Molecular).

PELO interacts with several proteins, including HAX1, EIF3G, and SRPX, forming complexes associated with the actin cytoskeleton. These interactions are facilitated by specific domains within the PELO protein, such as the acidic tail domain (residues 271-285) for HAX1 binding and the C-terminal domain (residues 268-370) for EIF3G and SRPX binding (BurnickaTurek2010Pelota). The protein complexes localize to cytoskeletal filaments, suggesting a role in cytoskeletal organization and mRNA surveillance (BurnickaTurek2010Pelota).

The PELO protein is predominantly found in the cytoskeletal and membrane fractions, with a higher proportion in the cytoskeletal fraction, indicating its association with actin microfilaments (BurnickaTurek2010Pelota).

## Function
The PELO gene encodes the pelota protein, which plays a crucial role in ribosome rescue and mRNA surveillance in healthy human cells. Pelota is involved in the recycling of ribosomes, particularly in erythroid cells and platelets, where it compensates for the reduced levels of the canonical ribosome recycling factor ABCE1. This function is essential for maintaining ribosome availability and ensuring efficient protein synthesis, such as hemoglobin production during cell differentiation (Mills2016Dynamic).

Pelota also modulates translation start site choice and protein isoform levels of the transcription factor C/EBPα. It influences the balance between different isoforms by removing unrecycled ribosomes that could block translation initiation, thus promoting the expression of the longer isoform of C/EBPα. This regulation is important for normal hematopoiesis and has implications for cellular differentiation and function (Fernandez2023Ribosome).

In addition, Pelota is involved in mRNA surveillance pathways, such as no-go decay and non-stop decay, which are critical for the degradation of aberrant mRNA and maintaining translational quality control. It works in conjunction with HBS1L to stabilize ribosomal function and ensure proper translation processes (O’Connell2019Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PELO gene, which encodes the pelota protein, have been linked to several clinical conditions. In the context of skin health, the selective deletion of PELO in mouse epidermal cells results in significant skin abnormalities, such as scaly skin, increased trans-epidermal water loss, hair and weight loss, and delayed wound healing. These phenotypes are associated with increased proliferation and abnormal differentiation of epidermal cells, as well as degeneration of sebaceous glands and hair follicles (LiakathAli2018An). 

PELO also plays a critical role in immune responses. It is involved in the activation of NLR family proteins, which are crucial for innate immune responses. Alterations in PELO expression can impair the activation of inflammasomes, such as NLRP3 and NLRC4, leading to reduced inflammatory responses and impaired immune function (Wu2022Ribosomerescuer). 

In the context of viral infections, PELO is implicated in the replication of the dengue virus in Aedes aegypti cells. While the transcript levels of PELO do not significantly change during infection, its protein levels increase, suggesting a role in the translation of viral genomic RNA and/or the assembly and release of virions (Asad2018Suppression).

## Interactions
The PELO protein, also known as pelota mRNA surveillance and ribosome rescue factor, participates in various interactions with other proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. PELO interacts with HAX1, EIF3G, and SRPX, forming complexes associated with the actin cytoskeleton. These interactions were identified using yeast two-hybrid screens and confirmed through GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HeLa cells. The acidic tail domain of PELO is responsible for binding to HAX1, while the C-terminal domain is essential for binding to EIF3G and SRPX (BurnickaTurek2010Pelota).

In the context of immune responses, PELO interacts with NLR family proteins, specifically activating their ATPase activity, which is crucial for the oligomerization and assembly of inflammasome complexes like NLRC4. This interaction is mediated through the NACHT and LRR domains of NLRs, and PELO acts as a catalyzer rather than a structural component of these complexes (Wu2022Ribosomerescuer).

In prostate cancer, PELO interacts with PLK1 and Smad4, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of Smad4, which promotes cancer progression. The interaction between PELO and Smad4 is mediated by the 137-268 amino acid region of PELO (Gao2022PELO).
