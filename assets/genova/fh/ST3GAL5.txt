# ST3GAL5

## Overview
ST3GAL5 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 5, commonly referred to as GM3 synthase. This enzyme is a type II transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of gangliosides, which are glycosphingolipids essential for cellular functions, particularly in the nervous system. GM3 synthase catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid to lactosylceramide, forming GM3 ganglioside, a precursor for more complex gangliosides. The enzyme is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the formation of lipid rafts and modulates cell signaling pathways. Mutations in the ST3GAL5 gene can lead to significant neurological disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal neurological function (Boccuto2013A; Schnaar2016Gangliosides; Sipione2020Gangliosides).

## Structure
The ST3GAL5 gene encodes a type II transmembrane protein known as GM3 synthase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of gangliosides. The protein consists of 418 amino acids and includes several conserved sialyl motifs: the L-motif (large), S-motif (small), and VS-motif (very small), which are characteristic of mammalian sialyltransferases (Inamori2022Ganglioside). The L-motif is responsible for binding the donor nucleotide sugar, while the S-motif participates in binding both the donor and the acceptor (Boccuto2013A). 

ST3GAL5 is a type II integral membrane protein with a short cytoplasmic NH2-terminal tail, a single transmembrane domain, and a large catalytic domain located within the Golgi lumen (Boccuto2013A; Uemura2015The). The protein's structure is further stabilized by N-glycans, which are crucial for its stability and proper localization within the Golgi apparatus (Uemura2015The). 

Mutations in the ST3GAL5 gene, such as the p.E332K missense mutation, can disrupt the protein's sialyltransferase domain, leading to structural instability and loss of function (Boccuto2013A). The protein's intracellular localization predominantly in the Golgi apparatus is consistent across various pathogenic variants (Indellicato2019Total).

## Function
The ST3GAL5 gene encodes the enzyme GM3 synthase, which plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of gangliosides, a class of glycosphingolipids essential for normal cellular functions. In healthy human cells, GM3 synthase catalyzes the addition of sialic acid in an alpha-2,3 linkage to lactosylceramide, forming the GM3 ganglioside. This process occurs primarily in the Golgi apparatus, where the enzyme facilitates the production of GM3, a precursor for more complex gangliosides (Boccuto2013A; Schnaar2016Gangliosides).

Gangliosides, including GM3, are integral components of cell membranes and are involved in cell signaling and communication. They contribute to the formation of lipid rafts, which are specialized membrane domains that modulate signaling pathways. GM3, in particular, is implicated in modulating signaling through multiple receptor pathways, such as EGF, insulin, and VEGF, by forming glycolipid-enriched microdomains that facilitate these interactions (Boccuto2013A).

The presence of GM3 and other gangliosides is crucial for maintaining normal neurological function and cellular homeostasis. Disruptions in their biosynthesis can lead to significant physiological abnormalities, highlighting the importance of ST3GAL5 in cellular and organismal health (Sipione2020Gangliosides; Schnaar2014Sialic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ST3GAL5 gene, which encodes the enzyme GM3 synthase, are linked to several severe neurological disorders. GM3 synthase deficiency, caused by mutations in ST3GAL5, results in a rare congenital disorder of glycosylation (ST3GAL5-CDG). This condition is characterized by severe neurological symptoms, including infantile-onset epilepsy, intellectual disability, blindness, and choreoathetosis (Lee2016GM3; Indellicato2019Total). Patients may also experience failure to thrive, hearing and visual impairments, and respiratory chain dysfunction (Indellicato2019Total).

A specific mutation, pR288*, was first identified in the Old Amish community and is associated with symptoms such as irritability, poor feeding, and developmental delays (Trinchera2018Diseases). Another condition linked to ST3GAL5 mutations is "Salt & Pepper" syndrome, a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, and altered dermal pigmentation (Boccuto2013A).

Research indicates that despite the loss of GM3 synthase activity, the transcription, translation, and stability of the mutated proteins remain similar to the wild type, suggesting additional unknown mechanisms may contribute to the syndrome (Indellicato2019Total). The variability in clinical manifestations highlights the complexity of disorders associated with ST3GAL5 mutations (Trinchera2018Diseases).

## Interactions
ST3GAL5, also known as GM3 synthase, is involved in the biosynthesis of gangliosides and participates in several protein interactions crucial for its function. The enzyme contains an R/K-based motif that interacts with the small GTPase Sar1, which is essential for the formation of COPII-coated vesicles, facilitating ER export. However, this interaction alone may not be sufficient for efficient cargo concentration, suggesting the involvement of other cargo receptors (Uemura2015The). 

Mutations in ST3GAL5 can lead to mislocalization and affect its stability and maturation, indicating that proper interactions are necessary for its function and retention in the Golgi apparatus (Uemura2015The). The enzyme's role in glycosphingolipid synthesis also implies interactions with other glycosyltransferases, such as B4GalNAcT1, which require both the R/K-based motif and homodimer formation for efficient ER export (Uemura2015The).

In the context of disease, ST3GAL5 mutations are linked to altered glycosylation processes, affecting the expression of various glycosyltransferases involved in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, such as B4GALT6, which utilizes LacCer as a substrate (Boccuto2013A). These interactions and modifications are critical for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing disorders like Salt & Pepper syndrome.
