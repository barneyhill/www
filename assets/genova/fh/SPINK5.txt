# SPINK5

## Overview
The SPINK5 gene encodes the serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 5 (LEKTI), a multidomain protein that plays a critical role in skin homeostasis and barrier function. LEKTI is primarily expressed in the epidermis and is composed of multiple Kazal-type serine protease inhibitory domains, which allow it to regulate the activity of serine proteases, particularly those in the kallikrein family. This regulation is essential for maintaining skin barrier integrity and controlling the desquamation process, which involves the shedding of dead skin cells. Mutations in SPINK5 can lead to a deficiency in LEKTI, resulting in unregulated protease activity and contributing to skin disorders such as Netherton syndrome, characterized by skin barrier defects and inflammation (Moltrasio2023Netherton; Chavanas2000Mutations; Komatsu2002Elevated).

## Structure
The SPINK5 gene encodes the serine protease inhibitor LEKTI, which is a multidomain protein primarily expressed in the epidermis. LEKTI consists of 15 Kazal-type serine protease inhibitory domains, which are crucial for its function in inhibiting serine proteases such as skin kallikreins (KLKs) (Wang2022A; Moltrasio2023Netherton). The protein is initially synthesized as a 125 kDa pre-proprotein and undergoes proteolytic processing by furin to generate multiple active inhibitory domains (Komatsu2007Proteolytic; Moltrasio2023Netherton).

These domains are highly homologous and contribute to the protein's ability to regulate proteolytic activity in the skin, maintaining skin barrier integrity and preventing excessive protease activity (Moltrasio2023Netherton; Chavanas2000Mutations). The D6-D9 domains of LEKTI are particularly effective at inhibiting skin kallikreins, which are involved in skin desquamation and inflammation (Wang2022A).

Post-translational modifications of LEKTI may include glycosylation, which can affect its stability and function. The protein's structure allows it to interact with and inhibit multiple proteases, playing a critical role in skin and hair morphogenesis, as well as in the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial protection of mucous epithelia (Moltrasio2023Netherton).

## Function
The SPINK5 gene encodes the serine protease inhibitor LEKTI, which plays a crucial role in maintaining skin homeostasis and barrier function. LEKTI is involved in the regulation of protease activity in the epidermis, particularly in the uppermost layers and hair follicles, where it inhibits serine proteases such as human kallikreins 5 (hK5) and 7 (hK7) (Komatsu2002Elevated; Schechter2005Inhibition). These proteases are involved in the desquamation process by degrading desmosomal proteins, which are essential for cell adhesion. By inhibiting these proteases, LEKTI prevents excessive degradation of desmoglein-1, maintaining normal skin shedding and barrier integrity (Schechter2005Inhibition; Komatsu2002Elevated).

LEKTI is synthesized as a large proprotein with multiple inhibitory domains, which are processed into active fragments that tightly bind and inhibit target proteases. This regulation is pH-dependent, allowing for controlled protease activity in different skin layers (Schechter2005Inhibition). In healthy individuals, SPINK5-derived peptides help maintain the balance of skin cell turnover and protect against excessive proteolytic activity, contributing to the skin's permeability barrier function and antimicrobial defense (Raghunath2004SPINK5; Komatsu2002Elevated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPINK5 gene are primarily associated with Netherton syndrome (NS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by skin abnormalities, hair defects, and atopic manifestations. NS is caused by loss-of-function mutations in SPINK5, leading to a deficiency of the serine protease inhibitor LEKTI, which results in unregulated protease activity in the epidermis. This causes severe skin barrier impairment, increased inflammation, and the production of proallergic molecules (Samuelov2014Peeling; Chavanas2000Mutations; Lacroix2012Clinical).

Patients with NS often present with congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, trichorrhexis invaginata, and a range of atopic symptoms, including asthma and allergic rhinitis. The condition can lead to life-threatening complications due to epidermal barrier dysfunction, resulting in dehydration, infections, and failure to thrive (Descargues2006Corneodesmosomal; HannulaJouppi2016Intrafamily).

Alterations in SPINK5 expression are also implicated in other inflammatory skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis. The SPINK5 : c.1258A>G polymorphism is associated with atopy and atopic dermatitis, conditions that share clinical features with NS (Moltrasio2023Netherton). The variability in NS phenotypes is influenced by the specific mutations in SPINK5, with more severe cases linked to mutations in early exons and milder cases associated with mutations near the C-terminus (Wang2022A).

## Interactions
The SPINK5 gene encodes the protein lymphoepithelial Kazal-type inhibitor (LEKTI), which is involved in inhibiting various serine proteases, particularly those in the kallikrein family. LEKTI interacts with epidermal kallikreins such as KLK5, KLK7, and KLK14, playing a crucial role in regulating protease activity in the skin. These interactions are essential for maintaining skin barrier function and controlling desquamation, the process of shedding dead skin cells (Deraison2007LEKTI; Schechter2005Inhibition).

LEKTI is composed of multiple Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor domains, which allow it to form tight and specific inhibitory complexes with its target proteases. The inhibition of KLK5 and KLK7 by LEKTI is characterized by low equilibrium inhibition constants, indicating a strong and specific binding affinity (Schechter2005Inhibition). The interaction between LEKTI fragments and these kallikreins is also influenced by pH, which modulates the activity of KLK5 in the skin's stratum corneum (Deraison2007LEKTI).

Mutations in SPINK5, leading to defective LEKTI function, result in unregulated protease activity, contributing to skin disorders such as Netherton syndrome. This condition is characterized by skin barrier defects and inflammation due to the loss of protease inhibition (Briot2009Kallikrein; Komatsu2002Elevated).
