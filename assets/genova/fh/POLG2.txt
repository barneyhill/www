# POLG2

## Overview
The POLG2 gene encodes the DNA polymerase gamma 2, accessory subunit, also known as pol γ-β, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma complex. This protein functions as a processivity factor, enhancing the efficiency and stability of DNA replication within mitochondria. Structurally, pol γ-β is a homodimeric protein that interacts with the catalytic subunit of the polymerase, pol γ-α, to form a heterotrimeric holoenzyme. This interaction is essential for the replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), playing a significant role in maintaining mtDNA integrity and cellular energy production (Young2011Biochemical; Fan2006A). The accessory subunit is unique among eukaryotic processivity factors due to its structural similarity to prokaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, suggesting an evolutionary link (Carrodeguas1999The). Mutations in POLG2 can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and are associated with various mitochondrial diseases, underscoring its clinical significance (Young2015POLG2disease; Longley2006Mutant).

## Structure
The POLG2 gene encodes the accessory subunit of human mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, known as pol γ-β. This protein forms a homodimer, which is crucial for its function as a processivity factor in DNA replication. The pol γ-β monomer is organized into three domains: the N-terminal domain, the C-terminal domain, and a short middle domain. The N-terminal domain features a β-sheet surrounded by α-helices and loops, while the C-terminal domain is a mixed α/β domain. The middle domain contains a helix-loop-helix motif that is essential for dimerization (Fan2006A).

Structurally, pol γ-β shares homology with class IIa aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, particularly in the anticodon-binding domain. This structural similarity is reflected in the protein's ability to bind DNA and RNA molecules with stem-loop structures, suggesting a role in replication initiation (Fan2006A; Fan1999The). The dimeric structure of pol γ-β enhances the processivity of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase holoenzyme by encircling the newly synthesized double-stranded DNA, thereby increasing DNA binding affinity (Fan2006A).

Mutagenesis studies have identified specific residues critical for the interaction between pol γ-β and the catalytic core pol γ-α, as well as with DNA, highlighting the importance of these interactions for the protein's function (Fan2006A).

## Function
The POLG2 gene encodes the p55 accessory subunit of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (pol γ), which is essential for the replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in human cells. The pol γ holoenzyme is a heterotrimer composed of a 140 kDa catalytic subunit (encoded by POLG) and a 110 kDa p55 homodimeric accessory subunit (encoded by POLG2) (Young2011Biochemical; Hoff2018Characterization). The p55 subunit enhances the processivity and physiological salt tolerance of the pol γ catalytic subunit by binding asymmetrically to it, with each monomer of the homodimer playing distinct roles. The proximal p55 subunit strengthens the interaction with DNA, while the distal subunit accelerates nucleotide incorporation (Young2011Biochemical; Hoff2018Characterization).

POLG2 is involved in determining the mtDNA content of mitochondrial nucleoids, suggesting a role in nucleoid organization (Young2011Biochemical). The p55 subunit is unique among eukaryotic processivity factors due to its similarity to prokaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, indicating a potential evolutionary relationship (Carrodeguas1999The). This structural uniqueness suggests that p55 mediates the loading of pol γ onto primers for mtDNA replication initiation (Young2011Biochemical). The accessory subunit is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial DNA integrity, which is essential for cellular energy production and overall cellular function (Lim1999The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLG2 gene, which encodes the p55 accessory subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, are associated with several mitochondrial diseases. These mutations can lead to conditions such as progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), characterized by muscle weakness and neurological symptoms. The G451E mutation disrupts the interaction between the p55 and p140 subunits, impairing DNA synthesis processivity and leading to mtDNA deletions (Longley2006Mutant). The R369G mutation decreases the affinity between the p55 and p140 subunits, reducing enzyme processivity and contributing to autosomal dominant PEO and multiple mtDNA deletions (Craig2012A).

Another significant mutation, L475DfsX2, results in a frameshift and premature stop codon, leading to severe defects in p140 binding and dsDNA binding, which are detrimental to mtDNA synthesis (Young2011Biochemical). The R182W mutation is linked to mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, causing severe metabolic, neurological, and muscular diseases, including fatal hepatic liver failure (Hoff2018Characterization). These mutations highlight the critical role of POLG2 in maintaining mitochondrial DNA integrity and its involvement in various mitochondrial pathologies.

## Interactions
The POLG2 gene encodes the p55 accessory subunit of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (polγ) complex, which plays a crucial role in mitochondrial DNA replication and repair. The p55 subunit forms a homodimer and interacts with the catalytic subunit p140, encoded by the POLG gene, to form a heterotrimeric holoenzyme. This interaction enhances the processivity of polγ by stabilizing its association with the DNA template, thereby facilitating efficient DNA synthesis (Young2015POLG2disease; Humble2012Polg2).

Mutations in POLG2 can disrupt these interactions, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. For instance, the G451E mutation in the p55 subunit impairs its interaction with p140, resulting in reduced polymerase activity and processivity (Young2015POLG2disease; Longley2006Mutant). This mutation exhibits a dominant negative effect, where the WT/G451E heterodimer significantly inhibits polγ activity (Young2015POLG2disease).

Other variants, such as P205R and R369G, also show altered interactions with p140, affecting the holoenzyme's function. These variants demonstrate reduced ability to stimulate DNA synthesis, highlighting the importance of proper subunit interactions for maintaining mitochondrial DNA integrity (Young2011Biochemical).
