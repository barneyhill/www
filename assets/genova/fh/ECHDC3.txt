# ECHDC3

## Overview
ECHDC3 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme enoyl-CoA hydratase domain containing 3, which plays a critical role in fatty acid metabolism, particularly within the beta-oxidation pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a hydratase and is involved in the conversion of enoyl-CoA to 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, a key step in the breakdown of fatty acids for energy production (Duarte2016The). The protein is predominantly active in the mitochondrial matrix, contributing to cellular energy homeostasis by facilitating the conversion of fatty acids into usable energy forms (Eraso‐Pichot2018GSEA). ECHDC3 is notably expressed in astrocytes, where it supports energy balance and metabolic flexibility in the brain (Eraso‐Pichot2018GSEA). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various clinical conditions, including acute myeloid leukemia, cardiovascular diseases, and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Zhao2022Comprehensive; Tan2021Associations).

## Function
The ECHDC3 gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme involved in fatty acid metabolism, specifically within the beta-oxidation pathway. This enzyme, enoyl-CoA hydratase domain containing 3, participates in the hydration of enoyl-CoA to 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, a crucial step in the breakdown of fatty acids for energy production in cells (Duarte2016The). The protein is active in the mitochondrial matrix, where it contributes to cellular energy homeostasis by facilitating the conversion of fatty acids into usable energy forms (Eraso‐Pichot2018GSEA).

In astrocytes, ECHDC3 is associated with cellular energy homeostasis, indicating its role in maintaining energy balance within these cells. Astrocytes, which are glial cells in the brain, utilize fatty acid oxidation as a significant metabolic pathway, and ECHDC3 is one of the genes overexpressed in these cells compared to neurons (Eraso‐Pichot2018GSEA). This suggests that ECHDC3 may play a role in the complex metabolic processes of the brain, contributing to the flexibility and efficiency of energy production in astrocytes (Eraso‐Pichot2018GSEA). The enzyme's activity in fatty acid oxidation highlights its importance in both cellular and organismal energy metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
ECHDC3 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high expression of ECHDC3 is associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance. It is considered an independent risk factor for inferior overall survival in AML patients, and its knockdown has been shown to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs like cytarabine and doxorubicin (Zhao2022Comprehensive). ECHDC3 is also linked to changes in the bone marrow microenvironment, influencing immune cell infiltration and potentially affecting immune therapy outcomes in AML (Zhao2022Comprehensive).

In cardiovascular diseases, ECHDC3 expression is associated with the extent of coronary lesions. Higher ECHDC3 mRNA expression is observed in patients with low coronary lesions, suggesting its role in the initial progression of coronary artery disease (Duarte2016The).

ECHDC3 has also been associated with Alzheimer's disease. Variants in the ECHDC3 gene are linked to changes in gene expression and brain neurodegeneration, with specific variants associated with altered MRI hippocampal volumes, indicating a potential role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis (Tan2021Associations).
