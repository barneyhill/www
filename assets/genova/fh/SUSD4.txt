# SUSD4

## Overview
SUSD4 is a gene that encodes the Sushi domain-containing protein 4, a transmembrane protein characterized by the presence of multiple Sushi or complement control protein (CCP) domains. These domains are integral to the protein's role in mediating protein-protein interactions, particularly within the immune system. The protein encoded by SUSD4 is involved in various biological processes, including synaptic plasticity, motor learning, and complement system regulation. It interacts with AMPA receptor subunits and E3 ubiquitin ligases, influencing synaptic transmission and neuronal survival. Additionally, SUSD4 functions as a complement inhibitor, protecting cells from excessive complement activation. The gene's expression and function have significant implications in neurological disorders and cancer biology, where it acts as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer (Holmquist2013Sushi; GonzálezCalvo2021Sushi; Zhu2020The).

## Structure
The SUSD4 gene encodes a transmembrane protein characterized by the presence of four extracellular Sushi or complement control protein (CCP) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and are common in complement regulators (Holmquist2013Sushi; Zhu2020The). These domains suggest a role in complement inhibition, as they are evolutionarily conserved modules initially characterized in proteins involved in immunity (GonzálezCalvo2021Sushi).

SUSD4 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, including a membrane-bound form (SUSD4a) and a soluble form (SUSD4b). SUSD4a is a 49-kDa protein with four CCP domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail, while SUSD4b is a 27-kDa protein with three CCP domains and a region of unknown homology (Holmquist2013Sushi). The molecular weight of SUSD4 can vary due to post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, with the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides contributing to a higher observed molecular weight in some contexts (Papadakos2022Sushi).

The protein's structure is further defined by its interaction with other proteins, such as the C1Q globular domain, which is found in major synaptic regulators, and its involvement with E3 ubiquitin ligases of the NEDD4 family, which regulate the ubiquitination and degradation of substrates (GonzálezCalvo2019SUSD4; GonzálezCalvo2021Sushi).

## Function
The SUSD4 gene encodes the Sushi domain-containing protein 4, which plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity and motor learning. This protein is involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission by interacting with AMPA receptor subunits, particularly GluA2, and influencing their degradation. SUSD4 interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligases of the NEDD4 family, which are crucial for the ubiquitination and degradation of AMPA receptors, thereby regulating synaptic plasticity and learning processes (GonzálezCalvo2021Sushi).

SUSD4 is expressed in neurons and oligodendrocyte lineage cells within the central nervous system, where it functions as a complement system regulator by binding to the C1 complex and complement component C1q, blocking the activation of the complement cascade. This activity suggests a role in neuron survival and synaptic pruning, which are essential for maintaining normal CNS function (Zhu2020The).

In addition to its role in synaptic plasticity, SUSD4 acts as a complement inhibitor, protecting cells from complement attack by disrupting the formation of the classical C3 convertase. This function is crucial for preventing excessive complement activation that could lead to autoimmunity (Holmquist2013Sushi).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or deletions in the SUSD4 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders. SUSD4 is often deleted in 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome, a condition associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities, seizures, developmental delays, and intellectual disabilities (Zhu2020The). Research using Susd4 knockout mice has shown that the absence of this gene leads to significant defects in motor performance, increased anxiety-like behaviors, and abnormal neuronal morphologies, such as 'hairy' basket cells in the cerebellum and reduced dendritic spine density in hippocampal neurons (Zhu2020The). These findings suggest that SUSD4 plays a crucial role in maintaining normal nervous system function, and its deletion may contribute to the neurological symptoms observed in patients with 1q41q42 deletions (Zhu2020The).

In cancer biology, SUSD4 acts as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, with its expression correlating with smaller, more differentiated tumors and better patient survival (Gialeli2018Novel; Englund2015The). SUSD4 expression in tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating T cells is associated with improved prognosis and reduced metastasis rates in breast cancer patients (Englund2015The).

## Interactions
Sushi domain-containing protein 4 (SUSD4) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. SUSD4 interacts with several members of the NEDD4 subfamily of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases, which are known to ubiquitinate and target key signaling molecules for degradation. This interaction is mediated by two potential PY binding sites in SUSD4's intracellular domain, and mutations in these sites affect the binding to NEDD4 ligases (GonzálezCalvo2021Sushi). SUSD4 also interacts with GluA2-containing AMPA receptors, playing a role in their turnover and degradation, which is crucial for synaptic plasticity (GonzálezCalvo2021Sushi).

In the context of breast cancer, SUSD4 binds to the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) and initiates autophagy in an EGFR phosphorylation-independent manner. This interaction affects EGFR dynamics, potentially influencing its trafficking and ubiquitination, but not its degradation (Papadakos2022Sushi). SUSD4 also interacts with other growth factor receptors, such as PDGFRα, suggesting its role in modulating multiple signaling pathways (Papadakos2022Sushi).

SUSD4 has been shown to inhibit the complement system by disrupting the formation of the classical C3 convertase, binding directly to components like C1q, which are involved in the activation of the classical complement pathway (Holmquist2013Sushi).
