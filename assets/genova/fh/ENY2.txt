# ENY2

## Overview
ENY2 is a gene that encodes the ENY2 transcription and export complex 2 subunit, a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes such as transcription regulation and mRNA export. The protein is a component of the SAGA complex, where it plays a role in the deubiquitination of histones, and the TREX-2 complex, which is essential for mRNA processing and export. ENY2 is characterized by a WD40 repeat domain, facilitating protein-protein interactions necessary for its function in these complexes. The protein's interactions and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are crucial for its regulatory roles in gene expression and cellular homeostasis. ENY2's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential implications in diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma (Li2022Integrated; Lang2011The; Kopytova2010Multifunctional).

## Structure
ENY2 is a component of the transcription and export (TREX-2) complex, playing a crucial role in mRNA processing and export. The protein is characterized by the presence of a WD40 repeat domain, which is instrumental in facilitating protein-protein interactions. This domain typically forms beta-propeller folds, a structural motif common in proteins that mediate complex formation and stability through multiple interaction surfaces. The beta-propeller structure is composed of several beta-sheets arranged in a circular fashion, resembling the blades of a propeller, which allows for versatile binding capabilities.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are known to regulate the function of ENY2. These modifications can influence the protein's activity, stability, and interactions with other components of the TREX-2 complex. The precise regulation of ENY2 through such modifications underscores its importance in the dynamic process of mRNA export.

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ENY2 are not provided, the presence of the WD40 domain and its associated structural features are critical to its function within the TREX-2 complex. The structural attributes of ENY2 enable it to effectively participate in the intricate network of protein interactions necessary for mRNA processing and export.

## Function
ENY2 is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical molecular processes in human cells. It is a component of the SAGA complex, where it participates in the deubiquitination of histones H2A and H2B, a process essential for transcriptional regulation. This activity is mediated by the deubiquitination module (DUBm) of the SAGA complex, which includes other subunits such as USP22, ATXN7, and ATXN7L3 (Lang2011The). ENY2's role in the SAGA complex is crucial for maintaining low levels of histone ubiquitination, which is necessary for the activation of SAGA-dependent genes (Lang2011The).

ENY2 is also involved in mRNA export from the nucleus, forming part of the TREX-2 complex. This complex is essential for the proper processing and export of mRNA, linking transcription to mRNA export and ensuring efficient gene expression (Nabirochkina2019The). ENY2's interaction with the nuclear pore complex facilitates the anchoring of transcription sites to the nuclear pores, promoting efficient transcription and mRNA export (Kopytova2010Multifunctional). Through these roles, ENY2 contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
ENY2 is implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common form of liver cancer. It is significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and is associated with early recurrence of the disease. ENY2 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, which are critical factors in cancer progression. Knockdown of ENY2 has been shown to reduce these malignant phenotypes, while its overexpression enhances them, suggesting that ENY2 could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in HCC, particularly in preventing early recurrence and metastasis (Li2022Integrated).

ENY2 is also linked to telomere maintenance, a process crucial for cancer cell immortality, through its co-expression with genes involved in this pathway. This association further underscores its role in cancer progression and recurrence (Li2022Integrated). The gene's involvement in the SAGA complex, which is associated with histone modifications and transcription regulation, suggests that alterations in ENY2 expression or function could disrupt normal gene expression and contribute to oncogenesis (Li2022Integrated). These findings highlight ENY2's potential clinical significance as a biomarker for predicting HCC recurrence and as a target for therapeutic strategies aimed at managing the disease (Li2022Integrated).

## Interactions
ENY2 is a component of the deubiquitination module (DUBm) within the human SAGA complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by deubiquitinating histones H2B and H2A. ENY2 interacts with other subunits of the DUBm, including ATXN7, ATXN7L3, and USP22, to regulate the catalytic activity of USP22. These interactions are essential for the assembly and stability of the DUBm, with ENY2 being necessary for the full activation of USP22 (Lang2011The).

ENY2 also interacts with the adenovirus E1A protein, independently of TRRAP, suggesting a competitive interaction between ENY2 and TRRAP for binding to E1A. This interaction is enhanced in TRRAP-depleted cells, indicating that ENY2 may enhance E1A expression (Vijayalingam2016The). ENY2 is part of a deubiquitinase complex that includes ATXN7, ATXN7L3, and USP22, which is a sub-complex of the larger TRRAP-GCN5 (or SAGA) protein complex. This complex interacts with E1A sequences spanning residues 26-35, crucial for E1A's transforming domain (Vijayalingam2016The).

ENY2 is also involved in mRNA export as part of the transcription and export (TREX-2) complex, interacting with proteins such as GANP, PCID2, and DSS1, and is associated with RNA polymerase II loading to nascent mRNA (Lang2011The).
