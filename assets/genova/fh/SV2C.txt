# SV2C

## Overview
SV2C (synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein belonging to the synaptic vesicle protein family, which is integral to the regulation of neurotransmitter release, particularly dopamine, at synapses. The SV2C protein is characterized by its 12-transmembrane domain structure, typical of the major facilitator superfamily, and plays a crucial role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and exocytosis (Stout2019The; Dunn2017Synaptic). It is predominantly expressed in specific brain regions such as the substantia nigra pars compacta, ventral tegmental area, and striatum, where it is involved in modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity (Dunn2017Synaptic). SV2C's interactions with proteins like α-synuclein and synaptotagmin-1 suggest its involvement in neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Chang2024Synaptic; Dunn2017Synaptic).

## Structure
SV2C (synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C) is a member of the synaptic vesicle protein family, characterized by its 12-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of the major facilitator superfamily (Stout2019The). These transmembrane domains are crucial for its role in neurotransmitter release and vesicle trafficking. SV2C contains a large luminal domain (LD4) between transmembrane helices 7 and 8, which is involved in binding interactions with botulinum neurotoxins (Li2020Structural). The LD4 domain of SV2C is described as a right-handed, quadrilateral β-helix, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, particularly stacked phenylalanine side chains (Li2020Structural).

Post-translational modifications of SV2C include N-glycosylation, which occurs at conserved sites within the luminal domain. This modification enhances the binding of botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) to SV2C, although it is not essential for toxin entry (Li2020Structural). The glycosylation at Asn-559 is particularly noted for its role in slowing the dissociation rate of BoNT/A, thereby prolonging receptor occupancy (Li2020Structural).

SV2C also exhibits structural variants due to alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms with potentially distinct functions. These variants include alterations in the N-terminus and five known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), though their exact functional implications remain unclear (Stout2019The).

## Function
SV2C (synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C) is a protein involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, particularly dopamine, at synapses. It is part of the synaptic vesicle protein family, which plays a crucial role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. SV2C is primarily active in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, where it modulates synaptic transmission and plasticity, influencing cognitive and motor functions (Dunn2017Synaptic).

SV2C is expressed in specific brain regions, including the substantia nigra pars compacta, ventral tegmental area, and striatum, where it is highly colocalized with the dopaminergic marker tyrosine hydroxylase (Dunn2019Immunochemical; Dunn2017Synaptic). It is implicated in promoting vesicular function by coordinating vesicular mobilization, facilitating calcium-stimulated exocytosis, or stabilizing intravesicular transmitters (Dunn2017Synaptic). Genetic deletion of SV2C results in reduced dopamine content and impaired dopamine release, suggesting its critical role in maintaining a readily releasable pool of vesicles and proper vesicular trafficking (Dunn2017Synaptic).

SV2C also interacts with α-synuclein, a protein associated with Parkinson's disease, indicating a potential link between SV2C disruption and the disease's pathogenesis (Dunn2017Synaptic). This interaction may affect dopamine release and content, contributing to the neurochemical and behavioral responses observed in healthy human cells (Dunn2017Synaptic).

## Clinical Significance
SV2C (synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C) is implicated in several neurological disorders, primarily due to its role in dopamine regulation. Alterations in SV2C expression have been linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). In PD, SV2C expression is disrupted, leading to reduced dopamine release and content in the dorsal striatum, which contributes to motor deficits and dopaminergic dysfunction (Dunn2017Synaptic). Genetic studies have identified SV2C as a risk locus for PD, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs246814 associated with the disease (Chang2024Synaptic). These genetic variations may affect SV2C's function and its interaction with other synaptic proteins, potentially influencing PD progression (Chang2024Synaptic).

SV2C is also involved in depression-like behavior and memory disorders. In mice, miR-96 negatively regulates SV2C expression, leading to increased depression-like behaviors and memory impairments. Overexpression of SV2C has been shown to alleviate these symptoms, suggesting a protective role against such disorders (Sun2021miR96). The gene's involvement in dopamine and GABA neurotransmission further underscores its clinical significance in neuropsychiatric conditions (Stout2019The).

## Interactions
Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2C (SV2C) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in synaptic function and neurotransmitter release. One of the key interactions of SV2C is with α-synuclein, a protein implicated in Parkinson's disease. SV2C coimmunoprecipitates with α-synuclein, indicating a specific physical interaction. This interaction is thought to influence α-synuclein expression, with SV2C knockout animals showing altered levels of monomeric and multimeric α-synuclein, which may contribute to α-synuclein aggregation and toxicity in Parkinson's disease (Dunn2017Synaptic).

SV2C is also suggested to interact with synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1), a calcium sensor essential for neurotransmitter exocytosis. Although direct evidence for SV2C's involvement in SYT1 trafficking is still lacking, its N-terminal tail contains a binding site for SYT1, suggesting a potential interaction (Chang2024Synaptic). Additionally, SV2C may interact with the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), influencing dopamine uptake and retention, although the functional significance of this interaction is not fully understood (Chang2024Synaptic). These interactions highlight SV2C's role in modulating synaptic vesicle dynamics and neurotransmitter release, particularly in dopaminergic neurons.
