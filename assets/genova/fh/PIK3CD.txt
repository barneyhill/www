# PIK3CD

## Overview
The PIK3CD gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta (p110δ), a critical component of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex. This protein is categorized as a kinase and plays a pivotal role in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating various cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and survival. Predominantly expressed in leukocytes, p110δ is integral to immune cell signaling, particularly within B-cells, T-cells, and myeloid cells (Vanhaesebroeck2015Molecules; Chantry1997p110δ). The p110δ subunit forms a heterodimer with the p85 regulatory subunit, facilitating its localization to the plasma membrane and subsequent phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol substrates (Vanhaesebroeck1997p110δ). Mutations in PIK3CD can lead to immune dysregulation, contributing to conditions such as activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS), characterized by recurrent infections and autoimmunity (Angulo2013Phosphoinositide; Lau2019Activated).

## Structure
The PIK3CD gene encodes the p110δ catalytic subunit of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, which plays a crucial role in immune cell signaling. The p110δ protein is composed of several domains: an adaptor-binding domain (ABD), a Ras-binding domain (RBD), a C2 domain, a helical domain, and a bi-lobed kinase domain (Takeda2017Novel; Dornan2018Molecular). The ABD interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit, forming a heterodimer that is essential for the stability and regulation of the PI3K complex (Dornan2018Molecular). 

Mutations in PIK3CD can lead to structural changes that affect the protein's function. For instance, the E525K mutation disrupts the nSH2-helical interface, while the E1021K mutation affects the interaction of the kinase domain with the membrane (Dornan2017Conformational). The novel mutation p.T240M in the RBD results in a loss of polarity and a longer side chain, likely altering the structural configuration of the RBD (Abrego2022Novel). 

Common post-translational modifications of p110δ include phosphorylation, which is critical for its activity and regulation (Takeda2017Novel). The protein's quaternary structure involves its interaction with the p85 regulatory subunit, which provides inhibitory contacts and stabilizes the complex (Takeda2017Novel).

## Function
The PIK3CD gene encodes the p110δ isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which plays a critical role in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for various cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival, and intracellular trafficking. In healthy human cells, p110δ is predominantly expressed in leukocytes, where it is involved in immune cell signaling and function (Vanhaesebroeck2015Molecules; Chantry1997p110δ).

PI3Kδ is a key player in the adaptive immune system, particularly in B-cells, T-cells, mast cells, and myeloid cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. It regulates immune responses by influencing the development, survival, and function of these cells (Tangye2019Immune; Edwards2019Activating). The p110δ subunit forms a heterodimer with the p85 regulatory subunit, which localizes PI3K activity to the plasma membrane, facilitating the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol substrates (Chantry1997p110δ; Vanhaesebroeck1997p110δ).

In T cells, PI3Kδ is activated by the CD28 co-stimulatory molecule, which is crucial for interleukin-2 production and T cell activation (Chantry1997p110δ). The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, in which p110δ is involved, acts as a metabolic checkpoint regulating glycolysis, essential for the differentiation and function of CD8+ T cells (Edwards2019Activating).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIK3CD gene, which encodes the p110δ subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ), are associated with a condition known as activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS). This syndrome is characterized by immune dysregulation, leading to recurrent respiratory infections, lymphoproliferation, and autoimmunity. Patients often present with increased levels of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and susceptibility to infections by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Angulo2013Phosphoinositide; Lau2019Activated; Zhao2024Activated).

The most common mutation associated with APDS is E1021K, which results in hyperactivation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. This hyperactivation leads to immune cell dysfunction, including impaired B cell development and function, and T cell senescence, which limits the generation of long-lived memory T cells (Tangye2019Immune; Lucas2013Dominantactivating). Patients with these mutations may also experience autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune cytopenias and thyroiditis, and have an increased risk of developing B cell lymphomas (Lau2019Activated; Edwards2019Activating).

Therapeutic strategies targeting the PI3K pathway, such as the use of p110δ-specific inhibitors, have shown potential in managing the symptoms and immune dysregulation associated with PIK3CD mutations (Avery2018Germlineactivating; Edwards2019Activating).

## Interactions
The PIK3CD gene encodes the p110δ catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which is involved in several critical protein interactions. The p110δ subunit interacts with the p85α regulatory subunit, a crucial interaction for the kinase's activity. Mutations in PIK3CD, such as the R821H mutation, can disrupt specific interactions between p110δ and p85α, affecting PI3K activity without altering the expression levels or binding of p110δ to p85α (Rodriguez2019Concomitant).

Gain-of-function mutations in PIK3CD lead to hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway, enhancing interactions within the PI3K complex. These mutations do not disrupt the interaction between mutant p110δ proteins and p85α but enhance kinase activity, resulting in increased Akt phosphorylation (Lucas2013Dominantactivating). The PI3K pathway, involving p110δ, is activated downstream of several surface receptors, including the T-cell receptor (TCR), CD28, and inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS), which are essential for T follicular helper (T_FH) cell generation and function (Bier2019Activating).

Additionally, the PI3Kδ subunit's conformational dynamics are affected by immunodeficiency mutations, which disrupt inhibitory interactions, particularly at the nSH2-helical and cSH2-kinase interfaces, leading to increased activation (Dornan2017Conformational). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving PIK3CD in immune cell signaling.
