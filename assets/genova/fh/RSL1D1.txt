# RSL1D1

## Overview
RSL1D1, also known as ribosomal L1 domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a nucleolar protein involved in various cellular processes, including ribosome biosynthesis and cell cycle regulation. The protein, characterized by a ribosomal L1-like domain, plays a crucial role in delaying cellular senescence and promoting cell proliferation through pathways such as PTEN/p27Kip1 (Ma2016The). RSL1D1 is implicated in the regulation of mRNA stability and is associated with transcriptional and post-transcriptional modifications, influencing genes critical for cell proliferation and senescence (Ma2015Global). Additionally, RSL1D1 is involved in the progression of colorectal cancer by interacting with proteins such as p53 and HDM2, affecting their stability and activity (Ding2021Ribosomal). Its interactions and regulatory functions make RSL1D1 a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Liu2022RSL1D1).

## Structure
RSL1D1, also known as ribosomal L1 domain containing 1, is a protein encoded by the human gene RSL1D1. The protein is composed of 490 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 54.7 kDa (Ma2016The). It contains a ribosomal L1-like domain in its N-terminus, which is crucial for its involvement in ribosome biosynthesis (Ma2016The). The L1 domain spans amino acids 150-254 and is primarily cytoplasmic, but it can localize to the nucleolus when fused with a nuclear localization signal (Meng2006Multiple). The protein also includes a coiled-coil domain between amino acids 270-316, which contributes to its nucleolar localization (Meng2006Multiple).

The C-terminus of RSL1D1 is lysine-rich and interacts with other proteins, such as nucleostemin and ING1, indicating a role in protein binding activity (Meng2006Multiple; Ma2016The). RSL1D1 forms a complex with nucleostemin in the nucleolus, with the interaction mediated by the B and G domains of nucleostemin and the region of RSL1D1 spanning amino acids 317-452 (Meng2006Multiple). The protein's structure and interactions suggest its involvement in nucleolar organization and regulation of nucleostemin localization (Meng2006Multiple).

## Function
RSL1D1, also known as the cellular senescence-inhibited gene (CSIG), plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is highly expressed in early-passaged human diploid fibroblast cells and declines during senescence, indicating its involvement in delaying cellular aging (Liu2022RSL1D1; Ma2016The). RSL1D1 is involved in cell cycle regulation, promoting cell proliferation and delaying senescence through the PTEN/p27Kip1 pathway by inhibiting PTEN synthesis, which prevents G1 phase arrest (Ma2016The). It also participates in ribosomal protein synthesis and is associated with the nucleolus, where it plays a role in ribosome biosynthesis (Ding2021Ribosomal; Ma2016The).

The protein is involved in transcriptional and post-transcriptional modifications, influencing the mRNA half-life of genes such as Cdc14B, CASP7, and CREBL2, which are crucial for cell proliferation and senescence (Ma2015Global). RSL1D1's expression is increased during bone healing and growth, suggesting its role in bone tissue formation and regeneration (Ma2016The). It is widely expressed in most human tissues, with higher expression in the heart, skeletal muscle, and placental tissues, and is predominantly distributed in the nucleolus (Ma2016The).

## Clinical Significance
RSL1D1 (ribosomal L1 domain containing 1) is implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) through its role in suppressing autophagy and interacting with key proteins involved in tumorigenesis. Overexpression of RSL1D1 in CRC cells promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, while its knockdown results in reduced tumor growth and metastasis (Liu2022RSL1D1). RSL1D1 interacts with RAN, a member of the RAS superfamily, to suppress autophagic gene expression by inhibiting the nuclear accumulation of STAT3, a critical regulator of autophagy (Liu2022RSL1D1). This interaction is crucial for CRC cell proliferation and invasion, highlighting RSL1D1 as a potential therapeutic target (Liu2022RSL1D1).

In addition to its role in autophagy, RSL1D1 negatively regulates the tumor suppressor protein p53 by promoting its ubiquitination and degradation through the upregulation of HDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Ding2021Ribosomal). This regulation facilitates cancer cell proliferation and survival, contributing to tumor progression in CRC. Silencing RSL1D1 has been shown to increase p53 levels, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a target for drug development in CRC with wild-type p53 (Ding2021Ribosomal).

## Interactions
RSL1D1, a nucleolar protein, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. It interacts with p53 and HDM2, forming a ternary complex that promotes p53 ubiquitination and degradation, thereby negatively regulating p53 activity in CRC cells (Ding2021Ribosomal). RSL1D1 stabilizes HDM2 mRNA, increasing HDM2 protein levels independently of p53, which contributes to the negative regulation of p53 (Ding2021Ribosomal).

RSL1D1 also interacts with the protein RAN, inhibiting its deacetylation by competing with Sirt7. This interaction affects the acetylation of RAN, influencing the subcellular localization of STAT3 and suppressing autophagy, which promotes CRC progression (Liu2022RSL1D1). The interaction between RSL1D1 and nucleostemin is mediated by specific domains, with RSL1D1's C-terminal half being crucial for binding. This interaction influences nucleolar localization and retention times, suggesting a role in nucleolar organization (Meng2006Multiple). These interactions highlight RSL1D1's involvement in critical cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in CRC.
