# ZNF253

## Overview
ZNF253 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 253, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs. These motifs are typically involved in binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 253 is categorized as a transcription factor, which implies its involvement in regulating the expression of other genes. The specific biological functions and pathways influenced by ZNF253 remain an active area of research, with studies indicating potential roles in cellular differentiation and development (Qiu2020aarFDC).
