# C1QTNF2

## Overview
C1QTNF2 is a gene that encodes the protein C1q and TNF related 2, which is a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family. This protein is characterized by a C-terminal globular C1q domain and is known for its role as a secreted hormone involved in regulating lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. C1q and TNF related 2 is primarily expressed in adipose tissue and plays a significant role in metabolic processes, including the modulation of lipid profiles and energy balance. It is involved in the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, which enhances energy expenditure and metabolic rate. The protein's structural features, such as its ability to form trimers or higher-order oligomers, are crucial for its function. C1QTNF2 has been implicated in various diseases, including heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and metabolic disorders, due to its involvement in extracellular matrix processes and lipid metabolism (Lei2019C1qTNFrelated; Zhou2020Weighted).

## Structure
The C1QTNF2 protein, encoded by the C1QTNF2 gene, is part of the C1q/TNF-related protein family and is characterized by a C-terminal globular C1q domain. This domain is approximately 140 amino acids long and includes several highly conserved residues, which are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the protein (Tom2005The). The C1q domain features a 10-stranded beta-sandwich fold with a jelly-roll topology, consisting of two five-stranded beta-sheets, which is a common structural motif in this protein family (Ghai2007C1q).

C1QTNF2 typically forms trimers or higher-order oligomers, a quaternary structure that is facilitated by the trimerization properties of the C1q domain and associated collagen-like regions (Tom2005The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and stability, although specific details on these modifications for C1QTNF2 are not provided in the context (Tom2005The). The protein's structure and sequence similarity with other members of its family suggest potential functional relatedness, although specific details on its primary, secondary, or tertiary structures are not detailed in the available sources (Tom2005The).

## Function
C1QTNF2, also known as C1q/TNF-related protein 2 (CTRP2), is a secreted hormone that plays a significant role in regulating lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis in healthy human cells. It is part of the highly conserved CTRP family, which is involved in various metabolic processes, including insulin action and the metabolism of sugars and fats (Lei2019C1qTNFrelated). CTRP2 is expressed in adipose tissue and is known to modulate lipid metabolism in both adipose tissue and the liver. It suppresses fat mobilization in adipocytes and restrains excessive triglyceride hydrolysis, thereby influencing lipid profiles and energy balance (Lei2019C1qTNFrelated).

CTRP2 activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway in muscle cells, which leads to increased glycogen deposition and fatty acid oxidation, enhancing energy expenditure and metabolic rate (Lei2019C1qTNFrelated; Shanaki2020The). This protein is also involved in the regulation of triglyceride metabolism, as evidenced by its role in hepatic triglyceride secretion and the modulation of plasma triglyceride levels (Lei2019C1qTNFrelated). These functions suggest that CTRP2 is crucial for maintaining lipid homeostasis and energy balance in the body.

## Clinical Significance
C1QTNF2 has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In heart failure (HF), C1QTNF2 is significantly upregulated and is associated with the organization and disassembly of the extracellular matrix, suggesting a role in cardiac remodeling processes (Zhou2020Weighted). It is also identified as a potential risk factor for HF, with elevated expression levels correlating with disease presence (Wang2022Identification). In ischemic heart disease (ISCH) and cardiomyopathy (CMP), C1QTNF2 is similarly upregulated, indicating its involvement in extracellular matrix processes and the regulation of the BMP signaling pathway (Zhou2020Weighted).

In the context of lung diseases, C1QTNF2 is enriched in pathways related to extracellular matrix-receptor interactions, which are significant in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Its expression is notably altered in lung squamous cell carcinomas, highlighting its potential role in tumorigenesis (Banaganapalli2022Integrative).

C1QTNF2 is also linked to metabolic disorders. Its expression is positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and is upregulated in obesity, suggesting a role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis (Lei2019C1qTNFrelated).
