# EPB41L4A

## Overview
EPB41L4A is a gene that encodes the protein erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 like 4A, which is a member of the FERM domain-containing protein superfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in cytoskeletal organization by linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, thereby maintaining cell shape and stability. It is involved in several cellular processes, including intracellular trafficking, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal rearrangement, which are essential for embryonic development and cell proliferation (Comiskey2020Characterizing; Samdal2021The). EPB41L4A is also a target of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and cell differentiation (Samdal2021The). The protein's interactions and potential post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, suggest its involvement in complex cellular functions and its significance in various physiological and pathological contexts (Comiskey2020Characterizing).

## Structure
EPB41L4A encodes a protein involved in cytoskeletal organization, potentially containing FERM domains, which are crucial for linking cytoskeletal components to the plasma membrane. The presence of these domains suggests a role in maintaining cell shape and stability by anchoring the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could influence its function and interactions with other cellular components. 

Splice variants of EPB41L4A may exist, leading to different isoforms of the protein. These isoforms could have diverse roles within the cell, possibly affecting the protein's ability to interact with other molecules or its localization within the cell. The specific structural details of the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of EPB41L4A are not provided in the available context, but the presence of FERM domains indicates a likely involvement in membrane-associated processes. 

Overall, the structural features of EPB41L4A, including its potential domains and post-translational modifications, suggest a significant role in cytoskeletal organization and membrane interactions, although detailed structural information is not specified in the current context.

## Function
EPB41L4A, a member of the FERM domain-containing protein superfamily, plays a crucial role in maintaining cell shape and stability by linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular trafficking, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal rearrangement, which are essential for embryonic development and cell proliferation (Comiskey2020Characterizing; Samdal2021The). EPB41L4A is a target gene of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is vital for regulating embryonic development, adult tissue homeostasis, and cell differentiation (Samdal2021The).

In healthy human cells, EPB41L4A is implicated in the regulation of cell survival pathways, particularly through its interaction with β-catenin, influencing cell proliferation and differentiation (Comiskey2020Characterizing). The gene is highly expressed in thyroid tissue, suggesting a potential role in thyroid-specific functions (Comiskey2020Characterizing). EPB41L4A's involvement in cellular trafficking and β-catenin signaling highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and contributing to organismal outcomes such as tissue development and homeostasis (Comiskey2020Characterizing).

## Clinical Significance
The EPB41L4A gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disruptions in its normal interactions. In the context of cancer, EPB41L4A is associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Variants such as rs73227498 and rs17134155 have been linked to increased PTC risk, with the latter affecting the splicing of a non-coding transcript, EPB41L4A-203, potentially influencing cancer predisposition through the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway (Comiskey2020Characterizing).

In neurodevelopmental disorders, structural variations at the EPB41L4A locus, particularly copy number variations (CNVs), have been associated with neurological abnormalities, including dyslexia, intellectual disability, and atypical behavior. These CNVs may disrupt the topologically associating domain (TAD) boundary, leading to misregulation of nearby genes such as NREP, which is crucial for nervous system development (Salnikov2024Structural).

EPB41L4A is also linked to antipsychotic-induced QTc interval prolongation (AIQTIP) in patients with schizophrenia. The SNP rs7732687 in EPB41L4A has been associated with significant QTc interval prolongation, particularly in male patients, suggesting a genetic predisposition to this cardiovascular side effect (Cao2020EPB41L4A). These findings highlight the gene's clinical significance across various medical conditions.

## Interactions
EPB41L4A, a member of the band 4.1 protein family, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is linked to the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and differentiation. The gene's interaction with β-catenin suggests its involvement in regulating cell survival pathways, potentially influencing cytoskeletal rearrangements and intracellular trafficking (Comiskey2020Characterizing).

In the context of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), EPB41L4A is associated with the regulation of β-catenin pathway regulators, including CTNNB1, CDH6, and DKK2. Knockdown experiments in thyroid cells have shown that decreased expression of EPB41L4A leads to changes in gene expression related to cell proliferation and movement, highlighting its role in the predisposition to PTC (Comiskey2020Characterizing).

EPB41L4A's interactions are not limited to permanent complexes but also include more transient interactions that can activate or inhibit various cellular functions. These interactions underscore the gene's potential involvement in multiprotein complexes, contributing to its regulatory roles in different cellular contexts (Comiskey2020Characterizing).
