# SGCZ

## Overview
The SGCZ gene encodes the ζ-sarcoglycan protein, a transmembrane component of the sarcoglycan complex, which is integral to the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DAPC) in muscle cells. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cell membranes by linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, thereby facilitating proper muscle function and stability (Boulay2015The; Piovani2014De). Beyond its role in muscle tissue, ζ-sarcoglycan is also expressed in the cerebrovascular system, where it contributes to the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and may influence calcium signaling (Boulay2015The). Additionally, the SGCZ gene has been implicated in cognitive function, with high expression levels in the brain suggesting potential roles in neurogenesis and dendrite formation (Davies2017Ninetynine). This highlights the gene's multifaceted importance in both muscular and neurological health.

## Function
The SGCZ gene encodes the ζ-sarcoglycan protein, which is a component of the sarcoglycan complex. This complex is part of the larger dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DAPC) that plays a critical role in linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, thereby maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cell membranes during contraction and relaxation (Boulay2015The; Piovani2014De). The sarcoglycan complex, including ζ-sarcoglycan, is involved in mechanosignaling, which is essential for muscle function and stability (Piovani2014De).

In addition to its role in muscle cells, the sarcoglycan complex is expressed in the cerebrovascular system, where it is involved in maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and may contribute to calcium homeostasis and signaling (Boulay2015The). The SGCZ gene is also associated with general cognitive function, as it is one of the novel genes identified to influence cognitive abilities, with high expression in the brain and involvement in neurogenesis and dendrite formation (Davies2017Ninetynine). This suggests that ζ-sarcoglycan may have roles beyond muscle tissue, potentially impacting brain health and cognitive processes.

## Interactions
SGCZ (sarcoglycan zeta) is a component of the sarcoglycan complex, which is part of the larger dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) in muscle cells. This complex plays a crucial role in maintaining muscle integrity by linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. SGCZ interacts with other sarcoglycans, including α-, β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycans, to form a stable subcomplex within the DGC. In striated muscle, the major sarcoglycan complex includes α-, β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycans, while in vascular smooth muscle, it consists of ε-, β-, δ-, and ζ-sarcoglycans (Valera2021Essential).

SGCZ is related to γ- and δ-sarcoglycans and is involved in maintaining membrane stability. Mutations in other sarcoglycan genes can lead to reduced expression of SGCZ, suggesting its indirect role in membrane instability associated with muscular dystrophies (Valera2021Essential). SGCZ also interacts with β-sarcoglycan (SGCB) and δ-sarcoglycan (SGCD), with molecular docking analyses revealing specific residues involved in these interactions. The substitution of serine at position 204 with proline in SGCB can disrupt these interactions, highlighting the importance of SGCZ in the structural stability of the sarcoglycan complex (Tariq2021Whole).
