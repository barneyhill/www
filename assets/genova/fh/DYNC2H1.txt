# DYNC2H1

## Overview
The DYNC2H1 gene encodes the dynein cytoplasmic 2 heavy chain 1 protein, a critical component of the dynein-2 motor complex involved in retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) within cilia. This protein is categorized as a motor protein, characterized by its ATPase activity, which powers the movement of the dynein complex along microtubules. The DYNC2H1 protein plays a vital role in maintaining ciliary function and structure, impacting various cellular processes, including the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is crucial for bone development (Schmidts2013Exome; Vig2020DYNC2H1). Mutations in the DYNC2H1 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, such as Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy and short-rib polydactyly syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in skeletal development and disease (Schmidts2013Exome; Antony2021Ciliary).

## Structure
The DYNC2H1 protein is a large motor protein involved in cellular processes, with a primary structure consisting of 4314 amino acid residues (Schmidts2013Exome). Its secondary structure includes several conserved domains, although specific details on alpha helices and beta sheets are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure of DYNC2H1 is modeled based on the resolved crystal structure of the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain of *Dictyostelium discoideum*, with amino acid residues 1204-2969 modeled with confidence (Schmidts2013Exome).

DYNC2H1 contains six AAA+ domains (AAA1-AAA6) that form a hexameric ring-like ATP-hydrolyzing motor domain, essential for its function. These domains are located at specific amino acid positions: AAA1 (1651-1875), AAA2 (1938-2161), AAA3 (2251-2505), AAA4 (2617-2863), AAA5 (3244-3479), and AAA6 (3697-3912) (Schmidts2013Exome). The protein also includes a microtubule-binding stalk domain between AAA4 and AAA5 (2881-3227), an N-terminal tail (DHC_N1, 234-676), a linker domain, and a conserved C-terminal domain (Schmidts2013Exome).

The quaternary structure is not explicitly described, but the protein's function as a motor suggests it may form complexes with other proteins (Schmidts2013Exome). The DYNC2H1 protein is part of the dynein-2 complex, which includes homodimers of DYNC2H1 heavy chains and other associated proteins (Schmidts2013Exome).

## Function
The DYNC2H1 gene encodes a protein that is a key component of the dynein-2 motor complex, which is essential for retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) within cilia. This process is crucial for the maintenance and function of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of cells involved in cell signaling and movement (Schmidts2013Exome; Vig2020DYNC2H1). The DYNC2H1 protein contains several domains, including six AAA+ domains that form a hexameric ring-like ATP-hydrolyzing motor domain, which is responsible for its ATPase activity. This activity powers the movement of the dynein complex along microtubules, facilitating intracellular transport (Schmidts2013Exome).

In healthy human cells, DYNC2H1 is involved in the transport of intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins from the ciliary tip to the base, a process necessary for ciliogenesis and the regulation of various cell signaling events, including the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is important for bone development (Schmidts2013Exome). The protein's activity is particularly important in photoreceptor cells, where it maintains the function and survival of these cells by facilitating the transport of proteins like IFT88 (Vig2020DYNC2H1). Mutations in DYNC2H1 can disrupt these processes, leading to various ciliopathies and skeletal abnormalities (Schmidts2013Exome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DYNC2H1 gene are associated with several skeletal ciliopathies, including Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD) and short-rib polydactyly syndrome (SRPS). These conditions are characterized by skeletal abnormalities such as a narrow thorax, shortened ribs, and, in some cases, polydactyly. JATD, also known as Jeune syndrome, often presents with respiratory difficulties due to the narrow chest and can include renal, liver, and retinal disease, although these are less common in cases caused by DYNC2H1 mutations (Schmidts2013Exome). SRPS is considered a more severe form, often lethal in utero or during the neonatal period, while JATD may allow for survival beyond the neonatal period (Antony2021Ciliary).

DYNC2H1 mutations are also linked to short-rib thoracic dysplasia 3 (SRTD3), a condition characterized by shortened limbs, a narrow thorax, and sometimes polydactyly. This condition is part of a group of genetically heterogeneous skeletal dysplasias that follow an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (Chen2023Genetic; Fang2023Genetic). The mutations in DYNC2H1 often involve conserved amino acids and are predicted to be damaging, affecting the protein's function in ciliary intraflagellar transport (Dagoneau2009DYNC2H1).

## Interactions
DYNC2H1 is a central component of the dynein-2 complex, which is crucial for retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) in cilia. This protein interacts with several other components of the dynein-2 complex, including the light intermediate chain DYNC2LI1 and intermediate chain DYNC2I1, as well as dynein light chains such as DYNLL1/LC8 and DYNLT1/TCTEX1 (Schmidts2013Exome). The interaction with these proteins is essential for the stability and function of the dynein-2 complex, which facilitates the transport of IFT particles from the ciliary tip to the base (Vuolo2018Dynein2).

DYNC2H1 also interacts with microtubules through its microtubule-binding stalk domain, which is part of its motor function. This interaction is critical for the protein's role in microtubule-based motility, allowing it to facilitate movement along these structures (Schmidts2013Exome). The protein's structural domains, including six AAA+ domains, form a hexameric ring-like ATP-hydrolyzing motor domain that supports its interaction with microtubules (Schmidts2013Exome).

These interactions are vital for the proper assembly, function, and maintenance of cilia, impacting processes such as ciliogenesis and cell signaling pathways like the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is important for bone development (Schmidts2013Exome).
