# RAB3B

## Overview
RAB3B is a gene that encodes a member of the RAS oncogene family, specifically a small GTPase protein involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking. The RAB3B protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of exocytosis, particularly in the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells, and is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis. It is predominantly expressed in human islets and epithelial cells, where it contributes to the development of polarized cellular phenotypes and hormone exocytosis. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as microtubule-binding proteins and motor proteins, underscore its involvement in membrane trafficking and organelle movement. Additionally, RAB3B has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with poor prognosis and drug resistance, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Yao2024Rab3B; Weber1994Expression; Tsunedomi2022Elevated; Piper2010In).

## Function
RAB3B is a member of the RAS oncogene family, encoding a small GTPase protein involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking. In healthy human cells, RAB3B plays a crucial role in regulating exocytosis, particularly in the release of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells. It is predominantly expressed in human islets, where it is localized to the cytoplasm of beta-cells during both fetal and adult stages, suggesting its significant role in insulin secretion (Piper2010In). Unlike other RAB family members, RAB3B is not redundant in its function and is linked to a genetic locus associated with glucose intolerance and diabetes, indicating its potential importance in metabolic regulation (Piper2010In).

RAB3B is also expressed in epithelial cells, where it is targeted to the apical pole near junctional complexes. This localization suggests that RAB3B regulates the traffic of apical and/or junctional proteins, contributing to the development of the polarized phenotype in epithelial tissues (Weber1994Expression). In the anterior pituitary, RAB3B is essential for gonadotrophin release in response to gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), highlighting its role in hormone exocytosis (Tasaka1998Rab3B).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RAB3B gene have been implicated in various cancers. Elevated RAB3B expression is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive cancer features in several types of cancer, including lung adenocarcinoma, where it correlates with poor overall survival, lymph node metastasis, and advanced tumor stage (Yao2024Rab3B). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RAB3B is linked to chemoresistance and metastatic potential, with its expression elevated in cancer stem-like cells and associated with shorter recurrence-free periods (Tsunedomi2022Elevated). Knockdown of RAB3B in HCC cells reduces sphere formation and increases drug susceptibility, suggesting its role in drug resistance (Tsunedomi2022Elevated).

In hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC), RAB3B contributes to cisplatin resistance by inducing autophagy. Its expression is significantly upregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells, and knockdown of RAB3B enhances chemosensitivity (Lin2022Encoding). The gene is also implicated in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment through increased exosome release, which may facilitate metastasis (Tsunedomi2022Elevated).

These findings suggest that RAB3B plays a critical role in cancer progression and could serve as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a target for therapeutic intervention (Liu2024Pancancer).

## Interactions
Rab3B, a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In NIH 3T3 cells, Rab3B interacts with Gas8, a microtubule-binding protein. This interaction is specific to the GTP-bound form of Rab3B and is mediated by the N-terminal coiled-coil domains of Gas8. The interaction suggests a role for Rab3B in linking microtubules to membrane trafficking and organelle movement, particularly at the Golgi apparatus (Nishimura2008Interaction).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma, Rab3B interacts with DDX6, a protein with oncogenic roles. Rab3B enhances the stability of DDX6 by preventing its degradation, which contributes to the aggressive phenotype of non-small cell lung cancer cells. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, and the stability of DDX6 is shown to be dependent on Rab3B (Yao2024Rab3B).

Rab3B is also known to interact with myosin Va, a motor protein involved in intracellular transport, as part of a broader network of Rab proteins coordinating with myosin motors to regulate processes like exocytosis and vesicle recycling (Kjos2018Rab).
