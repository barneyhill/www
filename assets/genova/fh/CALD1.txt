# CALD1

## Overview
The CALD1 gene encodes caldesmon 1, a multifunctional actin- and calmodulin-binding protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Caldesmon 1 is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein and is involved in modulating actin-myosin interactions, which are essential for muscle contraction and cellular motility. The gene is located on human chromosome 7q33 and produces two main isoforms, H-caldesmon and L-caldesmon, through alternative splicing. These isoforms differ in their expression patterns, with H-caldesmon predominantly found in smooth muscle cells and L-caldesmon in non-muscle cells. Caldesmon 1's interactions with actin, myosin, and tropomyosin are crucial for stabilizing actin filaments and maintaining cellular structural integrity. The protein's function is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its binding properties and, consequently, its role in muscle contraction and actin dynamics (Yao2021Caldesmon:; Kokate2022Caldesmon).

## Structure
Caldesmon 1 (CALD1) is an actin-binding protein with two main isoforms, H-caldesmon and L-caldesmon, produced through alternative splicing of the CALD1 gene located on human chromosome 7q33 (Yao2021Caldesmon:). The isoforms differ primarily in a ~250 residue region present in H-caldesmon, which is absent in L-caldesmon (Kokate2022Caldesmon). 

Structurally, caldesmon contains distinct N-terminal and C-terminal domains, as well as a middle region. The N-terminal domain binds myosin and calmodulin, while the C-terminal domain contains actin-binding sites, calmodulin sites, and tropomyosin-binding sites (Yao2021Caldesmon:). The middle region, specific to H-caldesmon, includes a long α-helix that separates the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, aligning with the spatial arrangement of myosin molecules in smooth muscle (Yao2021Caldesmon:).

Caldesmon's function is regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which affects its binding to actin and calmodulin, influencing muscle contraction and actin dynamics (Yao2021Caldesmon:). The protein acts as a dynamic crosslinker between myosin-II and tropomyosin-actin filaments, maintaining regular myosin-II spacing within these bundles (Kokate2022Caldesmon).

## Function
Caldesmon, encoded by the CALD1 gene, is a calmodulin- and actin-binding protein that plays a significant role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton in both smooth muscle and non-muscle cells. In smooth muscle cells, caldesmon is involved in modulating actin-myosin interactions, which are crucial for muscle contraction and relaxation (Hayashi1992Genomic; Alnuaimi2023Immunohistochemical). The protein exists in two isoforms: high molecular weight caldesmon (h-CaD), predominantly found in smooth muscle cells, and low molecular weight caldesmon (l-CaD), which is more common in non-muscle cells (Hayashi1992Genomic; Alnuaimi2023Immunohistochemical).

Caldesmon's interaction with actin, myosin, and tropomyosin is essential for stabilizing actin filaments and maintaining cellular structural integrity. This interaction helps regulate cell motility, shape, and division by influencing cytoskeletal dynamics (Paule2010Proteomic; Alnuaimi2023Immunohistochemical). In non-muscle cells, caldesmon contributes to stable cell adhesion through focal adhesions, which are less dynamic compared to the podosomes found in transformed cells (Alnuaimi2023Immunohistochemical). This function is crucial for maintaining normal cell adhesion and motility, contrasting with its role in cancer cells, where it is associated with increased motility and metastasis (Alnuaimi2023Immunohistochemical).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CALD1 gene, which encodes caldesmon 1, have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer, the low molecular weight isoform l-caldesmon (l-CaD) is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This upregulation is associated with increased metastatic properties and resistance to chemoradiotherapy, particularly to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Kim2012Upregulated). CALD1 expression is also linked to poor prognosis in colorectal cancer, with higher levels correlating with early tumor stages and potential resistance to therapy (Alnuaimi2023Immunohistochemical).

In ovarian cancer, CALD1 is upregulated in platinum-resistant cases, contributing to poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance. Its expression is associated with advanced stages and venous invasion, suggesting a role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Li2024Upregulation).

CALD1 is also identified as a significant gene in cardiovascular diseases, particularly heart failure, where it is associated with various mutations. These mutations, including missense and splice variants, may impact the gene's function in smooth muscle contraction and contribute to disease pathology (Mhatre2023Functional).

## Interactions
Caldesmon 1 (CALD1) is an actin- and calmodulin-binding protein that plays a significant role in regulating actin-myosin interactions and stabilizing actin filaments. It interacts with several proteins, including actin, myosin, tropomyosin, and calmodulin, which are crucial for its function in muscle contraction and cellular motility processes (Hai2006Caldesmon). CALD1 competes with the Arp2/3 complex for binding to actin, thereby inhibiting actin nucleation and podosome formation. This competitive interaction is crucial for its role in repressing podosome formation in transformed and cancer cells (Morita2007Changes).

Phosphorylation of CALD1 by p21-activated kinases (PAK1 and PAK2) enhances its inhibitory effect on podosome formation by increasing its competition with the Arp2/3 complex for actin binding (Morita2007Changes). CALD1 also interacts with other proteins such as filamin and cofilin, affecting actin-myosin interactions and stabilizing actin filaments (Morita2007Changes). These interactions highlight CALD1's role in cytoskeletal remodeling and its potential impact on cellular processes involving actin dynamics. In cancer cells, CALD1 acts as a suppressor of invasion by regulating the formation of podosomes and invadopodia, structures involved in cell invasion (Yoshio2007Caldesmon).
