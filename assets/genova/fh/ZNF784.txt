# ZNF784

## Overview
ZNF784 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 784, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its DNA-binding capabilities. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a critical role in the regulation of gene expression by interacting with specific DNA sequences. The zinc finger motifs within ZNF784 facilitate these interactions, allowing it to influence transcriptional processes mediated by RNA polymerase II. The protein is also associated with non-canonical transcription factor motifs, suggesting alternative DNA-binding configurations that may contribute to its regulatory functions. ZNF784 has been implicated in environmental response mechanisms, particularly in relation to altered methylation patterns observed in smokers, and may be involved in cancer-related pathways, underscoring its significance in cellular processes and potential clinical relevance (Ali2023Carcinogenesis; Dogan2019A; Sastre2023Inactive; Jenkins2017Cigarette).

## Structure
ZNF784 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capabilities. These domains typically consist of a sequence rich in cysteine and histidine residues, which coordinate with zinc ions to stabilize the protein's structure (Dogan2019A). The primary structure of ZNF784 includes these zinc finger motifs, which are common in transcription factors and facilitate specific interactions with DNA sequences.

The secondary structure of ZNF784 likely includes β-sheets and α-helices, which are typical of zinc finger proteins. These structural elements contribute to the formation of the zinc finger motifs, allowing the protein to interact with DNA in a sequence-specific manner (Dogan2019A). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a stable configuration, often stabilized by the presence of zinc ions, which is a hallmark of zinc finger proteins.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination may occur, influencing the protein's function and localization within the cell (Dogan2019A). However, specific details on the quaternary structure of ZNF784 are not available, as zinc finger proteins generally do not form quaternary structures.

## Function
ZNF784 is a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcription factor, playing a role in the regulation of gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. It is involved in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, which suggests its participation in blocking transcriptional machinery in healthy human cells (Sastre2023Inactive). The protein is also associated with non-canonical transcription factor motifs, which are distinct from canonical motifs and may represent alternative DNA-binding configurations or functions. These non-canonical motifs are found in gene promoters and regulatory sequences, indicating a potential role in transcriptional regulation (ChumpitazDiaz2021Systematic).

ZNF784 has been identified in various studies as having altered methylation patterns in smokers, suggesting its involvement in environmental response mechanisms (Jenkins2017Cigarette). Although its specific role in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, the presence of ZNF784 in transcriptional regulation and its potential involvement in cancer-related pathways highlight its importance in cellular processes (Ali2023Carcinogenesis). The protein's activity is likely crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and responding to environmental changes.
