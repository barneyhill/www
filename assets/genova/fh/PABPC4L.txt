# PABPC4L

## Overview
The PABPC4L gene encodes the poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 4-like, a protein that plays a crucial role in mRNA metabolism, particularly in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation. This protein is characterized by the presence of four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are essential for its binding to mRNA molecules, a feature typical of cytoplasmic type I polyadenylate-binding proteins. PABPC4L is predominantly localized in the nucleus under normal conditions but relocates to stress granules in response to oxidative stress, indicating its involvement in cellular stress responses. The protein is expressed at varying levels in different regions of the brain, with higher expression in the hindbrain, suggesting a potential role in brain function, particularly in motor control and coordination. Mutations in the PABPC4L gene, such as the stop-gain variant p.R271X, have been associated with atypical parkinsonian disorder, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative diseases (Aslam2019Segregation).

## Function
The PABPC4L gene encodes the Poly(A) binding protein, cytoplasmic 4-like, which is involved in mRNA metabolism, particularly in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation. In healthy human cells, the PABPC4L protein predominantly localizes to the nucleus and associates with RasGAP SH3 domain Binding Protein (G3BP)-labeled cytoplasmic granules in response to oxidative stress. This suggests that PABPC4L plays a role in the cellular stress response, potentially by minimizing stress-related RNA damage and promoting cell survival (Aslam2019Segregation).

The PABPC4L protein contains four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are crucial for its function. These motifs are typical of cytoplasmic type I polyadenylate-binding proteins and are essential for binding to mRNA molecules. The protein is expressed at higher levels in the hindbrain, particularly in the cerebellum, and at moderate levels in the midbrain and forebrain, indicating a potential role in brain function, especially in regions associated with motor control and coordination (Aslam2019Segregation).

The intact PABPC4L protein is important for proper nuclear import or retention, which may be critical for its function in healthy cells. Disruption in its localization can lead to a uniform nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution, affecting its normal cellular functions (Aslam2019Segregation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PABPC4L gene have been linked to a rare familial form of atypical parkinsonian disorder (APD). A specific heterozygous stop-gain variant, c.C811T; p.R271X, has been identified in a family with this disorder, co-segregating with the disease and suggesting a genetic basis for the condition (Aslam2019Segregation). This variant results in a truncated protein that mislocalizes within the cell, failing to associate with stress granules in response to oxidative stress, unlike the wild-type protein. This mislocalization and altered stress granule association may contribute to the pathogenesis of APD in the affected family (Aslam2019Segregation).

The PABPC4L variant affects the protein's subcellular localization, with the truncated variant showing a uniform nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution, suggesting impaired nuclear import or retention. This alteration impacts the protein's ability to localize to stress granules, indicating potential functional disruptions that may underlie the observed neurological symptoms (Aslam2019Segregation). The study highlights the potential clinical significance of the PABPC4L variant in the development of atypical parkinsonism, emphasizing its role in the neurodegenerative process observed in the studied family (Aslam2019Segregation).

## Interactions
The PABPC4L protein is involved in interactions with other proteins and cellular structures, particularly in response to cellular stress. It is known to associate with RasGAP SH3 domain Binding Protein (G3BP)-labeled cytoplasmic granules, which are part of the stress granule (SG) pathways. These stress granules are cytoplasmic foci that form in response to cellular stress, playing a role in minimizing RNA damage and promoting cell survival (Aslam2019Segregation). The wild-type PABPC4L protein predominantly localizes to the cell nucleus but relocates to these stress granules under oxidative stress conditions, indicating a dynamic interaction with these cellular structures (Aslam2019Segregation).

The study of a rare stop-gain variant (p.R271X) in the PABPC4L gene revealed that the truncated protein resulting from this mutation does not localize to stress granules, suggesting a disruption in its normal interactions and functions. This mislocalization implies that the variant may impair the protein's ability to participate in stress granule formation and function, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of atypical parkinsonian disorder in the affected family (Aslam2019Segregation). The interactions of PABPC4L with stress granules highlight its role in cellular stress responses and its potential involvement in neurodegenerative processes (Aslam2019Segregation).
