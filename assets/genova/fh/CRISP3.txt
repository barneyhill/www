# CRISP3

## Overview
CRISP3, or cysteine-rich secretory protein 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP) family, which is characterized by a conserved cysteine-rich domain. The CRISP3 protein is involved in various physiological processes, particularly within the immune and reproductive systems. It is categorized as a secretory protein and is known for its role in modulating immune responses and contributing to reproductive functions. CRISP3 is expressed in neutrophils and exocrine secretions such as saliva and seminal plasma, where it may influence matrix degradation and sperm maturation (Gibbs2008The; Udby2002An). The protein's structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds and glycosylation, which are crucial for its interactions with other proteins, such as α1B-glycoprotein and β-microseminoprotein (Udby2010Human; Volpert2014Eukaryotic). Alterations in CRISP3 expression have been linked to various diseases, including prostate cancer and autoimmune conditions, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Gibbs2008The; Pathak2018Androgen).

## Structure
CRISP3 is a member of the cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP) family, characterized by a conserved cysteine-rich domain. The protein consists of a C-terminal CRISP domain, which includes an ion-channel regulatory (ICR) region and a hinge region linking it to the N-terminal CAP domain (Gibbs2008The; Anklesaria2016Purification). The CRISP domain contains ten conserved cysteine residues forming five disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's structural stability (Gibbs2008The; Volpert2014Eukaryotic). 

CRISP3 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation. In humans, CRISP3 is glycosylated at N220 within the CRISP domain, while in mice, glycosylation occurs at N99 and N113 in the CAP domain (Volpert2014Eukaryotic). This glycosylation is significant for protein stability and function, affecting interactions with binding partners such as alpha-1-B glycoprotein (A1BG) and prostate secretory protein of 94 amino acids (PSP94) (Volpert2014Eukaryotic; Anklesaria2016Purification). 

The molecular mass of CRISP3 varies due to glycosylation, with the glycosylated form being approximately 28 kDa and the non-glycosylated form around 26 kDa (Anklesaria2016Purification). The protein's tertiary structure is maintained by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for its functional interactions (Volpert2014Eukaryotic).

## Function
CRISP3 (cysteine-rich secretory protein 3) is involved in various molecular processes, primarily within the immune and reproductive systems. In the immune system, CRISP3 is expressed in neutrophils and is localized to secretory granules rich in matrix degradation proteins, suggesting a role in matrix degradation and innate immunity (Gibbs2008The; Udby2002An). It is also found in exocrine secretions such as saliva, plasma, and seminal plasma, where it may modulate immune responses (Udby2002An).

In the male reproductive system, CRISP3 is produced by the vas deferens and prostate, contributing to its presence in seminal plasma. It is associated with sperm, indicating a potential role in sperm maturation and function (Gibbs2008The; Udby2005Characterization). CRISP3 binds to dimeric β-microseminoprotein in seminal plasma, although the biological significance of this interaction is not fully understood (Gibbs2008The).

CRISP3 is also implicated in tissue remodeling, as its expression is regulated by androgen levels and is involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, particularly in the context of branching morphogenesis (Gibbs2008The). Despite these insights, the precise functions of CRISP3 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
CRISP3 is implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In prostate cancer, CRISP3 is significantly upregulated, with expression levels increasing 20-to-2000-fold in cancerous tissue compared to normal prostate tissue. This upregulation is associated with poor prognosis and lower recurrence-free probability, particularly in cases with PTEN deletions and ERG fusion-positive tumors (Gibbs2008The; Pathak2018Androgen; Grupp2013Cysteinerich). CRISP3 expression is regulated by androgen levels and the androgen receptor, and its promoter activity is influenced by histone acetylation and deacetylation (Pathak2018Androgen).

In mammary carcinoma, lower CRISP3 expression correlates with improved disease-free and overall survival. Knockdown of CRISP3 in certain mammary carcinoma cells reduces their migration and invasion abilities, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Wang2019Low).

CRISP3 is also involved in autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. In Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease affecting exocrine glands, women produce significantly less CRISP3, which may be linked to the disease's gender bias and hormonal changes (Gibbs2008The). In chronic pancreatitis, CRISP3 is upregulated in degenerating acinar cells, although the significance of this observation remains unclear (Gibbs2008The).

## Interactions
CRISP3, a cysteine-rich secretory protein, is known to participate in several protein-protein interactions. In human seminal plasma, CRISP3 forms stable, high-affinity complexes with β-microseminoprotein (MSP). This interaction is characterized by specific binding kinetics and is unaffected by the glycosylation status of CRISP3, indicating a highly specific interaction (Udby2005βMicroseminoprotein).

CRISP3 also interacts with prostate secretory protein of 94 amino acids (PSP94) in seminal plasma. This interaction is highly specific, with a high affinity and low dissociation rate, suggesting a significant role in seminal plasma function (Anklesaria2016Purification).

In human plasma, CRISP3 binds to α1B-glycoprotein (A1BG), forming non-covalent complexes. This interaction is conserved across species, as CRISP3 also binds A1BG in cow, horse, and rabbit sera. The binding is specific and requires the proper tertiary structure of CRISP3 (Udby2010Human; Volpert2014Eukaryotic).

These interactions suggest that CRISP3 may play roles in modulating immune functions and influencing reproductive processes. However, there is no evidence from the provided context that CRISP3 interacts with nucleic acids.
