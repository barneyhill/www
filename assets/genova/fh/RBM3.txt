# RBM3

## Overview
RBM3 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 3, a cold-inducible RNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, including RNA metabolism and stress response. The protein is characterized by an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and an Arginine-Glycine-rich (RGG) domain, which facilitate its interaction with mRNA, enhancing their stability and translation (Sayed2020RNA). RBM3 is predominantly located in the nucleus but can translocate to the cytoplasm under certain conditions, where it plays a crucial role in regulating gene transcription and posttranscriptional modifications (Zhu2016Coldinducible). It is implicated in cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis, particularly under stress conditions such as hypoxia and serum starvation (Wellmann2010The). Additionally, RBM3 is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and has been associated with various cancers, acting as a proto-oncogene in some contexts (Zhu2016Coldinducible; Chen2019RBM3). Its role in stabilizing mRNA and interacting with other RNA-binding proteins underscores its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease progression.

## Structure


## Function
RBM3 is an RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and survival, particularly under stress conditions such as serum starvation and hypoxia. In healthy human cells, RBM3 enhances cell survival by increasing protein synthesis, as evidenced by higher amino acid incorporation in HEK293 cells (Wellmann2010The). It is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it induces stemness by suppressing GSK3β kinase activity, thereby enhancing β-catenin signaling (Zhu2016Coldinducible). RBM3 also promotes cell cycle progression, specifically facilitating the G2/M transition, and inhibits apoptosis by repressing PARP cleavage and potentially inducing Bcl-2 expression (Zhu2016Coldinducible).

RBM3 is predominantly located in the nucleus, where it regulates gene transcription and binds to mRNA for posttranscriptional regulation. Its localization can shift between the nucleus and cytoplasm depending on the developmental stage and cell type (Zhu2016Coldinducible). The protein is also involved in stabilizing mRNA of certain genes, including COX-2, VEGF, and IL-8, by binding to AU-rich sequences in their 3' untranslated regions, thereby enhancing their stability and translation (Sureban2008Translation). This activity is crucial for maintaining cell integrity and survival under stress conditions (Wellmann2004Oxygenregulated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RBM3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it often acts as a proto-oncogene. In breast cancer, RBM3 is overexpressed and associated with lower overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates. Its expression correlates with lymph node metastasis and higher tumor grade, suggesting a role in cancer progression by promoting cell proliferation and metastasis (Chen2019RBM3). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RBM3 is upregulated and linked to larger tumor size and advanced grading, with a trend towards shorter overall survival in patients with high RBM3 expression (Miao2020Role; Dong2019The).

RBM3 also plays a role in colorectal cancer, where its overexpression leads to increased cell proliferation and survival, while its suppression results in decreased growth and increased apoptosis (Sureban2008Translation). In prostate cancer, RBM3 inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, reducing tumor growth in a bone microenvironment (Zhang2023RBM3). In muscle-invasive bladder cancer, RBM3 expression is associated with improved survival and may predict chemotherapy response (Wahlin2022Preclinical). These findings highlight RBM3's potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
RBM3 is an RNA binding protein that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA metabolism and stress response. It contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) at the N terminus and an Arginine-Glycine-rich (RGG) domain at the C terminus, which facilitate its association with mRNA, enhancing their stability and translation (Sayed2020RNA). RBM3 is known to interact with the 60S ribosomal subunit, promoting global protein translation and active polysome formation (Zhu2016Coldinducible).

RBM3 also interacts with the RNA-binding protein HuR, particularly in the stabilization and translation of mRNAs such as COX-2, IL-8, and VEGF. This interaction involves binding to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated region of these mRNAs, enhancing their stability and translation (Sureban2008Translation). The interaction between RBM3 and HuR has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid analysis and in vitro translation experiments (Sureban2008Translation).

In cancer cells, RBM3 is involved in modulating long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), such as lnc-Flii-1 and lnc-LSAMP-3, which are implicated in cancer cell migration and angiogenesis (Sayed2020RNA). RBM3's interactions with these lncRNAs and mRNAs contribute to tumor progression by enhancing mRNA translation of transcripts involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness (Sayed2020RNA).
