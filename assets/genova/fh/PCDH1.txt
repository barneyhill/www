# PCDH1

## Overview
Protocadherin-1 (PCDH1) is a gene that encodes the protocadherin 1 protein, a member of the cadherin superfamily, which is primarily involved in cell-cell adhesion processes. The protein is characterized by its seven extracellular cadherin repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with conserved motifs, which facilitate its role in homophilic adhesion and cellular signaling (Modak2019Identification). Protocadherin 1 is predominantly expressed in bronchial epithelial cells, where it contributes to maintaining epithelial barrier integrity and modulating signaling pathways such as TGF-β and NF-κB (Ye2022PCDH1; Faura2016Protocadherin1). The gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including asthma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, where its expression levels and interactions with other proteins influence disease progression and prognosis (Du2023PCDH1; Koppelman2009Identification).

## Structure
Protocadherin-1 (PCDH1) is a protein characterized by its molecular structure, which includes seven extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with three conserved motifs (CM1-CM3) (Modak2019Identification). The EC repeats are arranged in tandem and exhibit a typical cadherin fold consisting of seven β-strands, forming a Greek-key motif (Modak2019Identification). 

The tertiary structure of PCDH1 involves the folding of these EC repeats to facilitate homophilic adhesion, which is mediated by an antiparallel overlapped dimer interface involving the EC1-4 repeats (Modak2019Identification). This interaction is calcium-dependent, with calcium ions coordinated by conserved motifs in the linker regions between the EC repeats (Modak2019Identification).

PCDH1 can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, and its dimerization is independent of disulfide bonds (Modak2019Identification). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at specific residues, although the functional role of these modifications is not fully understood (Modak2019Identification).

PCDH1 also exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with isoforms differing in the length of their cytoplasmic domains (Faura2015Protocadherin1; Redies2008Expression). These structural features are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and its involvement in respiratory diseases.

## Function
Protocadherin-1 (PCDH1) is primarily expressed in bronchial epithelial cells and plays a significant role in maintaining epithelial barrier function and cell-cell adhesion. Although its adhesion properties are considered weak, PCDH1 contributes to the acquisition and maintenance of the bronchial epithelial barrier. Knockdown of PCDH1 in bronchial epithelial cells results in delayed and reduced build-up of electrical resistance, indicating compromised barrier function, which is crucial for protecting against environmental insults (Faura2016Protocadherin1).

PCDH1 interacts with SMAD3, a signaling intermediate in the TGF-β signaling pathway, to modulate TGF-β-induced gene transcription. This interaction suppresses SMAD3 transcriptional activity, thereby reducing the sensitivity of cells to TGF-β-driven gene expression. This regulatory role impacts processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix production (Faura2015Protocadherin1).

PCDH1 is localized at cell-cell contact sites in bronchial epithelial cells, specifically at the lateral border and basal to adherens and tight junctions. Its expression increases during mucociliary differentiation, suggesting its involvement in epithelial repair and differentiation (Faura2016Protocadherin1). The gene's role in epithelial integrity is significant, as its dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma and other atopic diseases (Faura2016Protocadherin1).

## Clinical Significance
PCDH1 (protocadherin 1) has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), high expression of PCDH1 is associated with poor prognosis, including reduced overall survival and disease-free survival. This overexpression is linked to cancer cell metastasis and is considered a poor prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for PAAD. The gene's expression is influenced by DNA methylation, genetic alterations, and miRNA regulation, with hypo-methylation at specific CpG sites correlating with higher expression levels (Du2023PCDH1).

In asthma, PCDH1 is identified as a susceptibility gene for bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), a key feature of the disease. Variants of PCDH1, such as SNP rs3797054, have been associated with BHR across multiple populations. PCDH1 interacts with SMAD3, modulating TGF-β signaling, which is crucial in asthma pathogenesis. Alterations in PCDH1 expression can affect airway epithelial repair and differentiation, contributing to asthma development (Faura2015Protocadherin1; Koppelman2009Identification).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of PCDH1 in both cancer and respiratory diseases, suggesting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
Protocadherin-1 (PCDH1) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. PCDH1 interacts with SMAD3, a key protein in the TGF-β signaling pathway. This interaction has been shown to suppress TGF-β1-induced gene transcription. PCDH1 isoforms 1 and 2 both bind to SMAD3, with isoform 1 demonstrating a stronger interaction. These interactions have been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screens and co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells, as well as in endogenous protein levels in 16HBE cells, a bronchial epithelial cell line (Faura2015Protocadherin1).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), PCDH1 interacts with KPNB1, a nuclear transporter. This interaction facilitates the nuclear import of p65, a component of the NF-κB pathway, thereby activating NF-κB signaling. This activation is crucial for cancer progression, as it enhances PDAC cell proliferation, migration, and the acquisition of cancer stem cell phenotypes. The interaction between PCDH1 and KPNB1 has been validated through mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Ye2022PCDH1). These interactions highlight PCDH1's role in modulating key signaling pathways in both asthma and cancer contexts.
