# PLAC1

## Overview
PLAC1 (placenta-specific 1) is a gene that encodes a membrane-associated protein predominantly expressed in the placenta, known as placenta enriched 1. This protein plays a critical role in placental development, particularly in the process of trophoblast syncytialization, which is essential for the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast layer involved in nutrient exchange and hormone production at the maternal-fetal interface (Chang2016PLAC1; Fant2010PLAC1). The PLAC1 protein is characterized by its structural features, including a significant number of cysteine residues and potential post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its function and localization (Fant2006The; Nazari2017Optimized). Beyond its physiological role, PLAC1 is implicated in various cancers, where its aberrant expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Dong2008Plac1; Mahmoudian2019PLAC1:).

## Structure
The PLAC1 protein is a membrane-associated protein with a significant number of cysteine residues, which are likely involved in disulfide bond formation, contributing to its structural stability (Nazari2017Optimized). The secondary structure of PLAC1 is composed of approximately 11.2% alpha-helix, 53% beta-sheet and turn, and 35.8% random structures, as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Nazari2017Optimized). The protein's tertiary structure has been modeled using the i-TASSER program, which predicted a 3D structure with a C-score of 0.94 and a TM-score of 0.60 ± 0.14, indicating high confidence in the model (Nazari2017Optimized).

PLAC1 shares homology with the ZP-N subdomain of the zona pellucida 3 (ZP3) protein, suggesting a potential role in polymerization similar to other ZP domain proteins (Jovine2006The). The protein is also associated with the microvillous membrane surface of the syncytiotrophoblast, indicating its localization in specific cellular compartments (Fant2006The). PLAC1 contains four putative O-glycosylation sites and five potential phosphorylation sites, suggesting it may undergo post-translational modifications that could affect its function and localization (Fant2006The).

## Function
PLAC1 (placenta enriched 1) is a gene that encodes a protein primarily expressed in the placenta, playing a crucial role in placental development and function. The PLAC1 protein is involved in the process of trophoblast syncytialization, where cytotrophoblast cells fuse to form the multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (STB) layer, essential for nutrient exchange and hormone production in the placenta (Chang2016PLAC1). PLAC1 is highly expressed in the villous STB layer and is associated with the microvillous brush border membranes, indicating its role in cell differentiation and function at the maternal-fetal interface (Massabbal2005PLAC1; Fant2010PLAC1).

The protein is membrane-associated, found in the microsomal fraction, which includes the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus (Fant2010PLAC1). PLAC1 expression is regulated by growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF-7) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), which stimulate its expression through MAP kinase and PI-3 kinase-dependent pathways (Massabbal2005PLAC1). This regulation suggests that PLAC1 may have a receptor-like function, facilitating interactions at the maternal-fetal interface, crucial for placental and fetal development (Massabbal2005PLAC1).

## Clinical Significance
PLAC1 (placenta-specific 1) is implicated in various cancers, where its expression is often upregulated, contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PLAC1 mRNA is present in 32% of samples, and its protein expression is confirmed in 23.3% of cases. It also elicits an antibody response in 3.8% of HCC patients, indicating its immunogenicity (Dong2008Plac1). In colorectal cancer, PLAC1 is associated with poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas and advanced TNM stages, correlating with lymph node metastasis (Mahmoudian2019PLAC1:). High PLAC1 expression in colon cancer is linked to advanced clinical stages and poorer prognosis, serving as an independent prognostic factor (Ren2020High).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), PLAC1 is associated with more invasive tumor behavior and a noninflamed tumor microenvironment, negatively affecting immune cell infiltration and overall survival (Meng2022Plac1). PLAC1 expression is also linked to poor prognosis in gastric, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, where it is associated with aggressive tumor characteristics (Mahmoudian2019PLAC1:). The gene's expression is regulated by factors such as mutant Tp53 and estrogen receptor alpha, influencing its role in cancer progression (Mahmoudian2019PLAC1:).

## Interactions
PLAC1 (placenta enriched 1) is known to participate in several significant protein interactions that influence cellular processes. One of the primary interactions of PLAC1 is with Furin, a type I transmembrane protein. This interaction has been shown to play a crucial role in the progression of certain cancers, such as breast cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In breast cancer, the interaction between PLAC1 and Furin promotes the degradation of Notch1, leading to the generation of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD), which subsequently inhibits PTEN activity. This signaling cascade, known as the Furin/NICD/PTEN axis, is implicated in cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Li2018Cancertestis).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, PLAC1's interaction with Furin enhances the activation of the Notch signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This interaction is associated with the upregulation of proteins such as NICD, P-Akt, MMP2, and MMP9, while downregulating PTEN and E-Cadherin (Lin2021Plac1).

PLAC1 also interacts with Desmoglein-2 (DSG2), a component of the desmosomal complex, which is crucial for cell-to-cell communication. This interaction is dependent on the intact ZP-N domain of PLAC1, and mutations in this domain can disrupt the interaction, affecting cell-cell junctions and potentially influencing cancer cell invasiveness (Chen2021PLAC1).
