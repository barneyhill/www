# CACNB2

## Overview
The CACNB2 gene encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit beta 2, a critical component of voltage-gated calcium channels. These channels are integral membrane proteins that facilitate the influx of calcium ions in response to membrane depolarization, playing a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. The beta 2 subunit, categorized as a membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein, is characterized by conserved domains such as the Src homology 3 (SH3) and guanylate kinase (GK) domains, which are essential for protein-protein interactions and channel assembly, respectively (Rima2016Protein). The CACNB2 gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct functional properties and expression patterns (Foell2004Molecular; Breitenkamp2014Rare). These isoforms modulate the activity of calcium channels, influencing cellular processes and contributing to the gene's involvement in various clinical conditions, including cardiac and neurological disorders (Vuori2019CACNB2; Buraei2013Structure).

## Structure
The CACNB2 gene encodes the beta-2 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, which are part of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein family. The protein structure includes several conserved domains, such as the Src homology 3 (SH3) and guanylate kinase (GK) domains, connected by a HOOK domain. The SH3 domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the GK domain plays a role in channel assembly by binding to the α1-interaction domain (AID) of the CaV α1 subunit (Rima2016Protein).

The CACNB2 gene undergoes extensive alternative splicing, resulting in multiple splice variants, including CaV β2a, CaV β2b, CaV β2c, CaV β2d, and CaV β2e. These variants exhibit different expression profiles and functional properties, such as varying inactivation kinetics (Foell2004Molecular; Breitenkamp2014Rare). The primary structure of these isoforms is characterized by variable N- and C-termini, with the core region consisting of the SH3 and GK domains (Rima2016Protein).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the function of the beta-2 subunit, contributing to its role in modulating calcium channel activity (Ebert2008The). The quaternary structure involves the interaction of the beta-2 subunit with other channel subunits, influencing the overall channel function (Rima2016Protein).

## Function
The CACNB2 gene encodes the beta-2 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, which are crucial for modulating calcium ion influx in response to membrane depolarization. This subunit plays a significant role in the regulation of calcium channel activity, influencing various cellular processes such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression (Buraei2013Structure). In the heart, the CaVβ2 subunit is essential for proper cardiac development and function. It is the predominant CaVβ subunit in the heart, particularly the CaVβ2b variant, and is critical during development, as its absence results in prenatal death due to lack of cardiac contractions (Buraei2013Structure).

CaVβ2 is involved in excitation-transcription coupling by interacting with signaling pathways like the MAPK/ERK pathway, which induces CREB-directed gene expression in neuronal cells (Vergnol2022New). It also plays a role in regulating cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by modulating calcium currents and influencing the activity of pro-hypertrophic proteases and their inhibitors (Vergnol2022New). The subunit is primarily active in the plasma membrane, where it enhances the surface expression and open probability of calcium channels, thereby increasing calcium currents (Buraei2013Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CACNB2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of diabetic retinopathy, particularly proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), the CACNB2 gene has been identified as a susceptibility gene in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Two missense mutations, R476C and S502L, were found to be associated with a faster progression to PDR, affecting protein function and potentially influencing the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is crucial for angiogenesis and diabetic retinal neovascularization (Vuori2019CACNB2).

In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), rare mutations in CACNB2 have been identified, suggesting a role in the pathophysiology of ASD. These mutations, such as p.Arg70Cys, p.G167S, p.S197F, and p.F240L, alter the function of calcium channels by affecting inactivation kinetics, which may contribute to the disorder. The gene has been identified as a risk locus for several major psychiatric disorders, including ASD, and is associated with conditions like intellectual disability and precocious puberty (Graziano2020A; Breitenkamp2014Rare).

CACNB2 is also linked to other conditions, such as Brugada syndrome, sudden cardiac death syndrome with arrhythmia, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, and migraine, highlighting its broad clinical significance (Vuori2019CACNB2).

## Interactions
The CACNB2 gene encodes the CaVβ2 subunit, which is a component of voltage-gated calcium channels. This subunit interacts with the α1 subunit of the channel, playing a crucial role in modulating channel trafficking and gating properties. The interaction between the CaVβ2 subunit and the α1 subunit involves specific domains, such as the guanylate kinase (GK) domain of the CaVβ2 subunit and the alpha interaction domain (AID) of the α1 subunit, which stabilizes the functional conformation of the channel (Soldatov2015CACNB2:; Ebert2008The).

The CaVβ2 subunit also interacts with calmodulin (CaM), a calcium-binding messenger protein. This interaction is important for calcium-dependent inactivation and transcriptional activation of the channel. The presence of CaM can restore channel activity in the absence of CaV subunits, suggesting a significant role in modulating channel function (Soldatov2015CACNB2:).

Additionally, the CaVβ2 subunit is involved in oligomerization, forming homo- and hetero-oligomers, which can enhance current density and alter voltage-dependence and inactivation kinetics of the calcium channels. This oligomerization is a key mechanism affecting the properties of calcium channels and is proposed as a novel aspect of calcium channel regulation (Soldatov2015CACNB2:).
