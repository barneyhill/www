# RPL27A

## Overview
RPL27A is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein L27a, a crucial component of the 60S subunit of the ribosome. This protein plays a significant role in the process of protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mRNA into polypeptides, which is essential for cellular growth and proliferation. Ribosomal protein L27a is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the assembly and function of ribosomes, ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of protein synthesis (FrommDornieden2012Novel). Beyond its role in the ribosome, RPL27A is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and differentiation, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting organismal development (FrommDornieden2012Novel). Additionally, alterations in RPL27A expression have been linked to the progression of certain cancers, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhao2021Ribosome; Xing2023High).

## Structure


## Function
RPL27A encodes a component of the 60S subunit of the ribosome, which is essential for protein synthesis. In healthy human cells, RPL27A plays a critical role in translating mRNA into polypeptides, contributing to cellular growth and proliferation. This protein is active in the cytoplasm, where ribosomes are located, facilitating efficient protein production necessary for normal cellular function and organismal development (FrommDornieden2012Novel).

RPL27A is involved in ribosome assembly and function, which are crucial for protein synthesis. The protein's role in ribosomal structure is vital for maintaining the translational machinery's integrity, ensuring that proteins are synthesized accurately and efficiently (FrommDornieden2012Novel). The up-regulation of RPL27A has been observed in processes like adipogenesis, where it is associated with increased translational activity and ribosomal association, indicating its importance in cellular differentiation and growth (FrommDornieden2012Novel).

RPL27A also exhibits extraribosomal functions, such as regulating the cell cycle and promoting cell growth or differentiation, which might explain its involvement in early adipogenesis and other cellular processes (FrommDornieden2012Novel). These functions highlight the protein's multifaceted role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RPL27A gene have been implicated in the progression and prognosis of certain cancers. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), RPL27A is significantly upregulated in metastatic cancer cells compared to primary cancer cells. This upregulation is associated with increased cell migration and invasion, suggesting that RPL27A plays a crucial role in TNBC metastasis. The knockdown of RPL27A in TNBC cell lines results in reduced cell migration and invasion, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhao2021Ribosome).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high expression levels of RPL27A are linked to poor prognosis. Studies have shown that elevated RPL27A expression is associated with worse survival outcomes and is particularly pronounced in patients with TP53 mutations. The gene's expression correlates with immune cell infiltration, including CD8+ T cells and macrophages, which may influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Xing2023High).

These findings suggest that RPL27A could serve as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancers where it is overexpressed (Zhao2021Ribosome; Xing2023High).

## Interactions
RPL27A, a component of the 60S ribosomal subunit, is involved in various protein-protein interactions essential for its function in ribosome assembly and protein synthesis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RPL27A is part of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network that includes several hub genes such as RPS27A, UBA52, RPS8, RPS5, RPS6, RPS3, RPS13, RPS15A, and RPS16. These interactions suggest a close relationship between RPL27A and other ribosomal proteins, highlighting its role in ribosome structure and function (Xing2023High).

In the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), RPL27A is upregulated in metastatic cancer cells and is associated with the EIF2 signaling pathway. This suggests that RPL27A may interact with components of this pathway, contributing to cancer progression and metastasis (Zhao2021Ribosome).

RPL27A has also been identified as interacting with the Dengue virus NS1 protein in infected human liver cells. This interaction is crucial for viral translation and replication, indicating that RPL27A may play a role in viral pathogenesis by interacting with viral proteins (CervantesSalazar2015Dengue).
