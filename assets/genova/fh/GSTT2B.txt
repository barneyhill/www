# GSTT2B

## Overview
GSTT2B is a gene that encodes the protein glutathione S-transferase theta 2B, which is part of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family. This family of enzymes plays a crucial role in the detoxification of endogenous and exogenous compounds by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione to a wide variety of substrates. The GSTT2B protein is involved in the metabolism of toxic substances, including those found in cigarette smoke, and is categorized as a detoxification enzyme. Variations in the GSTT2B gene, such as copy number variations, have been associated with altered expression levels in alveolar macrophages, which may influence susceptibility to smoke-induced lung diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer (Butler2011Glutathione). Understanding the genetic and functional dynamics of GSTT2B is essential for elucidating its role in pulmonary pathophysiology.

## Clinical Significance
GSTT2B, a member of the glutathione S-transferase family, is implicated in the pathogenesis of smoke-induced lung diseases due to its role in detoxification processes. Alterations in GSTT2B expression, particularly through copy number variations (CNVs), have been linked to changes in gene expression levels in alveolar macrophages. These CNVs are common and heritable, with a positive correlation between GSTT2B gene expression and its copy number. This relationship suggests that CNV polymorphisms negatively regulate GST genes, including GSTT2B, potentially contributing to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer in smokers (Butler2011Glutathione).

The deletion of GSTT2B, which is a duplicate gene of GSTT2, can reduce GSTT2 expression in alveolar macrophages, possibly due to the loss of an enhancer element. This reduction in expression is significant because GST genes are not upregulated by smoke exposure, unlike other detoxification genes, indicating that CNV-mediated alterations in GST gene dosage may be clinically relevant in smoke-induced lung disease (Butler2011Glutathione). These findings highlight the importance of GSTT2B in the context of lung diseases associated with xenobiotic exposure.
