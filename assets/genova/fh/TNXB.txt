# TNXB

## Overview
The TNXB gene encodes tenascin-X (TNX), a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and organization of connective tissues. As a member of the tenascin family, TNX is involved in the extracellular matrix (ECM), where it contributes to the stability and function of tissues such as skin, tendons, and ligaments. The protein is characterized by several structural domains, including epidermal growth factor-like repeats and fibronectin type III repeats, which facilitate its interactions with other ECM components, such as collagens and tropoelastin (Egging2006Interactions; Chiovaro2015Transcriptional). TNX is expressed in a tissue-specific manner and is not induced by inflammation or wound healing, with its expression negatively regulated by glucocorticoids (Chiovaro2015Transcriptional). Mutations in the TNXB gene are associated with connective tissue disorders, including certain forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining connective tissue integrity (Demirdas2016Recognizing; Rymen2019Clinical).

## Structure
The TNXB gene encodes the tenascin-X (TNX) protein, a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein involved in connective tissue structure. The primary structure of TNX is characterized by a rich composition of cysteine and glycine residues. The protein is composed of several distinct domains, including an N-terminal signal peptide, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain (Egging2006Interactions; Miller2021TenascinX—Discovery).

The secondary structure of TNX includes multiple EGF-like repeats and 32 to 33 FnIII domains, which are crucial for its interaction with other extracellular matrix components (Miller2018TenascinX; Egging2006Interactions). The tertiary structure involves a complex folding pattern that stabilizes its interactions with other molecules, such as collagens and tropoelastin, which are essential for collagen fibrillogenesis and matrix stability (Egging2006Interactions).

TNX functions as a monomer and does not form a quaternary structure. It undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which contribute to its molecular weight of approximately 1.5 million Da (Miller2021TenascinX—Discovery). Alternative splicing of TNXB results in different isoforms, including a truncated form known as XB-Short, which is expressed in the adrenal gland (Chiovaro2015Transcriptional).

## Function
The TNXB gene encodes the protein Tenascin-X (TNX), which plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues. TNX is a member of the tenascin family and is involved in the extracellular matrix (ECM), where it contributes to the organization and stability of tissues such as skin, tendons, and ligaments (Chiovaro2015Transcriptional; Miller2021TenascinX—Discovery). TNX indirectly binds to and bridges collagen fibrils, regulating collagen deposition and fibrillogenesis, which is essential for connective tissue integrity (Chiovaro2015Transcriptional; PénissonBesnier2013Compound).

TNX is characterized by several structural domains, including epidermal growth factor-like repeats and fibronectin type III repeats, which allow it to form multi-armed structures crucial for its function in the ECM (Miller2021TenascinX—Discovery). It is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with higher levels in tendons, ligaments, and perineural sheaths (Chiovaro2015Transcriptional).

In healthy human cells, TNX is involved in modulating cell adhesion and migration, influencing the spacing of collagen fibrils, and remodeling elastic fibers. It also regulates the expression of ECM components like collagen VI and proteoglycans, contributing to tissue repair and stability (Rymen2019Clinical). TNX is not induced by inflammation or wound healing, and its expression is negatively regulated by glucocorticoids (Chiovaro2015Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TNXB gene are associated with various forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), particularly the tenascin-X deficient type and classical-like EDS. These conditions are characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. The tenascin-X deficient type of EDS is autosomal recessive and lacks atrophic scarring, distinguishing it from other EDS types (Demirdas2016Recognizing; Rymen2019Clinical). TNXB mutations can lead to a complete loss of tenascin-X function, resulting in severe connective tissue disorders (Demirdas2016Recognizing).

TNXB mutations are also linked to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in a condition known as CAH-X syndrome, which combines features of both CAH and EDS. This syndrome is often due to contiguous gene deletions involving TNXB and CYP21A2, leading to TNXB haploinsufficiency and hypermobility-type EDS (Morissette2015Broadening; Miller2018TenascinX). Additionally, TNXB mutations can result in primary myopathy, characterized by muscle weakness and abnormal myotendinous junctions, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of TNX-related disorders (PénissonBesnier2013Compound). TNX deficiency is also associated with cardiovascular abnormalities and gastrointestinal complications (Demirdas2016Recognizing; Rymen2019Clinical).

## Interactions
Tenascin-X (TNX), encoded by the TNXB gene, is a large extracellular matrix protein that interacts with various dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. TNX binds dose-dependently to human and bovine collagens, specifically types I, III, and V, as well as to tropoelastin. However, it does not bind to denatured collagen (gelatin) or several domains of the elastic fiber protein fibrillin-1 (Egging2006Interactions). The FNIII29 repeat of TNX shows strong binding to collagen types I, III, and V, and also binds to recombinant tropoelastin, with FNIII29 exhibiting stronger binding than other domains (Egging2006Interactions). The FNIII29 domain is implicated in accelerating collagen fibrillogenesis in vitro, suggesting a role in matrix stability and collagen fibril formation (Egging2006Interactions).

The V1195M mutation in the TNXfn7 domain of TNX, associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, affects the flexibility of the C0E loop, potentially altering TNX's binding to ECM molecules and impacting collagen deposition and fibrillogenesis (Zhuang2010Phenotypic). This mutation does not significantly change the three-dimensional structure of TNXfn7 but reduces its flexibility, which may disrupt TNX's interactions with ECM components (Zhuang2010Phenotypic).
