# PKDCC

## Overview
The PKDCC gene encodes the protein kinase domain containing, cytoplasmic (PKDCC), a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, particularly in chondrocyte differentiation and skeletal development. This kinase is secreted and is involved in remodeling the extracellular matrix, influencing the timing of chondrocyte differentiation and bone formation, especially in cranial regions. PKDCC is expressed in multiple tissues, excluding the brain, pancreas, and skin, indicating its diverse functional roles across different biological contexts (Jung2024Identification; Mohammed2024A). The gene is also implicated in facial morphology, with specific genetic variations affecting its expression and potentially contributing to conditions such as non-syndromic cleft lip and palate (Mohammed2024A). PKDCC's interactions with key signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/PCP pathway, underscore its regulatory significance in embryonic development and tissue-specific signaling (Vitorino2015Xenopus).

## Function
The PKDCC gene encodes a secreted tyrosine kinase involved in various cellular processes, particularly in chondrocyte differentiation and skeletal development. In humans, PKDCC is expressed at high levels in multiple tissues, except for the brain, pancreas, and skin, suggesting its involvement in diverse cellular functions across different tissues (Jung2024Identification). The gene plays a crucial role in remodeling the extracellular matrix during cartilage development, affecting the timing of proliferative chondrocyte differentiation and subsequent bone formation, especially in cranial chondrocytes (Mohammed2024A).

PKDCC is also implicated in the regulation of facial shape and development. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs6740960, located in an enhancer region, modulates PKDCC expression during cranial chondrogenesis, impacting facial morphology and potentially increasing susceptibility to conditions like non-syndromic cleft lip and palate (Mohammed2024A). The gene's function in healthy human cells is not fully elucidated, but its expression patterns and involvement in chondrocyte differentiation suggest a significant role in skeletal and facial development (Mohammed2024A; Sajan2018Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PKDCC gene are associated with a rare skeletal disorder known as rhizomelic limb shortening with dysmorphic features (RLSDF). This condition is characterized by rhizomelic shortening of the limbs, distinctive facial features, and other skeletal abnormalities. The disorder follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, with biallelic variants in PKDCC leading to the phenotype. In humans, these mutations can result in features such as short stature, hypertelorism, flat face, and micrognathia (Yan2023Prenatala).

In mouse models, the disruption of the Pkdcc gene results in severe skeletal abnormalities, including shortened limbs and craniofacial defects, which mirror the human condition. These findings underscore the gene's critical role in chondrocyte differentiation and bone development (Imuta2008Short; Sajan2018Biallelic). The PKDCC gene interacts with the hedgehog signaling pathway, particularly influencing the Gli3 gene, which is crucial for normal bone development (Sajan2018Biallelic).

Alterations in PKDCC expression, such as those influenced by the rs6740960 enhancer, have been linked to craniofacial abnormalities, including cleft palate. This enhancer modulates PKDCC expression specifically in cranial chondrocytes, affecting craniofacial development and potentially contributing to conditions like non-syndromic cleft lip and palate (Mohammed2024A).

## Interactions
PKDCC, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. In the context of Xenopus laevis, PKDCC orthologs, pkdcc1 and pkdcc2, have been shown to interact with Dishevelled (Dvl), a key protein in the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway. These interactions facilitate the recruitment of Dvl to the plasma membrane, which is crucial for the pathway's function (Vitorino2015Xenopus). Pkdcc1 and Pkdcc2 exhibit distinct roles in this signaling pathway, with Pkdcc1 promoting and Pkdcc2 inhibiting the activation of ATF2, a marker of JNK-dependent PCP signaling (Vitorino2015Xenopus).

In mice, PKDCC is implicated in skeletal development, particularly in the differentiation of flat proliferative chondrocytes. It may interact with signaling pathways involving ␦EF1/ZEB1, Wnt5a, and Gli2/Gli3, although the precise molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Imuta2008Short). These interactions suggest that PKDCC plays a role in modulating signaling pathways that are critical for proper bone development and cellular differentiation. The gene's involvement in these pathways highlights its potential as a regulatory element in both embryonic development and tissue-specific signaling processes.
