# OTUD1

## Overview
OTUD1 (OTU deubiquitinase 1) is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in the regulation of protein ubiquitination, a critical post-translational modification that influences protein stability, localization, and function. The OTUD1 protein is characterized by its OTU domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity, and a ubiquitin-interacting motif that facilitates its interaction with ubiquitinated substrates. Functionally, OTUD1 plays a significant role in cellular processes such as tumor suppression, immune response regulation, and oxidative stress management. It acts by modulating the ubiquitination status of key proteins involved in these pathways, including p53, SMAD7, and KEAP1, thereby influencing cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and inflammation. Mutations and dysregulation of OTUD1 have been implicated in various diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancers, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2020OTUD1; Oikawa2023Pleiotropic; Oikawa2022OTUD1).

## Structure
The OTUD1 protein is a deubiquitinating enzyme characterized by several distinct regions that contribute to its function. It contains an OTU domain, spanning amino acids 291-446, which includes the active site at Cys320, crucial for its enzymatic activity (Zhang2020OTUD1; Oikawa2022OTUD1). The N-terminal region, comprising amino acids 1-290, is rich in alanine, proline, and glycine, and is referred to as the Ala-, Pro-, and Gly-rich region (APGR). This region is intrinsically disordered and plays a significant role in protein interactions (Oikawa2022OTUD1).

OTUD1 also features a ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) located between amino acids 457-481, which is involved in its interaction with ubiquitinated substrates (Oikawa2022OTUD1). The protein's structure allows it to interact with multiple proteins and pathways, including KEAP1 and MCL1, influencing various cellular processes (Oikawa2022OTUD1; Wu2019The). The enzyme domain, covering amino acids 309-481, is sufficient for its interaction with MCL1, highlighting the importance of this region for its functional activity (Wu2019The). The molecular weight of OTUD1 is approximately 51 kDa, and it forms complexes with other proteins, as suggested by gel filtration analysis (Oikawa2022OTUD1).

## Function
OTUD1 (OTU deubiquitinase 1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the hydrolysis of lysine-63-linked ubiquitin chains, although it can cleave various ubiquitin linkages, impacting protein stability and function (Oikawa2023Pleiotropic). OTUD1 acts as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing proteins such as p53, SMAD7, and others, which are critical for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Zhang2017Breast; Piao2017Ovarian).

OTUD1 negatively regulates the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is essential for controlling inflammatory responses. It achieves this by hydrolyzing K63-linked ubiquitin chains from NF-κB signaling factors, thereby suppressing inflammation and preventing excessive cell death (Oikawa2023Pleiotropic; Oikawa2022OTUD1). Additionally, OTUD1 interacts with KEAP1, a regulator of oxidative stress response, modulating its K63-polyubiquitination. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting cells from oxidative stress-induced death (Oikawa2022OTUD1).

OTUD1 also plays a role in antiviral signaling by regulating the activity of IRF3, a transcription factor involved in innate immunity. It disrupts the noncanonical ubiquitination of IRF3, thereby modulating its ability to bind DNA and initiate transcription of antiviral genes (Zhang2020OTUD1). Through these activities, OTUD1 contributes to cellular homeostasis and stress responses, impacting inflammation, apoptosis, and immune regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the OTUD1 gene are associated with several diseases, particularly autoimmune disorders and various cancers. In autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis, mutations like P95R, R243C, P379S, T407P, P420L, and G430V impair OTUD1's ability to suppress innate immune responses, leading to dysregulated interferon production and enhanced inflammatory responses (Oikawa2023Pleiotropic; Lu2018Mutations). These mutations are linked to the gene's failure to inhibit pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as NF-κB and IRFs (Lu2018Mutations).

In cancer, OTUD1 acts as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing proteins like p53 and SMAD7, which are involved in cell cycle regulation and metastasis inhibition. Alterations in OTUD1 expression or its interactions can lead to poor prognosis in cancers such as glioblastoma, melanoma, lung, breast, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Oikawa2023Pleiotropic). OTUD1's role in regulating the stability of MCL1, a protein involved in cell survival, also affects the sensitivity of cancer cells to certain treatments, influencing cancer progression and treatment resistance (Wu2019The).

In cardiovascular diseases, OTUD1 is implicated in hypertensive heart failure, where its increased expression promotes pathological cardiac remodeling through interactions with STAT3 (Wang2023OTUD1). These findings highlight OTUD1's significant role in various pathological conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
OTUD1 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. It stabilizes the tumor suppressor p53 by removing K48-linked ubiquitin chains, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Oikawa2023Pleiotropic). OTUD1 also interacts with SMAD7, deubiquitinating it to inhibit TGF-β/SMAD signaling, which is crucial for its anti-metastatic activity in breast cancer (Zhang2017Breast). This interaction involves the removal of K33-linked poly-ubiquitin chains from SMAD7, facilitating its interaction with SMURF2 (Zhang2017Breast).

OTUD1 is involved in immune responses by interacting with MAVS, TRAF3, and TRAF6, leading to their degradation and negatively regulating antiviral signaling pathways (Zhang2018Induction). It also interacts with IRF3, removing K6-linked ubiquitin chains to modulate its activity in antiviral responses (Zhang2020OTUD1). In the context of oxidative stress, OTUD1 interacts with KEAP1, influencing the regulation of Nrf2 (Oikawa2023Pleiotropic).

In cancer-related processes, OTUD1 interacts with PTEN, stabilizing it and affecting cancer cell sensitivity to anticancer drugs (Oikawa2023Pleiotropic). It also binds to AKT, inhibiting its phosphorylation, and interacts with YAP, removing its K63-ubiquitin chain to act as a tumor suppressor (Oikawa2023Pleiotropic).
