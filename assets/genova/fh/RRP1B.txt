# RRP1B

## Overview
RRP1B (ribosomal RNA processing 1B) is a gene that encodes a nucleolar protein involved in critical cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis and RNA metabolism. The protein encoded by RRP1B plays a pivotal role in the processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which is essential for the assembly and maturation of ribosomal subunits, thereby influencing cell growth and proliferation (Balčiūnienė2024Impact). Beyond its fundamental role in ribosome biogenesis, RRP1B is implicated in the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression, impacting cancer metastasis by modulating cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Crawford2007Rrp1b). The protein interacts with various factors, including Sipa1 and transcriptional corepressors, to influence metastasis-associated gene expression and histone methylation (Balčiūnienė2024Impact). Additionally, RRP1B's involvement in RNA metabolism and its interactions with proteins such as Lsm1 and SRSF1 underscore its multifaceted role in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing (Crawford2007Rrp1b).

## Function
RRP1B (ribosomal RNA processing 1B) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis by participating in the processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) within the nucleolus, which is essential for the assembly and maturation of ribosomal subunits. This function is crucial for proper cell growth and proliferation, impacting overall cellular function and organismal development (Balčiūnienė2024Impact).

RRP1B is also involved in modulating extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression, which is significant in the context of cancer metastasis. Its expression influences the metastatic potential of tumors by altering ECM gene expression, suggesting a role in cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Crawford2007Rrp1b). The protein interacts with Sipa1, affecting Rap-GTPase enzymatic activity, which is a critical component in cell signaling pathways (Crawford2007Rrp1b).

Additionally, RRP1B is implicated in RNA metabolism, as it contains a Nop52 domain related to rRNA generation and may interact with Lsm1, a protein involved in mRNA degradation (Crawford2007Rrp1b). These interactions highlight its multifaceted role in cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and RNA processing.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RRP1B gene have been implicated in the progression and metastasis of various cancers, notably breast and cervical cancer. In breast cancer, the RRP1B gene is associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression, which is crucial for metastasis prediction. Variants in RRP1B, such as the 1421G!A SNP, have been linked to improved outcomes in estrogen receptor-positive tumors, suggesting a role in patient stratification and prognosis (Crawford2007Rrp1b). The gene's expression levels and polymorphisms are correlated with survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Crawford2007Rrp1b).

In cervical cancer, the presence of specific RRP1B haplotypes, such as the GCTTC haplotype, is associated with reduced risk of tumor progression and metastasis. Non-carriers of this haplotype have a statistically significant reduced risk of advanced tumor size and metastasis, highlighting its protective role (Balčiūnienė2024Impact). The gene's variants also show potential prognostic value in predicting survival outcomes, with certain diplotypes associated with decreased hazard ratios for overall survival (Balčiūnienė2024Impact). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RRP1B gene variations in influencing cancer outcomes.

## Interactions
RRP1B is a nucleolar protein that participates in various interactions influencing cancer progression and metastasis. It forms a binding alliance with the metastasis-modulating factor SIPA1 and is associated with extracellular matrix gene expression, crucial for metastasis regulation (Balčiūnienė2024Impact). RRP1B interacts with transcriptional corepressors TRIM28 and HP1α, recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes to regulate metastasis-associated gene expression (Balčiūnienė2024Impact). It also influences histone methylation and modulates alternative mRNA isoforms through interactions with the splicing regulator SRSF1 (Balčiūnienė2024Impact).

RRP1B interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), affecting tumorigenesis and the metastatic cascade, and enhances DNA damage-induced apoptosis by acting as a transcriptional coactivator for proapoptotic genes under E2F1 regulation (Balčiūnienė2024Impact). It associates with the nucleolar phosphoprotein NPM1, involved in cellular proliferation and growth-suppression pathways, and interacts with BRD4, a transcriptional and epigenetic regulator in cancer development (Balčiūnienė2024Impact). RRP1B is also involved in the regulation of claudin-1 expression, affecting cell viability and motility in claudin-low breast cancer cells (Chiang2019DOCK1). These interactions highlight RRP1B's role in transcription and metastasis regulation, impacting multiple pathways and biological processes.
