# MELTF

## Overview
The MELTF gene encodes the protein melanotransferrin, which is a member of the transferrin family involved in iron metabolism. Melanotransferrin is primarily expressed on the cell surface and plays a crucial role in iron uptake and transport, contributing to cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. It is notably active in tissues like the brain and skin, where it supports iron homeostasis and tissue-specific functions. In addition to its role in iron metabolism, melanotransferrin is implicated in pathways related to cell proliferation and tissue regeneration, particularly in the context of endometrial regeneration, where it is upregulated by platelet-rich plasma treatment (Mao2022MELTF). Furthermore, melanotransferrin is involved in interactions that enhance drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier, highlighting its potential clinical significance in therapeutic applications (Kuo2016Enhanced).

## Function
Melanotransferrin (MELTF) is a protein involved in iron metabolism, primarily expressed on the cell surface, and plays a role in iron uptake and transport. It is part of the transferrin family, which is crucial for cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. MELTF is active in various tissues, including the brain and skin, where it contributes to cellular iron homeostasis and supports tissue-specific functions.

In the context of endometrial regeneration, MELTF has been identified as a key gene upregulated by platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment. It is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, including endometrial glandular and vascular epithelial cells, and is not found in stromal cells. The increased expression of MELTF in response to PRP suggests its involvement in pathways related to cell proliferation and tissue regeneration, potentially through the regulation of ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and autophagy (Mao2022MELTF). While the specific function of MELTF in healthy human cells outside the context of endometrial regeneration is not directly addressed, its role in iron metabolism and cellular processes indicates its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue health (Mao2022MELTF).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
Melanotransferrin (MELTF) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In the context of platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-mediated endometrial regeneration, MELTF is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, including endometrial glandular and vascular epithelial cells. It is not expressed in stromal cells, suggesting a specific role in epithelial cell interactions (Mao2022MELTF). The study indicates that MELTF may interact with proteins involved in the retinol metabolism and extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction pathways, which are upregulated during PRP-induced endometrial regeneration (Mao2022MELTF).

In the context of drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), MELTF is targeted by melanotransferrin antibodies (MA) to enhance receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT). This interaction facilitates the transport of drugs like etoposide across the BBB by binding to human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), which express MELTF. This binding promotes endocytosis and increases BBB permeability, highlighting MELTF's role in mediating interactions that enhance drug delivery (Kuo2016Enhanced). These interactions suggest that MELTF plays a significant role in cellular processes related to iron metabolism, cell adhesion, and migration, potentially through its interactions with transferrin receptors and other cell surface molecules.
