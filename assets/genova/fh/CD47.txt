# CD47

## Overview
CD47 is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein known as CD47, which is integral to various cellular processes, including immune regulation and cell signaling. The CD47 protein is characterized as a 5-transmembrane receptor with a heavily glycosylated extracellular domain, which plays a pivotal role in cell-cell interactions. It is widely expressed across different cell types and functions as a "marker of self" by interacting with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) on macrophages, thereby inhibiting phagocytosis and preventing the immune system from attacking self-cells (Brown2001Integrinassociated; Oldenborg2000Role). This interaction is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has significant implications in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer, where CD47 overexpression allows tumor cells to evade immune clearance (Eladl2020Role). The protein's involvement in multiple signaling pathways underscores its role in cellular differentiation, stress responses, and immune system modulation (SotoPantoja2015CD47).

## Structure
The CD47 protein is a unique 5-transmembrane (5-TM) receptor characterized by a heavily glycosylated N-terminal immunoglobulin variable (IgV)-like extracellular domain (ECD), a 5-TM spanning helical bundle domain, and a small C-terminal domain (CTD) with four isoforms (Fenalti2021Structure). The ECD is connected to the transmembrane domain (TMD) via a six-residue peptide linker (114 RVVSWF 119), forming an extended loop that stabilizes the ECD for cell surface presentation (Fenalti2021Structure). The ECD exhibits an IgV-like fold and a six-stranded mainly parallel AGFCC'C" β-sheet, crucial for binding with SIRPα (Fenalti2021Structure).

The transmembrane domain consists of five helices forming a tightly packed helical bundle, with helix III central to the structure, contributing to its stability through interhelical hydrophobic contacts (Fenalti2021Structure). The intracellular side features a hydrogen bond network involving polar residues from helices I, III, IV, and V, which may stabilize the TMD bundle (Fenalti2021Structure).

CD47 undergoes multiple post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, glycosaminoglycan modification, and pyroglutamate modification, which influence its membrane localization and interactions with ligands (Zhang2024Structural–functional). The protein's structure allows it to regulate cell-cell adhesion and migration through actin cytoskeleton reorganization (Zhang2024Structural–functional).

## Function
The CD47 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular and physiological processes. CD47 is widely expressed on the surface of many cell types, including red blood cells, where it functions as a "marker of self" by interacting with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) on macrophages. This interaction inhibits phagocytosis, thereby preventing the immune system from attacking self-cells, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing conditions like hemolytic anemia (Oldenborg2000Role).

In the immune system, CD47 is involved in the homeostasis of dendritic cells and T cells in the spleen. It regulates the development and survival of conventional dendritic cells, which are vital for initiating immune responses and maintaining T cell tolerance (Murata2014The). CD47 also plays a role in T cell activation by modulating signaling pathways, such as those involving thrombospondin-1, which inhibits T cell receptor signaling and affects cellular responses to stress (SotoPantoja2015CD47).

CD47 is implicated in various signaling pathways, including those regulating calcium homeostasis, cyclic nucleotide signaling, and nitric oxide biosynthesis. These pathways influence cell survival, mitochondrial biogenesis, and stem cell regulation, highlighting CD47's role in cellular differentiation and stress responses (SotoPantoja2015CD47).

## Clinical Significance
CD47, a transmembrane protein, plays a significant role in various cancers by enabling tumor cells to evade immune clearance. Its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in several malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), gastric cancer, and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) (Shi2021CD47; Yan2022The; Luo2024CD47—a). In AML, CD47 is upregulated on leukemia stem cells, correlating with worse survival outcomes and varying expression across different genotypes, which suggests potential for targeted therapies like anti-CD47 antibodies (Marra2023CD47). 

In gastric cancer, high CD47 expression is associated with resistance to adjuvant chemotherapy and reduced prognostic value of M1-polarized macrophages, indicating its role in immune evasion and poor treatment outcomes (Shi2021CD47). Similarly, in EOC, high CD47 expression correlates with advanced disease stages, poor chemotherapy response, and decreased survival rates, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Luo2024CD47—a).

CD47's interaction with signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) on phagocytes prevents the phagocytosis of cancer cells, contributing to immune evasion and tumor progression (Eladl2020Role). This interaction is a focus of ongoing research for developing targeted therapies to disrupt CD47's "don't eat me" signal, aiming to enhance anti-tumor immune responses.

## Interactions
CD47, also known as integrin-associated protein, engages in several significant interactions with other proteins. It interacts with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) on macrophages, which plays a crucial role in inhibiting phagocytosis by delivering a "don't eat me" signal (Brown2001Integrinassociated; Oldenborg2013CD47:). CD47 also binds to thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a soluble protein, which affects cell adhesion, chemotaxis, and integrin-mediated cell spreading (Brown2001Integrinassociated; Oldenborg2013CD47:). This interaction is significant in the context of aging red blood cells, where TSP-1/CD47 binding leads to increased CD47 clustering, facilitating the removal of aged cells (Wang2020Aging‐associated).

CD47 forms complexes with integrins such as αvβ3, αIIbβ3, and α2β1, influencing processes like platelet activation and cell migration (SotoPantoja2015CD47; Brown2001Integrinassociated). It also interacts with cytoplasmic proteins like ubiquilin-1, which affects integrin activation and links CD47 to the cytoskeleton (SotoPantoja2015CD47). These interactions highlight CD47's role in various cellular processes, including immune regulation and cell signaling.
