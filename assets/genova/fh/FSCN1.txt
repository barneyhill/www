# FSCN1

## Overview
FSCN1 is a gene that encodes the fascin actin-bundling protein 1, a crucial component of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. This protein is categorized as an actin-binding protein and is primarily involved in the bundling of actin filaments, which is essential for the formation of cellular structures such as filopodia and stress fibers. These structures play significant roles in cell migration, motility, and adhesion, contributing to various physiological processes including wound healing and immune responses (Beghein2018Cortactin; Yang2024Targeting). Fascin-1's ability to organize actin filaments into tightly packed bundles is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and monoubiquitination, which modulate its activity and stability (Lamb2020Fascin; Kureishy2002Fascins). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are also implicated in cancer progression, making FSCN1 a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Liu2024Identification; Chen2019FSCN1).

## Structure
FSCN1 encodes fascin-1, a 55 kDa actin-binding protein that plays a critical role in the organization of actin-based structures. The protein is composed of four β-trefoil domains, each containing six two-stranded β-hairpins arranged in a trifold symmetry. These domains are organized into two lobes, allowing fascin-1 to bundle actin filaments as a monomer, unlike most actin bundlers that function as dimers (Lamb2020Fascin; Kureishy2002Fascins).

The crystal structure of fascin-1 has been resolved at 2.9 Å resolution, confirming the presence of these four β-trefoil folds. The structure includes a C-terminal actin-binding domain essential for its function in actin bundling (Kureishy2002Fascins). Fascin-1 has three distinct actin-binding areas: two larger sites located in the clefts of β-trefoils 1 and 2, and β-trefoils 1 and 4, and a smaller site in β-trefoil 3 (Lamb2020Fascin).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at serine 39 by protein kinase C, regulate fascin-1's actin-binding activity. This phosphorylation inhibits actin bundling, affecting the formation of cellular protrusions (Lamb2020Fascin; Kureishy2002Fascins). Fascin-1 also undergoes monoubiquitination, which impairs bundle formation and accelerates disassembly (Lamb2020Fascin).

## Function
Fascin actin-bundling protein 1 (FSCN1) plays a crucial role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the bundling of actin filaments, which is essential for the formation of cellular structures such as filopodia and stress fibers. These structures are important for various cellular processes, including cell migration, motility, and adhesion (Beghein2018Cortactin). FSCN1's actin-bundling activity contributes to the mechanical stiffness and stability of these structures, facilitating cellular interactions and movement (Beghein2018Cortactin).

In the cytoplasm, FSCN1 is active in cross-linking F-actin microfilaments into tight, parallel bundles, which is vital for maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and supporting cellular functions like migration and tissue development (Yang2024Targeting). This actin-bundling activity is independent of its role in extracellular vesicle release, where FSCN1 is involved in endosomal trafficking and invadopodia formation, highlighting its multifaceted role in cell biology (Beghein2018Cortactin).

FSCN1's function in healthy cells is critical for organismal outcomes such as wound healing and immune responses, where efficient cell movement and structural organization are necessary (Beghein2018Cortactin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FSCN1 gene, which encodes the fascin actin-bundling protein 1, have been implicated in various cancers. In tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), FSCN1 is overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior. High FSCN1 expression is associated with adverse clinicopathological parameters, such as advanced clinical stage and increased risk of relapse, and is an independent prognostic factor for poor disease-free survival (Chen2019FSCN1). In breast cancer, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FSCN1 gene, such as rs56156320, are linked to increased cancer risk and progression to advanced stages, suggesting that these genetic variations could serve as biomarkers for breast cancer susceptibility and clinical outcomes (Wang2017FSCN1).

FSCN1 is also implicated in radiation resistance in cancers with PIK3CA gene alterations, such as cervical and head and neck cancers. Its expression is associated with poorer overall survival and reduced radiotherapy response, indicating its potential as a biomarker for prognosis and treatment outcomes (Li2021FSCN1). In colorectal cancer, FSCN1 is expressed at the invasive front of tumors and is regulated by the β-catenin-TCF signaling pathway, promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Vignjevic2007Fascin).

## Interactions
Fascin actin-bundling protein 1 (FSCN1) is known to interact with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as migration, adhesion, and signaling. In laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) cells, FSCN1 interacts with prostaglandin reductase 1 and 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), with the latter being a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. This interaction may promote cancer progression by regulating cholesterol metabolism-related signaling pathways (Liu2024Identification). 

FSCN1 also interacts with proteins involved in cell adhesion and migration, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src, through its association with microtubules (MTs). This interaction is crucial for focal adhesion dynamics and cell migration, as it influences the FAK-Src signaling pathway (Villari2015A). 

In addition, FSCN1 has been shown to bind with aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex interacting multifunctional protein 1 (AIMP1) and leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) in LSCC cells. These interactions contribute to the oncogenic functions of FSCN1, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Gao2019Mass). 

These interactions highlight FSCN1's role in various cellular processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer.
