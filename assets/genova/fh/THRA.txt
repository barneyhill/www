# THRA

## Overview
The THRA gene encodes the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TRα), a nuclear receptor that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression in response to thyroid hormones, particularly triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). As a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, TRα functions as a transcription factor, modulating the expression of genes involved in diverse physiological processes, including development, metabolism, and differentiation (Laudet1991Genomic; Bernal2007Thyroid). The receptor is predominantly expressed in the brain and other tissues, where it influences critical developmental and metabolic pathways. The THRA gene undergoes alternative splicing, producing multiple isoforms, such as TRα1 and TRα2, which have distinct functional roles. TRα1 is capable of binding T3 and activating transcription, while TRα2 acts as a dominant negative regulator, modulating the activity of TRα1 (Laudet1991Genomic; Paisdzior2021A). Mutations in the THRA gene can lead to resistance to thyroid hormone alpha (RTHα), a condition characterized by impaired sensitivity to thyroid hormones, resulting in a spectrum of clinical manifestations (TylkiSzymańska2015Thyroid).

## Structure
The human thyroid hormone receptor alpha (THRA) gene encodes a nuclear receptor protein that plays a crucial role in mediating thyroid hormone functions. The THRA protein is organized into distinct structural domains, including a DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain (LBD). The DNA-binding domain contains zinc finger motifs, each encoded by a separate exon, which facilitate the binding of the receptor to specific DNA sequences (Laudet1991Genomic).

The THRA gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two main isoforms: THRA1 and THRA2. THRA1 is a 410 amino acid protein capable of binding triiodothyronine (T3), the active form of thyroid hormone, and activating transcription. In contrast, THRA2, which is 490 amino acids long, cannot bind T3 but can still bind DNA and form heterodimers with THRA1, exerting a dominant negative effect on THRA1's transactivation activity (Laudet1991Genomic; Paisdzior2021A).

The ligand-binding domain of THRA is crucial for the recruitment of coactivators and is involved in the receptor's interaction with thyroid hormones. Mutations in this domain can impair the receptor's ability to bind T3, affecting its transactivation activity (Espiard2015A). The THRA protein can form homodimers or heterodimers, which are important for its function as a transcription factor (Paisdzior2021A).

## Function
The THRA gene encodes the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TRα), a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). In healthy human cells, TRα1, a major isoform of this receptor, binds to specific DNA sequences known as thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) to modulate the transcription of target genes. This regulation is essential for maintaining the balance between progenitor cell self-renewal and neurogenesis, which affects overall brain size and development (Bernal2007Thyroid; Krieger2019Mutations).

TRα1 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebrum and cerebellum, where it influences processes such as neuronal differentiation and cerebellar granule cell migration (Bernal2007Thyroid). The receptor's activity is ligand-dependent; unliganded TRα1 recruits corepressors to inhibit gene transcription, while T3 binding promotes the dissociation of corepressors and the recruitment of coactivators, leading to transcriptional activation (Bernal2007Thyroid; Krieger2019Mutations).

In addition to its genomic actions, TRα1 is involved in nongenomic actions of T3 in the brain, such as the regulation of actin, which is crucial for maintaining neuronal structure and function (Liu2018Thyroid). The receptor's role in these processes underscores its importance in normal brain development and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the THRA gene, which encodes the thyroid hormone receptor alpha, are associated with a condition known as Resistance to Thyroid Hormone Alpha (RTHα). This condition is characterized by a reduced sensitivity to thyroid hormone, leading to a range of clinical symptoms. Patients with RTHα often present with growth retardation, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, skeletal dysplasia, and specific facial features. Laboratory findings typically show low free thyroxine (fT4) and high free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels, with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, complicating the diagnosis (TylkiSzymańska2015Thyroid).

The condition can result from both truncating and missense mutations in the THRA gene. Truncating mutations tend to lead to more severe phenotypes, including significant intellectual disabilities and skeletal abnormalities, while missense mutations are associated with milder clinical presentations (TylkiSzymańska2015Thyroid; Demir2016Diverse). The mutations often cluster in the last exon of the gene, suggesting a dominant-negative mechanism (TylkiSzymańska2015Thyroid).

RTHα is also linked to other symptoms such as macroglossia, chronic constipation, macrocephaly, and anemia. The condition's variability in symptoms and severity underscores the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis (le2020Two; Moran2015Resistance).

## Interactions
The thyroid hormone receptor alpha (THRA) is a nuclear receptor that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. THRA binds to specific DNA sequences known as T3 response elements (TREs) in the 5' flanking regions of target genes. In the absence of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3), THRA forms complexes with corepressor proteins such as N-CoR and SMRT, which recruit histone deacetylases to repress transcription by tightening chromatin structure (KOENIG1998Thyroid). Upon T3 binding, THRA undergoes a conformational change that releases corepressors and recruits coactivators like SRC-1, CBP, and PCAF, which possess histone acetyltransferase activity to facilitate transcription (KOENIG1998Thyroid).

THRA can form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs), which are crucial for its DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Mutations in THRA can affect its interactions with RXR and corepressors, influencing transcriptional activity and potentially leading to resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome (KOENIG1998Thyroid; Tagami2009The). The ligand-binding domain of THRA contains regions essential for dimerization and interactions with coactivators and corepressors, with the CoR box being critical for corepressor binding (KOENIG1998Thyroid).
