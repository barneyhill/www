# TEPSIN

## Overview
TEPSIN is a gene that encodes the tepsin adaptor-related protein complex 4 accessory protein, which plays a pivotal role in intracellular protein trafficking. The protein is categorized as an accessory protein associated with the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4), and it is integral to the formation of AP-4 coated vesicles at the trans-Golgi network. These vesicles are crucial for the export and delivery of ATG9A, a lipid scramblase necessary for autophagosome biogenesis, to the cell periphery. The tepsin protein contains an epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain and a VHS/ENTH-like domain, which are essential for its function, although they lack some features found in other epsins. Additionally, tepsin interacts with LC3B, a member of the mammalian ATG8 family, through a specific LC3-Interacting Region (LIR) motif, facilitating the proper distribution of ATG9A and maintaining autophagosome structure and function (Borner2012Multivariate; Wallace2023Tepsin). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in AP-4 deficiency syndrome, where mutations affecting the AP-4 complex can lead to neurological disorders (Hardies2014Recessive).

## Structure
Tepsin is a protein associated with the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4) and is involved in vesicular trafficking. It contains two structured domains: an epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain and a VHS/ENTH-like domain. These domains are crucial for its function, although they lack some critical features observed in other epsins, such as those promoting phosphoinositide binding to ENTH domains or ubiquitin binding to VHS domains (Wallace2023Tepsin). The ENTH domain is located at the N terminus, and a second α-helical domain related to both VHS and ENTH domains is found in the middle of the sequence (Borner2012Multivariate).

The unstructured C-terminus of tepsin contains two conserved motifs for binding AP-4 appendage domains, as well as a putative LC3-Interacting Region (LIR) motif, which allows it to bind directly to LC3B with micromolar affinity. This interaction is important for the regulation of autophagy dynamics and the trafficking of ATG9A (Wallace2023Tepsin). The LIR motif in tepsin is identified as GGWDEL, fitting the canonical LIR sequence pattern, and it binds to hydrophobic pockets on LC3B (Wallace2023Tepsin). The protein is mainly unstructured outside of these two α-helical domains (Borner2012Multivariate).

## Function
TEPSIN is an accessory protein associated with the Adaptor Protein 4 (AP-4) complex, playing a crucial role in the trafficking of proteins within cells. It is involved in the formation of AP-4 coated vesicles at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), which are essential for the export and delivery of ATG9A, a lipid scramblase necessary for autophagosome biogenesis, to the cell periphery (Wallace2023Tepsin). TEPSIN interacts specifically with LC3B, a member of the mammalian ATG8 family, through a LC3-Interacting Region (LIR) motif, facilitating the proper distribution of ATG9A and maintaining autophagosome structure and function (Wallace2023Tepsin).

In healthy human cells, TEPSIN is crucial for maintaining autophagy dynamics, as its depletion leads to dysregulation of autophagosome and autolysosome morphology, although it does not significantly alter autophagic flux (Wallace2023Tepsin). TEPSIN's interaction with AP-4 is necessary for its recruitment to membranes, and it colocalizes with AP-4 in a punctate juxtanuclear pattern, which is absent in AP-4-deficient cells (Borner2012Multivariate). This interaction is vital for the long-distance transport of vesicles from the perinuclear area to the cell periphery, highlighting TEPSIN's role in vesicle transport and protein trafficking (Borner2012Multivariate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the TEPSIN gene, which encodes an accessory protein for the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4), have significant clinical implications. TEPSIN is crucial for the proper trafficking of ATG9A, a protein involved in autophagy, by interacting with LC3B through a LC3-Interacting Region (LIR) motif. Disruption of this interaction due to mutations in TEPSIN can lead to mis-trafficking of ATG9A, resulting in dysregulated autophagosome and autolysosome morphology. This mis-trafficking is associated with increased cytotoxicity and altered autophagosome morphology, which can contribute to cellular dysfunction (Wallace2023Tepsin).

The clinical significance of TEPSIN is also linked to its role in AP-4 deficiency syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by neurological disorders such as spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability, and seizures. Although the TEPSIN gene itself is not directly implicated in causing these conditions, its function is affected by mutations in the AP4S1 gene, which destabilize the AP-4 complex and impair tepsin's membrane association. This impairment can exacerbate the symptoms of AP-4 deficiency syndrome by disrupting normal protein sorting and trafficking processes (Hardies2014Recessive).

## Interactions
TEPSIN interacts with LC3B, a member of the mammalian ATG8 family, through a specific LC3-Interacting Region (LIR) motif. This interaction is crucial for the export and distribution of ATG9A, a protein involved in autophagosome biogenesis, from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the cell periphery (Wallace2023Tepsin). The binding between TEPSIN and LC3B is facilitated by critical aromatic residues in the LIR motif, which interact with hydrophobic pockets on LC3B, known as the LIR docking site (LDS) (Wallace2023Tepsin). This interaction is specific, as mutations in the LDS of LC3B disrupt the binding, and TEPSIN's LIR motif shows selectivity for LC3B over other mATG8 proteins like GABARAP and GABARAPL2 (Wallace2023Tepsin).

TEPSIN's interaction with LC3B is essential for the proper trafficking of ATG9A, influencing the morphology of autophagosomes and autolysosomes. The loss of TEPSIN impairs ATG9A trafficking, leading to dysregulation of autophagosome and autolysosome morphology, although it does not affect the overall autophagic flux (Wallace2023Tepsin). This interaction is transient and likely occurs at the autophagosomal membrane, affecting ATG9A distribution (Wallace2023Tepsin).
