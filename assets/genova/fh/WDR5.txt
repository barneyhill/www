# WDR5

## Overview
WDR5 (WD repeat domain 5) is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 5 protein, a member of the WD40 repeat protein family. This protein is characterized by its WD40 repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and play a crucial role in the assembly of multiprotein complexes. The WD repeat domain 5 protein is primarily known for its function as a scaffold within chromatin-modifying complexes, such as the MLL/COMPASS and NSL complexes, where it is involved in histone modification and gene expression regulation (Dias2014Structural; Schapira2017WD40). Beyond its role in chromatin dynamics, WDR5 is a multifunctional protein, or 'moonlighting' protein, with additional roles in actin organization and protein synthesis gene expression (Kulkarni2018WDR5; Bryan2020WDR5). The gene's involvement in various cellular processes and its interactions with numerous proteins underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its implications in diseases such as cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders (Blok2021A; Guarnaccia2018Moonlighting).

## Structure
WDR5 (WD repeat domain 5) is a protein characterized by its WD40 repeat domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. The primary structure of WDR5 includes multiple WD40 repeats, which contribute to its function as a scaffold within multiprotein complexes (Schapira2017WD40). The secondary structure of WDR5 is defined by a seven-bladed β-propeller fold, a common feature of WD40 proteins, providing a stable platform for interactions with other proteins and peptides (Han2006Structural; Schapira2017WD40).

The tertiary structure of WDR5 involves a central pore or 'donut hole' within the β-propeller, which is crucial for binding interactions with peptides, such as those from the histone H3 tail (Han2006Structural). This central cavity is also a potential target for drug-like small molecules due to its physicochemical properties (Schapira2017WD40).

In terms of quaternary structure, WDR5 is a component of several chromatin-modifying complexes, including the MLL/COMPASS and NSL complexes. Its interactions within these complexes are mutually exclusive, indicating a specific and regulated role in chromatin targeting and gene expression (Dias2014Structural). WDR5's ability to bind methylated histone tails, such as H3 lysine 4, is facilitated by specific structural features, including nonconventional hydrogen bonds (Han2006Structural).

## Function
WDR5 (WD repeat domain 5) is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes. It is a core component of the SET1/MLL family of histone methyltransferases, which are responsible for histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation, a modification associated with active transcription. This role is crucial for the regulation of gene expression, particularly for developmentally essential genes such as the HOX genes (Wysocka2005WDR5; Guarnaccia2018Moonlighting).

In addition to its role in chromatin modification, WDR5 has been identified as a 'moonlighting' protein, meaning it has multiple functions beyond its primary role. It is involved in the organization of actin in multiciliated cells (MCCs), where it stabilizes the actin network necessary for ciliogenesis, independent of its chromatin modification functions (Kulkarni2018WDR5). WDR5 also plays a role in protein synthesis gene expression, binding to chromatin at promoter-proximal sites enriched with DNA-binding motifs for transcription factors (Bryan2020WDR5).

WDR5 is active in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, participating in various complexes that influence chromatin structure and function. Its interactions with numerous proteins and its involvement in diverse cellular processes underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (Guarnaccia2018Moonlighting).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the WDR5 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. WDR5 is overexpressed in various cancers, including leukemia, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and neuroblastoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages (Tan2017PI3KAKTmediated; Guarnaccia2021Impact; Chen2021Targeting). In colorectal cancer, WDR5 promotes metastasis by triggering the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Tan2017PI3KAKTmediated). In neuroblastoma and glioblastoma, WDR5 acts as a transcriptional co-factor of Myc, contributing to tumor progression (Wang2020WDR5Myc).

Beyond cancer, WDR5 is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Rare de novo missense variants in WDR5 have been linked to a novel neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, speech delays, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorder (Blok2021A). These variants disrupt protein interactions within the COMPASS complex, crucial for histone modification, highlighting the gene's role in neurodevelopment (Blok2021A). The diverse clinical features associated with WDR5 mutations underscore its importance in both oncogenic processes and developmental pathways.

## Interactions
WDR5 is a versatile protein involved in numerous interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin-associated processes. It is a core component of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) complex, where it interacts with MLL1, RBBP5, and ASH2L. WDR5 binds to the MLL protein through a histone H3-like motif, utilizing the same binding pocket for both MLL and histone H3. This interaction is crucial for the methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (Song2008WDR5).

WDR5 is also part of the NSL complex, interacting with KANSL1 and KANSL2. It is essential for the assembly and chromatin targeting of the NSL complex, with specific interactions involving the WIN motif of KANSL1 (Dias2014Structural). In the NuRD complex, WDR5 interacts with the MBD3C isoform, which is specific to embryonic stem cells (Guarnaccia2018Moonlighting).

WDR5 directly interacts with transcription factors such as MYC, Oct4, Twist1, and HSF2. The interaction with MYC is particularly important for MYC's role in gene regulation and tumorigenesis, with WDR5 binding to the MbIIIb motif of MYC (Thomas2015Interaction). WDR5 also interacts with long non-coding RNAs, including HOTTIP, NeST, GClnc1, and HOXD-AS1, highlighting its role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling (Guarnaccia2018Moonlighting).
