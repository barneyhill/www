# GTF2H1

## Overview
The GTF2H1 gene encodes the general transcription factor IIH subunit 1, a critical component of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in both transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair (NER), processes essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function. As a core subunit of the TFIIH complex, GTF2H1 is involved in the unwinding of DNA, facilitating RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription and the repair of helix-distorting DNA lesions. The protein's interactions with other TFIIH subunits and DNA repair factors underscore its importance in cellular growth and response to DNA damage. Alterations in GTF2H1 expression and function have been linked to various diseases, including cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (RibeiroSilva2018DNA; Seoane2019Lineagespecific).

## Function
The GTF2H1 gene encodes a core subunit of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, which is essential for transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair (NER) in human cells. In healthy cells, GTF2H1 plays a critical role in the transcription of DNA into RNA by facilitating the unwinding of DNA around the transcription start site, which is necessary for RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription (RibeiroSilva2018DNA). 

GTF2H1 is also crucial for the NER pathway, a DNA repair mechanism that removes a wide range of helix-distorting DNA lesions. It helps anchor the TFIIH complex to chromatin and is involved in unwinding DNA to verify the presence of proper NER substrates. This process is essential for the recruitment of other NER factors to damaged DNA, facilitating the excision of damaged strands and subsequent DNA synthesis and ligation (RibeiroSilva2018DNA). 

The TFIIH complex, with GTF2H1 as a subunit, is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function by ensuring efficient transcription and DNA repair processes (RibeiroSilva2018DNA). This activity is vital for cellular growth and the response to DNA damage, impacting overall organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GTF2H1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and DNA repair disorders. In the context of lung cancer, polymorphisms in GTF2H1, such as rs3802967, have been associated with a reduced risk of lung squamous cell carcinoma, while other variants like rs4150667 have shown variable risk associations depending on factors like age and body mass index (Geng2022Impact). These findings suggest that GTF2H1 polymorphisms could be part of a genetic panel to predict lung cancer risk, although further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms involved (Geng2022Impact).

In melanoma, GTF2H1 plays a significant role in tumor progression. Its expression correlates with clinical stage indicators such as tumor thickness and depth of invasion. Depletion of GTF2H1 in melanoma cells results in significant growth inhibition and reduced tumor growth in vivo, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Seoane2019Lineagespecific). The gene's regulation by MITF, a transcription factor, further underscores its importance in maintaining transcriptional homeostasis and effective DNA repair, particularly under UV exposure (Seoane2019Lineagespecific).

## Interactions
GTF2H1, a core component of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. Within the TFIIH complex, GTF2H1 interacts with subunits such as XPB and XPD, which are essential for transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair (NER) (RibeiroSilva2018DNA). GTF2H1 also engages with the transcription factor II E (TFIIE) during the formation of the transcriptional preinitiation complex (Seoane2019Lineagespecific).

GTF2H1 plays a role in DNA repair by interacting with DNA damage recognition factors like XPC-HR23B and the 3ʹ-endonuclease XPG, facilitating the recruitment of NER complexes to DNA lesions (Seoane2019Lineagespecific). The interaction between GTF2H1 and XPG is mediated through a pleckstrin homology domain, which is crucial for effective DNA repair (Seoane2019Lineagespecific).

In the context of chromatin remodeling, GTF2H1 expression is regulated by components of the SWI/SNF complex, such as BRM and BRG1. These interactions influence the stability and function of the TFIIH complex, affecting both transcription and DNA repair processes (RibeiroSilva2018DNA).
