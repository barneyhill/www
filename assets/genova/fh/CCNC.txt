# CCNC

## Overview
Cyclin C (CCNC) is a gene that encodes the cyclin C protein, a regulatory protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and transcription. Cyclin C is categorized as a cyclin protein, which is known for its role in forming complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) to regulate the cell cycle. Specifically, cyclin C interacts with Cdk8 and Cdk3, influencing transcription and cell cycle transitions, respectively (Ganesan2019Cyclin; MartínezAlonso2020Mammalian). Beyond its nuclear functions, cyclin C is also implicated in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in response to oxidative stress, where it activates the GTPase Drp1 to induce mitochondrial fission (Ježek2019Cyclin). The CCNC gene's expression and regulation have significant implications in cancer biology, particularly in breast cancer, where it may act as a tumor suppressor (Liu2022Cyclin).

## Structure
Cyclin C (CCNC) is a protein characterized by its structural composition, which includes two distinct cyclin box domains. The primary structure of cyclin C consists of amino acid sequences that form two five-helix bundles. The N-terminal domain, known as cyclin box 1 (CB1), is primarily involved in associating with cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), particularly Cdk8, facilitating its role in transcription regulation (Ganesan2019Cyclin). The C-terminal domain, cyclin box 2 (CB2), is crucial for binding to the GTPase domain of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), playing a significant role in mitochondrial dynamics and stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfission (Ganesan2019Cyclin).

Cyclin C's secondary structure includes alpha helices that form the cyclin box fold, a common feature among cyclin family members (Ganesan2019Cyclin). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its interaction with Drp1 and Cdk8, although specific details on this folding are not provided in the context. Cyclin C's quaternary structure is defined by its ability to form complexes with Cdks, such as Cdk8, within the Mediator complex, influencing transcription regulation (Xu2011Dysregulation).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may affect cyclin C's activity and stability, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context. The presence of splice variant isoforms is not mentioned in the provided information.

## Function
Cyclin C, encoded by the CCNC gene, is a regulatory protein involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, cyclin C is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and transcription. It is involved in the transition from the G0 to G1 phase by forming complexes with cyclin-dependent kinase 3 (CDK3), which phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein (Rb1), facilitating cell cycle re-entry from quiescence (Li2014Cyclin; MartínezAlonso2020Mammalian).

Cyclin C also forms a complex with CDK8, acting as a component of the RNA polymerase II transcription initiation complexes. This complex can repress transcription by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and inhibiting the general transcription factor TFIIH (Li2014Cyclin). Cyclin C is part of the Mediator complex, influencing the transcription of stress-responsive genes and modulating RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription (Ježek2019Cyclin).

Beyond its nuclear functions, cyclin C is involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress. It translocates to the cytosol and activates the GTPase Drp1, inducing mitochondrial fission, which can lead to apoptosis or mitophagy depending on the stress context (Ježek2019Cyclin; Stieg2020The). Cyclin C's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes.

## Clinical Significance
The CCNC gene, encoding cyclin C, plays a significant role in breast cancer. Alterations in its expression are linked to the disease's progression and prognosis. In breast cancer cell lines, CCNC mRNA expression is lower compared to normal cells, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. This low expression is associated with the transcriptional regulation of the NOTCH1 oncogene, which CCNC inhibits, potentially allowing tumor cells to bypass its effects for growth (Liu2022Cyclin). Despite this, CCNC mRNA expression is higher in breast cancer and tumor-adjacent tissues compared to normal tissues, indicating its complex role in cancer biology (Liu2022Cyclin).

The expression of CCNC is also correlated with the SRC2 gene, which is upregulated in early breast cancer stages. A decrease in SRC2 expression is linked to disease progression, suggesting that CCNC may influence breast cancer through its interaction with SRC2 (Liu2022Cyclin). Additionally, CCNC is involved in the RB-E2F pathway, which is crucial during breast cancer progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic predictor (Liu2022Cyclin). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CCNC in breast cancer, although its role in other diseases is not well-documented in the provided context.

## Interactions
Cyclin C (CCNC) is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence transcriptional regulation and cellular stress responses. It forms a regulatory sub-complex with cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) and the accessory subunits Med12 and Med13, known as the CDK8-dependent kinase module (CKM). This module associates with the Mediator complex to modulate RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription (Ježek2019Cyclin; Li2014Cyclin). Cyclin C is essential for the incorporation of CDK8 into this module, and its kinase activity is dependent on cyclin C (Li2014Cyclin).

Cyclin C also interacts with CDK19 and CDK3, forming complexes that phosphorylate the intracellular domain of Notch1 (ICN1), which is crucial for its degradation via the Fbw7 ubiquitin ligase. This interaction is significant in regulating Notch signaling, which is implicated in various cancers (Ježek2019Cyclin; Li2014Cyclin).

In response to oxidative stress, cyclin C translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol, where it interacts with the mitochondrial GTPase Drp1. This interaction enhances Drp1's activity, promoting mitochondrial fission and increasing cellular sensitivity to apoptosis (Ježek2019Cyclin). These interactions highlight cyclin C's dual role in transcriptional regulation and stress response.
