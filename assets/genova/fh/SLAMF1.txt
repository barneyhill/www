# SLAMF1

## Overview
SLAMF1, or signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor protein known as CD150. This receptor is predominantly expressed on the surface of immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and macrophages, where it plays a pivotal role in modulating immune responses. The SLAMF1 protein is integral to both innate and adaptive immunity, facilitating critical signaling pathways that influence cytokine production, phagocytosis, and pathogen clearance. It is particularly involved in the TLR4-mediated TRAM-TRIF-dependent signaling pathway, which is essential for the production of interferon β and the effective killing of Gram-negative bacteria. SLAMF1's interactions with various proteins, such as TRAM and Rab11, underscore its importance in immune cell signaling and its potential implications in diseases like chronic lymphocytic leukemia and systemic lupus erythematosus (Humbel2022SLAMF; Yurchenko2018SLAMF1; Bologna2015SLAMF1).

## Function
SLAMF1, also known as CD150, is a cell surface receptor that plays a significant role in immune cell signaling, particularly in human macrophages. It is involved in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. SLAMF1 is crucial for the TLR4-mediated TRAM-TRIF-dependent signaling pathway, which is essential for the production of interferon β (IFNβ) and the killing of Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli. This process involves the recruitment of TRAM to E. coli phagosomes, a Rab11-dependent mechanism, highlighting SLAMF1's role in phagosome maturation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which are critical for bacterial killing (Yurchenko2018SLAMF1).

SLAMF1 interacts with the TLR4-TRAM-TRIF complex, specifically binding to the N-terminal part of the TRAM TIR domain, facilitating the formation of this complex necessary for LPS-mediated signaling. This interaction is vital for the activation of TBK1-IKKε kinases, which phosphorylate Akt kinase, leading to enhanced phagocytosis and immune response (Yurchenko2018SLAMF1). SLAMF1 is also involved in the regulation of cytokine production, affecting the secretion of TNF, IL-6, and CXCL10, but not IL-1β and IL-8, indicating its selective role in cytokine signaling pathways (Yurchenko2018SLAMF1).

## Clinical Significance
SLAMF1 plays a significant role in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), SLAMF1 expression is associated with patient prognosis. High SLAMF1 expression correlates with a favorable prognosis, while its loss is linked to aggressive disease, characterized by shorter treatment-free survival and overall survival. SLAMF1 influences chemotaxis and autophagy, affecting CLL cell migration and response to therapy. SLAMF1-deficient CLL cells show resistance to autophagy-inducing therapies, suggesting that SLAMF1 expression levels could determine clinical outcomes (Bologna2015SLAMF1).

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), SLAMF1 is overexpressed on T and B cells, contributing to disease pathogenesis. Altered SLAMF1 expression patterns define an immune signature specific to SLE, with increased expression correlating with disease activity. This suggests that SLAMF1 could serve as a biomarker for SLE, with potential implications for diagnosis and treatment (Humbel2022SLAMF).

In autoimmune thyroid diseases, such as Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, SLAMF1 expression is altered in lymphocytes, potentially influencing the activation of autoreactive lymphocytes and contributing to disease severity (VitalesNoyola2016Expression).

## Interactions
SLAMF1, also known as CD150, is involved in various protein interactions that influence immune cell signaling. It interacts with the TRAM protein in human macrophages, specifically binding to the N-terminal part of the TRAM TIR domain. This interaction is enhanced upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and is crucial for TLR4-mediated TRAM-TRIF-dependent signaling, which is important for the induction of interferon β (IFNβ) and bacterial killing (Yurchenko2018SLAMF1).

SLAMF1 also forms a complex with Rab11 through class I Rab11 Family Interacting Proteins (FIPs), which is essential for its recruitment to E. coli phagosomes. This interaction is dependent on the presence of GTP-bound active Rab11, indicating that Rab11 functions as a molecular switch in this process (Yurchenko2018SLAMF1).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, SLAMF1 interacts with the autophagic machinery by influencing the phosphorylation of BCL2, leading to its dissociation from beclin1 and allowing the assembly of the autophagic complex. This interaction involves proteins like beclin1 and VPS34, and is crucial for autophagic flux and drug-induced apoptosis (Bologna2015SLAMF1).

SLAMF1 also interacts with prohibitin-2 (PHB2) in CLL, which is involved in the negative regulation of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. This interaction is thought to modulate BCR pathway signaling, potentially affecting the efficacy of BCR pathway antagonists (von2020SLAMF).
