# ARPC5L

## Overview
ARPC5L is a gene that encodes the actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 5-like protein, which is a component of the Arp2/3 complex. This protein is integral to the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, particularly in the context of actin filament nucleation and branching. ARPC5L is distinct from its isoform ARPC5, as it is primarily involved in nuclear actin polymerization within CD4 T cells, a process crucial for T cell activation and regulated by nuclear calcium-calmodulin signaling and the nucleation promoting factor N-WASP (Sadhu2022ARPC5). The protein's interactions within the Arp2/3 complex and its role in mechanotransduction underscore its importance in cellular processes that respond to physiological and mechanical stimuli (Häupl2016Protein; Chung2024A).

## Function
ARPC5L is a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, which is essential for actin filament nucleation and branching, playing a critical role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics. In healthy human cells, ARPC5L is involved in distinct actin remodeling events, particularly in CD4 T cells. It is crucial for nuclear actin polymerization (NFA) in response to T cell activation, a process regulated by nuclear calcium-calmodulin signaling and the nucleation promoting factor N-WASP (Sadhu2022ARPC5). This specific pathway allows ARPC5L to mediate the formation of thin and dynamic actin filaments, which may influence transcriptional regulation following T cell receptor (TCR) engagement (Sadhu2022ARPC5).

ARPC5L's role is distinct from that of ARPC5, another isoform in the Arp2/3 complex, which is more involved in cytoplasmic actin polymerization and DNA replication stress responses (Sadhu2022ARPC5). The presence of ARPC5L in the Arp2/3 complex is associated with the formation of actin structures that are sensitive to specific cellular signals, highlighting its importance in tailoring actin dynamics to physiological stimuli (Sadhu2022ARPC5).

## Interactions
ARPC5L is a component of the ARP2/3 complex, which plays a crucial role in actin nucleation and branching. It interacts with other subunits of the ARP2/3 complex, including ARPC1, ARPC2, ARPC3, ARPC4, ARPC5, ARP2, and ARP3, to facilitate actin polymerization (Häupl2016Protein). ARPC5L is involved in nuclear actin filament formation in CD4 T cells, a process regulated by nuclear calcium-calmodulin signaling and the nucleation promoting factor N-WASP (Sadhu2022ARPC5). This interaction suggests that ARPC5L may influence the sensitivity of the Arp2/3 complex to activation by N-WASP-calcium-calmodulin, although the exact molecular interactions remain unclear (Sadhu2022ARPC5).

In the context of mechanotransduction, ARPC5L interacts with the talin rod domain, specifically binding to cryptic sites within the talin structure under mechanical tension. This interaction is mediated by the second rod domain helix bundle, R2, and is facilitated by the mechanical extension of the protein, which can be modulated by a DNA-based molecular clamp (Chung2024A). These interactions highlight ARPC5L's role in actin dynamics and its involvement in cellular processes that respond to mechanical forces.
