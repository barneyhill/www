# OSBP2

## Overview
Oxysterol-binding protein 2 (OSBP2) is a gene that encodes the protein oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 2 (ORP2), which is a member of the intracellular lipid-binding/transport protein family. ORP2 is primarily involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, signaling, and actin cytoskeletal regulation. Unlike other oxysterol-binding proteins, ORP2 lacks a membrane-targeting pleckstrin homology domain, existing only as a 'short' variant (Olkkonen2019OSBPrelated). The protein plays a crucial role in cholesterol transport and metabolism, influencing cellular cholesterol efflux and triglyceride metabolism. It also interacts with various proteins to regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics and is involved in critical signaling pathways, such as the RhoA signaling pathway, which affects cell shape and movement (Kentala2018Analysis). Clinically, mutations in the OSBP2 gene are associated with hearing loss, highlighting its significance in auditory function and cellular signaling (Xing2015Identification; Shi2022Mutations).

## Function
OSBP2, also known as oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 2 (ORP2), is involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, signaling, and actin cytoskeletal regulation. ORP2 is a member of the intracellular lipid-binding/transport proteins family and is unique among mammalian ORPs for lacking a membrane-targeting pleckstrin homology domain, existing only as a 'short' variant (Olkkonen2019OSBPrelated).

ORP2 plays a significant role in cholesterol transport and metabolism. It enhances cellular cholesterol efflux and is involved in the transport of cholesterol to the plasma membrane in exchange for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2), thereby affecting the concentrations of these lipids (Olkkonen2019OSBPrelated). ORP2 is also implicated in triglyceride metabolism, as its knock-out in hepatoma cells results in reduced triglyceride storage and synthesis, linked to decreased expression of the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP-1 and its target genes (Olkkonen2019OSBPrelated).

In addition to its role in lipid metabolism, ORP2 is involved in actin cytoskeletal regulation. It interacts with actin-regulatory proteins and is linked to the RhoA signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell shape, polarity, and locomotion through actin polymerization (Kentala2018Analysis). ORP2's interaction with the Cdc37-Hsp90 chaperone complex is essential for Akt activity, influencing glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, and glycolysis (Kentala2018OSBPrelated). ORP2 localizes at cytoplasmic lipid droplets and endoplasmic-reticulum-lipid droplet contact sites, influencing triglyceride metabolism and steroid hormone synthesis (Olkkonen2019OSBPrelated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OSBPL2 gene are associated with various forms of hearing loss. OSBPL2 has been identified as a novel candidate gene for progressive nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), with specific mutations such as a heterozygous frameshift mutation (c.153_154delCT) and a missense mutation (c.583C>A) linked to hearing loss in affected individuals (Xing2015Identification). These mutations are predicted to be functionally deleterious, potentially affecting the protein's ability to bind ligands and cell receptors, contributing to hearing loss (Xing2015Identification).

OSBPL2 is also implicated in autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL), specifically mapped to the DFNA67 locus. A frameshift mutation, c.141_142delTG, has been identified in a family with early-onset hearing loss, initially affecting high frequencies and progressing to profound deafness (Thoenes2015OSBPL2).

Additionally, OSBPL2 deficiency is linked to hearing loss associated with primary cilia defects via the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway. This deficiency leads to ciliary defects and impaired Shh signaling, resulting in progressive hearing loss and abnormal cochlear development (Shi2022Mutations). These findings highlight the clinical significance of OSBPL2 mutations in hearing disorders.

## Interactions
OSBP2, also known as ORP4, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with the carboxy-terminus of ITPR1, linking inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium release, which is essential for cellular calcium homeostasis and NFAT activation, promoting cell proliferation (Olkkonen2022The). ORP4 also forms a signaling complex at the plasma membrane with CD3ε, Gαq/11, and phospholipase C β3 (PLCβ3), facilitating IP3 production, calcium release, and mitochondrial respiration, which are critical for the survival of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells (Olkkonen2022The).

In addition, ORP4 interacts with the vimentin network, although the functional relevance of this interaction is not fully understood (Charman2014Oxysterolbinding). The protein is also implicated in the anticancer activity of certain natural products, known as ORPphilins, which inhibit 25-hydroxycholesterol binding to ORP4 and OSBP (Charman2014Oxysterolbinding). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of OSBP2 in cellular signaling and cancer cell survival.
