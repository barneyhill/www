# EHF

## Overview
The EHF gene encodes the ETS homologous factor, a transcription factor belonging to the ETS family, which is characterized by a conserved ETS DNA-binding domain. This domain is essential for the protein's ability to bind specific DNA sequences, thereby regulating gene expression. EHF plays a pivotal role in epithelial tissue homeostasis, particularly in the epidermis and colon, by influencing cellular differentiation and maintaining structural integrity. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the modulation of MAP kinase signaling pathways, and acts as a transcriptional repressor in certain contexts. EHF's function is further modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, such as ETS1 and ZEB1, which are crucial for its role in suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes in cancer cells. The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in several cancers, where it can function as either a tumor suppressor or promoter, depending on the cancer type and context (Reehorst2021EHF; Sakamoto2021EHF; Shi2016Increased).

## Structure
The EHF (ETS homologous factor) protein is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, characterized by a conserved ETS DNA-binding domain. This domain is crucial for its function, allowing EHF to bind to specific DNA sequences known as ETS-binding sites (EBS) (Shi2016Increased). The EHF protein also contains a pointed (PNT) domain, which is similar to the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, involved in protein-protein interactions and other cellular functions (Luk2018ELF3).

EHF exists in two splice variant isoforms: a long form (EHF-LF) and a short form (EHF-SF). The long form includes an additional 22 amino acids from the first exon, while the short form lacks this sequence (Sakamoto2021EHF). EHF-SF is primarily localized in the nucleus and is involved in degrading ETS1 proteins, whereas EHF-LF is found in the cytoplasm or perinuclear region (Sakamoto2021EHF).

Post-translational modifications of EHF include phosphorylation, acetylation, sumoylation, ubiquitinylation, and glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions with other proteins (Shi2016Increased). Mutations within the ETS domain, such as L285P, can impair EHF's function, highlighting the importance of this domain for its anti-EMT effects (Sakamoto2021EHF).

## Function
The EHF gene encodes a transcription factor that is crucial for maintaining homeostasis in epithelial tissues, particularly in the epidermis and colon. EHF is involved in the differentiation of keratinocytes, which are essential for the skin's barrier function, by regulating approximately 400 genes associated with this process (Reehorst2021EHF). In the intestinal epithelium, EHF influences the differentiation of goblet cells, which are vital for mucin production and the protection of the colonic epithelium (Reehorst2021EHF). EHF also plays a role in modulating the nuclear response to MAP kinase signaling cascades, which are involved in various cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and migration (Tugores2001The).

In terms of molecular activity, EHF acts as a transcriptional repressor in a context-dependent manner, particularly in epithelial cells. It represses the transcriptional activation of certain promoters that contain ETS and AP-1 binding sites, which are downstream targets of MAP kinase signaling cascades (Tugores2001The). EHF's role in epithelial cell biology is underscored by its involvement in maintaining the structural integrity and function of epithelial tissues, as its absence can lead to significant pathological changes, including increased susceptibility to colitis and tumor formation in the colon (Reehorst2021EHF).

## Clinical Significance
The EHF gene is implicated in various cancers, with its role varying depending on the cancer type. In prostate cancer, EHF functions as a tumor suppressor. Its loss is associated with the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-NEPC). EHF loss leads to increased expression of EZH2, promoting aggressive cancer traits and resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (Long2021Loss). In prostate cancer, EHF also regulates the Lin28/let-7 axis, and its loss results in a cancer stem cell-like phenotype, contributing to tumorigenicity and metastasis (Albino2016Activation).

In gastric cancer, EHF amplifications are linked to poor outcomes, and its knockdown inhibits cancer cell proliferation and survival, suggesting a potential tumor suppressive role (Luk2018ELF3). Conversely, in ovarian cancer, EHF overexpression correlates with poor survival, while its knockdown reduces cell proliferation and migration (Luk2018ELF3). EHF also acts as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer, where its downregulation is associated with poor outcomes and increased metastasis (Luk2018ELF3). These findings highlight the complex role of EHF in cancer, where its expression and function can significantly impact disease progression and patient prognosis.

## Interactions
EHF (ETS homologous factor) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence cancer progression and tissue homeostasis. In gastric cancer, EHF directly binds to the HER2 promoter, enhancing its activity and activating downstream MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. This interaction is confirmed through luciferase reporter gene assays and EMSA, demonstrating EHF's binding to an ETS responsive element within the HER2 promoter (Shi2016Increased).

In prostate cancer, EHF re-expression inhibits stem-like properties and promotes epithelial differentiation by repressing EMT drivers and the Lin28a/b RNA binding proteins, while promoting let-7 miRNAs. EHF also represses IL-6 by binding its promoter, affecting STAT3 signaling (Luk2018ELF3).

EHF interacts with ETS1 and ZEB1 proteins, particularly through its short form (EHF-SF), which inhibits ETS1-mediated activation of the ZEB1 promoter by promoting the degradation of ETS1 proteins. This interaction leads to the suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes in cancer cells (Sakamoto2021EHF).

EHF's role as a transcription factor involves binding to specific DNA sequences, such as the ETS-binding site (EBS), to regulate gene expression, as seen in its interaction with the HER2 promoter in gastric cancer (Shi2016Increased).
