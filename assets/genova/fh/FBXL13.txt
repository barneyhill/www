# FBXL13

## Overview
FBXL13 is a gene that encodes the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 13, a member of the F-box protein family. These proteins are characterized by an F-box motif, which is approximately 40 amino acids in length and is crucial for protein-protein interactions. The F-box proteins are one of the four subunits of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein), which plays a pivotal role in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The leucine-rich repeat region of FBXL13 is involved in protein-protein interactions, contributing to the specificity of substrate recognition. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation, by targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
