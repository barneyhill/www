# PXDC1

## Overview
PXDC1 is a gene that encodes the PX domain containing 1 protein, which is characterized by the presence of a Phox (PX) domain. This domain is typically involved in phosphoinositide binding, suggesting a role in cellular signaling pathways. The PXDC1 protein is implicated in various biological processes, including potential interactions with other proteins and environmental factors. Notably, PXDC1 has been associated with the repression in response to environmental pollutants and has been linked to chemotherapy resistance in certain cancer cell lines, indicating its potential significance in environmental and clinical contexts (Mozaffari2018Parent; Jehl2020An; Malik2017Structural). Despite these associations, the precise biological functions and interactions of PXDC1 remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
PXDC1 (PX domain containing 1) is a protein that has been identified to potentially interact with other proteins, although specific details about these interactions are limited. In the context of the FAM26F protein interaction network, PXDC1 is predicted to interact with FAM26F, as determined using the STRING database with a medium confidence score. However, the specific nature and functional implications of this interaction are not detailed (Malik2017Structural).

Additionally, PXDC1 has been noted for its repression in the liver of mice and rats exposed to TCDD, a dioxin pollutant. This suggests a possible interaction with environmental factors affecting its expression. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of PXDC1 using a CRISPR system has been shown to increase the survival of an acute myeloid leukemia cell line exposed to cytarabine, indicating a role in chemotherapy resistance (Jehl2020An).

PXDC1 is also highlighted as a potentially new imprinted gene due to its asymmetrical expression pattern, suggesting it may have unique regulatory interactions at the genetic level (Mozaffari2018Parent). Despite these findings, specific protein-protein interactions involving PXDC1 remain largely unexplored in the current literature.
