# UBAC1

## Overview
UBAC1 (UBA domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of ubiquitination pathways, which are critical for protein degradation and cellular signaling processes. The protein encoded by UBAC1 is a non-catalytic subunit of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase KPC complex, which plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitination and degradation of specific proteins, such as p27 (Kip1), thereby influencing cell proliferation (Mazzone2020UBAC1KPC2). Additionally, UBAC1 is involved in modulating NF-κB signaling through its interaction with the CARMA2sh/TANK complex, impacting inflammatory responses and skin homeostasis (Mazzone2020UBAC1KPC2). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions, including inflammatory skin disorders and immune deficiencies (Etzioni2017Immune; Kanda2021Psoriasis:).

## Function
UBAC1 (UBA domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in ubiquitin-mediated processes, particularly in the regulation of ubiquitination pathways in human cells. The UBAC1 protein is a non-catalytic subunit of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase KPC complex, which includes the catalytic subunit KPC1 and KPC2/UBAC1. This complex is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of proteins, such as p27 (Kip1), through K48-linked ubiquitination, a process crucial for controlling cell proliferation (Mazzone2020UBAC1KPC2).

UBAC1 also promotes K63-linked ubiquitination of the TANK protein, which is part of a complex with CARMA2sh that regulates NF-κB signaling. This signaling pathway is essential for controlling inflammatory responses and maintaining skin homeostasis (Mazzone2020UBAC1KPC2). In human keratinocytes, UBAC1 modulates the NF-κB-inducing activity of CARMA2sh by altering the ubiquitination state of TANK, thereby playing a regulatory role in immune signaling pathways (Mazzone2020UBAC1KPC2).

In experiments with human keratinocytes, UBAC1 was shown to accelerate cell proliferation and cluster formation, indicating its role in cell viability and growth. Conversely, silencing UBAC1 resulted in slower cell growth, suggesting its significant role in regulating cell proliferation and inflammatory signaling pathways in healthy human cells (Mazzone2020UBAC1KPC2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the UBAC1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving inflammatory and immune responses. UBAC1 interacts with the CARD14/CARMA2sh-TANK complex, playing a crucial role in modulating NF-κB signaling pathways in keratinocytes. Alterations in this interaction can lead to inflammatory skin disorders, such as familial psoriasis, where mutations in CARMA2 are known to exacerbate the condition (Kanda2021Psoriasis:; Mazzone2020UBAC1KPC2). UBAC1's role in promoting K63-linked ubiquitination of TANK is significant in regulating inflammatory responses, and its dysregulation can lead to increased inflammatory gene expression (Mazzone2020UBAC1KPC2).

In addition to its role in skin inflammation, UBAC1 is part of the KIP1 ubiquitination-promoting complex, which is essential for the proper functioning of the NF-κB transcription factor. Defects in this complex can lead to immune deficiencies, highlighting the importance of UBAC1 in immune regulation (Etzioni2017Immune). Furthermore, UBAC1 has been associated with degenerative processes in intervertebral discs, suggesting its involvement in lysosomal and proteasomal degradation pathways (Liu2019Molecular). These findings underscore the clinical significance of UBAC1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
UBAC1, a non-catalytic subunit of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase KPC complex, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the CARD14/CARMA2sh protein, a key player in the activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor involved in inflammatory responses. This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed in mammalian cells, including HEK293T and HaCaT cells, using co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays (Mazzone2020UBAC1KPC2).

UBAC1 is also part of the CARMA2sh/TANK complex, where it modulates the ubiquitination of TANK, affecting NF-κB signaling. This modulation is crucial for balancing inflammatory and antiviral responses in keratinocytes, particularly in response to TLR3 agonists like poly (I:C) (Mazzone2020UBAC1KPC2). UBAC1 promotes K63- and K29-linked ubiquitination of TANK, which is significant for regulating NF-κB pathways (Mazzone2020UBAC1KPC2).

Additionally, UBAC1 has been shown to interact with ubiquitin chains, with a preference for specific chain lengths, indicating its role in ubiquitin-binding processes (Lutz2020The). These interactions highlight UBAC1's involvement in ubiquitination pathways and its potential impact on inflammatory skin disorders.
