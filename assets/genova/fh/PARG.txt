# PARG

## Overview
Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) is an enzyme encoded by the PARG gene, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, a post-translational modification critical for DNA repair and cellular homeostasis. As a hydrolase, PARG is responsible for the catabolism of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chains, which are synthesized by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) (Davidovic2001Importance; Bonicalzi2005PolyADPribosylation). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining genomic stability and modulating chromatin structure, thereby facilitating access to DNA lesions for repair processes (Min2010Deletion). PARG's structure is characterized by a catalytic domain with a macrodomain fold, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Tucker2012Structures). The gene produces multiple isoforms that localize to different cellular compartments, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria, each potentially exhibiting distinct regulatory and catalytic properties (Tucker2012Structures). PARG's interactions with various proteins involved in DNA repair, RNA metabolism, and cell cycle regulation underscore its multifaceted role in cellular function and stress response (Isabelle2010Investigation).

## Structure
The human poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) enzyme is characterized by a catalytic domain with a macrodomain fold, essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain features a mixed beta-sheet core flanked by alpha-helices, forming a central cleft that serves as the primary ADP-ribose binding site and catalytic center (Tucker2012Structures). The PARG catalytic domain includes a conserved PARG-signature motif, GGG-X6-8-QEE, which is crucial for orienting catalytic residues and facilitating the hydrolysis of ADP-ribose polymers (Kim2012Structure; Barkauskaite2015Structures).

PARG is composed of several domains, including a macrodomain and an accessory domain that together form the minimal catalytic region, and a less conserved regulatory domain (Barkauskaite2015Structures). The enzyme also contains a unique 'tyrosine clasp' that plays a critical role in substrate binding (Kim2012Structure).

PARG exists in multiple isoforms, including nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial forms, all derived from the same transcript (Tucker2012Structures). These isoforms may differ in their regulatory and catalytic properties, influenced by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. The mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) is noted for its role in enzymatic activity and structural stability (Kim2012Structure).

## Function
Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) is a critical enzyme in the regulation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, a post-translational modification that plays a significant role in DNA repair, genomic stability, and cell death. PARG is responsible for the catabolism of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chains, reversing the modifications added by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) (Davidovic2001Importance; Bonicalzi2005PolyADPribosylation). This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of excessively modified proteins, which could interfere with cellular processes (Harrision2020Poly(ADP-Ribose) page 2 of 8).

PARG is primarily active in the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences DNA repair processes, including single-strand break repair (SSBR) and double-strand break repair (DSBR) (Harrision2020Poly(ADP-Ribose) page 6 of 8). It facilitates the removal of PAR chains from proteins, ensuring efficient DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability (Min2010Deletion). PARG's activity is crucial for modulating chromatin structure, allowing repair enzymes access to DNA lesions (Davidovic2001Importance). The enzyme also plays a role in regulating NAD+ consumption, recycling it after PARP activation to prevent excessive depletion, which could lead to apoptosis (Harrision2020Poly(ADP-Ribose) page 6 of 8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PARG gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In cancer, PARG mutations have been identified in triple-negative breast cancer and high-grade serous ovarian cancers, contributing to resistance against PARP inhibitors, a class of drugs used in cancer therapy. This resistance is linked to increased PARP1 auto-PARylation, which reduces PARP trapping and restores PARP signaling, thereby diminishing the efficacy of PARP inhibitors (Slade2020PARP).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, PARG expression is regulated by the RNA-binding protein HuR. Alterations in this regulatory pathway can affect DNA repair and resistance to PARP inhibitors. Targeting the HuR/PARG axis has been proposed to enhance the efficacy of PARP inhibitors, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy (Chand2017Posttranscriptional).

In neurodegenerative diseases, PARG dysfunction has been linked to progressive neurodegeneration in Drosophila models, characterized by the accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose) in the central nervous system. This accumulation leads to neurodegenerative changes, such as the absence of normal axon structures and cell death, providing insights into conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (Hanai2003Loss).

## Interactions
PARG (poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. PARG interacts with PARP1 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) in the context of DNA repair mechanisms, particularly in the theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ) pathway. PARP1 facilitates the recruitment of DNA polymerase theta (Polθ) to DNA damage sites through PARylation, which PARG subsequently modulates by removing repressive poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) marks, thus activating Polθ for DNA repair (Vekariya2024PARG).

PARG also interacts with various proteins involved in RNA metabolism and splicing. It associates with components of the spliceosome C complex, such as hnRNP M and hnRNP U, and other splicing factors like ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX5 and hnRNP A1. These interactions suggest a role for PARG in regulating RNA-binding and splicing activities (Isabelle2010Investigation).

Additionally, PARG is part of multiprotein complexes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. It interacts with proteins involved in these processes, indicating its broader role in cellular homeostasis and response to stress (Isabelle2010Investigation). These interactions highlight PARG's multifaceted role in maintaining genomic integrity and cellular function.
