# LTV1

## Overview
LTV1 is a gene that encodes the LTV1 ribosome biogenesis factor, a protein integral to the assembly and maturation of the small ribosomal subunit, specifically the 40S subunit, in eukaryotic cells. This protein is categorized as a ribosome biogenesis factor and is primarily active within the nucleolus and cytoplasm, where it orchestrates the assembly of ribosomal proteins and the folding of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (Collins2018Ribosome; Blomqvist2023A). LTV1 interacts with several ribosomal proteins, such as Rps3, Rps10, and Asc1/RACK1, and plays a pivotal role in the hierarchical organization of ribosomal protein binding and rRNA folding, ensuring efficient ribosome assembly (Collins2018Ribosome). The protein's function is critical for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the ribosomal small subunit, which is essential for protein synthesis and mRNA surveillance (Blomqvist2023A).

## Function
LTV1 is a ribosome biogenesis factor that plays a critical role in the assembly and maturation of the small ribosomal subunit, particularly the 40S subunit, in eukaryotic cells. It is primarily active in the nucleolus and cytoplasm, where it facilitates the proper assembly of ribosomal proteins and the folding of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (Collins2018Ribosome; Blomqvist2023A). LTV1 is involved in the hierarchical organization of ribosomal protein binding and rRNA folding, ensuring efficient assembly of the 40S subunit, which is essential for protein synthesis and mRNA surveillance (Blomqvist2023A).

LTV1 interacts with several ribosomal proteins, such as Rps3, Rps10, and Asc1/RACK1, facilitating their incorporation into the small ribosomal subunit (Collins2018Ribosome). It also plays a role in delaying the recruitment of certain ribosomal proteins, which affects the acquisition of RNA structure and ensures the correct sequence of protein recruitment and release during ribosome biogenesis (Blomqvist2023A). The phosphorylation-dependent release of LTV1 is crucial for the maturation of the small ribosomal subunit, as it allows for structural rearrangements necessary for the proper positioning of ribosomal proteins (Collins2018Ribosome; Blomqvist2023A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LTV1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In zebrafish, knockout of the ltv1 gene results in disrupted ribosome biogenesis, leading to developmental defects such as hypoplastic craniofacial cartilage, digestive organ dysplasia, and impaired hematopoiesis. These phenotypes are associated with decreased cell proliferation rather than increased apoptosis, and the defects appear to be independent of the P53 pathway (Zhang2021The).

In humans, a mutation analogous to the Ltv1_L216S mutation in yeast, known as Ltv1_N168S, is associated with LIPHAK syndrome, a rare dermatological disorder characterized by altered skin pigmentation due to subcutaneous oxygenation defects. This mutation impairs ribosome assembly by affecting the phosphorylation-dependent release of Ltv1, leading to its accumulation in pre-40S ribosomes and preventing the proper release of other assembly factors (Blomqvist2023A).

In cancer, particularly breast cancer, altered LTV1 expression results in ribosomes with substoichiometric levels of ribosomal proteins, which may disrupt protein homeostasis and support tumor development. This insufficiency is linked to defects in stop codon recognition, suggesting a potential impact on translational fidelity in cancer cells (Collins2018Ribosome).

## Interactions
LTV1 is a ribosome biogenesis factor that plays a crucial role in the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit by interacting with various ribosomal proteins and rRNA elements. It is involved in the recruitment and positioning of ribosomal proteins such as Rps3, Rps10, Rps20, and Rps29. LTV1 orchestrates the recruitment of Rps29 by delaying the binding of Rps20, which is essential for the proper docking of rRNA helices (Blomqvist2023A). It also facilitates the recruitment of Rps31 by enabling the rotation of Tsr1, which is necessary for LTV1 dissociation and subsequent binding of Enp1 (Blomqvist2023A).

LTV1 interacts with the C-terminal tail of Rps15 and Tsr1, forming a functional network that is crucial for ribosome assembly. The L216S mutation in LTV1 disrupts these interactions, affecting the positioning of the LTV1 C-terminal tail and its interaction with Rps15, which in turn impacts the movement of Tsr1 (Blomqvist2023A). In yeast cells lacking LTV1, there is a mispositioning of the Rps3 tail, which affects the recruitment of Asc1 to the 40S ribosomal subunit (Collins2018Ribosome). These interactions highlight the importance of LTV1 in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the ribosomal small subunit.
