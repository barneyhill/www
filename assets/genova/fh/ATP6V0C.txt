# ATP6V0C

## Overview
The ATP6V0C gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, specifically within the V0 domain. This protein, known as ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit c, is integral to the membrane and plays a pivotal role in proton transport across cellular membranes, contributing to the acidification of intracellular compartments such as lysosomes and endosomes. As a transmembrane protein, ATP6V0C is essential for the rotary mechanism of the V-ATPase, facilitating the movement of protons necessary for maintaining cellular pH balance and supporting various cellular processes, including protein degradation and neurotransmitter release. Mutations in ATP6V0C have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy, highlighting its significance in neurological health (Son2019Vacuolar; Mattison2022ATP6V0C; Waheed2020The).

## Structure
The ATP6V0C gene encodes a protein that is a component of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, specifically part of the V0 domain. This protein is integral to the membrane and plays a crucial role in proton transport across membranes, contributing to the acidification of intracellular compartments (Mattison2022ATP6V0C). The primary structure of ATP6V0C includes specific amino acid sequences that form part of the c-ring structure within the V0 domain, which is essential for the rotary mechanism of the V-ATPase (Mattison2022ATP6V0C).

The secondary structure of ATP6V0C likely includes transmembrane domains, as it is described to have four transmembrane domains (TM), with TM2 and TM4 being outward-facing and interacting with other subunits during the rotary process (Mattison2022ATP6V0C). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these transmembrane domains to facilitate their function in proton translocation.

In terms of quaternary structure, ATP6V0C forms part of a c-ring composed of nine copies of itself and one copy of ATP6V0B, which rotates within the membrane to deliver protons to the ATP6V0A subunit (Mattison2022ATP6V0C). This assembly is crucial for the V-ATPase's function in maintaining cellular pH balance. Variants in ATP6V0C, particularly those affecting the transmembrane domains, can disrupt its function and are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (Mattison2022ATP6V0C).

## Function
The ATP6V0C gene encodes a subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is essential for proton transport across cellular membranes. This complex functions as an ATP-driven proton pump, crucial for acidifying intracellular compartments such as lysosomes, endosomes, and the Golgi apparatus (Zou2017Silencing; Mattison2022ATP6V0C). The V-ATPase is composed of two main domains: the peripheral V1 domain, responsible for ATP hydrolysis, and the integral V0 domain, which translocates protons through a rotational mechanism. ATP6V0C forms part of the V0 domain, specifically contributing to the intramembrane c-ring that facilitates proton movement (Mattison2022ATP6V0C).

In healthy cells, ATP6V0C is involved in maintaining the pH gradient between the cytoplasm and lysosomal compartments, which is vital for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release (Zou2017Silencing; Son2019Vacuolar). The acidification process is necessary for the activation of lysosomal hydrolases, which degrade cellular components, and for the proper functioning of autophagic processes, including the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes (Ren2024Impaired). ATP6V0C's role in these processes is critical for cellular homeostasis and normal cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP6V0C gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, often accompanied by epilepsy. Variants in ATP6V0C have been identified in patients with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and early onset epilepsy, with the mean age of seizure onset being approximately 24.6 months (Mattison2022ATP6V0C). Specific mutations, such as p.Ala22Thr and p.Thr121Profs*7, have been linked to febrile seizures and epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (Tian2022ATP6V0C). These mutations can disrupt the V-ATPase function, which is crucial for cellular processes, leading to neurological symptoms (Mattison2022ATP6V0C).

The gene is also implicated in 16p13.3 microdeletion syndrome, which includes microcephaly, seizures, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Haploinsufficiency of ATP6V0C is suggested to underlie these phenotypes (Tinker2020Haploinsufficiency). In model organisms, knockdown or expression of ATP6V0C variants results in increased seizure duration and motor dysfunction, supporting its role in maintaining neurological health (Mattison2022ATP6V0C). Additionally, ATP6V0C mutations have been linked to the accumulation of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases, indicating its broader impact on neurological conditions (Mangieri2014ATP6V0C).

## Interactions
The ATP6V0C protein, a subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, participates in several important protein interactions. It is a component of the c-ring in the V0 domain of V-ATPase, which is essential for proton translocation across membranes. This interaction is crucial for the rotary mechanism of the V-ATPase, where ATP6V0C interacts with the ATP6V0A subunit during ATP hydrolysis. The transmembrane domains 2 and 4 of ATP6V0C are particularly involved in this interaction, which is necessary for the proper function of the V-ATPase complex (Mattison2022ATP6V0C).

ATP6V0C also interacts with tetherin, a host protein that restricts HIV-1 release. This interaction stabilizes tetherin by preventing its degradation, leading to its accumulation in intracellular compartments. ATP6V0C's role in tetherin stabilization is independent of the viral protein Vpu, although ATP6V0C also interacts with Vpu, forming a trimeric complex with tetherin. This complex is involved in the lysosomal degradation pathway, which is crucial for Vpu-mediated tetherin degradation and HIV-1 release (Waheed2020The; Waheed2020Thea).
