# RAB11FIP2

## Overview
RAB11FIP2 is a gene that encodes the RAB11 family interacting protein 2, a crucial component in intracellular membrane trafficking. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of endosomal recycling processes, interacting with Rab GTPases such as Rab11, Rab14, and Rab25 to facilitate vesicle transport and membrane recycling. RAB11 family interacting protein 2 is characterized by its C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which is essential for homodimerization and protein interactions, including those with Rab11 and VE-cadherin (Royo2019A; Yan2016Rab11a). The protein plays significant roles in synaptic plasticity, particularly during long-term potentiation, and in the phagocytosis of bacteria by macrophages, highlighting its importance in both neuronal function and immune response (Royo2019A; Skjesol2019The). Additionally, RAB11FIP2 has been implicated in various cancers, acting as either a tumor promoter or suppressor depending on the context, which underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Dong2018Overexpression; Dong2019Rab11FIP2).

## Structure
RAB11FIP2, also known as Rab11 family interacting protein 2, is characterized by several structural features that facilitate its role in endosomal recycling. The protein contains a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which is involved in homodimerization and interaction with other proteins (Royo2019A). This domain also includes a Rab-binding domain (RBD) that allows interaction with Rab11, although certain mutations can disrupt this binding without affecting other interactions (Royo2019A; Yan2016Rab11a). 

The C-terminal region of RAB11FIP2, specifically amino acids 453-512, is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as VE-cadherin, through a distinct binding site separate from the Rab11 binding site (Yan2016Rab11a). This region is also involved in the protein's role in synaptic delivery during long-term potentiation, where it interacts with AMPA receptors (Royo2019A).

RAB11FIP2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions and functions. For instance, phosphorylation at serine 227 is significant in the context of synaptic potentiation (Royo2019A). The protein may exist in multiple splice variants, potentially altering its structure and cellular roles.

## Function
RAB11FIP2 (RAB11 family interacting protein 2) is a key player in intracellular membrane trafficking, particularly in recycling endosomes. It interacts with Rab GTPases, including Rab11, Rab14, and Rab25, to regulate vesicle transport and membrane recycling processes. This protein is involved in various cellular functions such as endosomal retrieval systems, synaptic vesicle trafficking, and TLR4-mediated phagocytosis (Kearney2020Crystal).

In neurons, RAB11FIP2 is crucial for synaptic plasticity, particularly during long-term potentiation (LTP). It regulates the trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) by acting as a retention factor, preventing their synaptic delivery under normal conditions. Upon LTP induction, RAB11FIP2 dissociates from AMPARs, allowing their synaptic delivery, which is essential for synaptic plasticity and receptor recycling (Royo2019A).

RAB11FIP2 also plays a significant role in the phagocytosis of bacteria by human macrophages. It forms a complex with TRAM and Rab11, which is crucial for the uptake and processing of bacteria like E. coli. This interaction facilitates actin remodeling and the activation of actin-regulatory GTPases, which are necessary for effective phagocytosis (Skjesol2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of RAB11FIP2 have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance. In colorectal cancer (CRC), RAB11FIP2 is overexpressed, which is associated with increased tumor migration, angiogenesis, and poor patient survival. This overexpression enhances the migratory and metastatic capabilities of CRC cells, partly through increased secretion of PAI-1, a protein that promotes tumor invasion and angiogenesis (Dong2018Overexpression). The interaction between RAB11FIP2 and the long non-coding RNA CASC11 also plays a role in CRC progression by regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation (Zhang2021The).

In contrast, RAB11FIP2 expression is significantly reduced in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it appears to act as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation is associated with larger tumor size and lymph node metastasis, and is partly due to hypermethylation of the gene. Restoring RAB11FIP2 expression in NSCLC cells inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Dong2019Rab11FIP2). These findings underscore the dual role of RAB11FIP2 in cancer, acting as either a tumor promoter or suppressor depending on the cancer type.

## Interactions
RAB11FIP2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It forms a complex with TRAM (TRIF-related adaptor molecule) and Rab11a, which is enhanced by E. coli stimulation, and is crucial for the phagocytosis of Gram-negative bacteria like E. coli in macrophages (Skjesol2019The). The interaction between RAB11FIP2 and TRAM is essential for the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 Rho GTPases, which are important for actin dynamics and phagocytosis (Skjesol2019The). RAB11FIP2 also interacts with the glycolytic kinase PGK1, promoting its ubiquitination and leading to the inactivation of the oncogenic AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, suggesting a tumor suppressor role in non-small cell lung cancer (Dong2019Rab11FIP2).

RAB11FIP2 is involved in the recycling of VE-cadherin in endothelial cells, forming a ternary complex with Rab11a and VE-cadherin, which is crucial for maintaining endothelial barrier integrity (Yan2016Rab11a). It also interacts with AMPA receptor subunit GluA1, independently of Rab11 binding, and regulates AMPA receptor synaptic delivery during long-term potentiation (Royo2019A). These interactions highlight RAB11FIP2's role in membrane trafficking and cellular signaling pathways.
