# ASB6

## Overview
The ASB6 gene encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 6, which is primarily expressed in adipocytes and plays a significant role in the insulin signaling pathway. This protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains and a SOCS box, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and the formation of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, respectively. ASB6 facilitates the recruitment of elongins B and C to the insulin receptor signaling complex, contributing to the regulation of insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Additionally, ASB6 is implicated in protein degradation pathways, influencing cellular processes such as signal transduction and protein turnover. The gene's expression has been linked to various cancers, where it serves as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target due to its role in promoting cell migration and influencing immune responses (Hu2024ASB6; Anasa2018Multifaceted; Wilcox2004Asb6).

## Structure
ASB6 is a protein characterized by a 418 amino acid sequence, featuring a novel N-terminal region, six ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal SOCS box. The ankyrin repeats, spanning amino acids 65-286, are involved in protein-protein interactions and contribute to the protein's secondary structure by forming helix-loop-helix motifs (Anasa2018Multifaceted; Wilcox2004Asb6). The SOCS box, located between amino acids 358-413, contains the BC box consensus sequence and is crucial for forming E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes by interacting with Elongins B and C, as well as Cullin-RBX modules (Anasa2018Multifaceted; Wilcox2004Asb6).

ASB6 appears as a 50 kDa protein on SDS gels, despite a predicted molecular weight of approximately 46.2 kDa, likely due to phosphorylation. The protein contains several consensus serine/threonine phosphorylation sites, indicating potential post-translational modifications that may affect its function and stability (Wilcox2004Asb6). ASB6 is specifically expressed in adipocytes and interacts constitutively with APS, facilitating the recruitment of Elongins B and C to the insulin receptor signaling complex (Wilcox2004Asb6). The protein can form homo- and hetero-oligomers, with ASB3/ASB6 dimers reported (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

## Function
ASB6 is an adipocyte-specific protein that plays a significant role in the insulin signaling pathway. It interacts with the APS adapter protein, which is crucial for the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent pathway of insulin-stimulated glucose transport. ASB6 facilitates the recruitment of elongins B and C to the insulin receptor signaling complex, a process essential for the full activation of the insulin receptor (Wilcox2004Asb6). This interaction is constitutive and does not change with insulin stimulation, although ASB6 undergoes insulin-stimulated degradation along with APS, likely due to its SOCS box that binds to elongins (Wilcox2004Asb6).

ASB6 is involved in protein degradation pathways by interacting with scaffold proteins through its SOCS box domain, which facilitates binding to the Elongin BC complex. This interaction is part of the ubiquitination process, marking proteins for proteasomal degradation (Anasa2018Multifaceted). ASB6's role in these molecular processes suggests its involvement in regulating cellular processes such as signal transduction and protein turnover, influencing cell growth and differentiation (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

## Clinical Significance
The ASB6 gene has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with poor prognosis and disease progression. In pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC), high ASB6 expression correlates with worse overall survival, particularly in patients with triple-negative subtypes and pre-menopausal status. This suggests ASB6 as a potential therapeutic target in PABC (Zhang2019Identification).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), ASB6 is identified as an independent prognostic biomarker. Its overexpression is linked to lymphatic invasion, immune infiltration, and poor survival outcomes. ASB6 expression is notably higher in advanced stages of CRC and is associated with reduced sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. The gene's role in promoting cell migration and its correlation with M2 macrophage levels further underscore its significance in CRC progression (Hu2024ASB6; Zeng2022m6Amodified).

ASB6 also plays a role in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), where it enhances stemness properties and metastatic potential by attenuating endoplasmic reticulum stress. Its upregulation is associated with poor survival, particularly in patients with a history of betel quid consumption (Hung2019ASB6). These findings highlight ASB6 as a critical factor in cancer progression and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
ASB6 is known to participate in several protein-protein interactions, primarily through its ankyrin repeat and SOCS box domains. It interacts with the APS protein, facilitating the recruitment of elongins B and C to the insulin receptor signaling complex. This interaction is crucial for the full activation of the insulin receptor in adipocytes, suggesting a role in insulin signaling (Wilcox2004Asb6). The SOCS box domain of ASB6 binds to elongins B and C, forming part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

ASB6 also interacts with p62, a substrate of the CRL5 E3 ligase complex, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation independently of autophagy (Gong2021CUL5–ASB6). In colorectal cancer, ASB6 is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where it interacts with RNF41, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to its own degradation. This interaction is mediated by circFNDC3B, which enhances the association between ASB6 and RNF41, promoting ASB6 degradation (Zeng2022m6Amodified). These interactions highlight ASB6's role in various cellular processes, including insulin signaling and protein degradation pathways.
