# CMTM2

## Overview
CMTM2, or CKLF like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. The protein encoded by CMTM2 is predominantly expressed in the testis and plays a crucial role in enhancing AR transactivation, which is vital for male reproductive functions (Liu2009Human). CMTM2's modulation of AR signaling is achieved through the stabilization of AR protein levels and the suppression of Akt activation, thereby preventing AR degradation (Liu2009Human). Beyond its role in reproduction, CMTM2 is implicated in hematopoiesis and immune regulation, with its expression patterns suggesting a broader involvement in these physiological processes. Alterations in CMTM2 expression have been linked to various cancers, where it may function as a tumor suppressor or prognostic marker, depending on the cancer type (p&gt; Zhang2020&lt; DownRegulated; Liang2021Comprehensive).

## Function
CMTM2, also known as CKLF like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. In healthy human cells, CMTM2 is highly expressed in the testis and moderately in the prostate, bone marrow, and peripheral blood cells (Liu2009Human). It plays a significant role in enhancing the ligand-induced transactivation of the androgen receptor, which is crucial for the regulation of genes involved in male reproductive functions (Liu2009Human).

CMTM2 enhances the transactivation of the androgen receptor by increasing AR protein levels and suppressing Akt activation, which is known to phosphorylate AR and lead to its degradation (Liu2009Human). This suppression of Akt activation helps maintain AR stability, thereby facilitating its role in androgen signaling pathways (Liu2009Human). The expression pattern of CMTM2 suggests its involvement in male reproduction, hematopoiesis, and immunity. Notably, decreased or undetectable expression of CMTM2 has been observed in the testes of patients with spermatogenesis disturbances, indicating its potential role in spermatogenesis (Liu2009Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CMTM2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric cancer (GC), and ovarian cancer. In HCC, CMTM2 is frequently downregulated, which is associated with the promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process critical for cancer metastasis. This downregulation correlates with decreased expression of epithelial markers and increased expression of mesenchymal markers, suggesting a role in cancer progression and metastasis (p&gt; Zhang2020&lt; DownRegulated; Guo2020Downregulated). CMTM2 expression is also negatively correlated with vascular invasion and tumor grade in HCC, indicating its potential as a tumor suppressor and a prognostic marker (Guo2020Downregulated).

In gastric cancer, higher expression levels of CMTM2 are associated with better overall survival, progression-free survival, and post-progression survival, suggesting a protective role in GC prognosis (Liang2021Comprehensive). Conversely, in ovarian cancer, high expression of CMTM2 is linked to shorter progression-free survival, indicating a potential risk factor for poor prognosis. CMTM2's involvement in immune regulation and its correlation with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression may contribute to its role in ovarian cancer progression (Zhang2022Identification).
