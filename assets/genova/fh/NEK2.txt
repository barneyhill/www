# NEK2

## Overview
NEK2 is a gene that encodes the protein NIMA-related kinase 2, a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in critical cellular processes, particularly during the cell cycle. The NEK2 protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of centrosome separation and spindle assembly during mitosis, ensuring proper chromosomal segregation and genomic stability (Fry1999Activity; HELPS2000NIMArelated). Structurally, NEK2 features a kinase domain essential for its enzymatic activity and exists in multiple isoforms, which contribute to its functional diversity (Hayward2006Nek2; HAMES2002Alternative). NEK2's interactions with various proteins, such as protein phosphatase 1 and MAD1, underscore its role in maintaining cell cycle fidelity and chromosomal stability (Lou2004NEK2A; HELPS2000NIMArelateda). Aberrant expression of NEK2 has been implicated in several cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis and drug resistance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zeng2020Involvement; Zhou2013NEK2).

## Structure
The NEK2 protein is a serine/threonine kinase involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. Its primary structure includes a kinase domain essential for its enzymatic activity (Hayward2006Nek2). The secondary structure of NEK2 features a typical bilobal protein kinase fold, with alpha helices and beta sheets, similar to other kinases like Aurora-A and MARK2, sharing a sequence identity of 31% (Rellos2007Structure). The tertiary structure of NEK2 involves a catalytic domain and regulatory regions, with a disordered N-terminal lobe and a well-ordered C-terminal domain (Rellos2007Structure). 

NEK2 can form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure that plays a role in its regulation (Rellos2007Structure). The protein contains specific domains, such as the RCC1 domain, and undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at key threonine and serine residues, which modulate its activity (Rellos2007Structure). NEK2 exists in at least three splice variant isoforms: Nek2A, Nek2B, and Nek2A-T, which differ in their C-terminal regions and affect their regulatory properties and expression patterns (Hayward2006Nek2; HAMES2002Alternative). These structural features contribute to NEK2's functional diversity and regulatory mechanisms.

## Function
NEK2 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during the G2/M transition. It is primarily localized to the centrosome, the microtubule organizing center of the cell, where it is involved in centrosome separation, a crucial step for bipolar spindle formation during mitosis (Fry1999Activity; HELPS2000NIMArelated). NEK2's activity is regulated by its ability to form homodimers through a leucine zipper dimerization motif, which is essential for its trans-autophosphorylation and kinase activity (Fry1999Activity).

NEK2 phosphorylates several centrosomal proteins, including C-Nap1, which is involved in centrosome cohesion. This phosphorylation is thought to facilitate the separation of centrioles, preparing the centrosomes for mitotic spindle assembly (Faragher2003Nek2A; HELPS2000NIMArelated). NEK2 also interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), forming a complex that regulates the phosphorylation state of centrosomal proteins, thereby influencing centrosome dynamics and cell cycle progression (HELPS2000NIMArelated).

In addition to its role in centrosome function, NEK2 is involved in modulating alternative splicing of certain genes, such as BCL-X, which affects cell survival and apoptosis (Naro2013The). This highlights NEK2's multifaceted role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic stability.

## Clinical Significance
The NEK2 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromosomal instability and cell cycle regulation. Overexpression of NEK2 is associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis in multiple myeloma and other cancers, primarily through the activation of efflux drug pumps and signaling pathways such as AKT and Wnt, which enhance cancer cell proliferation and survival (Zhou2013NEK2). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NEK2 is overexpressed and linked to poor survival outcomes. It interacts with proteins like NDC80 and CEP250, influencing cell cycle processes and contributing to cancer progression (Zeng2020Involvement).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), NEK2 overexpression is associated with EGFR mutations, leading to drug resistance against tyrosine kinase inhibitors and poor patient survival (Chen2020High). NEK2 is also overexpressed in breast cancer, particularly in cases with mutant p53, contributing to centrosome amplification and compromised mitotic checkpoints (Ghaleb2020Mutant). In melanoma, high NEK2 expression correlates with poor overall and recurrence-free survival, potentially linked to TP53 mutations (huang2018aberrant). These findings suggest NEK2 as a potential therapeutic target across various malignancies.

## Interactions
NEK2, a serine/threonine-protein kinase, is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate cell cycle processes. It forms a complex with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), specifically binding through a KVHF motif in its C-terminal region. This interaction is crucial for regulating centrosome separation and involves at least two isoforms of PP1, PP1α and PP1γ (HELPS2000NIMArelateda). The NEK2-PP1 complex participates in a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle that modulates the phosphorylation state of C-Nap1, a protein involved in centriole cohesion, thereby influencing centrosome separation (HELPS2000NIMArelateda).

NEK2 also interacts with MAD1, a component of the spindle checkpoint, through a leucine zipper motif. This interaction is essential for the assembly of MAD2 onto kinetochores, which is critical for proper spindle checkpoint signaling during mitosis (Lou2004NEK2A). NEK2A, a variant of NEK2, binds to the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and its coactivator Cdc20, facilitating its ubiquitination during prometaphase. This interaction is primarily mediated by the MR tail of NEK2A (Alfieri2020A). These interactions highlight NEK2's role in maintaining chromosomal stability and proper cell cycle progression.
