# RGN

## Overview
The RGN gene encodes the protein regucalcin, a multifunctional calcium-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes. Regucalcin is characterized by its unique structure, which includes a 6-bladed β-propeller fold and a hydrophilic region that may function as a calcium-binding site, distinguishing it from other calcium-binding proteins that typically contain EF-hand motifs (Verleih2011Comparative). Functionally, regucalcin is involved in the activation of calcium pump enzymes and the regulation of cell signaling pathways, acting as a suppressor of cell proliferation and apoptosis by modulating the activity of protein kinases and phosphatases (Yamaguchi2023Regucalcin). Its role extends to the nucleus, where it influences gene expression and may function as a transcription factor (Yamaguchi2013Suppressive). Clinically, alterations in regucalcin expression have been associated with various cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (YAMAGUCHI2016Prolonged; Yamaguchi2023Regucalcin).

## Structure
The regucalcin (RGN) protein is a calcium-binding protein involved in calcium homeostasis and various cellular functions. The primary structure of RGN in rainbow trout and maraena whitefish consists of 298 and 299 amino acids, respectively, with a high amino acid identity of 95.7% between the two species (Verleih2011Comparative). The protein lacks a signal peptide and an EF-hand motif, which is a common calcium-binding site in other proteins. Instead, a hydrophilic region between nucleotide positions 100 and 200 may function as a calcium-binding site (Verleih2011Comparative).

The secondary structure of RGN includes a 6-bladed β-propeller fold, which is a prominent feature of its tertiary structure. This fold is associated with a single metal ion binding to the active site, coordinated by conserved residues E17, N153, and D203 (Verleih2011Comparative). The RGN protein contains a SGL multi-domain, specifically the SMP-30 region, which spans from amino acid position 16 to 262 in rainbow trout (Verleih2011Comparative).

The RGN protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, as indicated by the variation in exon structure among different teleost fish species (Verleih2011Comparative). However, specific details on post-translational modifications or quaternary structure are not provided in the context.

## Function
Regucalcin (RGN) is a multifunctional calcium-binding protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes. It is involved in activating calcium pump enzymes in the plasma membranes, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum, which helps reduce cytoplasmic calcium levels (Yamaguchi2023Regucalcin). Regucalcin translocates to the nucleus, where it inhibits the activity of several Ca2+-dependent protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and other enzymes involved in cell signaling, thereby regulating gene expression and potentially acting as a transcription factor (Yamaguchi2023Regucalcin).

In healthy cells, regucalcin suppresses cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death by inhibiting various signaling pathways, including those mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases and protein kinase C (Yamaguchi2016Increased; Yamaguchi2023Regucalcin). It also obstructs the G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases, such as cdc2, cdk2, and cdk5, and increasing the expression of p21, an inhibitor of these kinases (Yamaguchi2023Regucalcin). Regucalcin's role in maintaining cell homeostasis and function is critical, as it prevents uncontrolled cell proliferation and supports normal cellular functions, which can be disrupted in cancerous conditions (Yamaguchi2023Regucalcin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the regucalcin (RGN) gene have been implicated in various cancers. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), regucalcin expression is typically lower in tumor tissues compared to normal pancreatic tissues. Increased expression of regucalcin is associated with prolonged survival in PDAC patients, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor and therapeutic target (YAMAGUCHI2016Prolonged). Similarly, in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), regucalcin expression is significantly downregulated in tumor tissues. High expression levels correlate with poor survival, potentially due to interactions with the tumor immune microenvironment (Liao2023RGN). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), decreased regucalcin expression is linked to tumor growth, while its overexpression leads to cell cycle arrest and reduced proliferation (Yamaguchi2023Regucalcin).

In liver cancer, regucalcin acts as a suppressor of cell proliferation. Its expression is reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and higher expression levels are associated with better survival outcomes (Yamaguchi2023Regucalcin). Regucalcin's role in maintaining calcium homeostasis and inhibiting calcium signaling is crucial in these contexts, as its dysregulation can contribute to carcinogenesis (Yamaguchi2013Suppressive).

## Interactions
Regucalcin (RGN) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular regulation. In the nucleus, regucalcin binds to calmodulin and is involved in the regulation of nuclear functions, including the suppression of Ca2+-activated DNA fragmentation by inhibiting DNA endonuclease activation mediated through Ca2+/calmodulin (Yamaguchi2013Suppressive). It also inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis by interacting with RNA polymerases II and III, suggesting a potential role as a transcriptional factor (Yamaguchi2013Suppressive). Regucalcin can directly bind to DNA, although the specific base pairs it binds to are not yet identified (Yamaguchi2013Suppressive).

In the cytoplasm, regucalcin suppresses protein kinase and protein phosphatase activities, which are crucial for cell proliferation. It inhibits Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and protein phosphatase activities, affecting signal transduction and cell proliferation processes (Yamaguchi2013Suppressive). Regucalcin also interacts with aminoacyl-tRNA synthase, inhibiting protein synthesis, and may bind to aminoacyl (leucyl)-tRNA synthetase (Yamaguchi2013Suppressive). These interactions highlight regucalcin's role in regulating intracellular signaling pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis.
