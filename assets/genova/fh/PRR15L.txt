# PRR15L

## Overview
Proline Rich 15 Like (PRR15L) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is characterized by its proline-rich domain. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. PRR15L has garnered attention in cancer research due to its potential role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Notably, alterations in the expression and methylation of PRR15L have been associated with prognostic outcomes in certain cancers, such as clear-cell renal cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer (Mizuguchi2019Identification; Wang2019Identification). The protein's involvement in these malignancies suggests it may serve as a valuable biomarker and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Clinical Significance
PRR15L has been identified as a significant prognostic marker in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). High methylation levels of PRR15L are associated with poor prognosis and low survival rates in ccRCC patients. This suggests that hypermethylation of PRR15L may inhibit its expression, affecting cellular metabolism and contributing to decreased patient survival (Wang2019Identification).

In colorectal cancer, a novel PRR15L-RSPO2 fusion transcript has been discovered in a case of sigmoid colon cancer derived from superficially serrated adenoma (SuSA). This fusion involves exon 1 of PRR15L and exon 2 of RSPO2, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis. The fusion was present in both adenocarcinoma and metastasis, but not in normal mucosa, indicating its potential involvement in cancer development and progression (Mizuguchi2019Identification).

These findings highlight the potential of PRR15L as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and its involvement in tumorigenic processes. Further research is needed to explore the clinical implications of PRR15L alterations and their potential as therapeutic targets in cancer treatment.
