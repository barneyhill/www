# KEL

## Overview
The KEL gene encodes the Kell protein, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that functions as a zinc-dependent endopeptidase. This protein is primarily expressed on the surface of red blood cells and plays a crucial role in the enzymatic cleavage of big endothelin-3 to produce endothelin-3, a peptide involved in vasoconstriction and blood pressure regulation (Russo2000Expression; Lee2000The). The Kell protein is part of the neprilysin family of zinc metalloproteases and forms a complex with the XK protein, which is essential for its stability and function (Russo1998Association; Lee1991Molecular). Beyond its role in erythroid tissues, the Kell protein is also expressed in non-erythroid tissues such as the testis and skeletal muscle, suggesting additional, yet not fully understood, functions (CAMARACLAYETTE2001Transcriptional). Mutations in the KEL gene can lead to significant clinical conditions, particularly affecting blood transfusion compatibility and pregnancy outcomes, underscoring the importance of this gene in medical genetics (Karamatic2013Three; Silvy2016New).

## Structure
The Kell protein, encoded by the KEL gene, is a type II membrane glycoprotein consisting of 732 amino acids. It features a single transmembrane region and a large extracellular domain of 665 amino acids (Lee1997Molecular; Lee1991Molecular). The primary structure includes six potential N-glycosylation sites, although not all are utilized due to structural constraints, such as the presence of a neighboring proline at position 724 (Lee1997Molecular). The protein is rich in cysteine residues, with 15 located in the extracellular domain, contributing to its tightly folded tertiary structure through disulfide bonds (Lee2003Active; Lee1997Molecular).

The secondary structure of the Kell protein is characterized by α-helical segments, forming two globular domains. The domain closest to the membrane contains motifs essential for catalytic activity, while the outer domain is more exposed (Lee2003Active). The Kell protein shares structural homology with the M13 family of zinc endopeptidases, including a zinc-binding catalytic sequence (Lee2000Functional).

In terms of quaternary structure, the Kell protein forms a complex with the XK protein, linked by a disulfide bond, which may facilitate cooperative membrane functions (Lee1997Molecular; Lee2000Functional).

## Function
The KEL gene encodes the Kell protein, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that functions as a zinc endopeptidase. This protein is primarily expressed on the surface of red blood cells and is involved in the enzymatic cleavage of big endothelin-3 to produce endothelin-3, a bioactive peptide with vasoconstrictor properties. This activity suggests a role in blood pressure regulation and the maintenance of vascular tone (Russo2000Expression; Lee2000The).

The Kell protein is also associated with the XK protein, forming a complex that is crucial for its stability and function. This complex is involved in maintaining erythrocyte membrane integrity and may play a role in intracellular processes related to the transport and processing of endothelin precursors (Russo2000Expression; Lee1991Molecular). The Kell protein's structure includes several N-glycosylation sites and potential zinc-binding sites, which are common in catalytic sites of endopeptidases, indicating its enzymatic function (Lee1991Molecular).

Beyond erythroid tissues, the Kell protein is expressed in non-erythroid tissues such as the testis and skeletal muscle, suggesting additional roles in these tissues, although the exact functions remain to be fully elucidated (Russo2000Expression; CAMARACLAYETTE2001Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KEL gene can lead to several clinically significant conditions, primarily related to blood transfusion and pregnancy. The KEL1 antigen, prevalent in about 9% of Caucasians, is a potent immunogen that can cause severe hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) when antibodies are formed against it (Silvy2016New; Lee2007The). The K0 phenotype, characterized by the absence of Kell antigens, can result in the production of anti-Ku antibodies upon exposure to Kell antigens through transfusion, posing a risk for transfusion reactions (Silvy2016New; Koda2002Heterozygosity).

The Kmod phenotype, resulting from mutations that diminish Kell antigen expression, can also lead to the production of anti-Ku antibodies, complicating transfusion compatibility (Lee2003Mutations). The McLeod phenotype, associated with absent XK protein expression, results in weakened Kell antigens and is linked to McLeod syndrome, a disorder with neuromuscular and central nervous system manifestations (Karamatic2013Three; Silvy2016New). These conditions highlight the importance of genotyping and molecular analysis in managing blood transfusions and understanding the genetic basis of Kell-related disorders.

## Interactions
The KEL gene encodes the Kell protein, which interacts with the XK protein to form a complex on the surface of red blood cells. This interaction is facilitated by a disulfide bond between cysteine 72 of the Kell protein and cysteine 347 of the XK protein. This bond is crucial for the structural integrity and function of the Kell-XK complex (Lee2000The; Russo1998Association). The absence of XK protein, as seen in the McLeod phenotype, results in the lack of this complex, leading to altered red blood cell morphology and associated clinical symptoms (Russo1998Association).

The Kell protein is part of the neprilysin family of zinc metalloproteases and shares structural similarities with other family members, such as neutral endopeptidase and endothelin-converting enzymes. These proteins have conserved cysteine residues and a zinc-binding site, which are important for their enzymatic activity (Lee2000The). The Kell protein has been shown to activate endothelin-3 by cleaving big endothelin, highlighting its role in peptide hormone processing (Lee2000The).

Additionally, the study identified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a neighboring protein to Kell on the red cell membrane, suggesting potential interactions with other membrane proteins (Russo1998Association).
