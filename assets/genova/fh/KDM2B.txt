# KDM2B

## Overview
KDM2B is a gene that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 2B, which is a member of the histone demethylase family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of epigenetic modifications, primarily through its function as a demethylase targeting specific histone marks such as H3K36me1/2 and H3K79me2/3, which are associated with transcriptional activity (Vacík2018KDM2AB). As a transcriptional repressor, lysine demethylase 2B is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, senescence, and differentiation, by modulating gene expression and chromatin structure (He2008The). The protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a JmjC domain for demethylase activity, a CXXC zinc finger domain for DNA binding, and an F-box domain for protein interactions (Kang2018KDM2B; He2013Kdm2b). KDM2B's involvement in critical biological pathways and its dysregulation in various cancers highlight its significance as a potential therapeutic target (He2011KDM2bJHDM1b; Staberg2018Targeting).

## Structure
KDM2B is a protein characterized by several functional domains that contribute to its role in histone demethylation and gene regulation. The protein contains a JmjC domain, which is responsible for its histone demethylase activity, specifically targeting histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36) and lysine 79 (H3K79) (Kang2018KDM2B). The CXXC zinc finger domain is crucial for DNA binding, particularly to unmethylated CpG islands, and plays a significant role in recruiting the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) to these sites (He2013Kdm2b; Farcas2012KDM2B). 

KDM2B also includes a plant homeodomain (PHD) and an F-box domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes (Deiktakis2020Identification). The protein's structure is further defined by leucine-rich repeats (LRR) that contribute to its interaction capabilities (He2013Kdm2b). 

KDM2B exists in multiple isoforms, with the long isoform (Kdm2b LF) containing the JmjC domain, while the short isoform (Kdm2b SF) lacks this domain (He2013Kdm2b). These structural features enable KDM2B to participate in chromatin silencing and transcriptional repression, impacting cellular processes such as differentiation and senescence (Kang2018KDM2B).

## Function
KDM2B, also known as lysine demethylase 2B, is a crucial regulator of epigenetic modifications in human cells. It functions primarily as a demethylase, targeting histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me1/2) and other histone marks such as H3K4me3 and H3K79me2/3, which are associated with transcriptionally active promoters. This demethylation activity leads to transcriptional repression, indicating that KDM2B acts as a transcriptional repressor (Vacík2018KDM2AB).

KDM2B is involved in regulating cell proliferation and senescence by modulating the expression of the p15 Ink4b gene, a known tumor suppressor. Its demethylase activity is essential for normal cell proliferation and the repression of p15 Ink4b, which is linked to cell cycle regulation (He2008The). KDM2B also plays a role in hematopoiesis, where it is required for the maintenance and lineage commitment of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Its expression is high in these cells and decreases with differentiation, indicating its role in maintaining stem cell populations (Andricovich2016Histone).

In the context of neural development, KDM2B acts as a negative regulator of apoptosis and is crucial for normal neural development, as its deficiency can lead to neural tube defects (Fukuda2011Fbxl10Kdm2b). KDM2B's activity in the nucleus impacts processes like transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling, contributing to its function in maintaining genomic stability and regulating developmental pathways.

## Clinical Significance
KDM2B is implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. In leukemia, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), KDM2B is highly expressed and acts as an oncogene, crucial for the initiation and maintenance of the disease. Its oncogenic functions are mediated through the silencing of tumor suppressor genes like p15 Ink4b, making it a potential therapeutic target for leukemia treatment (He2011KDM2bJHDM1b). In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), KDM2B is overexpressed and contributes to tumor progression by modulating apoptosis and cell proliferation. Silencing KDM2B in GBM cells increases their sensitivity to apoptosis-inducing agents, suggesting its potential as a target for cancer therapy (Kurt2017KDM2B; Staberg2018Targeting).

KDM2B also plays a role in hematopoietic malignancies, where it can function as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, depending on the context. Its deletion can accelerate myeloid transformation driven by oncogenic KRAS, while overexpression can counteract oncogenic drivers by restoring lymphoid differentiation (Andricovich2016Histone). In glioma stem-like cells, KDM2B is crucial for maintaining chemoresistance and survival, making it a potential target for glioblastoma treatment (Staberg2018Targeting).

## Interactions
KDM2B interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It is a component of a variant Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) in mouse embryonic stem cells, where it associates with proteins such as RING1B, YAF2, RYBP, PCGF1, BCOR, and BCORL1. RING1B, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is crucial for the mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2A at position 119 (H2AK119ub1), a key function of PRC1 (Farcas2012KDM2B). KDM2B binds specifically to non-methylated CpG dinucleotides and is enriched at polycomb-associated CpG islands (CGIs), suggesting its role in targeting PRC1 to these sites (Farcas2012KDM2B).

KDM2B also interacts with the SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex through its F-box domain. This interaction is essential for promoting lytic gene expression during Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection by stabilizing the c-Jun protein, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex (Naik2021KDM2B). The F-box domain of KDM2B is necessary for its binding to SKP1, a component of the SCF complex, which facilitates the degradation of proteins that destabilize c-Jun, thereby enhancing AP-1 activity (Naik2021KDM2B).
