# DNASE1L2

## Overview
DNASE1L2 is a gene that encodes the protein deoxyribonuclease 1-like 2, a member of the DNase I family of enzymes. This protein is primarily involved in the degradation of nuclear DNA during the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, a process essential for the formation of the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the skin (Mori2022Origin; Ueki2017Survey). The enzyme is adapted to function optimally in the acidic environment of the epidermis, with a pH range of 5.5 to 6, and plays a crucial role in preventing parakeratosis, a condition associated with skin disorders such as psoriasis (Mori2022Origin; Ueki2017Survey). Beyond its role in skin, DNASE1L2 is also involved in the formation of hair fibers and nail plates, contributing to their structural integrity (Ueki2017Survey). Additionally, it aids in the defense against cutaneous bacterial biofilms by degrading exogenous DNA on the skin surface (Ueki2017Survey). The protein's interactions with chromatin and its affinity for heparin suggest a complex role in DNA degradation and chromatin remodeling during keratinocyte differentiation (Verhülsdonk2021Comparison; Fischer2017Inactivation).

## Function
DNASE1L2 is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the degradation of nuclear DNA during the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, a process essential for the formation of the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the skin (Mori2022Origin; Ueki2017Survey). This enzyme is specifically adapted to function in the acidic environment of the epidermis, with an optimal pH range of 5.5 to 6, which is crucial for its activity in skin cornification (Mori2022Origin). DNASE1L2 is primarily active in the skin, where it helps prevent the retention of nuclear DNA in keratinocytes, a condition known as parakeratosis, which is associated with skin disorders such as psoriasis (Ueki2017Survey).

In addition to its role in the skin, DNASE1L2 is involved in the breakdown of nuclear DNA during the formation of hair fibers and nail plates, contributing to the mechanical resilience of these structures (Ueki2017Survey). The enzyme is also thought to aid in restricting the formation of cutaneous bacterial biofilms by degrading exogenous DNA on the skin surface (Ueki2017Survey). DNASE1L2's activity is crucial for maintaining homeostasis by removing self-DNA, thereby preventing immune responses and potential autoimmunity (Mori2022Origin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNASE1L2 gene, which encodes the DNase I-like 2 enzyme, are implicated in the pathogenesis of parakeratosis, a skin condition characterized by the retention of nuclear DNA in the stratum corneum. This retention is commonly observed in inflammatory and hyperkeratotic diseases such as psoriasis. Non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), frameshift, and nonsense mutations in DNASE1L2 can lead to a loss of enzyme function, contributing to a genetic predisposition to parakeratotic conditions (Ueki2017Survey). The study identified 48 pathogenetic SNPs in DNASE1L2 that may impair its role in DNA degradation during keratinocyte differentiation, potentially leading to conditions like psoriasis (Ueki2017Survey).

DNase 1L2 is also thought to play a role in hair fiber and nail plate formation, as well as in anti-biofilm defense on the skin. The presence of these SNPs might impair these functions, further contributing to skin diseases (Ueki2017Survey). Despite its crucial role in DNA degradation, the absence of DNase 1L2 does not lead to significant skin-related diseases or conditions, as evidenced by studies on double knockout mice lacking both Trex2 and DNase1L2 (Manils2017Double).

## Interactions
DNASE1L2, a member of the DNase I family, is involved in DNA degradation processes, particularly in keratinocytes. It does not significantly interact with monomeric α-actin, as its nuclease activity remains unaffected by α-actin, and it does not influence α-actin polymerization (Verhülsdonk2021Comparison). DNASE1L2 binds to heparin, which affects its chromatin cleavage pattern. In the presence of heparin, DNASE1L2's cleavage pattern changes from bi-modular to random, indicating a higher affinity for basic histones over acidic heparin. This suggests that DNASE1L2's interaction with chromatin is influenced by its affinity for these molecules (Verhülsdonk2021Comparison).

DNASE1L2 is also implicated in the degradation of nuclear DNA during the cornification of keratinocytes, a process crucial for the formation of the stratum corneum. Inactivation of DNASE1L2, along with DNase2, leads to the retention of nuclear DNA in the stratum corneum, resulting in parakeratosis. This indicates a role for DNASE1L2 in chromatin remodeling during keratinocyte differentiation (Fischer2017Inactivation). However, specific details on its interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond these contexts are not provided in the available literature.
