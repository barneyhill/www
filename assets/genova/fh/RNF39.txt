# RNF39

## Overview
RNF39 is a gene that encodes ring finger protein 39, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the regulation of antiviral innate immunity. This protein is a member of the RING finger protein family and plays a critical role in the ubiquitination process, specifically targeting the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3X for proteasomal degradation. By modulating the levels of DDX3X, RNF39 acts as a negative regulator of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway, which is crucial for initiating antiviral responses. The protein's activity is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive immune activation, which can lead to autoimmune disorders. RNF39's interactions and regulatory functions are primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it directly interacts with DDX3X through specific protein domains (Wang2021RNF39).

## Function
RNF39 (ring finger protein 39) is a gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of antiviral innate immunity. The protein is involved in the ubiquitination process, specifically mediating K48-linked polyubiquitination of DDX3X, a DEAD-box RNA helicase. This ubiquitination targets DDX3X for proteasomal degradation, thereby modulating its levels within the cell (Wang2021RNF39).

In healthy human cells, RNF39 functions as a negative regulator of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway, which is essential for initiating antiviral responses. By promoting the degradation of DDX3X, RNF39 inhibits the activation of IRF3, a transcription factor critical for the expression of interferon-beta (IFN-β) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. This regulation is vital for preventing excessive immune activation, which can lead to autoimmune disorders (Wang2021RNF39).

RNF39 is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts directly with DDX3X. The interaction is mediated through specific domains of both proteins, and the ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF39 is essential for this process. Mutations that disrupt this activity can abolish its regulatory function (Wang2021RNF39).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RNF39 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. RNF39 is associated with autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and Behçet's disease. In MS, RNF39 is hypermethylated in CD4+ T cells, suggesting a role in disease pathogenesis (Maltby2017Differential). Similarly, hypermethylation of RNF39 is observed in SLE patients, particularly those with cutaneous manifestations like malar rash and discoid rash (Renauer2015DNA).

RNF39 also plays a role in viral infections. It is involved in the regulation of antiviral immunity through its interaction with the DDX3X protein, acting as a negative regulator of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway. RNF39 deficiency enhances antiviral responses and reduces viral replication, indicating its potential impact on susceptibility to RNA viral infections (Wang2021RNF39). Genetic variants of RNF39 have been associated with HIV-1 disease progression and plasma viral loads, suggesting that RNF39 influences the clinical course of HIV-1 infection (Lin2014Ring).

Additionally, RNF39 is linked to allergic rhinitis, with genetic variants associated with the condition, both with and without asthma (Morin2017Combining). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RNF39 in various immune-related and infectious diseases.

## Interactions
RNF39, a member of the RING finger protein family, is known to interact with the DDX3X protein. RNF39 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting DDX3X for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal region of RNF39 and the N-terminal RecA-like domain 1 of DDX3X. The interaction has been confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy analyses. RNF39 specifically promotes K48-linked polyubiquitination of DDX3X, leading to its degradation, a process that can be inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. This specificity is highlighted by the fact that other E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as TRIM13, TRIM31, and TRIM40, do not affect DDX3X expression (Wang2021RNF39).

RNF39 also plays a role in the regulation of antiviral responses by inhibiting the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway. It does so by mediating the ubiquitination of DDX3X, which is crucial for antiviral immunity. This interaction negatively regulates the RLR pathway, as evidenced by increased antiviral responses in RNF39-deficient models (Wang2021RNF39).
