# HSD3B2

## Overview
The HSD3B2 gene encodes the enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, a member of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroid precursors into Δ4-ketosteroids, a critical step in the production of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens. The protein is predominantly expressed in the adrenal glands, ovaries, and testes, where it localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, facilitating essential steroidogenic reactions. The activity of this enzyme is regulated by various transcription factors and signaling pathways, ensuring the maintenance of normal steroid hormone levels necessary for physiological processes such as electrolyte balance, stress response, and reproduction (Simard2005Molecular; Wang2007Human; Udhane2013Differential).

## Structure
The HSD3B2 gene encodes the type II 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5-Δ4 isomerase enzyme, which is crucial for steroid hormone biosynthesis. The enzyme is composed of 371 amino acids and shares 93.5% identity with the type I enzyme encoded by the HSD3B1 gene (Simard2005Molecular). The primary structure of the enzyme includes a nucleotide-binding site sequence at the amino terminus, which is characteristic of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase superfamily (Simard2005Molecular).

The enzyme's secondary structure includes a glycine-rich segment that forms a hydrophobic pocket for the AMP part of the nucleotide factor, which is essential for its catalytic activity (Simard2005Molecular). The tertiary structure involves specific amino acids critical for its function, such as His 261 for 3β-HSD activity and Tyr 253 or Tyr 254 for isomerase activity (Simard2005Molecular).

The quaternary structure of the enzyme is not explicitly detailed in the context, but it is known to be part of a functional steroidogenic complex with P450scc in the inner mitochondrial membrane, suggesting a role in substrate accessibility (Simard2005Molecular). The enzyme also contains two membrane-binding domains that are crucial for its localization and function (Simard2005Molecular).

## Function
The HSD3B2 gene encodes the enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones in human tissues. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroid precursors, such as pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), into Δ4-ketosteroids, including progesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone (Wang2007Human; Udhane2013Differential). These reactions are essential for the production of all major classes of steroid hormones, including glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens (Wang2007Human).

HSD3B2 is predominantly expressed in the adrenal glands, ovaries, and testes, where it plays a vital role in steroidogenesis (Wang2007Human; Udhane2013Differential). The enzyme is NAD+-dependent and localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, facilitating critical steroidogenic reactions in these tissues (Wang2007Human). Its activity is regulated by various transcription factors, including GATA, Nur77, and SF1/LRH1, and is influenced by cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling (Udhane2013Differential). The enzyme's function is crucial for maintaining normal steroid hormone levels, which are important for electrolyte balance, stress response, and reproductive functions (Xing2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HSD3B2 gene lead to 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 deficiency, a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). This condition impairs steroidogenesis in the adrenal glands and gonads, resulting in decreased production of cortisol, aldosterone, and sex steroids. Clinically, it manifests as salt-wasting, ambiguous genitalia in genetic males, and various degrees of hypogonadism and hyperandrogenism (Lusa2010Structural; Moisan1999New; Mellone2022CoOccurrence).

The severity of the phenotype depends on the type of mutation. Severe mutations, such as frameshift and nonsense mutations, often result in a salt-wasting crisis due to significant loss of enzyme activity. Missense mutations may retain some enzymatic activity, leading to non-salt-wasting forms (Guran2020Revisiting; Al2019Clinical). In males, impaired testosterone biosynthesis can cause incomplete masculinization, while females may experience virilization and menstrual disorders (Chen2021Three; Al2019Clinical).

The non-classical form of 3βHSD deficiency, characterized by hyperandrogenic symptoms, has been observed in older females and children with premature pubarche, although no mutations in HSD3B2 were found in these cases (Moisan1999New). Understanding the genotype-phenotype correlation is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management of the condition (Guran2020Revisiting).

## Interactions
The HSD3B2 gene encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in steroid hormone biosynthesis. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of Δ5-steroid precursors into Δ4-ketosteroids, which are essential for producing various hormones, including glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, progesterone, androgens, and estrogens (Simard2005Molecular). The enzyme is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, where it is part of a functional steroidogenic complex with P450scc in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This complex facilitates the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone and then to progesterone, indicating a close physical association between 3β-HSD and P450scc, which allows efficient substrate transfer and conversion (Simard2005Molecular).

In terms of transcriptional regulation, the HSD3B2 gene is influenced by several transcription factors. The transcription factor YY1 binds to specific regions within intron 1 of the HSD3B2 gene, enhancing its basal promoter activity. This binding is crucial for the gene's transcriptional regulation, with the distal YY1 binding site playing a more significant role in basal transcription than the proximal site (Foti2004YY1). Additionally, transcription factors such as Stat5, activated by prolactin, and GATA factors, particularly GATA-4 and GATA-6, are involved in regulating HSD3B2 expression (Simard2005Molecular).
