# RHBG

## Overview
The RHBG gene encodes the Rh family B glycoprotein, a transmembrane protein involved in the transport of ammonia across cell membranes. This protein is a member of the Rh family, which is characterized by its role in ammonium transport and structural similarity to other Rh proteins, such as RhAG and RhCG. RHBG is predominantly expressed in non-erythroid tissues, including the kidney and liver, where it plays a critical role in ammonia excretion and detoxification, contributing to metabolic homeostasis (Callebaut2006Hydrophobic; Huang2005Evolutionary). The protein's structure, featuring 12 transmembrane helices, is modeled after the ammonia channel AmtB from Escherichia coli, suggesting a similar channel architecture (Conroy2005Modelling). RHBG's function is essential for maintaining acid-base balance and nitrogen metabolism, and it may also be involved in CO2 transport, highlighting its importance in physiological processes (Huang2005Evolutionary).

## Structure
The RHBG protein is a member of the Rh family of proteins, which are involved in ammonium transport. It shares structural similarities with other Rh proteins, such as RhAG and RhCG, and is characterized by having 12 transmembrane helices, with both the N- and C-termini located in the cytoplasm (Conroy2005Modelling; Callebaut2006Hydrophobic). An additional N-terminal helix, termed M0, is present in RHBG, contributing to its total of twelve transmembrane segments (Callebaut2006Hydrophobic).

The protein's structure is modeled based on the ammonia channel AmtB from Escherichia coli, suggesting a similar channel architecture that facilitates ammonium transport (Conroy2005Modelling). The RHBG protein is expressed in non-erythroid tissues, such as the kidney and liver, where it plays a role in ammonia production and excretion (Callebaut2006Hydrophobic).

The RHBG protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can affect its function and stability. The presence of conserved residues, including those involved in tight helix packing, is crucial for maintaining the protein's structural integrity (Callebaut2006Hydrophobic). The exact role of RHBG in ammonium transport, whether as NH4+ or NH3, remains a subject of study (Callebaut2006Hydrophobic).

## Function
RHBG (Rh family B glycoprotein) is primarily involved in the transport of ammonia across cell membranes, playing a crucial role in maintaining acid-base balance and nitrogen metabolism in healthy human cells. This protein is expressed in epithelial tissues of various organs, including the kidney and liver, where it facilitates the excretion and detoxification of ammonia, contributing to metabolic homeostasis (Huang2005Evolutionary). 

RHBG is thought to function as a channel for CO2, diverging from its ancestral Amt proteins, which were involved in NH3/NH4+ transport. This suggests that RHBG may have a role in CO2 waste disposal and buffering of body fluids, which is essential for pH homeostasis (Huang2005Evolutionary). The evolutionary conservation of RHBG, indicated by strong purifying selection, supports its critical physiological functions (Huang2005Evolutionary).

The protein's activity is crucial for normal embryonic development and may also be involved in sensing CO2 levels, further underscoring its importance in maintaining physiological balance (Huang2005Evolutionary). The structural and functional characteristics of RHBG highlight its role in the complex regulation of ammonia and CO2 transport, essential for cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The RHBG gene, which encodes a non-erythroid Rhesus factor involved in ammonium transport, is implicated in various cancers due to its regulation by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This pathway is frequently deregulated in cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma. In HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells and SW480 colon adenocarcinoma cells, RHBG expression is highly dependent on β-catenin signaling. Silencing β-catenin in these cells leads to a decrease in RHBG expression, indicating a strong correlation between β-catenin activity and RHBG levels (Merhi2015WntβCatenin).

In HepG2 cells, which have a heterozygous deletion in the β-catenin gene, RHBG is overexpressed, suggesting that mutations leading to β-catenin activation can enhance RHBG expression. This overexpression is associated with the nuclear localization of β-catenin, which is a hallmark of active Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Merhi2015WntβCatenin). The study also identifies a minimal regulatory sequence in the RHBG promoter that is crucial for its activity, with β-catenin and TCF4 binding to this region to enhance expression (Merhi2015WntβCatenin). These findings suggest that alterations in RHBG expression, driven by abnormal Wnt/β-catenin signaling, may contribute to tumorigenesis in certain cancers.

## Interactions
The RHBG protein interacts with the spectrin-based membrane skeleton in epithelial cells, which is crucial for its stability and function. This interaction is mediated by ankyrin-G, which anchors RHBG to the basolateral plasma membrane of kidney epithelial cells (Nicolas2006Functional; Sohet2008Phosphorylation). The C-terminal domain of RHBG is essential for its interaction with the spectrin-based skeleton, and mutations in the 419 FLD 421 sequence can disrupt this interaction, affecting the protein's cell surface expression and stability (Sohet2008Phosphorylation).

Phosphorylation plays a significant role in regulating RHBG's interactions and function. Specifically, phosphorylation at tyrosine 429 is critical for its regulation, affecting NH3 transport capacity and its linkage to the spectrin-based skeleton. This phosphorylation is necessary for the basolateral targeting of RHBG in polarized epithelial cells (Sohet2008Phosphorylation). The interaction with ankyrin-G is disrupted by mutations in the ankyrin-G-binding site, which significantly reduces NH3 transport and affects the protein's anchorage to the skeleton (Sohet2008Phosphorylation). These interactions and modifications highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing RHBG's function and localization within cells.
