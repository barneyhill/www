# FBXW8

## Overview
FBXW8 is a gene that encodes the F-box and WD repeat domain containing 8 protein, which is a member of the F-box protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of an F-box domain and a WD40 β-propeller domain, which are crucial for its role in protein-protein interactions and the formation of ubiquitin ligase complexes. As an F-box protein, FBXW8 is integral to the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. This function is essential for various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, genomic stability, and development. FBXW8 is also involved in maintaining Golgi apparatus morphology and dendrite patterning in neurons, as well as playing a significant role in placental development. Its dysregulation has been associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders (Litterman2011An; Tsunematsu2006Fbxw8; Islam2021Cooperative).

## Structure
FBXW8 is a protein characterized by an F-box domain in its N-terminal region and a WD40 β-propeller domain in its central and C-terminal regions. The F-box domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly within ubiquitin ligase complexes, while the WD40 domain facilitates the formation of protein complexes by providing a stable platform for interactions (Tsunematsu2006Fbxw8; Pan2020CullinRING).

The WD40 β-propeller domain of FBXW8 consists of eight blades, with the N-terminal strand completing the C-terminal-most blade, a typical feature of WD40 proteins. This domain superimposes well with other F-box proteins like human FBXW7 and yeast Cdc4p (Hopf2022Structure). The C-terminal of FBXW8 extends beyond the propeller, forming a triangular platform that interacts with CUL7 domains (Hopf2022Structure).

FBXW8 forms part of the CRL7 FBXW8 complex, which includes CUL7 and RBX1. This complex adopts a diagonal T-shaped structure, with CUL7-RBX1 forming a long bar crossing the CUL7-FBXW8-SKP1 base at an angle. The T-junction is formed by CUL7 domains wrapping around FBXW8's β-propeller and stalk helix (Hopf2022Structure). The interaction with CUL7 involves a multipart interface, including the CR2, CR3, and 4HB domains of CUL7, which encase part of FBXW8's β-propeller (Hopf2022Structure).

## Function
FBXW8 is an F-box protein that plays a crucial role in the formation of a functional ubiquitin ligase complex with SKP1, Cullin1, and Cullin7. This complex is essential for the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of various substrates, including β-TrCP1, Cyclin D1, and MRFAP1, which are involved in cell cycle regulation and genomic stability (Islam2021Cooperative; Okabe2006A). FBXW8 is unique in its ability to form an SCF complex with both Cullin1 and Cullin7, which enhances the stability and activity of the complex, facilitating the degradation of its substrates (Islam2021Cooperative).

In neurons, FBXW8 is localized to the Golgi apparatus and is involved in maintaining Golgi morphology and dendrite patterning. It regulates the abundance of target proteins such as Grasp65, which is crucial for Golgi integrity and dendrite elaboration. Knockdown of FBXW8 in neurons results in simplified dendrite arbors and reduced dendrite length, indicating its specific role in dendrite growth (Litterman2011An).

FBXW8 also plays a role in placental development by forming a complex with Cul7 and Cul1, which is essential for normal placental and embryonic development (Tsunematsu2006Fbxw8).

## Clinical Significance
FBXW8 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Alterations in FBXW8 expression have been linked to cancer, particularly breast cancer, where it influences cell migration and metastasis through the regulation of β-catenin levels (Islam2021Cooperative). In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, deregulation of the Cul7-FBXW8 ubiquitin signaling pathway has been associated with abnormalities in dendrite morphology, which are linked to conditions such as mental retardation and autism spectrum disorders (Litterman2011An).

FBXW8 also plays a role in placental development, and its deficiency can lead to intrauterine growth retardation and embryonic lethality in mice, suggesting potential implications in human growth-related conditions (Tsunematsu2006Fbxw8). Although specific mutations in FBXW8 have not been directly linked to 3M syndrome, a disorder associated with growth retardation, its interaction with CUL7 suggests a contributory role in the syndrome's pathology (Pan2020CullinRING).

In cancer, FBXW8 functions as a high-risk gene in kidney chromophobe cancer (KICH), with its expression levels being negatively related to certain tumor microenvironment scores, indicating its potential impact on tumor progression and immune infiltration (Huang2022Pancancer).

## Interactions
FBXW8 is an F-box protein that participates in several protein interactions, forming part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It interacts with SKP1 through its F-box motif, which is crucial for forming the SCF complex with Cullin1 and Cullin7. This complex is essential for the ubiquitination and degradation of specific substrates, such as β-TrCP1, which influences β-catenin levels and cell migration (Islam2021Cooperative).

FBXW8 also forms a complex with the Golgi protein Grasp65, catalyzing its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is specific to Grasp65 and does not occur with the related protein Grasp55. The PDZ1 domain of Grasp65 is necessary for this interaction (Litterman2011An).

In the context of placental development, FBXW8 interacts with both Cul1 and Cul7, acting as a linker between these proteins. This interaction is crucial for the formation of a complex that includes Rbx1 and is essential for normal placental development (Tsunematsu2006Fbxw8).

FBXW8 also interacts with HPK1 in pancreatic cancer cells, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, which is dependent on the kinase activity of HPK1 (Wang2014The).
