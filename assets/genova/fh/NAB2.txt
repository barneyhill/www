# NAB2

## Overview
NAB2 is a gene that encodes the NGFI-A binding protein 2, a transcriptional corepressor involved in the regulation of gene expression. This protein plays a critical role in modulating physiological processes such as peripheral nerve myelination and cellular differentiation by interacting with early growth response (EGR) transcription factors (Srinivasan2006NAB2). As a nuclear poly(A)-binding protein, NGFI-A binding protein 2 is also integral to mRNA processing and export, forming complexes with various proteins to facilitate these functions (Batisse2009Purification). The protein's ability to recruit the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex underscores its role in transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling (Srinivasan2006NAB2). Clinically, alterations in NAB2, such as gene fusions in solitary fibrous tumors, have significant implications for tumor behavior and prognosis, while its regulatory functions are crucial in conditions like scleroderma and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy (Georgiesh2021Clinical; Bhattacharyya2009The).

## Function
The NAB2 gene encodes a transcriptional corepressor protein that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. NAB2 interacts with early growth response (EGR) transcription factors, such as Egr1, Egr2, and Egr3, to modulate various physiological processes, including peripheral nerve myelination and cellular differentiation (Srinivasan2006NAB2). NAB2 functions by recruiting the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, specifically interacting with the CHD4 subunit, to repress transcription through histone deacetylation and chromatin remodeling (Srinivasan2006NAB2).

In fibroblasts, NAB2 acts as a negative regulator of TGF-β-induced responses, inhibiting collagen synthesis and myofibroblast differentiation by repressing Egr-1 signaling. This repression is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing excessive fibrotic responses (Bhattacharyya2009The). NAB2's role in transcriptional repression is also evident in its ability to modulate Egr-1-dependent transcriptional activity, thereby influencing cellular processes such as growth and differentiation (Svaren1996NAB2). Through these mechanisms, NAB2 contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cellular homeostasis in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NAB2 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In solitary fibrous tumors (SFT), NAB2-STAT6 gene fusions are a key molecular alteration. These fusions convert NAB2 into a transcriptional activator, influencing tumor behavior and prognosis. Different fusion variants, such as STAT6-TAD and STAT6-Full, are associated with distinct clinical outcomes, with the STAT6-TAD variant linked to higher mitotic counts and poorer survival rates (Georgiesh2021Clinical).

In the context of fibrotic diseases like scleroderma, NAB2 acts as a negative regulator of Egr-1-dependent TGF-β signaling. Impaired expression or function of NAB2 in dermal fibroblasts may contribute to excessive collagen accumulation and fibrosis, highlighting its potential role in the pathology of scleroderma (Bhattacharyya2009The).

Mutations affecting the NAB-binding domain of EGR2, which interacts with NAB2, have been linked to congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy. This condition resembles the non-myelinating phenotype seen in Egr2-deficient mice, underscoring the importance of NAB2 in peripheral nerve myelination (Srinivasan2006NAB2). These findings suggest that NAB2's interactions and expression levels are crucial in various disease contexts.

## Interactions
NAB2, a nuclear poly(A)-binding protein, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for mRNA processing and export. In yeast, NAB2 interacts with several proteins involved in mRNA export, including the poly(A)-binding protein Pab1, Mlp1, and the Sac3-Thp1 complex, which couples transcription with mRNA metabolism (Batisse2009Purification). NAB2 also forms a complex with Gfd1, which interacts with Nup42, Gle1, and Dbp5, facilitating mRNA export (Suntharalingam2004Nuclear). The interaction with Gfd1 is particularly important for NAB2's export function, as it may serve as a bridge to Gle1, aiding in the terminal step of mRNA export (Suntharalingam2004Nuclear).

NAB2 is associated with a broad range of yeast transcripts, indicating its role in global mRNA export (Batisse2009Purification). It is suggested that NAB2 and its partners bind at several sites along the mRNA in vivo, forming a core structure with other proteins (Batisse2009Purification). Additionally, NAB2 interacts with RNA exosome cofactors, such as Nrd1 and Ski7, which can suppress growth defects in certain NAB2 mutants, highlighting its role in RNA processing and quality control (Kinney2022The).
