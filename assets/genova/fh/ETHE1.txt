# ETHE1

## Overview
ETHE1 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme ETHE1 persulfide dioxygenase, which is crucial for the catabolism of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) within human cells. This enzyme is categorized as a dioxygenase and is integral to the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway, where it facilitates the conversion of persulfide to sulfite, thereby preventing the toxic accumulation of H2S. The ETHE1 protein plays a significant role in maintaining cellular redox balance and mitochondrial function, contributing to energy metabolism by regulating the catabolism of fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids. Mutations in the ETHE1 gene are linked to ethylmalonic encephalopathy, a severe metabolic disorder characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and vascular damage due to impaired H2S detoxification (Henriques2014Ethylmalonic; Rose2016H2S).

## Function
The ETHE1 gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme known as persulfide dioxygenase, which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in healthy human cells. This enzyme is part of the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway, where it catalyzes the oxidation of persulfide to sulfite, consuming molecular oxygen and water in the process (Sahebekhtiari2016Quantitative; Rose2016H2S). This reaction is essential for detoxifying H2S, a signaling molecule that can be toxic at high concentrations, thereby preventing its accumulation and the subsequent inhibition of critical enzymes like cytochrome c oxidase (Sahebekhtiari2016Quantitative; Henriques2014Ethylmalonic).

ETHE1 is active in the mitochondrial matrix and is involved in maintaining cellular redox balance and mitochondrial function. It contributes to energy metabolism by regulating the mitochondrial catabolism of fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids (Rose2016H2S). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the elimination of H2S produced by gut anaerobic bacteria, highlighting its role in maintaining mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics (Grings2019ETHE1). ETHE1's function in sulfide metabolism underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ETHE1 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial sulfur dioxygenase, are responsible for ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE), a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. EE is characterized by early onset encephalopathy, chronic diarrhea, petechiae, orthostatic acrocyanosis, and defective cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in muscle and brain tissues (Giordano2011Morphologic; Papetti2015Severe). The pathogenic mechanism involves the accumulation of hydrogen sulfide due to impaired ETHE1 activity, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and vascular damage (Cardoso2017Bioenergetics; Burlina2013Ethylmalonic).

Biochemically, EE is marked by elevated levels of lactic, ethylmalonic, and methylsuccinic acids in body fluids (Giordano2011Morphologic). Neuropathological findings include symmetrical necrotic lesions in deep gray matter structures, which may result from metabolite toxicity or vascular changes (Tiranti2004Ethylmalonic). The condition often leads to severe developmental delay, seizures, and hypotonia, with many patients succumbing to the disease within the first decade of life (BijarniaMahay2016Ethylmalonic; Balushi2021A).

Genetic sequencing has identified numerous ETHE1 variants associated with EE, highlighting the importance of expanding the variant spectrum for better diagnosis and understanding of the disorder (Chen2020Novel). Treatment options, including metronidazole and N-acetylcysteine, have shown some promise in improving clinical outcomes (Burlina2013Ethylmalonic; Giordano2011Morphologic).
