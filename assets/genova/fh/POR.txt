# POR

## Overview
The POR gene encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR), a critical component in the electron transfer chain that facilitates the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes. This enzyme is a membrane-bound flavoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of drugs, steroids, and other xenobiotics by transferring electrons from NADPH to cytochrome P450 enzymes (Hart2008P450; Pandey2013NADPH). Located on chromosome 7q11.2, the POR gene comprises 16 exons and encodes a protein of 680 amino acids (Nurhafizuddin2022In; Hart2008P450). The POR protein is characterized by its transmembrane domain and distinct binding sites for flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are essential for its electron transfer function (SHAFQAT2024Protein; Pandey2013NADPH). Mutations in the POR gene can lead to significant clinical disorders, including cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency, affecting steroidogenesis and drug metabolism (Pandey2013NADPH; Miller2009Genetic).

## Structure
The human gene POR encodes the cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) enzyme, a membrane-bound flavoprotein essential for electron transfer from NADPH to cytochrome P450 enzymes. The POR protein consists of 680 amino acids and is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 7q11.2, which contains 16 exons (Nurhafizuddin2022In; Hart2008P450).

The primary structure of POR includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein chain. The secondary structure is composed of alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of POR involves the folding of the protein into a three-dimensional shape, which includes distinct domains for binding flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), as well as NADPH. These domains are connected by a flexible hinge region that facilitates electron transfer (SHAFQAT2024Protein; Pandey2013NADPH).

The POR protein also features a transmembrane anchoring domain, which is crucial for its interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes. The hinge domain allows for conformational changes necessary for electron transfer. Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which may affect the protein's function and stability (Hart2008P450). The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) is a crucial enzyme in human cells, primarily involved in electron transfer processes. It facilitates the transfer of electrons from NADPH to cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are essential for various metabolic reactions, including the metabolism of drugs, steroids, and xenobiotics (Hart2008P450; Pandey2013NADPH). POR is located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and plays a significant role in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids, impacting physiological processes such as steroid hormone production and drug metabolism (Hart2008P450; Pandey2013NADPH).

The enzyme contains flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as cofactors, which are critical for its function. Electrons are transferred from NADPH to the FAD domain of POR, then to the FMN domain, and finally to the cytochrome P450 enzymes (Pandey2013NADPH). This electron transfer is essential for the catalytic activity of cytochrome P450s, which require electrons for their reactions (Pandey2013NADPH).

Mutations in the POR gene can lead to disorders affecting steroidogenesis and drug metabolism, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal physiological functions (Pandey2013NADPH; Miller2009Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POR (cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase) gene can lead to a range of disorders, most notably cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency (PORD), a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). PORD is characterized by a complex set of disorders that resemble combined deficiencies of multiple steroid-metabolizing enzymes, leading to conditions such as disorders of sexual development (DSD), ambiguous genitalia, and bone malformations similar to Antley-Bixler syndrome (Burkhard2017P450; Pandey2013NADPH). 

Mutations in the POR gene disrupt the activities of steroid-metabolizing enzymes like CYP17A1, CYP19A1, and CYP21A2, affecting the biosynthesis of steroid hormones in both the adrenal cortex and gonads. This disruption can result in ambiguous external genitalia at birth in both males and females (Burkhard2017P450). 

Specific mutations, such as R457H, have been identified as causing severe inactivation of several P450 enzymes, impacting drug metabolism and leading to symptoms like ambiguous genitalia, maternal virilization during pregnancy, and skeletal deformities (Bai2017Cytochrome). The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and can result in adrenal and gonadal dysfunction, with symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to severe forms resembling Antley-Bixler syndrome (Wang2023Diagnostic).

## Interactions
Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) is a key enzyme involved in electron transfer to cytochrome P450 enzymes, facilitating their catalytic activities. POR interacts with various cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, forming transient complexes essential for electron transfer. These interactions are primarily driven by electrostatic forces, involving acidic amino acids on POR and basic amino acids on CYPs, although hydrophobic interactions also play a significant role (Kenaan2011Uncovering; Pandey2013NADPH).

The conformational flexibility of POR is crucial for its function, allowing it to transition between open and closed states necessary for effective electron transfer. This flexibility is modulated by the hinge segment of POR, which influences its interaction with different CYP isoforms (Campelo2018Probing). Mutations in the hinge region can alter these interactions, affecting the electron transfer rates and the overall metabolic activity of CYPs (Campelo2018Probing).

POR also interacts with other proteins such as cytochrome b5, which can act as a redox facilitator or donor of a second electron to P450s. These interactions are competitive, with cytochrome b5 and POR vying for binding to CYPs, thereby influencing CYP activity (Campelo2018Probing). The presence of substrates and inhibitors can further modulate these interactions, affecting the electron transfer efficiency and metabolic outcomes (Kandel2014Role).
