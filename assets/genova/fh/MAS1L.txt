# MAS1L

## Overview
The MAS1L gene encodes a protein known as the MAS1 proto-oncogene-like, G protein-coupled receptor, which is a member of the 7-transmembrane (7-TM) superfamily of receptors. These receptors are characterized by their seven transmembrane domains, a structural feature that facilitates their role in signal transduction across the cell membrane (Fatakia2011Molecular; Younger2001Characterization). The MAS1L receptor is closely related to the MAS proto-oncogene receptor and is part of a cluster of receptors involved in sensory perception, particularly in the detection of painful stimuli (Surgand2005A). Although the precise biological functions and ligand interactions of the MAS1L receptor remain to be fully elucidated, its structural classification suggests a potential role in various cellular signaling pathways. Despite its structural similarities to other G protein-coupled receptors, the MAS1L receptor is predicted not to naturally bind small molecule ligands, indicating unique aspects of its function and interaction (Fatakia2011Molecular).

## Structure
The MAS1L gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is part of the 7-TM superfamily, characterized by seven transmembrane domains (Younger2001Characterization). This structural motif is typical of GPCRs, which have a single polypeptide chain traversing the cell membrane seven times, forming an interhelical cavity (Fatakia2011Molecular). The MAS1L receptor is similar to the MAS proto-oncogene receptor and is part of the MAS-related receptor cluster, which includes receptors involved in detecting painful stimuli (Surgand2005A).

The transmembrane cavity of the MAS receptor, which is related to MAS1L, is divided into two subsites, with subsite 2 being more polar and containing a negatively charged spot that may serve as an anchoring point for ligands (Surgand2005A). This structural feature is similar to that found in chemokine receptors. While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of the MAS1L protein are not provided, its classification within the 7-TM superfamily suggests a common structural motif shared among these receptors (Younger2001Characterization). The MAS1L receptor is predicted not to naturally bind small molecule ligands, indicating potential differences in ligand interaction compared to other GPCRs (Fatakia2011Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the MAS1L gene, which encodes a proto-oncogene-like G protein-coupled receptor, remains largely unclear. In the context of telomere biology disorders (TBDs), MAS1L has been identified as having differentially methylated CpG sites in individuals with extremely short relative telomere length (ES-RTL). These methylation changes suggest a potential role in disease progression, although the specific clinical implications are not well-defined (Carlund2023DNA). Despite these findings, there is no direct evidence linking MAS1L mutations to telomere-related processes or other specific diseases (Carlund2023DNA).

In the field of male infertility, studies have not found a significant association between MAS1L and impaired spermatogenesis, indicating that its role in this condition may be limited or non-existent (Krausz2015Genetics). Additionally, while MAS1L is located near the olfactory receptor gene cluster in the HLA genomic region, its clinical significance in relation to diseases such as acute graft-versus-host disease remains unexplored (Suzuki2022Sequence). Overall, while MAS1L is implicated in various cellular processes, its direct clinical significance in specific diseases requires further investigation.
