# ICOS

## Overview
The ICOS gene encodes the inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) protein, a pivotal component of the immune system that belongs to the CD28 family of T cell-specific costimulatory receptors. As a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, ICOS plays a crucial role in the regulation of immune responses by facilitating T cell activation, proliferation, and survival. It is primarily expressed on activated T cells and is instrumental in enhancing cytokine production and promoting interactions with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (Beier2000Induction; Simpson2010Regulation). The ICOS protein is characterized by its immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V-type) domain architecture, which is essential for its interaction with its ligand, ICOS-L, and subsequent intracellular signaling (Rujas2020Structural). This interaction is vital for the differentiation and function of various T helper cell subsets, including Th1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T cells, and is implicated in maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune responses (Simpson2010Regulation). Mutations in the ICOS gene can lead to immunodeficiencies and are associated with autoimmune diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in immune regulation (Schepp201714; Warnatz2020ICOS).

## Structure
The ICOS protein, encoded by the ICOS gene, is a member of the CD28 family of T cell-specific costimulatory receptors. It is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that adopts an immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V-type) domain architecture in its extracellular region (Rujas2020Structural). The extracellular domain of ICOS is characterized by two β-sheets, the A'GFCC' sheet and the BED sheet, connected by loops following Ig V-type topology (Bajorath1999A). A key structural feature is the FDPPPF motif in the FG loop, which is crucial for binding to its ligand, ICOS-L (Rujas2020Structural; Chattopadhyay2006Structural).

ICOS forms disulfide-linked homodimers on the cell surface, contributing to its quaternary structure (Rujas2020Structural). The protein contains three putative N-linked glycosylation sites, with the N110 glycan playing a role in modulating binding affinity to ICOS-L (Rujas2020Structural). Despite low sequence identity with other CD28 family members, ICOS shares structural similarities, such as the Ig-fold, with proteins like CTLA-4 and CD28 (Rujas2020Structural). The absence of the A-strand, typical in other IgSF proteins, indicates structural deviations in ICOS (Bajorath1999A).

## Function
The inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) is a crucial protein in the regulation of immune responses, primarily expressed on activated T cells. ICOS plays a significant role in T cell activation, proliferation, and survival by enhancing cytokine production and facilitating interactions with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (Beier2000Induction). It is involved in the co-stimulation of T cells, promoting the secretion of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10, and IL-21, which are important for T helper 2 (Th2) and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell responses (Simpson2010Regulation). ICOS is particularly effective in inducing IL-10 production, which is crucial for B cell differentiation and antibody production (Hutloff1999ICOS).

ICOS is active in lymphoid tissues, including the thymus, tonsils, and lymph nodes, where it supports the formation of germinal centers and aids in the maturation of B cells into plasma cells or memory cells (Hutloff1999ICOS; Beier2000Induction). It also plays a role in maintaining immune tolerance by promoting the development of regulatory T cells and preventing autoimmune responses (Simpson2010Regulation). ICOS signaling is essential for the differentiation and function of various T helper cell subsets, including Th1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T cells (Simpson2010Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ICOS gene lead to ICOS deficiency, a condition that manifests as a common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)-like disease. This deficiency is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections, particularly of the respiratory tract, due to hypogammaglobulinemia and impaired antibody production (Schepp201714; Warnatz2020ICOS). Patients with ICOS deficiency often exhibit low levels of IgG and IgA, while IgM levels may be elevated or normal (Warnatz2020ICOS). The condition is associated with a range of clinical features, including increased susceptibility to viral and opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders, and cancer (Schepp201714; MontesCasado2019ICOS).

ICOS deficiency affects both T and B cell compartments, leading to impaired germinal center formation and reduced memory B-cell numbers (Schepp201714; Warnatz2020ICOS). The deficiency also results in decreased T follicular helper (TFH) cells, which are crucial for effective immune responses (Warnatz2020ICOS). Some patients experience immune dysregulation, presenting with conditions such as psoriasis, arthritis, and enteropathy (Schepp201714; Warnatz2020ICOS).

Alterations in ICOS expression are also implicated in autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where increased ICOS expression on Tfh cells correlates with autoantibody production and disease progression (Wikenheiser2016ICOS).

## Interactions
The inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) protein engages in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in T cell activation and signaling. ICOS interacts with its ligand, ICOS-L, forming a complex that is crucial for T cell activation. This interaction is characterized by a central FDPPPF motif and residues within the CC' loop of ICOS, which are responsible for the specificity of the interaction. The ICOS N110 N-linked glycan also participates in binding with ICOS-L (Rujas2020Structural). The binding of ICOS-L to ICOS triggers intracellular signaling cascades through conserved motifs in the ICOS cytoplasmic tail, promoting T cell activation and differentiation (Rujas2020Structural).

ICOS also interacts with the tyrosine kinase Lck through its transmembrane domain (TMD), which is essential for the costimulation of TCR-triggered calcium mobilization and PI3K activation. This association enhances proximal TCR signaling and calcium mobilization, which are critical for T-cell function (Wan2018Transmembrane). The TMD of ICOS promotes a weak but constitutive association with Lck, which is crucial for these processes (Wan2018Transmembrane).

In addition to protein interactions, ICOS mRNA interacts with the Roquin protein and NUFIP2. Roquin binds strongly to a specific cis-element within the ICOS mRNA, which is crucial for its regulation. NUFIP2 enhances the binding affinity of Roquin to the ICOS mRNA, forming a ternary complex that facilitates the recognition and regulation of ICOS mRNA (Rehage2018Binding).
