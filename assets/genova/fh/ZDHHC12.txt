# ZDHHC12

## Overview
ZDHHC12 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 12, which is a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases. This enzyme is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through S-palmitoylation, a process that adds palmitate to specific cysteine residues, thereby influencing protein localization, stability, and function. ZDHHC12 is highly expressed in certain tissues, such as the stomach, and plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism and the maintenance of tight junction integrity through its interaction with claudin-3 (CLDN3) (Yuan2020ZDHHC12mediated; Korycka2012Human). The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts, including its potential impact on cancer progression and neurological disorders (Liao2024The; Bian2024Identification).

## Function
ZDHHC12 is a palmitoyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through S-palmitoylation, a process that involves the addition of palmitate to specific cysteine residues. This modification is essential for the proper localization, stability, and function of target proteins. In healthy human cells, ZDHHC12 is highly expressed in the stomach and is involved in the regulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism by tethering APP in the Golgi apparatus, which suppresses the generation of APP-containing vesicles and their trafficking into the late secretory pathway (Korycka2012Human).

ZDHHC12 also plays a significant role in maintaining the function of tight junctions by mediating the S-palmitoylation of claudin-3 (CLDN3), which is crucial for its localization to the plasma membrane and interaction with ZO-1, a protein that supports tight junction integrity (Yuan2020ZDHHC12mediated). Additionally, ZDHHC12 is involved in the palmitoylation of gephyrin, a scaffolding protein at inhibitory synapses, contributing to the regulation of GABAergic synapses and synaptic plasticity (Liao2024The). These activities highlight the enzyme's role in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking, impacting various physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
ZDHHC12 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in protein palmitoylation. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), high expression levels of ZDHHC12 are associated with shorter overall survival and are linked to lymph node metastasis and advanced pathological stages, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Bian2024Identification). ZDHHC12 is also overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and high-grade bladder cancers, indicating its potential role in these conditions (Bian2024Identification).

In glioma, ZDHHC12 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal glial cells, correlating with adverse clinical features and poorer survival outcomes. This suggests that ZDHHC12 could serve as a prognostic biomarker for glioma (Xu2022Zinc). In ovarian cancer, ZDHHC12 mediates the S-palmitoylation of claudin-3 (CLDN3), which is crucial for its membrane localization and stability. Alterations in ZDHHC12 expression can impact CLDN3's role in cancer progression, making ZDHHC12 a potential therapeutic target (Yuan2020ZDHHC12mediated).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZDHHC12 in various cancers, where its dysregulation can influence tumor growth and patient prognosis.

## Interactions
ZDHHC12, a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with claudin-3 (CLDN3), a tight junction protein, facilitating its S-palmitoylation. This modification is crucial for CLDN3's localization and stability on the plasma membrane, which is significant in ovarian cancer progression (Yuan2020ZDHHC12mediated). ZDHHC12's interaction with CLDN3 is essential for its colocalization with ZO-1, another tight junction protein, affecting the integrity of tight junctions (Yuan2020ZDHHC12mediated).

In the context of neurological functions, ZDHHC12 interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), tethering it in the Golgi apparatus. This interaction suppresses the generation of APP-containing vesicles and their trafficking, thereby downregulating APP metabolism and potentially influencing Alzheimer's disease pathology (Korycka2012Human). ZDHHC12 also palmitoylates gephyrin, a scaffolding protein at inhibitory synapses, contributing to the regulation of GABAergic synapses (Liao2024The).

These interactions highlight ZDHHC12's role in modulating protein localization and function through palmitoylation, impacting both cancer progression and neurological processes.
