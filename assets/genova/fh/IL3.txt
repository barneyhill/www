# IL3

## Overview
Interleukin 3 (IL3) is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein interleukin 3, which is primarily involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell formation. As a cytokine, interleukin 3 is categorized as a signaling molecule that influences the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The IL3 gene is expressed in various tissues, including the bone marrow and the central nervous system, where it plays a role in neural development and protection. The protein interleukin 3 functions by binding to a specific receptor complex composed of an alpha subunit (IL-3Rα) and a common beta subunit (βc), which is shared with other cytokines such as GM-CSF and IL-5. This interaction activates several intracellular signaling pathways, including JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT, which are crucial for cellular proliferation and survival (Kitamura1991Expression; Hara1996Function; Johnson1998Regulation). Dysregulation of IL3 expression or function is associated with various hematological malignancies and immune disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Borriello2019Innate; Blalock1999Signal).

## Structure
Interleukin 3 (IL-3) is a cytokine with a complex molecular structure that plays a crucial role in hematopoiesis. The primary structure of IL-3 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the IL3 gene. The secondary structure of IL-3 is predicted to include four alpha-helices, which are important for its function and interaction with its receptor (Kaushansky1992Structurefunction; Barry1994Two). These helices form a helical core similar to that of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), although with a different orientation (Bagley1996A).

The tertiary structure of IL-3 involves a well-packed hydrophobic core, with moderate steric clashes between hydrophobic side chains (Bagley1996A). The presence of specific residues, such as Cys 84 forming a disulfide bond with Cys 16, imposes structural constraints that differentiate IL-3 from other cytokines like GM-CSF and IL-5 (Bagley1996A).

In terms of quaternary structure, IL-3 interacts with its receptor, which consists of an alpha-chain and a beta-chain. Specific residues, such as Asp21 and Glu22, are crucial for binding to these receptor chains, affecting the cytokine's biological activity (Bagley1996A; Barry1994Two). These interactions are essential for IL-3's function in stimulating the proliferation of blood cell progenitors.

## Function
Interleukin 3 (IL3) is a cytokine that plays a significant role in hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell formation. It is involved in the survival, proliferation, and maturation of bone marrow-derived multipotential and lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitors. IL3 exerts its effects by binding to a receptor composed of an IL3-specific alpha subunit (IL-3Rα) and a shared beta subunit (βc), which is also part of the receptors for GM-CSF and IL-5. This binding leads to the dimerization of the receptor subunits and subsequent activation of various signaling pathways, including the JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT pathways, which are crucial for cellular proliferation and suppression of apoptosis (Kitamura1991Expression; Hara1996Function; Johnson1998Regulation).

IL3 is also expressed in neural progenitors and mature neurons, particularly in the neocortex, where it promotes the proliferation of neural progenitors and protects against neuronal death. This neurotrophic effect is mediated through the activation of the MAPK and JAK/STAT pathways, as well as the PI3K/AKT pathway, which enhances cell survival (Luo2012The). IL3's role in these processes highlights its importance in both hematopoietic and neural cell biology.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the IL3 gene are implicated in several hematological malignancies and immune disorders. Dysregulation of IL-3 expression, often due to constitutive activation of signaling pathways like the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade, can lead to abnormal IL-3 expression, contributing to autocrine transformation and the development of leukemia (Blalock1999Signal). Chromosomal translocations involving the IL-3 gene have been linked to aberrant expression in certain B cell lymphomas (Blalock1999Signal).

IL-3 is a survival factor in several hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where its specific receptor subunit, CD123, is overexpressed. This overexpression is associated with reduced patient survival, making CD123 a potential therapeutic target (Borriello2019Innate). Elevated IL-3Rα expression in AML is linked to enhanced blast proliferation, increased cellularity, and poor prognosis, suggesting its role in the pathophysiology of AML and its potential use as a prognostic marker (Testa2002Elevated).

IL-3 is also implicated in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. It plays a role in allergic asthma by inducing airway hyperresponsiveness and is involved in the pathogenesis of conditions like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis (Borriello2019Innate).

## Interactions
Interleukin 3 (IL3) interacts with its receptor complex, which consists of an alpha subunit (IL-3Rα) and a common beta subunit (βc). IL3 initially binds to IL-3Rα, forming a complex that subsequently associates with βc, leading to high-affinity binding and receptor activation (Stomski1996Human). This interaction involves the formation of disulfide-linked heterodimers between IL-3Rα and βc, which are crucial for receptor activation but not necessary for high-affinity binding (Stomski1996Human). The binding of IL3 to its receptor triggers noncovalent associations and facilitates the formation of disulfide-linked dimers through the cytokine receptor module (CRM) in βc, essential for recruiting tyrosine kinases and initiating cellular activation (Stomski1996Human).

The IL3:IL-3Rα interaction is characterized by multiple hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and van der Waals interactions, with the IL-3 α2-helix playing a crucial role in stabilizing the interaction (Broughton2018A). Specific residues, such as Asp21 and Glu22 in IL3, are critical for binding to the receptor's alpha and beta chains, respectively, and are essential for the cytokine's biological activity (Barry1994Two). The IL3:receptor complex can form higher-order structures, such as hexamers and dodecamers, which are important for receptor activation and signaling (Dey2009A).
