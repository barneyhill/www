# LMNB2

## Overview
The LMNB2 gene encodes lamin B2, a B-type nuclear lamin protein that is integral to the structural and functional integrity of the nuclear envelope. Lamin B2 is categorized as a nuclear lamina protein, characterized by its tripartite structure, which includes a central α-helical rod domain flanked by globular head and tail domains. This protein is essential for the assembly and maintenance of the nuclear lamina, a fibrous network that provides mechanical support to the nucleus and plays a pivotal role in chromatin organization, DNA replication, and gene expression regulation. Lamin B2 is ubiquitously expressed across various cell types, with particularly high levels in brain cells, and is crucial for normal organ development and cell homeostasis. The protein's interactions with other nuclear envelope components, such as lamin A/C and emerin, underscore its role in maintaining nuclear morphology and function. Mutations in the LMNB2 gene have been associated with several diseases, including progressive myoclonic epilepsy, ataxia, and lipodystrophy, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Damiano2015Mutation; Varlet2021A; Dittmer2011The).

## Structure
Lamin B2, encoded by the LMNB2 gene, is a B-type nuclear lamin protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope. The protein is characterized by a tripartite structure consisting of a central α-helical rod domain flanked by globular head and tail domains (Dittmer2011The). The rod domain is divided into segments, including coil 1 and coil 2, which are connected by linker regions (Kapinos2010Characterization). The tail domain contains a nuclear localization signal, an immunoglobulin-like domain, and a CAAX box, which undergoes farnesylation, a post-translational modification important for membrane targeting (Dittmer2011The).

The primary structure of lamin B2 includes conserved intermediate filament consensus motifs, which are essential for its assembly into higher-order structures (Kapinos2010Characterization). The secondary structure is dominated by coiled-coil regions that facilitate dimerization, a key aspect of its quaternary structure (Kapinos2010Characterization). Lamin B2 can form both homopolymeric and heteropolymeric arrays, interacting with other lamins to contribute to the nuclear lamina's mesh-like network (Kapinos2010Characterization). The protein is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels in brain cells, and is involved in various nuclear functions, including genome organization and chromatin regulation (Dittmer2011The).

## Function
The LMNB2 gene encodes lamin B2, a crucial component of the nuclear lamina, which is a fibrous network located at the inner face of the nuclear envelope. Lamin B2 plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of the nucleus and is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, chromatin organization, and gene expression regulation (Damiano2015Mutation; Varlet2021A). It is essential for the proper assembly of the nuclear lamina, providing mechanical support to the nucleus and influencing the organization of chromatin (Parry2021Heterozygous).

In healthy human cells, lamin B2 is involved in modulating the morphology, dynamics, and function of the nucleolus, contributing to the maintenance of nuclear shape and the organization of nuclear contents (Varlet2021A). It also plays a role in ensuring chromosome stability during mitosis by regulating proper mitotic chromosome segregation, which is crucial for normal cell cycle progression (Ji2022Lamin). Lamin B2 is expressed in almost all cells and is essential for normal organ development, acting as a global chromatin regulator and maintaining cell homeostasis (Zhao2024Advances).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LMNB2 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Variants of LMNB2 have been linked to progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) and ataxia, with specific mutations such as a homozygous missense mutation (c.469C>T, p.His157Tyr) identified in patients with autosomal recessive PME with early ataxia syndrome. This condition is thought to result from disrupted neuronal migration (Damiano2015Mutation). Another variant, c.473G>T (p.Arg158Leu), has also been associated with PME and ataxia, affecting the protein's conformation and function (Farajzadeh2021A).

LMNB2 mutations have been implicated in lipodystrophy, with a specific mutation (p.Arg234Trp) linked to abnormal fat distribution and premature cell senescence (Varlet2021A). In Alzheimer's disease, a reduction in lamin B expression, including LMNB2, has been noted, contributing to neuronal death (Evangelisti2022The). Aberrant expression or localization of lamin B2 is also associated with cancer development and metastasis, with differential expression observed in various cancer types (Evangelisti2022The). These findings underscore the critical role of LMNB2 in maintaining nuclear integrity and its involvement in diverse pathological conditions.

## Interactions
Lamin B2 (LMNB2) is a nuclear lamina protein that interacts with various other proteins, playing a crucial role in maintaining nuclear structure and function. It is known to interact with lamin A/C and emerin, which are also components of the nuclear envelope. These interactions are important for maintaining the integrity of the nuclear lamina and ensuring proper nuclear morphology (Varlet2021A).

LMNB2 is involved in the mechanical linkage between the nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton, potentially through interactions with SUN- and KASH-domain proteins. These interactions are essential for processes such as neuronal migration, where the nuclear lamina must coordinate with cytoskeletal elements to facilitate nuclear translocation (Coffinier2010Abnormal).

In the context of cancer, LMNB2 interacts with MCM7, enhancing the activity of the MCM7 helicase, which is crucial for DNA replication and cell proliferation in lung cancer cells (Ji2022Lamin). Additionally, LMNB2 is involved in the dimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9), a modification associated with the malignant phenotype of non-small cell lung cancer (Ji2022Lamin). These interactions highlight LMNB2's role in both structural and regulatory functions within the cell.
