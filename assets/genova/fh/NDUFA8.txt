# NDUFA8

## Overview
NDUFA8 is a gene that encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A8, a crucial component of mitochondrial complex I, the first enzyme complex in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein plays a significant role in cellular respiration by facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, thereby contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, which is essential for ATP synthesis. Structurally, NDUFA8 is characterized by its integration into the membrane arm of complex I, where it interacts with other subunits to ensure the stability and proper assembly of the complex (Padavannil2022The; Triepels1998The). The protein is particularly important in tissues with high energy demands, such as the heart and skeletal muscle, underscoring its role in energy metabolism (Triepels1998The). Mutations in the NDUFA8 gene can lead to mitochondrial complex I deficiency, resulting in clinical manifestations such as developmental delay and epilepsy (Yatsuka2020A).

## Structure
The NDUFA8 protein is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. It consists of 172 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 20.1 kDa (Triepels1998The). The primary structure of NDUFA8 includes a conserved motif of eight cysteine residues, which are separated by 9 or 11 amino acid gaps, potentially important for the protein's function (Triepels1998The).

In terms of secondary and tertiary structure, NDUFA8 is characterized by an N-terminal coil followed by six α-helices folded into an L-shape. This structure includes two disulfide crosslinked helix-turn-helix motifs. The first motif (α3-α4) interacts with subunits NDUFA13, NDUFB5, and NDUFA3, while the second motif (α5-α6) interacts with NDUFA1, ND1, and NDUFA13 (Padavannil2022The).

The quaternary structure of NDUFA8 involves its integration into the mitochondrial complex I, where it interacts with multiple subunits, including NDUFA13, NDUFS5, and NDUFA1. The C-terminal coil of NDUFA8 extends halfway down the membrane arm, interacting with several other subunits and lipid molecules, indicating its role in the stability and assembly of complex I (Padavannil2022The).

## Function
The NDUFA8 gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is the first and largest enzyme complex in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This complex plays a crucial role in cellular respiration by transferring electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, contributing to the creation of a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient necessary for ATP production by ATP synthase (Triepels1998The). NDUFA8 is involved in the assembly and stability of complex I, interacting with other subunits such as NDUFA13 and NDUFB5 to form stabilizing interactions essential for the proper assembly and function of complex I (Yatsuka2020A). 

The protein is located at the intermembrane space of complex I and contains Cx9C domains, which form intramolecular disulfide bridges that stabilize the protein's structure. These structural features are crucial for the protein's localization and function within the mitochondrial intermembrane space (Szklarczyk2011NDUFB7). NDUFA8 is expressed in a wide range of human tissues, with the highest levels found in tissues with high metabolic energy demands, such as the heart and skeletal muscle, indicating its significant role in energy metabolism (Triepels1998The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFA8 gene are associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency, a condition that can lead to developmental delay, microcephaly, and epilepsy. This deficiency is due to the impaired assembly and function of complex I, a crucial component of the oxidative phosphorylation process in mitochondria. A specific homozygous variant, p.Arg47Cys, has been identified as pathogenic, destabilizing the NDUFA8 protein and disrupting its interactions within complex I. This mutation results in decreased enzymatic activity of complex I and affects the assembly of respiratory supercomplexes, contributing to the clinical symptoms observed in affected individuals (Yatsuka2020A).

The pathogenicity of the NDUFA8 variant is further supported by complementation analyses, where the introduction of wild-type NDUFA8 into patient fibroblasts restored complex I activity and respiratory function. This confirms the critical role of NDUFA8 in maintaining mitochondrial function and highlights its importance in the assembly of complex I (Yatsuka2020A). The study of NDUFA8 mutations underscores the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of mitochondrial diseases, which can present with diverse symptoms affecting various organs (Yatsuka2020A).

## Interactions
NDUFA8 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is crucial for oxidative phosphorylation. It interacts with other subunits within complex I, such as NDUFA13 and NDUFB5, to facilitate the assembly and stability of the complex. A specific mutation, p.Arg47Cys, in NDUFA8 disrupts these interactions, particularly affecting the stabilizing salt-bridging interactions with NDUFA13 and NDUFB5, leading to impaired complex I assembly and function (Yatsuka2020A).

The NDUFA8 protein is part of the ND1 module of complex I, which includes other subunits like MT-ND1, NDUFA3, and NDUFA13/GRIM19. The absence of NDUFA8 affects not only the ND1 module but also other modules such as N, ND2, and ND5, indicating its broad role in complex I assembly (Yatsuka2020A).

In studies involving patient fibroblasts with a homozygous variant in NDUFA8, the introduction of wild-type NDUFA8 was able to restore complex I assembly and function, confirming the critical role of NDUFA8 in maintaining the integrity and activity of mitochondrial complex I (Yatsuka2020A).
