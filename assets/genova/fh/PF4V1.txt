# PF4V1

## Overview
PF4V1 is a gene that encodes the protein CXCL4L1, a variant of the chemokine platelet factor-4 (PF-4). This protein is primarily associated with platelets and plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including inflammation, coagulation, and angiogenesis. CXCL4L1 is notably more effective than its counterpart CXCL4 in inhibiting angiogenesis, making it a significant focus in research related to cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The protein's angiostatic properties are attributed to its interaction with cell surface glycosaminoglycans rather than traditional receptor binding, which distinguishes it from other chemokines (Struyf2004Platelets). Additionally, PF4V1 is involved in immune responses, particularly in the context of viral infections, and has been identified as a marker in distinguishing between Zika and Dengue virus infections (Allgoewer2021New). The gene's role in regulating cell proliferation and migration, especially in cancer cells, further underscores its clinical significance (Zhang2022Circular).

## Function
The PF4V1 gene encodes a protein known as CXCL4L1, a variant of the chemokine platelet factor-4 (PF-4). This protein is primarily active in platelets and is released during platelet activation. CXCL4L1 is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, significantly more effective than its counterpart CXCL4. It inhibits the chemotaxis of human microvascular endothelial cells towards interleukin-8 (IL-8) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and in vivo studies have shown its effectiveness in inhibiting bFGF-induced angiogenesis in rat corneas (Struyf2004Platelets).

CXCL4L1 plays a role in the regulation of blood coagulation and inflammation. It is involved in chemoattraction and activation of specific leukocytes in immunoinflammatory responses, and it also plays a role in activating blood platelets, which are crucial for hemostasis and wound healing (Struyf2004Platelets). The protein's angiostatic properties are attributed to its interaction with cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAG), rather than binding to a G-protein-coupled receptor (Struyf2004Platelets).

In addition to its role in angiogenesis, PF4V1 is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and migration, particularly in cancer cells, by targeting the ERK1 and AKT pathways (Zhang2022Circular).

## Clinical Significance
PF4V1, also known as CXCL4L1, plays a significant role in the progression of various diseases, particularly in cancer and cardiovascular conditions. In osteosarcoma, a malignant bone tumor, alterations in PF4V1 expression are linked to the suppression of tumor cell proliferation and migration. The circular RNA hsa_circ_0069117 enhances PF4V1 expression by sponging miR-875-3p, which inhibits the ERK1 and AKT pathways, crucial for cell proliferation and migration. This regulatory axis suggests that PF4V1 acts as a suppressor of osteosarcoma progression, and its expression alterations could have therapeutic implications (Zhang2022Circular).

PF4V1 is also involved in angiogenesis regulation. The chemokine CXCL4L1, a nonallelic variant of PF4, is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, significantly more effective than its counterpart CXCL4. This property makes CXCL4L1 a potential therapeutic target in diseases characterized by abnormal angiogenesis, such as certain cancers and vascular diseases (Struyf2004Platelets). The ability of CXCL4L1 to inhibit endothelial cell chemotaxis and angiogenesis highlights its clinical significance in managing conditions where angiogenesis is dysregulated.

## Interactions
PF4V1, also known as platelet factor 4 variant 1, is a chemokine involved in various biological processes, including inflammation and coagulation. It is secreted by the α-granules of activated platelets during platelet aggregation and has been implicated in promoting blood coagulation and inhibiting angiogenesis (Islam2018Genetic). 

In the context of viral infections, PF4V1 has been identified as a significant protein in distinguishing between Zika virus (ZIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV) infections. It is expressed at higher levels in patients with ZIKV compared to those with DENV, suggesting a role in the immune response to these infections (Allgoewer2021New). 

PF4V1 is also part of the chemokine signaling pathways, which are crucial in immune response and inflammation. It has been associated with the chemokine cascade in the context of MERS-CoV infection, indicating its involvement in chemokine/chemokine receptor pathways (Messina2020COVID19:). 

Despite its involvement in these processes, specific binding partners or interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids for PF4V1 have not been clearly identified in the available studies (Rijkers2017Monitoring).
