# MAST3

## Overview
The MAST3 gene encodes the microtubule associated serine/threonine kinase 3, a member of the AGC kinase family, which plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. This kinase is characterized by its serine/threonine kinase domain and a PDZ domain, which facilitate its enzymatic activity and protein-protein interactions, respectively (Labbé2008MAST3:; Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). MAST3 is predominantly expressed in the human brain, particularly in regions such as the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, where it is involved in modulating neuronal function and development (Spinelli2021Pathogenic). The protein's kinase activity is crucial for regulating protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) through phosphorylation of ARPP-16, thereby influencing various cellular processes (Andrade2017ARPP16; Musante2017Reciprocal). Mutations in the MAST3 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Spinelli2021Pathogenic; Shu2022The). Additionally, MAST3 is implicated in inflammatory processes, further underscoring its diverse biological roles (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

## Structure
The MAST3 protein is a member of the AGC kinase family and is characterized by a modular structure that includes a serine/threonine kinase domain and a PDZ domain. The kinase domain is crucial for its enzymatic activity, sharing high sequence identity with other MAST family members, such as MAST1, MAST2, and MAST4, with percentages of 89%, 89%, and 90%, respectively (Labbé2008MAST3:). The PDZ domain, located in the carboxy-terminal half, is involved in protein-protein interactions and can form homodimers, influencing kinase regulation (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). This domain is also responsible for binding to PTEN, a tumor suppressor, which increases PTEN stability and facilitates its phosphorylation (Labbé2008MAST3:).

MAST3 is composed of 1309 amino acids and includes a four alpha-helix bundle structure (Labbé2008MAST3:). The protein's structure is predicted using AlphaFold and has been experimentally solved, showing no significant differences (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated). The MAST3 gene can undergo alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may affect its structure and function. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are likely to regulate its activity (Spinelli2021Pathogenic).

## Function
MAST3 (microtubule associated serine/threonine kinase 3) is a kinase involved in the regulation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity through its interaction with ARPP-16, a protein that inhibits PP2A. MAST3 phosphorylates ARPP-16 at serine 46, which leads to the inhibition of PP2A, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways (Andrade2017ARPP16; Musante2017Reciprocal). This phosphorylation event is part of a complex regulatory mechanism that involves cAMP/PKA signaling, where PKA can phosphorylate ARPP-16 at serine 88, antagonizing the effect of MAST3 and reducing PP2A inhibition (Musante2017Reciprocal; Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

MAST3 is predominantly expressed in the human cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, and is active in excitatory neurons in the cortex during late prenatal development and postnatally (Spinelli2021Pathogenic). It is involved in modulating cellular responses to cAMP, which is crucial for maintaining cellular functions in healthy human cells (Musante2017Reciprocal). The kinase activity of MAST3 is regulated by phosphorylation at specific sites, such as threonine 389, which influences its role in cellular signaling (Musante2017Reciprocal). Through these mechanisms, MAST3 contributes to the regulation of neuronal function and development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAST3 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). De novo missense variants in the serine-threonine kinase (STK) domain of MAST3 are particularly associated with DEE, often presenting with early-onset seizures, developmental regression, and intellectual disability. These variants may lead to a gain-of-function effect, increasing phosphorylation of substrates like ARPP-16, which in turn inhibits protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, potentially contributing to the neurological symptoms observed in affected individuals (Spinelli2021Pathogenic).

In addition to DEE, MAST3 variants have been implicated in ASD, with a notable enrichment of missense variants in the domain of unknown function (DUF) in ASD cohorts. This suggests a potential role for MAST3 in the pathogenesis of ASD, possibly through altered interactions with other neurodevelopmental genes (Shu2022The).

MAST3 is also involved in inflammatory processes, as it has been shown to increase NF-κB activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) tissues, indicating its broader role in disease mechanisms beyond the nervous system (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated).

## Interactions
MAST3, a member of the microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase family, is involved in several protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. It phosphorylates ARPP-16 at Ser46, which is crucial for ARPP-16's role as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (Andrade2017ARPP16; Musante2017Reciprocal). This phosphorylation event is part of a regulatory mechanism where MAST3 and PKA (protein kinase A) have mutually antagonistic effects on ARPP-16, with PKA phosphorylating ARPP-16 at Ser88, thereby inhibiting MAST3's phosphorylation at Ser46 (Musante2017Reciprocal).

MAST3 also interacts with components of the NF-κB signaling pathway, influencing the phosphorylation of IκB and p65, which are critical for the regulation of inflammatory responses. This interaction is particularly relevant in the context of rheumatoid arthritis, where MAST3 modulates the inflammatory response and proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (Xu2019MAST3).

While specific interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided context, MAST3's involvement in signaling pathways suggests it may indirectly influence gene expression through its kinase activity and interactions with other proteins.
