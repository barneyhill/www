# TMEM196

## Overview
TMEM196 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 196, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cellular communication, due to its location spanning the cellular membrane. The gene and its encoded protein have been studied for their roles in several physiological and pathological contexts, particularly in relation to respiratory and ocular diseases. Alterations in the expression and methylation of TMEM196 have been associated with conditions such as lung cancer, NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease, atopic asthma, and primary open angle glaucoma, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Yan2021Exposure; Lee2019Associations; Huang2024GWASbysubtraction; Liu2018TMEM196).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TMEM196 has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression and methylation status. In lung cancer, TMEM196 hypermethylation is prevalent in tumor tissues, plasma, and sputum samples, but not in normal tissues. This hypermethylation is associated with poorer survival outcomes, making it a potential independent prognostic marker for lung cancer. The study by Liu et al. suggests that TMEM196 methylation could serve as a non-invasive biomarker for lung cancer detection and prognosis (Liu2018TMEM196).

In the context of respiratory diseases, polymorphisms in TMEM196 have been linked to NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD) in asthma patients. Certain single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TMEM196 are associated with a reduced risk of NERD, indicating a potential protective effect (Lee2019Associations).

TMEM196 is also involved in the pathogenesis of atopic asthma. A study identified a CpG site in TMEM196 associated with higher odds of atopic asthma, suggesting a role in the epigenetic regulation of this condition (Yan2021Exposure).

Additionally, TMEM196 has been linked to primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) through non-intraocular pressure-dependent mechanisms, suggesting its involvement in optic nerve head degeneration or trabecular meshwork remodeling (Huang2024GWASbysubtraction).
