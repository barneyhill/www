# PXN

## Overview
The PXN gene encodes the protein paxillin, a cytoskeletal adaptor protein that plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion, motility, and signal transduction. Paxillin is characterized by its multiple LIM domains and LD motifs, which facilitate interactions with a variety of proteins involved in the dynamic regulation of the cytoskeleton and focal adhesion complexes. As a scaffold protein, paxillin is integral to the assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions, thereby influencing cellular processes such as migration, proliferation, and survival. It is involved in the regulation of Rho GTPase signaling pathways and interacts with key proteins like Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) and integrins, which are essential for cellular responses to external stimuli. The dysregulation of PXN expression and paxillin function has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it contributes to tumor progression and metastasis (Chen2013Abnormal; Deakin2008Paxillin; Dubois2017Paxillin).

## Structure
Paxillin (PXN) is a cytoskeletal protein characterized by its multiple LIM domains and LD motifs, which facilitate interactions with other proteins involved in cell adhesion and motility. The primary structure of paxillin includes a series of proline-rich regions. Its secondary structure features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the stability and function of the protein. The tertiary structure involves the folding of LIM domains, which are crucial for its interaction with integrin β subunits. Specifically, the LIM2 and LIM3 domains exhibit a characteristic double zinc finger motif, with each domain comprising two orthogonally packed β-hairpins followed by an α-helix (Baade2024A).

The LIM3 domain contains a flexible loop region that is essential for binding to the integrin β3 carboxy terminus, facilitating cell adhesion and motility (Baade2024A). This loop, along with a hydrophobic patch, supports a clamplike mechanism for integrin β CT binding (Baade2024A). Paxillin can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which are common and play a role in its function. Several splice variant isoforms of paxillin exist, which may contribute to its diverse roles in cellular processes (Zhu2019Structural).

## Function
Paxillin, encoded by the PXN gene, is a multi-domain scaffold protein that plays a critical role in cell adhesion, signaling, and migration. It localizes to focal adhesions, where it serves as a platform for recruiting various regulatory and structural proteins essential for dynamic changes in cell adhesion, cytoskeletal reorganization, and gene expression (Deakin2008Paxillin). Paxillin interacts with integrins and the cytoskeleton, influencing the assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions, which are crucial for cell migration (Deakin2008Paxillin).

Paxillin is involved in the regulation of Rho GTPase signaling, coordinating the spatial and temporal actions of the Rho family of small GTPases, including Rac1 and RhoA, which regulate the actin cytoskeleton (Deakin2008Paxillin). It also interacts with proteins like Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) to organize the Golgi complex and centrosome, which are crucial for cell polarization and vesicle trafficking during cell migration (Dubois2017Paxillin).

Paxillin's phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues is important for its interactions and functions, such as adhesion disassembly and microtubule acetylation, which are vital for cell migration and polarization (Deakin2008Paxillin; Dubois2017Paxillin). These processes are essential for organismal outcomes like wound healing, immune response, and embryogenesis (Deakin2008Paxillin).

## Clinical Significance
Paxillin (PXN) is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In gastric cancer, PXN is frequently up-regulated, correlating with aggressive tumor characteristics such as distant metastasis and poor overall survival. It is considered an independent prognostic factor in these patients (Chen2013Abnormal). In colorectal cancer, high PXN expression is associated with advanced tumor stages, metastasis, and recurrence. PXN knockdown reduces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in cancer progression and as a potential therapeutic target (Wen2020Paxillin). PXN also contributes to drug resistance; in colorectal cancer, it is linked to resistance to cetuximab and 5-fluorouracil, with PXN overexpression stabilizing Bcl-2 and affecting the ERK signaling pathway (DU2015Paxillin; Wu2014Bcl2).

In prostate cancer, PXN is involved in both extranuclear and intranuclear signaling, influencing cell proliferation and potentially serving as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Sen2012Paxillin). In acute myeloid leukemia, high PXN expression is associated with poor prognosis, highlighting its significance in risk stratification and treatment improvement (zhang2021High).

## Interactions
Paxillin (PXN) is a focal adhesion adaptor protein that interacts with various proteins to regulate cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. It binds to vinculin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), with specific interaction domains identified on paxillin. The vinculin-binding site is localized to a 21 amino acid stretch (residues 143-164), while FAK binding requires this region plus a carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 265-313) (Brown1996Identification). Paxillin can localize to focal adhesions independently of vinculin and FAK interactions, primarily through the LIM3 domain (Brown1996Identification).

Paxillin also interacts with integrins, which cluster at adhesion sites, and is enriched at the periphery of newly formed adhesions (Deakin2008Paxillin). It plays a role in cell signaling through its interactions with proteins such as GIT1, FAK, and the GIT-PIX-PAK-NCK complex, which are involved in Rac1 signaling. Phosphorylation of the LD4 motif at S273 is crucial for these interactions, promoting GIT1 binding while reducing FAK's affinity (Deakin2008Paxillin).

Paxillin's interactions extend to kinases like ERK and pseudokinases such as ILK, as well as phosphatases like PTP-PEST, which regulate its phosphorylation and interactions with other proteins (Alpha2020Paxillin). These interactions are essential for cytoskeletal remodeling and cell migration.
