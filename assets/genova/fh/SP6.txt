# SP6

## Overview
The SP6 gene encodes the Sp6 transcription factor, a member of the Sp/KLF family of transcription factors characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains are crucial for the protein's ability to bind to GC-rich promoter regions, thereby regulating the expression of various genes involved in critical biological processes. The Sp6 transcription factor plays a pivotal role in amelogenesis, the process of enamel formation in teeth, by influencing the proliferation and differentiation of ameloblasts, the cells responsible for enamel production. Mutations in the SP6 gene have been linked to amelogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disorder affecting enamel development, and have also been implicated in prostate cancer susceptibility. The protein's function and interactions underscore its importance in both dental development and broader physiological contexts (Sipeky2021Novel; Smith2020A; Ruspita2020An).

## Structure
The SP6 transcription factor is composed of 376 amino acids and features three C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are essential for DNA binding. These zinc finger domains are located at specific regions: His254 to His278, Phe284 to His308, and Phe314 to His336 (Smith2020A). The first zinc finger domain includes residues Lys267, His270, and Ala273, which are predicted to be involved in DNA contact (Smith2020A). A missense variant, p.(Ala273Lys), has been identified in the first zinc finger domain, which is predicted to affect DNA binding by altering the structure and function of this domain (Smith2020A).

Although there is no structure file for SP6 in the Protein Data Bank, insights into its zinc finger domains can be drawn from NMR structures of the homologous SP1 protein (Smith2020A). The zinc finger domains facilitate binding to GC-rich promoter regions, a characteristic feature of the Sp/KLF family of transcription factors. The p.(Ala273Lys) variant involves a substitution with a large, polar side chain, which is unlikely to disrupt protein folding or zinc ion binding but may affect DNA docking (Smith2020A). The SP6 protein's role in amelogenesis and its potential post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are crucial for its activity and stability.

## Function
The SP6 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in amelogenesis, the process of enamel formation in teeth. In healthy human cells, SP6 is expressed during the secretory stage of amelogenesis and is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of the inner enamel epithelium (IEE) into ameloblasts, the cells responsible for enamel production (Smith2020A). SP6 contains three zinc finger domains that are crucial for its DNA-binding ability, allowing it to regulate the expression of various tooth-related genes (Smith2020A).

SP6 is known to bind to CG-rich promoter elements, influencing the transcription of target genes such as AMBN, which is essential for proper enamel development (Smith2020A). The transcription factor is also involved in a molecular pathway with Msx2, another transcription factor, to regulate the expression of follistatin (Fst), a signaling molecule important for ameloblast differentiation (Ruspita2020An). This interaction highlights SP6's role in a molecular cascade that controls the life cycle of ameloblasts and the overall process of amelogenesis (Ruspita2020An). SP6's activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it modulates gene expression critical for dental development (Smith2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SP6 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting dental development. Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), a genetic disorder characterized by defective enamel formation, has been linked to mutations in SP6. A novel de novo missense mutation, c.817_818delinsAT, resulting in the amino acid change p.(Ala273Met), has been identified as a cause of severe hypoplastic AI in humans. This mutation leads to a decreased level of mutant protein compared to the wild-type, despite similar mRNA levels, indicating a significant impact on protein expression (Kim2021A). Another missense variant, c.817_818GC>AA, resulting in p.(Ala273Lys), has also been associated with autosomal dominant hypoplastic AI, affecting the zinc finger domain crucial for DNA binding (Smith2020A).

In addition to dental disorders, SP6 has been implicated in prostate cancer susceptibility. A genome-wide association study identified SP6 as a novel risk gene for aggressive prostate cancer, with the intronic variant rs2074187 linked to higher odds of aggressive disease outcomes (Sipeky2021Novel). These findings suggest that SP6 mutations and alterations in its expression can have significant clinical implications.

## Interactions
The SP6 transcription factor, a member of the SP/KLF family, is involved in DNA binding through its zinc finger domains. It specifically interacts with DNA sequences, particularly those in the promoter regions of genes such as AMBN, ROCK1, and CA3, although it does not bind to others like AMTN (Smith2020A). The missense variant p.(Ala273Lys) in SP6 affects its DNA binding capability, particularly with the AMBN promoter, due to a faster dissociation rate of the mutant protein-DNA complex (Smith2020A). This variant is associated with amelogenesis imperfecta, a condition affecting enamel formation, by potentially reducing the transcription of AMBN during amelogenesis (Smith2020A).

SP6 also plays a role in the differentiation and proliferation of the inner enamel epithelium (IEE) and ameloblasts, which are critical for enamel formation (Yoshizaki2020Transcriptional). The interaction between SP6 and other transcription factors, such as AmeloD, is essential for epithelial cell invasion and proliferation, as demonstrated in double knockout mice (Yoshizaki2020Transcriptional). These interactions highlight SP6's role in regulating gene expression crucial for dental epithelial cell fate and enamel formation.
