# PTPRC

## Overview
The PTPRC gene encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C, commonly known as CD45, which is a type 1 transmembrane protein crucial for immune cell signaling. CD45 is expressed on nearly all hematopoietic cells, excluding mature erythrocytes and platelets, and functions as a protein tyrosine phosphatase. It plays a pivotal role in regulating immune responses by modulating the activity of Src family kinases and JAK family kinases, thereby influencing pathways such as the JAK-STAT signaling cascade (IrieSasaki2001CD45; Al2021Protein). The protein's structure includes two cytoplasmic phosphatase domains, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular domain that undergoes alternative splicing and glycosylation, contributing to its functional diversity (Al2021Protein). CD45 is essential for the activation and development of T and B cells, impacting antigen receptor-mediated signaling and immune homeostasis (Al2021Protein). Mutations and polymorphisms in the PTPRC gene have been linked to various immune disorders and malignancies, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Li2023PTPRC; Porcu2012Mutation).

## Structure
The protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C (PTPRC), also known as CD45, is a type 1 transmembrane protein expressed by all hematopoietic stem cells except erythrocytes and platelets. It is a large glycoprotein with a molecular weight ranging from 180 to 220 kDa, constituting about 10% of the surface antigens of positively expressing cells (Al2021Protein). The structure of CD45 includes two cytoplasmic domains, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular domain. The cytoplasmic region features a C-terminal tail, a wedge-like domain, and two tandem phosphatase domains, with the D1 domain being enzymatically active (Al2021Protein). The extracellular domain is composed of five regions, including an extended N-terminal region with alternatively spliced exons and several regions for O-linked glycosylation, contributing to the protein's variable area (Al2021Protein).

The CD45 gene, PTPRC, consists of 35 exons, with four acting as alternative mRNA splicing sites, affecting isoform expression. Human CD45 mRNA has six isoforms, characterized by combinations of 0, 1, 2, or 3 exons (Al2021Protein). The heterogeneity of the extracellular domain is due to glycosylation and alternative splicing, and all isoforms share a common intracellular domain structure (Al2021Protein).

## Function
The PTPRC gene encodes the CD45 protein, a critical regulator of immune cell signaling in healthy human cells. CD45 is a transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase expressed on almost all hematopoietic cells, except mature erythrocytes (Al2021Protein). It plays a vital role in modulating the activity of Src family kinases (SFKs) and JAK family kinases by dephosphorylating specific phosphotyrosine residues, thereby negatively regulating cytokine receptor signaling pathways such as the JAK-STAT pathway (IrieSasaki2001CD45; Al2021Protein). This regulation is essential for controlling cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, and survival, and maintaining immune homeostasis (IrieSasaki2001CD45).

CD45 is involved in the activation and development of T and B cells, influencing antigen receptor-mediated signaling and immune responses (Al2021Protein). It also affects T cell interactions with macrophages, impacting T cell proliferation and apoptosis (Al2021Protein). The protein's activity is crucial for balancing protein tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities, preventing overactivation of immune cells, which could lead to immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, or malignancy (Al2021Protein). CD45's role in immune cell signaling highlights its importance in both adaptive and innate immunity (Al2021Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PTPRC gene, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45, have significant clinical implications. In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), inactivating mutations in PTPRC lead to reduced CD45 expression, which enhances cytokine-induced signaling and contributes to leukemia progression. These mutations often occur alongside activating mutations in IL-7R, JAK1, or LCK, suggesting a synergistic effect in promoting oncogenic signaling pathways (Porcu2012Mutation).

PTPRC polymorphisms, such as C77G and A138G, are associated with various immune disorders. The C77G polymorphism affects CD45RO isoform expression and is linked to autoimmune hepatitis, HIV infection, and multiple sclerosis. The A138G polymorphism, prevalent in the Japanese population, alters CD45 isoform expression and is associated with diseases like Hepatitis B and Graves' disease (Al2021Protein).

In cutaneous melanoma, PTPRC expression is linked to prognosis and response to immunotherapy. High PTPRC expression correlates with better survival outcomes and is associated with immune-related pathways, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Li2023PTPRC).

PTPRC is also implicated in hematological malignancies, such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and treatment response (Al2021Protein).

## Interactions
PTPRC, also known as CD45, is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a critical role in immune cell signaling through its interactions with various proteins. One of its key interactions is with Src family kinases, particularly p56lck and p59fyn. CD45 is phosphorylated on Tyr-1193 by the p50csk kinase, creating a binding site for p56lck. This interaction is SH2-dependent, involving the SH2 domain of p56lck, and is crucial for T cell signaling as it forms a stable complex with phosphorylated CD45 in T cells (Autero1994Tyrosine). 

CD45 also interacts with p59fyn, another Src family kinase, and is essential for coupling the T cell receptor (TCR) to intracellular signaling pathways. This interaction facilitates the activation of signaling molecules such as phospholipase C, leading to calcium influx and protein kinase C activation (Shiroo1992CD45). 

Additionally, CD45 interacts with various ligands, including lectins like galectin-1 and galectin-3, which modulate its phosphatase activity and influence immune responses (Al2021Protein). These interactions highlight CD45's role in regulating immune cell activation and signaling.
