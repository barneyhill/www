# CASP6

## Overview
Caspase-6 (CASP6) is a gene that encodes the cysteine protease enzyme known as caspase 6, which is a member of the caspase family involved in the execution phase of cell apoptosis. As an effector caspase, caspase 6 plays a critical role in the apoptotic pathway by cleaving various substrates, thereby facilitating cellular disassembly. The protein is characterized by its catalytic cysteine-histidine dyad and is known for its involvement in both apoptotic and non-apoptotic processes, including neural development and immune responses (Unknownauthors2020NewlyIdentifiedFunctionofCaspase6inZBP1mediatedInnateImmuneResponses; Baumgartner2009The). Caspase 6 is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, due to its interactions with neuronal substrates like tau and huntingtin proteins (Ehrnhoefer2019Activation; Dagbay2017Caspase6). The gene's expression and activity are tightly regulated through various mechanisms, including post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in disease contexts (MacPherson2019Triarginine; Skotte2016Palmitoylation).

## Structure
Caspase-6 (CASP6) is a cysteine protease with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of CASP6 consists of a polypeptide chain that includes a catalytic cysteine-histidine dyad, essential for its enzymatic activity (Baumgartner2009The). The secondary structure features a central six-stranded beta-sheet flanked by five alpha-helices and three small beta-strands, forming a typical caspase fold (Skotte2016Palmitoylation; Wang2010Crystal). 

In its tertiary structure, CASP6 forms a homodimer, with each monomer contributing to the active site formation. The dimeric structure is stabilized by interactions between the central beta-sheets of the monomers (Baumgartner2009The; Wang2010Crystal). The quaternary structure of CASP6 is a stable dimer, even at low concentrations, indicating a high stability of this form (Baumgartner2009The).

CASP6 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation at cysteines 264 and 277, which regulate its activity by affecting the flexibility of loops and dimerization (Skotte2016Palmitoylation). The protein also features a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), which plays a role in its activation and function (Baumgartner2009The).

## Function
Caspase-6 (CASP6) is an effector caspase involved in various physiological processes in human cells. It plays a role in the normal physiological turnover of the epithelial lining of the colon, where it is activated in mucosal cells at the crypt openings, suggesting its involvement in epithelial cell anoikis, a form of programmed cell death (Godefroy2013Expression). CASP6 is also highly expressed in fetal tissues, indicating a potential role in fetal development, possibly in apoptosis regulation or other functions such as organelle dissolution in the lens of the eye and the proliferation and differentiation of B lymphocytes (Godefroy2013Expression).

In adult tissues, CASP6 is less abundant in the brain, which may contribute to long-term neuronal survival (Godefroy2013Expression). It is involved in axon pruning through the death receptor 6 pathway during neural development, indicating its role in neural development and maintenance (Cao2012Inhibitory). CASP6 is expressed as a zymogen and undergoes proteolytic processing for activation, which involves cleavage at specific aspartate residues (Wang2010Crystal). Despite its roles in apoptosis, CASP6 can self-activate without inducing cell death, suggesting it may have non-apoptotic functions in healthy cells (Klaiman2009Selfactivation).

## Clinical Significance
Caspase-6 (CASP6) is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD). In AD, CASP6 activation is an early event associated with neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, contributing to synaptic loss and cognitive decline (Wang2015Activation; Graham2011Caspase6). CASP6 cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau, which are involved in AD pathogenesis (Skotte2016Palmitoylation). In HD, CASP6 activation is linked to the cleavage of the huntingtin protein (HTT), a critical step in disease progression (Graham2010Cleavage; Skotte2016Palmitoylation). The YAC128 mouse model of HD shows increased CASP6 activity due to dysfunctional HIP14, a palmitoyl acyltransferase that normally inhibits CASP6 activation (Skotte2016Palmitoylation).

CASP6 is also associated with conditions like stroke and inflammatory pain, where its activation contributes to neuronal apoptosis and axonal degeneration (Graham2011Caspase6). Genetic ablation of CASP6 in mice has shown neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke models (Skotte2016Palmitoylation). CASP6 mutations, such as R259H, have been reported in cancer, where they reduce catalytic efficiency and may contribute to tumorigenesis by decreasing apoptotic activity (Dagbay2017TumorAssociated).

## Interactions
Caspase-6 (CASP6) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in apoptosis and inflammation. CASP6 interacts with receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) to enhance its interaction with Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), promoting the assembly of the PANoptosome complex. This complex is essential for PANoptosis, a form of programmed cell death that integrates pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (Unknownauthors2020NewlyIdentifiedFunctionofCaspase6inZBP1mediatedInnateImmuneResponses).

CASP6 also interacts with several neuronal substrates, including microtubule-associated protein Tau, amyloid precursor protein, and huntingtin protein, which are significant in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases (Dagbay2017Caspase6). In Huntington's disease, CASP6 cleaves huntingtin at a specific site, and this interaction is crucial for disease progression (Ehrnhoefer2019Activation).

The tri-arginine exosite patch (42 RRR 44) of CASP6 is critical for substrate recognition and binding, facilitating interactions with substrates such as lamin A/C, PARP, and DJ-1 (PARK7) (MacPherson2019Triarginine). This exosite is important for stabilizing CASP6 and mediating dynamic contacts with substrates (MacPherson2019Triarginine). CASP6's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in apoptosis and its potential as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.
