# GRHPR

## Overview
The GRHPR gene encodes the enzyme glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate reductase, a member of the D-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase superfamily. This enzyme is crucial for the detoxification of glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate, catalyzing their reduction to glycolate and D-glycerate, respectively. This process is vital for preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as oxalate, which can lead to primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2), a rare metabolic disorder. The GRHPR protein functions as a homodimer, with each subunit comprising 328 amino acids, and is predominantly active in the liver and kidneys. Its activity is regulated by the cytoplasmic levels of NADPH, which it preferentially uses as a cofactor. Mutations in the GRHPR gene can lead to a deficiency in enzyme activity, resulting in the clinical manifestations of PH2 (Mdluli2005A; Cramer1999The; Booth2006Structural).

## Structure
The GRHPR protein is a homodimeric enzyme, with each subunit consisting of 328 amino acid residues. The primary structure of GRHPR includes specific regions that contribute to its functional domains (Oppici2017Folding). The secondary structure is characterized by two α/β/α domains per subunit. The smaller domain, comprising residues 5-106 and 299-328, adopts a flavodoxin-like fold. The larger domain, spanning residues 107-298, forms the coenzyme-binding domain, which features a core sheet of six strands flanked by three α-helices on one side and four α-helices on the other, typical of the NAD(P) binding Rossmann fold (Oppici2017Folding).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to form a functional enzyme, with the active site located in the cleft between the two domains. The quaternary structure is defined by the dimerization of two subunits, facilitated by a large interface involving an extended helical segment and a dimerization loop (Lassalle2016New). A conserved tryptophan residue (Trp141) in the dimerization loop is crucial for substrate specificity and allosteric regulation (Oppici2017Folding). The enzyme's active site is connected to the protein surface by a tunnel that regulates substrate trafficking (Lassalle2016New).

## Function
The GRHPR gene encodes the enzyme glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase, which plays a crucial role in the detoxification of glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate in human cells. This enzyme catalyzes the reduction of glyoxylate to glycolate and hydroxypyruvate to D-glycerate, processes that are essential for preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as oxalate, which can lead to conditions like primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2) (Mdluli2005A; Booth2006Structural). GRHPR is primarily active in the liver and kidneys, where it contributes to metabolic pathways that maintain cellular homeostasis (Cramer1999The).

The enzyme functions as a homodimer, with each subunit containing 328 amino acids, and belongs to the D-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenase superfamily. Its activity is regulated by the cytoplasmic levels of NADPH, which it preferentially uses as a cofactor over NADH, due to a tighter binding affinity (Mdluli2005A; Booth2006Structural). This preference is significant in directing the reduction of glyoxylate over its oxidation to oxalate by lactate dehydrogenase, thus playing a protective role in cellular metabolism (Booth2006Structural). The enzyme's active site is located between its coenzyme-binding and substrate-binding domains, allowing it to accommodate both small and large substituents at the reducible carbonyl group (Booth2006Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GRHPR gene are associated with primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the overproduction of oxalate, leading to kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis, and renal failure (Cramer1999The; Danpure2004Molecular). The GRHPR gene encodes the enzyme glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate reductase, which is crucial for glyoxylate metabolism. Deficiencies in this enzyme result in the accumulation of oxalate and L-glycerate, contributing to the clinical manifestations of PH2 (Cramer1999The; Danpure2004Molecular).

Several mutations have been identified in the GRHPR gene, including point mutations, deletions, and frameshift mutations, which lead to reduced or absent enzyme activity (Konkoľová2017Severe; Danpure2004Molecular). A specific mutation, c.103delG, accounts for a significant proportion of mutant alleles, facilitating genetic testing for PH2 (Bhat2005Tissue). The presence of these mutations can result in a complete loss of glyoxylate reductase activity, contributing to the disease's pathology (Danpure2004Molecular).

The clinical management of PH2 has evolved with the understanding of these molecular defects, although challenges remain in diagnosis due to variability in urinary metabolite levels and the impact of renal function deterioration (Danpure2004Molecular).
