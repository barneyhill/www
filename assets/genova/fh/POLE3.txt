# POLE3

## Overview
The POLE3 gene encodes the DNA polymerase epsilon 3, accessory subunit, which is a critical component of the DNA polymerase epsilon complex involved in DNA replication and repair. This protein functions as a histone chaperone, specifically interacting with histones H3 and H4, and plays a vital role in maintaining chromatin integrity during DNA replication. The POLE3 protein, in conjunction with POLE4, forms a complex that facilitates the proper assembly and recycling of nucleosomes, ensuring the accurate duplication of genomic DNA and the preservation of epigenetic information. The structural configuration of POLE3, including its histone fold domain, enables it to interact effectively with other proteins and histones, contributing to chromatin dynamics at the replication fork. Dysregulation or mutations in the POLE3 gene have been linked to genomic instability and are implicated in the development of certain cancers, highlighting its significance in maintaining genomic stability and cellular identity (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4).

## Structure
The POLE3 protein is a component of the POLE3-POLE4 complex, which plays a crucial role in maintaining chromatin integrity during DNA replication. The primary structure of POLE3 includes a histone fold domain (H2B-like) located at its N terminus, followed by two alpha helices (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4). This configuration allows POLE3 to interact with POLE4, which contains a C-terminal H2A-like histone fold domain. The interaction between POLE3 and POLE4 is essential for the stability of the PolÎµ complex, with specific residues such as Phe44 in POLE3 and Phe74 in POLE4 engaging in pi stacking interactions (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4).

The tertiary structure of POLE3 has been modeled by superposing it onto H2B using Phyre2, indicating structural similarities with histone proteins (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4). The quaternary structure involves its interaction with POLE4 and histones H3-H4, suggesting a role in linking the replisome and histone assembly pathways (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4). The C-terminal portion of POLE3 is a major interaction site with the histone fold domain of H4, crucial for binding H3-H4 (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4). The POLE3-POLE4 complex can bind both H3-H4 dimers and tetramers, indicating its role as a histone chaperone (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4).

## Function
The POLE3 gene encodes a subunit of the DNA polymerase epsilon complex, which plays a crucial role in DNA replication and repair. In healthy human cells, POLE3 functions as part of the POLE3-POLE4 complex, acting as a histone H3-H4 chaperone essential for maintaining chromatin integrity during DNA replication. This complex is involved in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly, facilitating the proper deposition and recycling of histones H3-H4, which is critical for the accurate duplication of genomic DNA and the transmission of epigenetic information (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4).

POLE3, along with POLE4, binds directly to histones H3-H4, promoting tetrasome formation and DNA supercoiling, which are necessary for chromatin assembly and stability. This interaction is crucial for the proper deposition of the replicative H3.1 histone variant and is essential for chromatin dynamics at the replication fork (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4). The POLE3-POLE4 complex is associated with the replisome and coordinates with other chaperones to ensure the recycling of parental histones and the deposition of newly synthesized ones, maintaining genomic stability and cellular differentiation (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4). This function is vital for the maintenance of cellular identity and has implications for genetic diseases and cancer (Bellelli2018POLE3POLE4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the POLE3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal and endometrial cancers. These changes can lead to genomic instability, which is a hallmark of cancer development. Genomic instability results from the impaired ability of cells to accurately replicate and repair DNA, leading to an accumulation of mutations that can drive cancer progression. In particular, alterations in POLE3 expression or its interactions with other proteins involved in DNA replication and repair may disrupt normal cell cycle regulation and the DNA damage response, further contributing to tumorigenesis.

The role of POLE3 in maintaining genomic stability suggests that its dysfunction could be a critical factor in the onset and progression of these cancers. Research into the specific mutations and expression changes in POLE3 associated with cancer could provide insights into potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for early detection and treatment. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which POLE3 alterations contribute to cancer could also aid in the development of strategies to mitigate the effects of these changes, potentially improving patient outcomes.
