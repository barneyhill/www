# UPK3BL2

## Overview
UPK3BL2 is a gene that encodes the protein uroplakin 3B like 2, which is a member of the uroplakin family. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is involved in the formation of the asymmetric unit membrane (AUM) in urothelial cells. The AUM plays a crucial role in maintaining the permeability barrier of the bladder epithelium, which is essential for proper urinary function. Uroplakin 3B like 2 is thought to contribute to the structural integrity and function of the urothelial surface, although its specific biological roles and mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest in studies exploring their potential implications in bladder-related disorders and diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
