# NEMP2

## Overview
NEMP2, or nuclear envelope integral membrane protein 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein integral to the nuclear envelope. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope, which is essential for proper cellular function and genomic stability. The NEMP2 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including nuclear organization and gene expression regulation. Its significance is underscored by its involvement in several clinical conditions, such as non-small-cell lung cancer and Sjögren's syndrome, where it serves as a prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target (Lathwal2020Identification; Khatri2022Genomewide). Despite its recognized roles, the full spectrum of NEMP2's functions and its implications in human health and disease continue to be areas of active research.

## Clinical Significance
The NEMP2 gene, known for its role in maintaining nuclear envelope integrity, has been implicated in various clinical conditions when mutated or dysregulated. In the context of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), NEMP2 is part of a prognostic gene signature that helps classify patients into high and low-risk groups based on gene expression profiles. This suggests its potential clinical significance in the prognosis of LUAD (Lathwal2020Identification).

In a genome-wide association study, NEMP2, also referred to as TMEM194B/NEMP2, was identified as a cis-eQTL in the minor salivary gland, associated with Sjögren's syndrome. Specific variants, such as rs11900804, rs2192008, and rs744600, were linked to altered promoter activity and gene expression, indicating a potential role in the pathogenesis of this autoimmune condition (Khatri2022Genomewide).

Although the NEMP2 gene is mentioned in the context of a missense variant leading to a leucine to arginine change, the clinical significance of this mutation remains unclear, as it has not been directly associated with recessively inherited neurodevelopmental phenotypes (Stephen2018Biallelic). Overall, NEMP2's involvement in disease processes highlights its importance in clinical research and potential therapeutic targeting.
