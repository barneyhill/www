# CELSR2

## Overview
CELSR2 is a gene that encodes the cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 2, a transmembrane protein that is part of the cadherin superfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in planar cell polarity (PCP) and neural development, contributing to processes such as cell adhesion, signaling, and tissue organization. CELSR2 is primarily localized to the cell membrane, where it influences cellular communication and the alignment of cells within tissues. It is particularly significant in neural development, where it is involved in axon guidance, neuronal migration, and the biogenesis of motile cilia. Additionally, CELSR2 is implicated in peripheral nerve regeneration and has been associated with various clinical conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma, neural tube defects, and cardiovascular diseases (Vilboux2017CELSR2; Dunn2023Exonic; Zhou2020Silencing).

## Function
CELSR2 is a member of the cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor family, which plays a significant role in planar cell polarity (PCP) and neural development. This protein is involved in cell adhesion and signaling, crucial for the proper orientation and alignment of cells within tissues. CELSR2 is primarily active in the cell membrane, where it influences cellular communication and tissue organization (Vilboux2017CELSR2).

In the context of neural development, CELSR2 is implicated in axon guidance and neuronal migration, processes essential for brain wiring and the formation of the nervous system (Vilboux2017CELSR2; Dunn2023Exonic). It is also involved in the biogenesis and planar polarization of motile cilia in ependymal cells, contributing to the maintenance of the mature cortex and potentially influencing neuronal recovery after traumatic events (Basta2023Celsr1; Dunn2023Exonic).

CELSR2 also plays a role in peripheral nerve regeneration by promoting the proliferation and migration of Schwann cells through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for nerve regeneration, as it regulates cellular processes like proliferation and migration (Zhou2020Silencing). The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in both central and peripheral nervous system development and repair.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CELSR2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CELSR2 is identified as a novel prognostic biomarker. Its mRNA and protein levels are significantly elevated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and high expression is associated with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages. Genetic alterations in CELSR2, including missense mutations, occur in about 8% of HCC cases and are linked to tumor development through pathways like cell adhesion and the Hippo signaling pathway (Xu2020Identification).

CELSR2 is also associated with neural tube defects (NTDs), such as spina bifida, where rare damaging mutations in the gene contribute to the genetic etiology of these conditions. The p.Thr2026Met mutation in CELSR2 affects planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, crucial for neural tube development (Chen2018Genetic).

In cardiovascular diseases, CELSR2 is part of a gene cluster associated with conditions like coronary artery disease. Polymorphisms such as rs599839 and rs646776 in the CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1 cluster are linked to increased cardiovascular risk, potentially through effects on serum lipid and cholesterol levels (CastilloAvila2023Association).

## Interactions
CELSR2, a member of the cadherin superfamily, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in planar cell polarity (PCP) and neural development. CELSR2 can recruit core PCP proteins such as Frizzled 6 (Fz6) and Vang-like 2 (Vangl2) to sites of homophilic adhesion, indicating a physical association with these proteins. However, the enrichment of Fz6 and Vangl2 at CELSR2 junctions is lower compared to CELSR1, possibly due to the lower junctional enrichment of CELSR2 itself (Basta2023Celsr1).

In the context of neural development, CELSR2 interacts with Frizzled 3 (FZD3) and is involved in axon guidance and dendrite development. The interactions of CELSR2 with FZD3 and other PCP-related genes like VANGL2 and WNT5a are crucial for processes such as facial branchiomotor neuron migration and ciliogenesis (Goffinet2017Seven). CELSR2 is also implicated in synaptic function, where it plays a role in modulating interactions between spinal motoneurons and interneurons, affecting synaptic plasticity and remodeling (Yu2023Celsr2).

These interactions highlight CELSR2's involvement in complex signaling pathways that regulate cell adhesion, migration, and tissue organization.
