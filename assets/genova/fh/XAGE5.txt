# XAGE5

## Overview
XAGE5 is a gene that encodes the protein X antigen family member 5, which is part of the cancer/testis antigen family. This protein is characterized by its expression in various cancer types and restricted expression in normal tissues, primarily the testis, making it a potential target for cancer immunotherapy. X antigen family member 5 is involved in cellular processes that are not yet fully understood, but its expression pattern suggests a role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The gene's expression and the protein's function are subjects of ongoing research, particularly in the context of their potential utility in cancer diagnosis and treatment (Qiu2020aarFDC).
