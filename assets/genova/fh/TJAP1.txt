# TJAP1

## Overview
TJAP1, or tight junction associated protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the formation and maintenance of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. These tight junctions are crucial for maintaining cell polarity and barrier functions, thereby regulating paracellular permeability and cellular signaling pathways. The TJAP1 protein is typically localized at the cell membrane within tight junction complexes, where it contributes to the structural integrity and stabilization of these cellular barriers. It is involved in the later stages of tight junction assembly, playing a role in stabilizing the junctional-interacting complex, which connects membranous tight junction components with the actin cytoskeleton. This protein is categorized as a structural component of tight junctions, and its interactions with other proteins, such as ENAH and Mint proteins, underscore its role in cellular processes related to actin remodeling and Golgi architecture (Cao2015Tight; Hwang2022Native; Weeratunga2023Interrogation).

## Structure


## Function
TJAP1 (tight junction associated protein 1) is involved in the formation and maintenance of tight junctions, which are essential for maintaining cell polarity and barrier functions in epithelial and endothelial cells. It plays a critical role in regulating paracellular permeability and cellular signaling pathways. TJAP1 is typically localized at the cell membrane, particularly in tight junction complexes, where it is thought to stabilize tight junction plaques and contribute to the structural integrity of these cellular barriers (Cao2015Tight).

In the context of tight junction assembly, TJAP1 is incorporated at the later stages and is postulated to play a role in stabilizing the junctional-interacting complex, a multi-molecular structure that bridges membranous tight junction components with the actin cytoskeleton (Cao2015Tight). This complex is crucial for the biogenesis and signaling of tight junctions, and its disruption can lead to increased barrier permeability (Cao2015Tight).

While specific functions of TJAP1 in healthy human cells are not detailed extensively, its involvement in maintaining tight junction integrity suggests it is vital for preserving the selective permeability and protective functions of epithelial and endothelial barriers (Cao2015Tight).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TJAP1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a study identified a 4.5 Mb shared genetic segment in families with multiple affected individuals, which includes potential variants affecting TJAP1. This suggests a possible role for TJAP1 in the genetic architecture of IBD, particularly in familial cases of Crohn's disease (Stittrich2016Genomic).

In cardiovascular research, TJAP1 expression has been linked to the severity of chronic mitral valve disease in dachshunds. The gene is part of the 'Tight Junction Assembly' pathway, which was found to be significantly regulated in patients with advanced heart disease, indicating that TJAP1 expression in peripheral blood cells may correlate with disease severity (Garncarz2016Correlation).

TJAP1 is also involved in maintaining blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Studies have shown that miR-132/212 can regulate TJAP1 expression, impacting BBB stability after ischemic stroke. This regulation is crucial for protecting against BBB breakdown, suggesting that alterations in TJAP1 expression could affect neurological outcomes post-stroke (Yan2021MiRNA132212; Burek2019HypoxiaInduced).

## Interactions
TJAP1, or tight junction associated protein 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in maintaining tight junction integrity. It interacts with the ENAH protein, a member of the Ena/VASP family, which is involved in actin remodeling. This interaction is significant as it suggests a role for TJAP1 in cellular processes related to the Golgi body, as ENAH is known to regulate Golgi architecture (Hwang2022Native).

TJAP1 also interacts with Mint proteins, specifically the PTB domains of Mint1 and Mint2. These interactions are distinct from the canonical NPxY motif interactions, involving a sequence from TJAP1 that forms specific structural and electrostatic contacts with Mint1. The binding affinity of the TJAP1 peptide to the Mint1 PTB domain is measured at 20.9 µM, indicating a modest interaction compared to other known interactions of Mint proteins (Weeratunga2023Interrogation).

In the context of tight junctions, TJAP1 is part of the junctional-interacting complex, which includes proteins like VAP-33 and cingulin. This complex is essential for bridging membranous tight junction components with the actin cytoskeleton, and its dysregulation can lead to tight junction disassembly and increased barrier permeability (Cao2015Tight).
