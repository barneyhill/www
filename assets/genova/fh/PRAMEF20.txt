# PRAMEF20

## Overview
PRAMEF20, or Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma Family Member 20, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma) family. This family of proteins is characterized by their role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and immune response modulation. PRAMEF20 is particularly noted for its expression in certain cancer types, where it may contribute to tumorigenesis by influencing pathways related to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The protein encoded by PRAMEF20 is not classified as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but rather as a member of a family of cancer-testis antigens, which are typically expressed in a restricted manner in normal tissues but are upregulated in various malignancies (Qiu2020aarFDC).
