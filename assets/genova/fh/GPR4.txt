# GPR4

## Overview
GPR4 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 4, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is involved in a variety of physiological processes, primarily through its role as a proton-sensing receptor that responds to changes in extracellular pH. GPR4 is expressed in several tissues, including endothelial cells, where it plays a significant role in vascular biology and homeostasis. It is also involved in the regulation of respiratory and renal functions, influencing processes such as breathing and acid-base balance. At the molecular level, GPR4 activates signaling pathways like the Gs/cAMP pathway, which are crucial for maintaining physiological homeostasis. The receptor's interactions with other proteins, such as Gα proteins and potassium channels, further underscore its involvement in complex signaling networks. Clinically, GPR4 is implicated in various diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Marie2023GPR4; Imenez2022Physiological; Justus2024The).

## Structure
The GPR4 protein is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by seven hydrophobic, potentially membrane-spanning regions, which are typical of GPCRs (MAHADEVAN1995Isolation). The primary structure of GPR4 includes an open reading frame encoding a protein of 362 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 41 kDa (MAHADEVAN1995Isolation). The protein has a potential N-linked glycosylation site at the N-terminus and another in the second extracellular loop, which are common post-translational modifications in GPCRs (MAHADEVAN1995Isolation). Additionally, there are multiple potential protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites within the third intracellular loop and the carboxy terminus (MAHADEVAN1995Isolation).

GPR4 is known to form dimers, both homo- and hetero-dimers, with other receptors such as LPA and S1P receptors. The dimerization involves different domains, including the N-terminal 'body' and the C-terminal 'tail' (Zaslavsky2006Homo). The tail of GPR4 is sufficient for homodimer formation, although not absolutely required (Zaslavsky2006Homo). The dimerization process is facilitated by disulfide bonds (Zaslavsky2006Homo).

## Function
GPR4 is a proton-sensing G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes by responding to changes in extracellular pH. It is highly expressed in endothelial cells, where it contributes to vascular biology by regulating vessel growth and maintaining blood vessel homeostasis (Glitsch2024Recent; Justus2024The). GPR4 is involved in the regulation of breathing and the body's response to changes in CO2 and pH levels, particularly in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) of the brainstem, where it enhances the chemosensitivity of neurons to acidic pH and CO2 (Imenez2022Physiological).

In the renal system, GPR4 plays a role in acid-base balance by influencing the kidney's response to acidosis. It is involved in processes such as ammoniagenesis and the excretion of ammonium, which are crucial for urinary acidification and systemic acid-base homeostasis (Imenez2022Physiological). GPR4 also affects insulin sensitivity, with its absence leading to increased insulin levels and faster glucose clearance, indicating its role in metabolic regulation (Imenez2022Physiological).

At the molecular level, GPR4 activates several signaling pathways, including the Gs/cAMP pathway, which influences cellular functions in response to extracellular acidosis (Justus2024The). This receptor's activity is essential for maintaining physiological homeostasis across multiple systems.

## Clinical Significance
GPR4 (G protein-coupled receptor 4) is implicated in several diseases due to its role in inflammation and angiogenesis. In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, GPR4 expression is upregulated, correlating with increased inflammation and fibrosis. This upregulation is associated with higher levels of inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IFN-γ, contributing to disease severity and progression to colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) (Marie2023GPR4; Weder2021New). 

In cancer, GPR4 is linked to tumorigenesis and poor prognosis. It promotes angiogenesis through the VEGF pathway, enhancing tumor vascularization and growth in colorectal cancer and other malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma (Marie2023GPR4). GPR4 knockout models show reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis, suggesting its protumorigenic role (Marie2023GPR4).

GPR4 is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, its pro-inflammatory effects exacerbate neuronal damage, with inhibition showing neuroprotective effects (Glitsch2024Recent). In the musculoskeletal system, GPR4 overexpression in osteoarthritis accelerates disease progression by upregulating matrix-degrading enzymes and inflammatory factors (Glitsch2024Recent). These findings highlight GPR4 as a potential therapeutic target in various inflammatory and cancerous conditions.

## Interactions
GPR4, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in signaling pathways. In Cryptococcus neoformans, GPR4 interacts with the Gα protein Gpa1, functioning upstream in the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. This interaction is supported by phenotypic analyses of mutants and epistasis tests, where a dominant active form of Gpa1 can suppress defects in gpr4 mutants, indicating GPR4's upstream role (Xue2006G). Yeast two-hybrid and split-ubiquitin assays have demonstrated a direct interaction between GPR4 and Gpa1, although GPR4 does not interact with other Gα proteins like Gpa2 or Gpa3 (Xue2006G).

GPR4 also forms homodimers, as shown by interactions between its third cytoplasmic loop and C-terminal tail, suggesting it may form oligomeric structures (Xue2006G). In the context of CO2-stimulated breathing, GPR4 interacts with TASK-2, a potassium channel, in the retrotrapezoid nucleus neurons. Mutations in GPR4 affect pH sensitivity and CO2 responsiveness, indicating its role in modulating CO2 sensitivity alongside TASK-2 (Gonye2024Intrinsic). These interactions highlight GPR4's involvement in complex signaling networks and its role in physiological processes.
