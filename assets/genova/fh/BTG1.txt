# BTG1

## Overview
BTG1, or B-cell translocation gene 1, is a gene that encodes the BTG anti-proliferation factor 1 protein, a member of the BTG/Tob family known for its role in regulating cell cycle progression and maintaining cellular quiescence. The BTG1 protein is characterized by a conserved BTG or APRO domain, which facilitates interactions with components of the CCR4-NOT complex, such as the CAF1 deadenylase subunit, and the poly(A) binding protein PABPC1, thereby playing a crucial role in mRNA deadenylation (Amine2021A). Functioning as a transcriptional coactivator, BTG1 interacts with various transcription factors and nuclear receptors, contributing to its tumor suppressor activity by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis (Kim2022Emerging; Winkler2009The). Clinically, alterations in BTG1 expression and mutations are implicated in several cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, highlighting its significance in cancer development and treatment response (Waanders2012The; Almasmoum2020Frequent).

## Structure
The BTG1 protein is a member of the BTG/Tob family, characterized by a conserved BTG or APRO domain at its N-terminus. This domain includes conserved motifs, boxA and boxB, which are essential for interaction with the CAF1 deadenylase subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex (Amine2021A). Additionally, BTG1 contains a boxC motif at the C-terminus of its BTG/APRO domain, an 11 amino-acid sequence (DGSICVLYEAS in BTG1), necessary for interaction with the poly(A) binding protein PABPC1, facilitating mRNA deadenylation (Amine2021A). The APRO domain of BTG1 folds as a unique and independent globular module, maintaining its conformation upon binding to CAF1 (Amine2021A).

The BTG1 protein also features a potential phosphorylation site at Ser158, which may be targeted by the M-phase kinase (Rouault1993Sequence). Despite the high conservation of the BTG1 coding sequence, specific functional domains beyond the APRO domain have not been clearly identified (Rouault1993Sequence). The protein does not appear to have a signal peptide cleavage site, suggesting it is not secreted but may be anchored to a cell membrane via its hydrophobic region (Rouault1993Sequence).

## Function
The BTG1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression and maintaining cellular quiescence. It is highly expressed during the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle and is downregulated as cells progress through G1, inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis in various cell types, including human breast cancer cells and murine fibroblasts (Kim2022Emerging). BTG1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator, interacting with transcription factors such as Homeobox B9 and nuclear receptors through its LxxLL motif, and is involved in mRNA deadenylation by binding to the CCR4-NOT complex, specifically the Ccr4-associated factor 1 (CAF1) (Kim2022Emerging; Winkler2009The).

BTG1 is also involved in maintaining the quiescent state of hematopoietic stem cells and T cells, with its expression being particularly high in naïve and memory T cells (Kim2022Emerging). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with its expression abundant in tissues such as the pancreas, heart, and hematopoietic tissues (Kim2022Emerging). BTG1's role in transcription regulation and mRNA stability contributes to its function as a tumor suppressor, influencing cell growth and proliferation in healthy human cells (Rouault1998Interaction; Prévôt2001Relationships).

## Clinical Significance
BTG1 (BTG anti-proliferation factor 1) is implicated in various cancers due to mutations, deletions, and altered expression levels. In precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), BTG1 deletions occur in approximately 9% of pediatric cases, often in specific subtypes like ETV6-RUNX1-positive cases. These deletions are associated with multiclonal evolution and can reoccur at relapse, indicating their role in disease progression (Waanders2012The). BTG1 deletions are also frequent in acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children with Down syndrome, suggesting a potential link to this specific leukemia type (Lundin2011High).

In non-Hodgkin lymphoma, BTG1 mutations disrupt interactions with the Ccr4-Not complex, impairing its ability to inhibit cell cycle progression and contributing to tumorigenesis (Almasmoum2020Frequent). In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, BTG1 loss leads to glucocorticoid resistance by affecting glucocorticoid receptor expression, which is crucial for apoptosis induction during treatment (van2010BTG1).

In solid tumors, such as lung, breast, and ovarian cancers, lower BTG1 expression is often due to promoter methylation and is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive cancer behavior (Zheng2022The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of BTG1 in cancer development and treatment response.

## Interactions
BTG1, a member of the BTG/Tob family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play a significant role in its antiproliferative function. It interacts with CNOT7 and CNOT8, components of the CCR4-NOT complex, which are involved in mRNA deadenylation and decay. This interaction is mediated by the conserved BTG domain, particularly the Box B motif (Rouault1998Interaction; Almasmoum2020Frequent). BTG1 also binds to the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT1, which is crucial for posttranslational modifications and gene regulation mediated by the retinoic acid receptor (Kim2022Emerging; Winkler2009The).

BTG1 interacts with the transcription factor Hoxb9, enhancing its DNA binding and transcriptional activation (Winkler2009The). It also associates with nuclear receptors such as the androgen receptor, estrogen receptor alpha, and T3 receptor through the LxxLL motif (Kim2022Emerging). The interaction with the cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein PABPC1 is mediated by the Box C motif, which is necessary for stimulating mRNA deadenylation (Amine2021A).

Mutations in BTG1 can impair its interactions with CNOT7 and CNOT8, potentially affecting its role in cell cycle regulation and contributing to malignant transformation (Almasmoum2020Frequent).
