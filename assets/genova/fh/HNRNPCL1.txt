# HNRNPCL1

## Overview
HNRNPCL1 is a gene that encodes the protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C like 1, a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family. This family of proteins is primarily involved in RNA processing, including mRNA splicing, stability, and transport. The HNRNPCL1 protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus and plays a critical role in the spliceosome complex, which is essential for mRNA processing (Blalock2014Identification). It is also associated with the active PKR complex, indicating its involvement in cellular stress responses and RNA metabolism (Blalock2014Identification). The hnRNP family, including HNRNPCL1, is characterized by RNA-binding domains that facilitate specific RNA-protein interactions, crucial for their function in RNA-related processes (Piazzi2023Alternative). While the specific functions of HNRNPCL1 in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, its role in fundamental RNA processing activities suggests its importance in gene expression regulation.

## Function
HNRNPCL1 is a protein-coding gene that encodes a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, which is involved in various aspects of RNA processing. This protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it plays a role in mRNA processing, particularly in RNA splicing as part of the spliceosome complex (Blalock2014Identification). HNRNPCL1 is associated with the active PKR complex, suggesting its involvement in mRNA processing in the context of active PKR complexes (Blalock2014Identification).

The hnRNP family, to which HNRNPCL1 belongs, is known for its roles in the maturation of pre-mRNA transcripts to mature mRNAs, influencing alternative splicing, mRNA stability, transport, and folding (Piazzi2023Alternative). These proteins contain RNA-binding domains that determine RNA-protein binding specificity, which is crucial for their function in splicing and other RNA-related processes (Piazzi2023Alternative). Although specific details about the function of HNRNPCL1 in healthy human cells are limited, its involvement in these fundamental processes suggests a significant role in the regulation of gene expression and RNA metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
HNRNPCL1 has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In the context of endometrial cancer, particularly sporadic and Lynch syndrome-related cases, HNRNPCL1 has been identified as a potential biomarker. The gene exhibits high-frequency mutation sites, suggesting a significant role in the occurrence and development of this cancer type (&lt; em&gt; p&gt; Gao2020&lt; HNRNPCL1&lt; /em&gt). 

In Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, HNRNPCL1 has been identified as a candidate gene with damaging variants. These variants were found in multiple cases, indicating a possible role in the syndrome's pathology, although the specific clinical significance remains to be fully elucidated (Chen2015Concurrent).

HNRNPCL1 is also associated with cancer prognosis, particularly in kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), where high expression levels correlate with poorer survival outcomes. This suggests that alterations in HNRNPCL1 expression may influence cancer progression and patient prognosis (Ye2022Comprehensive). 

Overall, while the precise mechanisms and clinical implications of HNRNPCL1 mutations and expression changes are not fully understood, these findings highlight its potential significance in various diseases, warranting further research.

## Interactions
HNRNPCL1, a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family, is involved in various protein interactions, particularly within the context of RNA processing. It has been identified as a component of the core spliceosome complex associated with the active PKR complex, indicating its role in mRNA processing (Blalock2014Identification). HNRNPCL1 is also known to interact with PKR, a protein kinase involved in cellular stress responses, in both its active and inactive forms (Blalock2014Identification).

In the study by Tenzer et al., HNRNPCL1 was identified as one of the proteins interacting with the RNA-binding protein RALY, although specific details on the nature of these interactions were not provided (Tenzer2013ProteomeWide). The interactions of hnRNPs, including HNRNPCL1, are often mediated by their RNA-binding domains, which allow them to engage in complex networks of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of RNA splicing, stability, and translation, highlighting the functional significance of HNRNPCL1 in cellular processes related to RNA metabolism (Tilliole2024hnRNPs:).
