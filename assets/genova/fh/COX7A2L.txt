# COX7A2L

## Overview
The COX7A2L gene encodes the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7A2-like protein, which is integral to the mitochondrial respiratory chain's function. This protein is categorized as a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes, specifically facilitating the assembly and organization of these complexes. COX7A2L is particularly involved in the interaction between complex III dimer (CIII2) and complex IV (CIV), playing a crucial role in the formation of supercomplexes such as SC III2+IV. Its activity is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it contributes to the structural organization of the respiratory chain, enhancing mitochondrial respiration and cardiorespiratory fitness, especially in skeletal muscle. The gene's expression is modulated by exercise and stress, and genetic variations in COX7A2L are linked to metabolic phenotypes, including increased energy expenditure and reduced body fat (Benegiamo2022COX7A2L; LoboJarne2018Human).

## Function
The human gene COX7A2L encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly and organization of mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes (SCs), particularly involving complex III (CIII2) and complex IV (CIV) (LoboJarne2018Human). COX7A2L is essential for the formation of SC III2+IV, facilitating the stable interaction between these complexes, which is important for efficient electron transport and energy production in mitochondria (Benegiamo2022COX7A2L; LoboJarne2018Human). This protein acts as a regulatory checkpoint, modulating the levels of complex III2 to ensure proper assembly and stability of these supercomplexes (LoboJarne2018Human).

COX7A2L is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it contributes to the structural organization of the mitochondrial respiratory chain without significantly affecting mitochondrial bioenergetics under normal conditions (LoboJarne2018Human). Its role in supercomplex formation is linked to enhanced mitochondrial respiration and cardiorespiratory fitness, particularly in skeletal muscle, where its expression is induced by exercise and stress conditions (Benegiamo2022COX7A2L). Genetic variations affecting COX7A2L expression are associated with improved metabolic phenotypes, such as increased energy expenditure and reduced body fat (Benegiamo2022COX7A2L).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the COX7A2L gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in relation to metabolic and cardiorespiratory health. Variants in COX7A2L, such as a 10-bp insertion in the 3′ untranslated region, enhance mRNA stability and expression in skeletal muscle, leading to improved mitochondrial supercomplex formation and respiration. This is associated with better cardiorespiratory fitness and reduced body fat in humans, suggesting potential therapeutic implications for reducing cardiovascular mortality (Benegiamo2022COX7A2L).

In mice, genetic variations in COX7A2L affect the formation of mitochondrial supercomplexes, which are crucial for efficient electron transport and energy production. A specific mutation in the C57BL/6J mouse strain results in a truncated and unstable COX7A2L protein, impairing its interaction with complex IV and affecting cardiorespiratory fitness. This mutation contrasts with the stable form found in other strains, which supports higher energy expenditure and improved fitness (Benegiamo2022COX7A2L; Davoudi2016COX7A2LSCAFI).

The gene's expression is also induced under stress conditions, playing a role in muscle physiology and exercise adaptation, which may have implications for metabolic risk prediction and exercise performance (Benegiamo2022COX7A2L).

## Interactions
The COX7A2L protein, also known as SCAF1, plays a crucial role in the assembly and organization of mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes (SCs). It is particularly involved in the interaction between complex III dimer (CIII2) and complex IV (CIV), facilitating the formation of SC III2+IV. COX7A2L interacts with CIII2 and CIV through independent domains, which is essential for the assembly of these supercomplexes (LoboJarne2018Human). The protein is also implicated in the formation of larger supercomplexes, such as the MegaC (I2+III2+IV2), although it is not necessary for the basic respirasomes (SCs I+III2 and I+III2+IV1) (LoboJarne2018Human).

In human cells, COX7A2L binds to pre-CIII2 before the incorporation of the catalytic RISP subunit, indicating its role in the early stages of CIII2 assembly. The binding of COX7A2L to CIV requires the correct orientation of a histidine residue at position 73, highlighting the specificity of its interactions (LoboJarne2018Human). The absence of COX7A2L affects the assembly efficiency of these structures, leading to an accumulation of CIII2 and impacting the formation of larger respirasomes (LoboJarne2018Human). These interactions are crucial for the specific assembly pathways of different SCs, with COX7A2L being necessary for the assembly of SC III2+IV and MegaCs (LoboJarne2018Human).
