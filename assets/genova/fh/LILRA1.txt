# LILRA1

## Overview
LILRA1 is a gene located on chromosome 19q13.4, encoding the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor A1, a type of activating receptor involved in immune response modulation. This receptor is part of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LILR) family, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of immune responses. LILRA1 is primarily expressed on monocytes and macrophages, but not on neutrophils, and it interacts with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, specifically recognizing open conformers of MHC-I that lack β2-microglobulin (β2m) (Lewis2020Leukocyte; Hudson2016Leukocyte). The receptor's ability to bind to HLA-C free heavy chains and HLA-B27, albeit with lower affinity compared to other LILRs, suggests its involvement in immune regulation and potential implications in disease associations, particularly in the context of viral infections (Hirayasu2015Functional; brown2004lilr). Despite its significant role in immune modulation, the precise molecular mechanisms and functional significance of LILRA1 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (brown2004lilr).

## Function
LILRA1, also known as CD86i or LIR6, is a member of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LILR) family, which plays a role in modulating immune responses. It is primarily expressed on monocytes and macrophages, but not on neutrophils, as indicated by the lack of binding of anti-LILRA1 monoclonal antibodies to neutrophils (Lewis2020Leukocyte). LILRA1 is an activating receptor that binds to HLA-C free heavy chains and HLA-B27, although with lower affinity compared to other LILRs like LILRB1 and LILRB2 (Hirayasu2015Functional; brown2004lilr). The specific molecular processes and functional significance of these interactions in healthy human cells remain unclear, but LILRA1 is thought to be involved in immune response modulation (Lewis2020Leukocyte).

LILRA1 is encoded within the leukocyte receptor complex on chromosome 19q13.4 and is part of a rapidly evolving gene family, which complicates functional analysis using animal models (Hirayasu2015Functional; brown2004lilr). While the precise role of LILRA1 in healthy human cells is not fully understood, it is implicated in immune regulation and may contribute to the body's defense mechanisms against pathogens (brown2004lilr).

## Interactions
LILRA1, a member of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor family, is involved in immune response regulation through its interactions with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. It is part of Group 1 LILRs, which can engage MHC-I, specifically recognizing open conformers of MHC-I that lack β2-microglobulin (β2m). This interaction suggests that alternatively folded forms of MHC-I may play a functional role in the immune response (Hudson2016Leukocyte).

LILRA1 has been shown to bind to HLA-C free heavy chains, although with lower affinities compared to other LILRs such as LILRB1 and LILRB2. This binding preference indicates a potential mechanism for MHC-I disease associations, particularly in the context of viral infections like HIV, where HLA-C variants have been linked to different infection outcomes (Hudson2016Leukocyte).

Despite its interactions with MHC-I, LILRA1 is not expressed on neutrophils, as evidenced by the lack of binding of anti-LILRA1 monoclonal antibodies to these cells and the absence of LILRA1-specific peptides in proteomic studies of neutrophil-derived samples (Lewis2020Leukocyte). This suggests that LILRA1 does not play a significant role in neutrophil-mediated immune responses.
