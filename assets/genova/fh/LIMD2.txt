# LIMD2

## Overview
LIMD2 is a gene that encodes the LIM domain containing 2 protein, which is characterized by the presence of LIM domains—zinc-binding motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. The LIMD2 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including gene transcription and cytoskeleton organization, due to its structural features that allow it to interact with multiple partners (Araldi2020LIMD2). It is associated with the EPLIN class of proteins and plays a significant role in pathways such as the MAPK signaling pathway, which is critical in cancer progression (Koch2012The). LIMD2 has been implicated in the progression and metastasis of several cancers, making it a potential therapeutic target (Zhang2019Overexpression; Wang2018LIMD2).

## Structure
LIMD2 is a protein characterized by the presence of LIM domains, which are zinc-binding motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. The protein contains two adjacent cysteine-histidine-rich zinc fingers separated by a hydrophobic linker, which serves as a protein-binding interface. This structural feature allows LIMD2 to interact with various partners, influencing cellular processes such as gene transcription and cytoskeleton organization (Araldi2020LIMD2). The LIM domain is crucial for the protein's function, as demonstrated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, which introduced a 1 bp deletion at residue 43, a cysteine that binds to a zinc ion within the first zinc-finger domain. This mutation likely alters the folding of the LIM domain, leading to a loss of function (Araldi2020LIMD2).

LIMD2 is associated with the EPLIN class of proteins, which includes a conserved 22-amino acid motif known as the Eplin Motif adjacent to the LIM domain. This motif-domain combination is present in human proteins such as Lima1, Xirp2, and LIMD2, indicating an ancient evolutionary origin (Koch2012The). The protein's structure and function are further influenced by its involvement in pathways such as the MAPK signaling pathway, which is critical in cancer progression (Araldi2020LIMD2).

## Clinical Significance
LIMD2 (LIM domain containing 2) is implicated in the progression and metastasis of several cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), LIMD2 is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to the malignant progression of NSCLC. Knockdown of LIMD2 in NSCLC cell lines results in reduced proliferation and invasion, indicating its role in cancer progression (Zhang2019Overexpression; Wang2018LIMD2). LIMD2 is also regulated by microRNAs such as miR-34a and miR-124, which act as tumor suppressors by targeting LIMD2, leading to decreased expression and reduced cancer cell aggressiveness (Zhang2019Overexpression; Wang2018LIMD2).

In papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), LIMD2 is overexpressed and correlates with the metastatic process. Its knockout in PTC cell lines reduces cell migration and invasion, suggesting its involvement in early metastasis steps (Araldi2020LIMD2). LIMD2 also plays a role in esophageal cancer (ECA), where it is identified as a prognostic marker. Its expression is linked to immune system processes and autophagy, and it is associated with poor survival outcomes in ECA patients (Chen2021LIMD2). These findings highlight LIMD2 as a potential therapeutic target in various cancers due to its role in promoting tumor progression and metastasis.

## Interactions
LIMD2 is known to interact with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In human embryonic stem cells, LIMD2 has been identified as a protein interacting with the endogenous L1 ORF1p, a component of the Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1) retrotransposon complex. This interaction suggests a role for LIMD2 in the regulation of retrotransposon activity, potentially influencing genomic stability and cellular differentiation (Vuong2019Proteome).

In the context of esophageal cancer, LIMD2 is associated with immune cell infiltration and autophagy-related pathways. It shows a positive correlation with memory activated CD4 T cells and is linked to autophagy-related genes such as BCL-2 and CCL2. These associations indicate that LIMD2 may participate in complex networks involving immune response and cellular survival mechanisms, although direct protein-protein interactions in this context are not explicitly detailed (Chen2021LIMD2).

In pigs, LIMD2 has been highlighted in studies related to feed efficiency, where it is associated with mitochondrial genes and fat metabolism. This suggests potential interactions within metabolic pathways, although specific protein partners are not identified (Carmelo2020Genome).
