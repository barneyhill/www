# SFTPC

## Overview
The SFTPC gene encodes surfactant protein C (SP-C), a small, hydrophobic protein that plays a pivotal role in the pulmonary surfactant system, essential for normal respiratory function. SP-C is primarily synthesized in alveolar epithelial type II cells and is crucial for reducing surface tension in the alveoli, thereby preventing their collapse during expiration (Sehlmeyer2020Alveolar). The protein is characterized by a highly α-helical structure, which facilitates its integration into phospholipid membranes and its function in lipid transfer and membrane dynamics (Mulugeta2006Surfactant; Beers2005SURFACTANT). SP-C's ability to form dimers in the membrane environment further enhances its role in maintaining surfactant membrane curvature and function (Korolainen2022Dimerization). Mutations in the SFTPC gene are linked to various interstitial lung diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in pulmonary health (Guillot2009New).

## Structure
The SFTPC gene encodes surfactant protein C (SP-C), a hydrophobic protein crucial for lung function. The primary structure of SP-C is a 197-amino acid proprotein that undergoes post-translational processing to form a mature 35-amino acid peptide (Beers2005SURFACTANT). The secondary structure of SP-C is characterized by a highly α-helical domain, particularly a 23-amino acid polyvaline stretch that spans phospholipid bilayers (Beers2005SURFACTANT). This α-helical structure is essential for its function in disrupting lipid packing in phospholipid membranes (Mulugeta2006Surfactant).

The tertiary structure of SP-C involves a compact, helical conformation, with the mature peptide being highly hydrophobic due to thioester-linked palmitoyl chains attached to N-terminal cysteine residues (Mulugeta2006Surfactant). These modifications enhance the interaction with phospholipid head groups, crucial for its role in the pulmonary surfactant system (Beers2005SURFACTANT).

SP-C does not prominently exhibit quaternary structure, but it can form dimers in the membrane environment. The dimerization involves specific motifs and contributes to its function in the pulmonary surfactant (Korolainen2022Dimerization). The BRICHOS domain of the proSP-C protein, which is part of the C-terminal region, plays a role in preventing amyloid formation and is crucial for the proper folding and function of SP-C (Willander2012Highresolution).

## Function
Surfactant protein C (SP-C), encoded by the SFTPC gene, is a small, hydrophobic protein that plays a critical role in pulmonary surfactant function, essential for maintaining lung homeostasis and efficient respiratory mechanics. SP-C is primarily associated with alveolar epithelial type II cells, where it contributes to the reduction of surface tension in the alveoli, preventing their collapse during expiration (Sehlmeyer2020Alveolar).

SP-C facilitates the transfer of lipids between membrane structures and enhances the adsorption of surface-active molecules at the air-liquid interface, which is crucial for sustaining the multilayered structure of the surfactant (Korolainen2022Dimerization). It also plays a role in altering lipid packing, influencing lipid motion and distribution, and increasing membrane permeability, which aids in the capture and re-spreading of surfactant material during breathing cycles (Sehlmeyer2020Alveolar).

SP-C is involved in cholesterol regulation within lung surfactant, affecting membrane structure and dynamics, and potentially modulating cholesterol mobilization (Sehlmeyer2020Alveolar). Its dimerization in pulmonary surfactant membranes is thought to be important for its function, contributing to the curvature of surfactant membranes and aiding in the removal of less surface-active lipids (Korolainen2022Dimerization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SFTPC gene, which encodes surfactant protein C, are associated with a range of lung diseases, particularly interstitial lung diseases (ILD) such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and familial pulmonary fibrosis. These mutations can lead to protein misfolding, resulting in cellular stress and lung tissue damage. The most common mutation, p.Ile73Thr (I73T), has been linked to both neonatal respiratory distress and chronic lung disease in children and adults (Guillot2009New; Nureki2018Expression). 

In children, SFTPC mutations are a frequent cause of diffuse lung disease, with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) often revealing ground-glass opacities and lung cysts, indicative of SFTPC-associated disorders (Mechri2010Surfactant). Histological analyses show macrophage accumulation and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, correlating with these HRCT findings (Mechri2010Surfactant).

In murine models, the expression of mutant SFTPC, such as the SftpcI73T allele, has been shown to drive spontaneous lung fibrosis, mimicking human IPF. This is due to disruptions in alveolar type II (AT2) cell homeostasis, leading to proinflammatory and profibrotic events (Nureki2018Expression). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SFTPC mutations in the pathogenesis of diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (Nureki2018Expression).

## Interactions
Surfactant protein C (SP-C), encoded by the SFTPC gene, participates in several interactions critical for its function in the lung. SP-C interacts with CD14 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), playing a role in the immune response. It specifically binds to the lipid A region of LPS and facilitates the binding of LPS to cells expressing CD14, similar to the function of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) (Augusto2003Interaction). This interaction is enhanced by SP-C, which alters the conformation of CD14 or the accessibility of its LPS-binding site, enabling it to bind LPS more effectively (Augusto2003Interaction). SP-C also directly binds to CD14, and this interaction is inhibited by LPS, suggesting a common binding site on SP-C for both CD14 and LPS (Augusto2003Interaction).

SP-C's interactions extend to its role in surfactant membrane dynamics. It can form dimers in a membrane environment, with the parallel dimer being the most stable configuration. This dimerization involves specific residues and may influence surfactant membrane curvature and alveolar homeostasis (Korolainen2022Dimerization). These interactions highlight SP-C's multifaceted role in both surfactant function and immune modulation in the lung.
