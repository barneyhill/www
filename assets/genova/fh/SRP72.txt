# SRP72

## Overview
The SRP72 gene encodes the signal recognition particle 72 (SRP72) protein, a critical component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex, which is essential for the co-translational targeting of secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotic cells. As a part of the SRP complex, SRP72 plays a pivotal role in recognizing and binding signal peptides, facilitating the proper translocation of nascent polypeptides to the ER for further processing. The SRP72 protein is characterized by its RNA-binding domain and protein-binding domain, which include tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) that are crucial for its interaction with SRP68, forming a stable heterodimer necessary for SRP function. Beyond its canonical role in protein targeting, SRP72 is involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin dynamics, indicating its broader role in gene expression regulation. Mutations in the SRP72 gene have been associated with hematological disorders, auditory abnormalities, and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Rafei2019Hereditary; Faoro2021Noncanonical; Iakhiaeva2009Characterization).

## Structure
The SRP72 protein is a component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex and plays a crucial role in its function. The primary structure of SRP72 includes a lysine-rich cluster and a conserved protein family motif known as the SRP72 Pfam, which is essential for binding to the SRP RNA (Wild2019Structure). The RNA-binding domain (RBD) of SRP72 spans residues 532 to 590 and is characterized by two crossed alpha-helices separated by a loop, which is crucial for maintaining the minimal RNA binding domain (Iakhiaeva2010Identification). This domain interacts with the 5e and 5f loops of the SRP RNA, stabilizing the RNA structure (Wild2019Structure).

The protein-binding domain (PBD) of SRP72 consists of nine antiparallel α-helices arranged in a closed α-solenoid structure, including four tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) that bind to the SRP68 protein-binding domain (Faoro2021Noncanonical). These TPR motifs are crucial for the interaction with SRP68, forming a stable heterodimer necessary for SRP function (Iakhiaeva2009Characterization). The SRP72 protein also contains a positively charged C-terminal helix that interacts with the ribosome (Wild2019Structure). The tertiary structure of SRP72 is characterized by these α-helices and TPR motifs, which contribute to its role in the SRP complex.

## Function
The SRP72 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the signal recognition particle (SRP), a ribonucleoprotein complex essential for the co-translational targeting of secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotic cells. SRP72, along with SRP68, forms a stable heterodimer that is crucial for the SRP's function in recognizing and binding signal peptides, which direct nascent polypeptides to the ER for further processing (Faoro2021Noncanonical; Iakhiaeva2009Characterization).

SRP72 binds to the SRP RNA, particularly affecting helices 5 and 8, which are important for the binding of the SRP54 protein. This interaction is vital for the SRP's role in guiding proteins to their membrane translocation sites, delaying translation, and facilitating the entry of secretory proteins into the ER (Iakhiaeva2008The; Iakhiaeva2010Identification). The SRP72 protein contains tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) necessary for binding with SRP68, ensuring the structural integrity and function of the SRP complex (Iakhiaeva2009Characterization).

Beyond its canonical role in protein targeting, SRP72 is also involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin dynamics, interacting with histone H4 in a methylation-sensitive manner, which suggests a broader role in gene expression regulation (Faoro2021Noncanonical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SRP72 gene are associated with several hematological disorders, including aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), which are forms of bone marrow failure. These conditions are linked to an increased risk of hematologic malignancy. Specific mutations, such as a missense mutation in exon 6 (R207H) and a deletion in the RNA-binding domain (T355deletion), have been identified in families with these disorders. These mutations lead to incorrect localization of the SRP72 protein within the cell and impair its ability to assemble onto the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex, affecting protein translocation (Rafei2019Hereditary; Faoro2021Noncanonical).

SRP72 mutations have also been linked to auditory abnormalities, such as labyrinthitis and deafness, in affected families. The age of onset for cytopenias and MDS in individuals with SRP72 mutations ranges from 11 to 76 years (Rafei2019Hereditary). In mouse models, heterozygous loss of SRP72 results in mild hematological phenotypes, suggesting that while SRP72 mutations are linked to aplasia and myelodysplasia in humans, the exact molecular mechanisms remain unclear (D’Altri2019Heterozygous).

SRP72 is also implicated in cancer, particularly thyroid and prostate cancers, where it is overexpressed and hypomethylated, suggesting an oncogenic role (Faoro2021Noncanonical).

## Interactions
SRP72 is a component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex, which plays a crucial role in targeting proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. SRP72 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, forming part of the SRP68/72 heterodimer. This heterodimer is essential for the structural integrity of the SRP complex, with SRP72 containing tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs that facilitate its interaction with SRP68 (Wild2019Structure; Iakhiaeva2009Characterization).

SRP72 also binds to SRP RNA, specifically interacting with the 5e motif, a conserved region crucial for SRP function. This interaction is mediated by specific amino acid residues within SRP72, including a lysine-rich region and a unique Pfam motif, which are essential for RNA binding (Iakhiaeva2010Identification; Iakhiaeva2008The). The binding of SRP72 to SRP RNA is critical for the assembly and function of the SRP complex (Iakhiaeva2008The).

In addition to its role in the SRP complex, SRP72 is involved in noncanonical functions, such as apoptosis regulation and transcriptional regulation, through interactions with caspases and histone H4, respectively (Faoro2021Noncanonical). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of SRP72 in cellular processes.
