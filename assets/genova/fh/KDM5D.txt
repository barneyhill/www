# KDM5D

## Overview
KDM5D is a gene located on the Y chromosome that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 5D, a member of the lysine-specific demethylase family. This protein plays a pivotal role in epigenetic regulation by demethylating di- and tri-methyl groups on lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4), a modification typically associated with active transcription. As a transcriptional repressor, KDM5D is involved in maintaining proper transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, which are crucial for cellular differentiation and genomic stability (Mizukami2018KDM5Dmediated; Jangravi2015Two). The protein contains several functional domains, including JmjN, ARID, and PHD motifs, which contribute to its role in chromatin-mediated gene regulation (Jangravi2015Two). KDM5D's activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it influences cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis, and interacts with various protein complexes to modulate gene expression and chromatin structure (Pavlenko2022Functions; Jangravi2015Two). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in cancer biology, particularly in prostate and colorectal cancers, where it can act as a tumor suppressor or be involved in tumor progression, respectively (Li2016JARID1D; Li2023Histone).

## Structure
The KDM5D protein, encoded by the KDM5D gene on the Y chromosome, is a lysine-specific demethylase involved in epigenetic regulation. It contains several functional domains, including the JmjN, ARID, and PHD motifs, which are shared between its canonical and alternate isoforms. The JmjC domain, crucial for its demethylase activity, is partially absent in the novel isoforms, which also lack the PLU-1 domain. The ARID domain is associated with cell growth, differentiation, and development, while the PHD motif is linked to chromatin-mediated gene regulation (Jangravi2015Two).

KDM5D has two splice variants, KDM5D-a and KDM5D-b, identified in the DU-145 prostate cancer cell line. KDM5D-a lacks exons 12 and 21-28, and KDM5D-b lacks exon 14. A new 100bp exon is present in KDM5D-a (Jangravi2015Two). These structural differences suggest distinct functional roles for the isoforms, potentially influencing cell growth regulation and apoptosis (Jangravi2015Two).

The protein's localization to the nucleolus is facilitated by a nucleolar localization signal, and it plays a role in regulating rRNA gene transcription, impacting cell proliferation and growth (Jangravi2015Two).

## Function
KDM5D, a lysine-specific demethylase located on the Y chromosome, plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression through its histone demethylation activity. It specifically demethylates di- and tri-methyl groups on lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4), a modification associated with active transcription, thereby acting as a transcriptional repressor (Jangravi2015Two). This demethylation process is essential for maintaining proper transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, influencing gene expression patterns and cellular differentiation (Mizukami2018KDM5Dmediated).

In healthy human cells, KDM5D is involved in regulating cell cycle progression and maintaining genomic stability. It modulates the expression of genes related to cell cycling and DNA replication, preventing DNA-replication stress and continuous DNA damage (Komura2018ATR). KDM5D also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) in the nucleus, influencing the expression of androgen-regulated genes by modulating H3K4 methylation marks, which are associated with active transcription (Komura2016Resistance).

KDM5D's activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of transcriptional activity and chromatin structure, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis (Jangravi2015Two).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KDM5D gene, also known as JARID1D, have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In prostate cancer, KDM5D acts as a tumor suppressor by repressing gene expression programs associated with cell invasiveness. Its expression is notably lower in metastatic prostate tumors compared to primary tumors and normal tissues, often due to deletions on the Y chromosome where the gene is located. This downregulation is linked to increased expression of invasion-associated genes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and Slug, which enhance cancer cell invasiveness and are associated with poor prognosis and survival outcomes in prostate cancer patients (Li2016JARID1D).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), KDM5D expression is upregulated in male patients, particularly those with KRAS mutations. This upregulation is associated with increased tumor invasiveness and metastasis, contributing to worse survival outcomes. KDM5D influences CRC progression by repressing genes involved in cell adhesion and immune recognition, promoting metastasis and aiding immune evasion. The gene's interaction with the Sin3-HDAC complex and its role in epigenetic regulation further highlight its impact on cancer progression, suggesting potential targets for therapeutic intervention (Li2023Histone).

## Interactions
KDM5D, a histone demethylase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in chromatin regulation and gene expression. One notable interaction is with the Polycomb group RING finger protein 6 (PCGF6), a component of non-canonical PRC1 complexes. This interaction enhances the demethylase activity of KDM5D, highlighting its role in chromatin modification (Pavlenko2022Functions).

KDM5D also interacts with the Sin3-HDAC complex, which includes histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2. This interaction is crucial for KDM5D's role in immune evasion in colon cancer, as it helps downregulate H3K27ac, a histone mark associated with active enhancers, thereby affecting antigen presentation and immune response (Li2023Histone).

In the context of colorectal cancer, KDM5D is upregulated by KRAS* through STAT4 activation, leading to the repression of genes involved in cell adhesion and immune recognition. This repression is mediated through interactions with chromatin-modifying complexes, affecting cancer cell adhesion properties and tumor immunity (Li2023Histone).

These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of KDM5D in epigenetic regulation and its implications in cancer biology, particularly in sex-specific differences in colorectal cancer outcomes (Li2023Histone).
