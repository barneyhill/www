# CCNL2

## Overview
The CCNL2 gene encodes the protein cyclin L2, a member of the cyclin family, which is primarily involved in the regulation of transcription and pre-mRNA splicing. Cyclin L2 is characterized by its cyclin box domain and a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain, which are indicative of its role in RNA processing. This nuclear protein interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases, particularly CDK11, forming complexes that enhance splicing activity and localize to nuclear speckles associated with RNA transcription and processing. Cyclin L2 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Its expression and function have been implicated in several cancers, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and a promoter, depending on the context (Loyer2020Roles; Li2022Integrated; de2004Characterization).

## Structure
Cyclin L2, encoded by the CCNL2 gene, is a member of the cyclin family characterized by a cyclin box domain (CBD) and a C-terminal RS domain. The CBD is a conserved domain that shares over 90% similarity with Cyclin L1, but shows much lower conservation with other cyclins, such as Cyclins Q, T, and Y, which have approximately 35% similarity (Loyer2020Roles). Cyclin L2 lacks the phenylalanine found in most cyclins, which is replaced by histidine at position 129 (Loyer2020Roles).

Cyclin L2 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms, including a long isoform with an apparent electrophoretic mobility of approximately 65 kDa and a shorter isoform at approximately 25 kDa (Loyer2020Roles). The RS domain, similar to those found in SR splicing factors, suggests a role in pre-mRNA processing (Loyer2020Roles). Cyclin L2 interacts with CDK11 isoforms, including CDK11 p110, p58, and p46, indicating its involvement in transcription and pre-mRNA splicing regulation (Loyer2020Roles). Cyclin L2 is phosphorylated by DYRK1A, which modulates its levels and influences HIV replication (Loyer2020Roles).

## Function
Cyclin L2 (CCNL2) is a nuclear protein involved in the regulation of transcription and pre-mRNA splicing in healthy human cells. It is characterized by an N-terminal cyclin domain and a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain, which is typical of proteins involved in RNA processing (de2004Characterization). Cyclin L2 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases, particularly CDK11 p110, forming complexes that enhance splicing activity. This interaction is crucial for modulating splicing, as demonstrated by increased intron splicing activity when cyclin L2 is co-expressed with CDK11 p110 (Loyer2020Roles; Loyer2008Characterization).

Cyclin L2 localizes to nuclear speckles, subnuclear structures associated with RNA transcription and processing, where it co-localizes with splicing factors such as SC35 and SF2/ASF (Yang2004Cyclin; de2004Characterization). It is involved in alternative splicing, influencing the expression of different splice variants, which can impact gene expression and cellular function (Loyer2008Characterization). Cyclin L2's interaction with the protein kinase DYRK1A suggests a role in phosphorylation processes, potentially regulating splicing through phosphorylation (de2004Characterization). Overall, cyclin L2 plays a significant role in RNA processing, contributing to the regulation of gene expression in human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCNL2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In prostate cancer (PCa), high CCNL2 expression is associated with poor prognosis, increased tumor cell migration, and proliferation. It is also linked to immune infiltration, particularly with CD8+ T cells, and may influence patient response to androgen deprivation therapy and immunotherapy (Li2022Integrated). The CCNL2 gene is part of a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network involving AC005154.6 and hsa-miR-29c-3p, which is considered a prognostic biomarker for PCa. This network suggests that AC005154.6 may upregulate CCNL2 by sponging hsa-miR-29c-3p, contributing to cancer progression (Li2022Integrated).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, overexpression of CCNL2 suppresses cell growth and induces apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. This effect is mediated through the upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as p53 and Bax, and the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (Yang2004Cyclin). Similarly, in lung cancer, CCNL2 overexpression leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, indicating its role in inhibiting tumor growth (LI2007Overexpression). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in cancer-related processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
Cyclin L2 (CCNL2) is involved in several interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It is known to interact with CDK11 (cyclin-dependent kinase 11), forming a complex that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation and RNA splicing. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of pre-mRNA processing, highlighting CCNL2's involvement in the splicing machinery (Chen2021CLK1SRSF5).

In the context of pancreatic cancer, the CLK1-SRSF5 pathway regulates the alternative splicing of CCNL2, particularly influencing exon skipping events. SRSF5, when phosphorylated by CLK1, binds to specific exons of CCNL2 pre-mRNA, such as exon 6.2, to control its splicing pattern. This interaction is essential for the regulation of cell proliferation and metastasis in pancreatic cancer cells (Chen2021CLK1SRSF5).

The study of CCNL2 in prostate cancer has also revealed its involvement in a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, where it interacts with hsa-miR-29c-3p and AC005154.6. This axis is associated with immune infiltration and cancer progression, although specific physical interactions with proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Li2022Integrated).
