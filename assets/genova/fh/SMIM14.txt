# SMIM14

## Overview
SMIM14, or small integral membrane protein 14, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, which suggests its involvement in cellular processes that occur across the cell membrane. While the specific functions of SMIM14 are not fully elucidated, transmembrane proteins typically play critical roles in signaling, transport, and maintaining cellular structure. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their roles in cellular physiology and potential implications in human health and disease.
