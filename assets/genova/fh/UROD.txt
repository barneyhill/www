# UROD

## Overview
The UROD gene encodes the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, which is a crucial component of the heme biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a decarboxylase and is responsible for the conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III by catalyzing the removal of carboxyl groups. Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase is a cytosolic enzyme that functions as a dimer and is characterized by a distorted (β/α)8-barrel structure. It is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and plays a vital role in preventing the accumulation of porphyrinogens and porphyrins, which can lead to porphyrias if enzyme activity is deficient (Elder1995Uroporphyrinogen; Whitby1998Crystal). Mutations in the UROD gene are linked to disorders such as porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria, highlighting its clinical significance (Armstrong2004Hepatoerythropoietic; Poblete‐Gutiérrez2004The).

## Structure
The human uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) enzyme is a 40.8 kDa protein that plays a crucial role in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain of 355 residues (Whitby1998Crystal). The secondary structure of UROD is characterized by a distorted (β/α)8-barrel, a common fold in many enzymes, which includes eight parallel β-strands forming a circular β-barrel surrounded by eight α-helices (Fan2007Crystal; Whitby1998Crystal). 

The tertiary structure reveals a single domain with a deep cleft at the C-terminal end of the β-barrel, which serves as the active site. This cleft is lined with conserved residues such as Arg37, Arg41, and His339, which are likely involved in substrate binding, and Asp86, Tyr164, and Ser219, which may play roles in catalysis (Whitby1998Crystal). 

UROD functions as a dimer in solution, with dimerization observed in its crystal structure. This quaternary structure involves a large hydrophilic interface, suggesting a functional interaction between the catalytic centers of the two monomers (Whitby1998Crystal). The enzyme does not require cofactors or prosthetic groups for its activity (Whitby1998Crystal).

## Function
Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a critical role in the heme biosynthesis pathway. It catalyzes the decarboxylation of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III by removing four carboxyl groups from the acetic acid substituents on the uroporphyrinogen molecule. This reaction results in the formation of hepta-, hexa-, and pentacarboxylic porphyrinogens as intermediates, ultimately producing coproporphyrinogen III (Elder1995Uroporphyrinogen; de1983Purification). UROD is a monomeric enzyme with a molecular mass of approximately 42 kDa and is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with increased activity during erythroid differentiation (Elder1995Uroporphyrinogen).

The enzyme's activity is essential for preventing the accumulation of porphyrinogens and porphyrins, which can lead to porphyrias if UROD activity is deficient (Elder1995Uroporphyrinogen). UROD does not require a coenzyme or metal ions for its activity, but it is inhibited by sulfhydryl group reagents and heavy metals (Elder1995Uroporphyrinogen). The enzyme's structure is highly conserved across species, with specific amino acid residues, such as histidine and arginine, being crucial for its function (Elder1995Uroporphyrinogen). UROD activity is vital for the proper production of heme, an essential component of hemoglobin and other heme-containing proteins, thereby playing a significant role in red blood cell production and overall cellular respiration (Elder1989Genetics).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UROD gene are associated with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), a condition characterized by skin sensitivity to sunlight and liver dysfunction. PCT can be classified into sporadic (type I) and familial (type II) forms, with the latter being inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Mutations in the UROD gene lead to decreased enzyme activity, contributing to the accumulation of porphyrins, which cause the clinical symptoms of PCT (Phillips2001Functional; Poblete‐Gutiérrez2004The). 

Several specific mutations, such as A22V, F84I, T141I, Y182C, D79N, and P150L, have been identified in PCT patients. These mutations often coexist with other risk factors like HFE mutations, hepatitis C virus infection, estrogen use, and alcohol consumption, which can exacerbate the condition (Badenas2009Identification). 

In addition to PCT, UROD mutations can lead to hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. HEP is characterized by severe UROD deficiency, leading to skin lesions and increased porphyrin excretion. The F46L mutation is one example associated with HEP, resulting in a unique urinary porphyrin excretion pattern (Armstrong2004Hepatoerythropoietic). 

Alterations in UROD expression levels have also been implicated in cancer, particularly head and neck cancer, where UROD overexpression is linked to radioresistance (Ito2011Uroporphyrinogen).
