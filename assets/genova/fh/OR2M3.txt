# OR2M3

## Overview
The OR2M3 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily M member 3, a protein that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of specific odor molecules, notably 3-mercapto-2-methylpentan-1-ol, a key food odorant found in onions. OR2M3 is characterized by its narrow tuning, as it is the only receptor among a large array tested that responds to this particular compound, highlighting its specificity and potential evolutionary significance in humans (Block2017The). The receptor's structure includes a seven-transmembrane domain, typical of GPCRs, which facilitates its role in olfactory signaling. Additionally, OR2M3's activity can be modulated by various factors, including inverse agonists like n-hexanal, which suppress its response to its known agonist (Ojiro2024Enhancement). The gene's expression and methylation status have been linked to clinical conditions such as thyroid cancer and autism spectrum disorder, suggesting its broader significance beyond olfactory perception (Bisarro2017Prognostic; Kuo2015GenomeWide).

## Structure
The olfactory receptor OR2M3 is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This receptor is specifically activated by the compound 3-mercapto-2-methylpentan-1-ol, a key food odor found in onions, and exhibits a narrow tuning, responding only to this compound among 190 tested key food odors (Block2017The). The molecular structure of OR2M3 includes a CSSHL sequence in transmembrane domain 6 (TM6), featuring cysteine (C291) and histidine (H294) residues. This motif is shared with another receptor, OR2T11, suggesting a potential copper effect on OR2M3's response, although this has not been confirmed (Block2017The).

The primary structure of OR2M3, like other olfactory receptors, is highly polymorphic, allowing for the recognition of a wide variety of odorants (Block2017The). The receptor's secondary and tertiary structures are inferred from its classification as a GPCR, which typically involves seven transmembrane alpha-helices forming a ligand-binding pocket. Specific details about the quaternary structure or post-translational modifications of OR2M3 are not provided in the available context. The receptor's function and specificity are influenced by its unique structural features, which are crucial for its role in olfaction.

## Function
The OR2M3 gene encodes an olfactory receptor that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is highly selective and is primarily responsive to 3-mercapto-2-methylpentan-1-ol, a key food odorant found in onions. OR2M3 is unique among human olfactory receptors for its narrow tuning to this specific compound, as it was the only receptor among 391 tested that responded to it (Block2017The). The receptor's response is concentration-dependent and specific to certain chain lengths of 3-mercapto-2-methylalkan-1-ols, indicating its high specificity (Block2017The).

In addition to its role in detecting specific odorants, OR2M3 can exhibit inhibitory responses. For instance, n-hexanal acts as an inverse agonist for OR2M3, suppressing its response to its known agonist, 3-mercapto-2-methyl-1-pentanol, in a concentration-dependent manner. This suggests a potential regulatory role in olfactory signaling (Ojiro2024Enhancement). The receptor is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell. The receptor's activity is also potentially influenced by metals, such as copper, which may enhance its response to certain odorants (Block2017The).

## Clinical Significance
The olfactory receptor gene OR2M3 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to its role in olfactory perception and potential involvement in disease. OR2M3 is specifically activated by the compound 3-mercapto-2-methylpentan-1-ol, a key food odor found in onions, and is noted for its narrow tuning, responding only to this compound among 190 tested key food odors (Block2017The). This specificity suggests an evolutionary adaptation in humans, as only the Homo sapiens variant of OR2M3 is active towards this compound (Block2017The).

Alterations in the expression of OR2M3 have been associated with thyroid cancer. A study identified OR2M3 as hypomethylated in well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma with poor prognosis, suggesting that changes in its methylation status could serve as a biomarker for aggressive thyroid cancer subtypes (Bisarro2017Prognostic). This finding highlights the potential clinical significance of OR2M3 in predicting disease-free survival in thyroid cancer patients (Bisarro2017Prognostic).

In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), OR2M3 has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of the condition. A genome-wide association study in the Taiwanese Han population identified a potential association between OR2M3 and ASD, although the specific clinical significance of OR2M3 mutations in ASD remains unclear (Kuo2015GenomeWide).

## Interactions
The olfactory receptor OR2M3 is involved in interactions that influence its activity and response to odorants. Notably, the TAR-Tat system has been shown to enhance the sensitivity of assays involving OR2M3, although it also induces a negative response value, suggesting an inhibitory effect in this context (Ojiro2024Enhancement). This indicates that the TAR-Tat system may interact with OR2M3 in a manner that modulates its activity.

Additionally, n-hexanal has been identified as an inverse agonist for OR2M3. It suppresses the receptor's response to the agonist 3-mercapto-2-methyl-1-pentanol in a concentration-dependent manner, effectively inhibiting the constitutive activity of OR2M3. This interaction highlights the role of n-hexanal in modulating OR2M3 activity by acting as an inverse agonist, which is a type of interaction where a molecule binds to a receptor and induces the opposite effect of an agonist (Ojiro2024Enhancement).

These interactions suggest that OR2M3 participates in complex signaling pathways, where its activity can be modulated by various factors, including specific molecules and systems that influence its response to odorants.
