# SYNJ2BP

## Overview
SYNJ2BP is a gene that encodes the synaptojanin 2 binding protein, a transmembrane protein primarily located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. This protein is characterized by a PDZ domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and a transmembrane domain that anchors it to the mitochondrial membrane (Hartmann2020The). Synaptojanin 2 binding protein plays a critical role in the formation of mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contact sites (MERCs), which are essential for cellular processes such as calcium uptake and lipid homeostasis (Janer2023ESYT1; Janer2022ESYT1). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as TMIGD1 and RRBP1, underscore its involvement in mitochondrial dynamics and cellular signaling pathways (Hartmann2020The). Additionally, SYNJ2BP has been implicated in various cancers, acting as an oncogene in breast cancer and a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2017SYNJ2BP; Liu2016SYNJ2BP).

## Structure
SYNJ2BP is a 145-amino acid protein that is an integral component of the outer mitochondrial membrane. It features a PDZ domain located between amino acids 13-100, which is exposed to the cytosol and facilitates protein-protein interactions (Hartmann2020The). The protein also contains a transmembrane domain (TMD) spanning amino acids 118-138, anchoring it to the mitochondrial membrane, with a short C-terminal region extending into the intermembrane space (Hartmann2020The). The PDZ domain is crucial for interactions with other proteins, such as TMIGD1 and RRBP1, and is involved in tethering mitochondria to the endoplasmic reticulum (Hartmann2020The).

SYNJ2BP exists in two forms with slightly different molecular weights, 16 and 17 kDa, likely due to post-translational modifications, although phosphorylation has been ruled out (Ilacqua2022Expression). The protein is also known to have splice variants, two of which lack the transmembrane domain and are expected to localize exclusively in the cytoplasm (Hartmann2020The). These structural features and modifications contribute to SYNJ2BP's diverse functional roles in cellular processes, including its involvement in mitochondrial-ER contacts and potential RNA-binding activities (Ilacqua2022Expression).

## Function
SYNJ2BP (synaptojanin 2 binding protein) is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that plays a crucial role in the formation of mitochondria-ER contact sites (MERCs), which are essential for maintaining mitochondrial calcium uptake and lipid homeostasis. It acts as a tethering agent, facilitating the interaction between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, thereby influencing cellular processes such as energy metabolism and protein synthesis (Janer2023ESYT1; Janer2022ESYT1).

SYNJ2BP interacts with ESYT1, forming a high molecular weight complex that promotes the formation of MERCs. This interaction is vital for mitochondrial calcium uptake, as the absence of SYNJ2BP significantly reduces both the maximal mitochondrial calcium concentration and the uptake rate. Conversely, overexpression of SYNJ2BP enhances mitochondrial calcium uptake capacity (Janer2023ESYT1; Janer2022ESYT1).

SYNJ2BP also influences the architecture of MERCs by increasing the length of contacts between mitochondria and the ER, leading to a 'zipper-like' morphology. This structural role is independent of mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins, indicating a unique function in maintaining the integrity and dynamics of MERCs (Janer2023ESYT1; Janer2022ESYT1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SYNJ2BP gene have been implicated in various cancers, notably breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In breast cancer, SYNJ2BP is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, with higher levels correlating with advanced tumor stages and increased metastasis. This overexpression promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis through the activation of the PI3K/AKT/SNAI1 signaling pathway, while also inhibiting PTEN function, which enhances cancer cell proliferation and migration (Wang2017SYNJ2BP).

In contrast, SYNJ2BP expression is frequently down-regulated in HCC, where it acts as a tumor suppressor. Low SYNJ2BP levels are associated with larger tumor size, increased vascular invasion, and poorer overall survival. The gene inhibits tumor growth and metastasis by activating the DLL4-mediated Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for suppressing cell proliferation and migration in HCC (Liu2016SYNJ2BP).

These findings suggest that SYNJ2BP plays a dual role in cancer, acting as an oncogene in breast cancer and a tumor suppressor in HCC, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in these diseases.

## Interactions
SYNJ2BP, or synaptojanin 2 binding protein, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the cell adhesion molecule TMIGD1, a relationship mediated by the PDZ domain of SYNJ2BP and the PDZ domain-binding motif of TMIGD1. This interaction allows SYNJ2BP to recruit TMIGD1 to mitochondria, suggesting a role in mitochondrial localization and potentially in oxidative stress protection (Hartmann2020The).

SYNJ2BP also interacts with the ER membrane protein RRBP1, facilitating the tethering of mitochondria to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This interaction is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and may influence the trafficking of late endosomes to mitochondria (Hartmann2020The).

In the context of cancer, SYNJ2BP has been shown to interact with PTEN, promoting its degradation through the lysosomal pathway. This interaction activates the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β/SNAI1 signaling pathway, contributing to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and breast cancer metastasis (Wang2017SYNJ2BP).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, SYNJ2BP interacts with DLL4, stabilizing Notch signaling, which is important for suppressing tumor growth and metastasis (Liu2016SYNJ2BP). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of SYNJ2BP in cellular signaling and disease progression.
