# TGFB3

## Overview
The TGFB3 gene encodes the protein transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-β3), a member of the TGF-beta superfamily, which is involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. TGF-β3 is a secreted cytokine that plays a pivotal role in tissue homeostasis and repair, particularly within the cardiovascular system and adipose tissue. The protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor that undergoes proteolytic processing to become active, forming a homodimer stabilized by disulfide bonds. TGF-β3 interacts with serine/threonine kinase receptors to activate downstream signaling pathways, including both SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent pathways, which are crucial for its diverse biological functions (Komai2018Reevaluation; Santibañez2011TGF-β/TGF-β). Mutations in the TGFB3 gene have been linked to connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 5, highlighting its clinical significance (Schepers2018A; Mégarbané2020Homozygous).

## Structure
The TGFB3 protein is a member of the TGF-beta superfamily and is involved in various cellular processes. It is synthesized as an inactive pre-pro-TGF-beta precursor, which undergoes proteolytic processing to form a small latent complex. This complex includes the mature TGF-beta ligand and its latency-associated peptide (LAP), which are non-covalently connected, rendering the TGF-beta biologically inactive until activation (Komai2018Reevaluation).

The mature TGFB3 protein forms a homodimer, stabilized by disulfide bonds, a common feature in TGF-beta proteins. The protein structure includes a cystine knot motif, which is typical for members of this family (Daly2022Computational). The molecular structure of TGFB3 was modeled using the experimentally solved structure of TGFB1 as a template, with a homodimer model containing residues 14 to 412 (BertoliAvella2015Mutations).

TGFB3 is activated through integrin-mediated processes, with integrins αvβ6 and αvβ8 capable of binding and activating pro-TGF-beta3. This activation is crucial for its biological functions (Komai2018Reevaluation). The protein's activity and stability can be influenced by post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation.

## Function
Transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFB3) is a crucial component of the TGF-beta superfamily, involved in various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, TGFB3 plays a significant role in regulating adipocyte number in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) by stimulating the proliferation of adipocyte progenitors. This regulation is essential for maintaining adipocyte numbers and function, particularly in the context of obesity and weight loss (Petrus2018Transforming).

TGFB3 is primarily expressed in the stromal vascular fraction of sWAT, especially in adipocyte progenitor cells, and its expression is altered in obesity. It influences adipocyte proliferation and differentiation, contributing to the hyperplastic expansion of white adipose tissue, which is protective against metabolic complications (Petrus2018Transforming).

TGFB3 also plays a critical role in cardiovascular development. It is involved in the regulation of both canonical and non-canonical TGF-beta signaling pathways, which are important for normal cardiovascular development. The protein's activity in the extracellular matrix influences tissue homeostasis and repair, highlighting its importance in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cardiovascular tissues (Chakrabarti2020Transforming).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TGFB3 gene are associated with several connective tissue disorders, most notably Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 5 (LDS5). This syndrome is characterized by arterial aneurysms, tortuosity, and features overlapping with Marfan syndrome, such as skeletal and craniofacial abnormalities (Schepers2018A; Mégarbané2020Homozygous). A specific variant, p.(Asp263His), has been linked to LDS5 and shows variable clinical expression, including aortic aneurysms and connective tissue manifestations (Perik2023Variable).

TGFB3 mutations also contribute to syndromic aortic aneurysms and dissections, with systemic features similar to Loeys-Dietz, Shprintzen-Goldberg, and Marfan syndromes. These include cleft palate, skeletal overgrowth, and mitral valve disease (BertoliAvella2015Mutations). In cardiac conditions, TGFB3 is implicated in cardiac hypertrophy, acting as a negative regulator of fibrosis during disease progression (Zhang2022Upregulation).

Additionally, TGFB3 polymorphisms have been associated with male infertility, potentially due to disruptions in the blood-testis barrier (Droździk2015TGFβ3). The gene's role in orofacial clefts, particularly cleft palate, has been investigated, though evidence for a strong association remains inconclusive (Jugessur2003Variants; Lidral1998Association).

## Interactions
TGFB3 interacts with various proteins and signaling pathways, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It binds to cell-surface serine/threonine kinase receptors, specifically types I and II (TBRI and TBRII), forming heteromeric complexes essential for activating downstream signaling pathways mediated by Smad proteins (Santibañez2011TGF-β/TGF-β). TGFB3 can also interact with co-receptors such as endoglin and betaglycan, known as type III TGF-β receptors (TBRIIIs), which influence the signaling pathways by enhancing or inhibiting specific Smad responses (Santibañez2011TGF-β/TGF-β).

In the context of retina regeneration, TGFB3 collaborates with PP2A and Notch signaling pathways to inhibit Müller glia proliferation. This interaction suggests that PP2A acts downstream of TGFB3, and TGFB3 stimulates Notch signaling, preventing the injury-dependent suppression necessary for Müller glia proliferation (Lee2020Tgfb3). TGFB3 also interacts with integrins in the extracellular matrix, which is a mechanism for its activation (Lee2020Tgfb3).

In cardiovascular development, TGFB3 is involved in both SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent pathways, interacting with proteins such as phospho-SMAD2, SMAD2, phospho-SMAD3, SMAD3, phospho-p38, and ERK1/2, which are part of the MAPK signaling pathways (Chakrabarti2020Transforming). These interactions highlight TGFB3's role in maintaining a balance between canonical and noncanonical signaling pathways essential for cardiovascular development (Chakrabarti2020Transforming).
