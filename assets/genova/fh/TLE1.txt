# TLE1

## Overview
TLE1 (Transducin-Like Enhancer of Split 1) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Groucho/TLE family, which functions as a transcriptional corepressor. The TLE1 protein is characterized by its ability to interact with various transcription factors, thereby modulating gene expression without directly binding to DNA. It plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, including the regulation of inflammation, immune response, and cell differentiation. Structurally, TLE1 contains distinct domains such as the N-terminal glutamine-rich domain and the C-terminal WD40 repeat domain, which facilitate its interactions and repressive functions. TLE1 is involved in key signaling pathways, including the NF-κB and Notch pathways, and has significant implications in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, such as cancer and inflammatory diseases (Ramasamy2016Tle1; Chen2000GrouchoTLE).

## Structure
The TLE1 protein, a member of the Groucho/TLE family, is characterized by several distinct structural domains that contribute to its function as a transcriptional corepressor. The primary structure of TLE1 includes an N-terminal glutamine-rich (Q) domain, a glycine/proline-rich (GP) domain, and a C-terminal WD40 repeat domain (Pickles2002Crystal). The Q domain is highly conserved and facilitates oligomerization through leucine zipper sequences, playing a crucial role in forming tetramers necessary for effective transcription repression (Chodaparambil2014Molecular).

The secondary structure of TLE1 includes a seven-bladed β-propeller WD40 repeat domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (Pickles2002Crystal). This domain is essential for TLE1's interaction with transcription factors and histones, recruiting histone deacetylases to mediate transcriptional repression (Pickles2002Crystal).

In terms of quaternary structure, TLE1 can form dimers and tetramers, with tetramerization being crucial for its function as a transcriptional co-repressor (Chodaparambil2014Molecular). The tetramerization domain is involved in chromatin binding and condensation, facilitating the formation of transcriptionally silent chromatin structures (Chodaparambil2014Molecular). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate TLE1's activity, although specific details are not provided in the context (Pickles2002Crystal). Splice variants of TLE1 can result in different isoforms with distinct functional properties (Pickles2002Crystal).

## Function
TLE1 (Transducin-Like Enhancer of Split 1) functions as a transcriptional corepressor in healthy human cells, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It interacts with various DNA-binding transcription factors, forming repressor complexes that modulate transcriptional activity without directly binding to DNA (Ramasamy2016Tle1). TLE1 is involved in the negative regulation of the NF-κB inflammatory pathway, which is essential for controlling inflammation, immune response, and cell proliferation. By inhibiting NF-κB activation, TLE1 reduces the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation (Ramasamy2016Tle1).

TLE1 also interacts with the Notch signaling pathway, forming a stable complex with the Hes1 protein, which is important for immune suppression and limiting inflammation (Ramasamy2016Tle1). In addition, TLE1 acts as a corepressor of AML1-induced transactivation, influencing hematopoietic lineage-specific gene expression and potentially modulating hematopoiesis (Imai1998TLE). Through these interactions, TLE1 plays a significant role in cell differentiation, proliferation, and development, impacting processes such as neurogenesis and hematopoiesis (Chen2000GrouchoTLE).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TLE1 gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In hematologic malignancies, TLE1 is often epigenetically inactivated through CpG island hypermethylation, leading to its silencing in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This inactivation is linked to disrupted cell differentiation and proliferation (Fraga2008Epigenetic). In AML, TLE1 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its loss can cooperate with the AML1-ETO fusion protein to promote leukemogenesis by affecting myeloid cell proliferation and survival (Dayyani2008Loss).

TLE1 is also implicated in inflammatory diseases. It negatively regulates inflammation by modulating the NF-κB pathway. Loss of TLE1 leads to increased inflammation and is associated with conditions like Crohn's disease, where it interacts with the NOD2 gene to influence disease susceptibility (Ramasamy2016Tle1; Nimmo2011TLE1).

In cancer, TLE1's role varies by context. It is highly expressed in synovial sarcoma and serves as a diagnostic marker, while in other cancers, its expression levels correlate with prognosis. For instance, high TLE1 expression is linked to better outcomes in pancreatic cancer but poorer prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (Yu2022Roles).

## Interactions
TLE1, a member of the Groucho/transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) family, participates in various protein interactions that facilitate its role as a transcriptional corepressor. TLE1 interacts with T-box factors such as Tbx18 and Tbx15 through an engrailed homology 1 (eh1) binding motif, which aids in transcriptional repression by recruiting histone deacetylases (Kaltenbrun2013A). It also forms complexes with the yeast transcriptional co-repressor SSN6 and mammalian SSN6-related proteins, indicating a conserved mechanism of transcription repression across species (GRBAVEC1999Grouchotransducinlike).

In the context of neuronal survival, TLE1 interacts with Forkhead box protein G1 (FoxG1), and this interaction is crucial for promoting neuronal survival. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and phosphorylation by CK2 are necessary for this process (Dastidar2012Transducinlike). TLE1 also binds to the orphan nuclear receptor ERRγ, with its WD40 domain facilitating this interaction (Hentschke2003Identification).

TLE1's interaction with transcription factors such as HESX1 and PROP1 in pituitary development highlights its role in hormone regulation. It forms a complex with HESX1 to repress PROP1 activity, which is crucial for pituitary hormone regulation (Carvalho2010Corepressors).
