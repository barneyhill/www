# SNAP91

## Overview
SNAP91 is a gene that encodes the synaptosome-associated protein 91, a crucial component in the regulation of synaptic vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter release. This protein is categorized as a synaptic protein due to its involvement in the endocytosis and recycling of synaptic vesicles, processes essential for efficient synaptic transmission. SNAP91 interacts with key proteins such as clathrin and AP-2, forming part of the protein complex that facilitates these synaptic functions. Beyond its neurological roles, SNAP91 has been implicated in various cancer-related pathways, serving as a hub gene in protein-protein interaction networks in cancers such as metastatic prostate cancer and esophageal cancer (Sun2021Clinical; Pan2020MicroRNA301b). Additionally, SNAP91 has been identified as a potential biomarker for neuroblastoma and is involved in pathways related to Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, highlighting its significance in both neurological and oncological contexts (Xiong2023Novel; Schrode2019Synergistic; Hu2020Coexpression).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
SNAP91 has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders due to its role in synaptic vesicle recycling. Alterations in the expression of SNAP91 have been associated with schizophrenia (SZ). Studies using CRISPR-based techniques have shown that SNAP91 can influence both pre- and postsynaptic neuronal functions, suggesting its involvement in SZ pathogenesis. The gene's expression changes can lead to synaptic defects, impacting synaptic vesicle recycling and postsynaptic receptor stabilization, which are critical in SZ (Schrode2019Synergistic).

In addition to schizophrenia, SNAP91 has been identified as a potential novel biomarker for neuroblastoma. Bioinformatics analyses have highlighted SNAP91 as one of the differentially expressed genes in neuroblastoma tissues, suggesting its involvement in tumor proliferation and migration. However, its role in neuroblastoma has not been experimentally verified, indicating the need for further research (Xiong2023Novel).

SNAP91 has also been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Co-expression network analyses have identified SNAP91 as a hub gene involved in AD-related pathways. It is notably down-regulated in AD tissues, suggesting its potential role in AD pathogenesis (Hu2020Coexpression).

## Interactions
SNAP91, also known as synaptosome-associated protein 91, is involved in synaptic vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter release. It interacts with proteins such as clathrin and AP-2, playing a role in endocytosis. SNAP91 is part of the protein complex that facilitates synaptic vesicle endocytosis and recycling in neurons. In the context of cancer, SNAP91 has been identified as a hub gene in various protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. For instance, in metastatic prostate cancer, SNAP91 shows high connectivity in the PPI network, suggesting significant interactions with other proteins involved in cancer progression (Sun2021Clinical). In esophageal cancer, SNAP91 is targeted by microRNA-301b, which negatively regulates its expression, indicating a regulatory interaction that affects cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Pan2020MicroRNA301b). Additionally, SNAP91 has been highlighted as a novel marker in neuroblastoma, where it is associated with pathways related to synaptic vesicle transport and axon development, suggesting interactions with proteins involved in these processes (Xiong2023Novel). These interactions underscore SNAP91's role in both neurological functions and cancer-related pathways.
