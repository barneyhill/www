# WASHC3

## Overview
WASHC3 is a gene that encodes the protein WASH complex subunit 3, a critical component of the WASH complex involved in actin polymerization and endosomal sorting. This protein is categorized as a regulatory subunit within the multiprotein WASH complex, which is essential for the regulation of endosome-to-Golgi transport and receptor recycling within cells. WASH complex subunit 3 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, where it associates with endosomal membranes to facilitate the movement and sorting of endosomal contents. This activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient intracellular communication. Disruptions in the function of WASHC3 can lead to impaired cellular trafficking, with potential implications for overall cell function and organismal health (Jia2010WASH; Derivery2009The).

## Function
WASHC3, a subunit of the WASH complex, plays a pivotal role in actin polymerization and endosomal sorting. This protein is integral to the regulation of endosome-to-Golgi transport, a critical process for the recycling of receptors within the cell. WASHC3 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it associates with endosomal membranes. This localization is crucial for its function in cellular trafficking and signaling pathways. By influencing the dynamics of actin filaments, WASHC3 facilitates the movement and sorting of endosomal contents, ensuring that cellular components are correctly recycled and transported to their appropriate destinations. This activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient intracellular communication. The proper functioning of WASHC3 is vital for the regulation of receptor recycling, which impacts various cellular processes, including signal transduction and nutrient uptake. Disruptions in the activity of WASHC3 can lead to impaired cellular trafficking, potentially affecting overall cell function and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WASHC3 gene, particularly the N471D mutation in the strumpellin protein, are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG8), a neurodegenerative disease. This mutation leads to defects in the endolysosomal system, including a block in exocytosis and altered lysosome morphology, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Song2018Expression). The N471D mutation disrupts normal protein interactions within the WASH complex, affecting cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking and actin polymerization, which are essential for neuronal function (Song2018Expression).

Alterations in WASHC3 interactions can also impact protein folding and vesicle transport, as seen with the failure of the N471D mutant to interact with proteins involved in these processes (Song2018Expression). These disruptions may contribute to the molecular causes of SPG8 and other neurodegenerative conditions by affecting the endolysosomal system and protein homeostasis (Song2018Expression). The clinical significance of WASHC3 mutations underscores the importance of the WASH complex in neurodegenerative diseases and highlights potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
WASHC3, a component of the WASH complex, participates in several protein interactions crucial for its function in actin polymerization and endosomal sorting. It is part of a large multiprotein complex that includes other subunits such as FAM21, KIAA1033 (SWIP), Strumpellin, and CCDC53. This complex is structurally similar to the WAVE regulatory complex and is involved in regulating actin dynamics (Jia2010WASH). The WASH complex interacts with the Arp2/3 complex, promoting actin nucleation necessary for endosomal fission and morphology maintenance (Derivery2009The).

WASHC3 also interacts with dynamin, a GTPase involved in membrane fission, although this interaction is not dependent on dynamin's activity (Derivery2009The). The WASH complex includes capping protein (CP), which typically inhibits actin dynamics, suggesting a regulatory role in actin filament capping (Derivery2009The). These interactions highlight the role of WASHC3 in coordinating the structural and functional dynamics of endosomes through its involvement in the WASH complex.
