# SERTAD3

## Overview
SERTAD3 is a gene that encodes the protein SERTA domain containing 3, which is characterized by the presence of a SERTA domain. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and cancer progression. SERTAD3 interacts with I-mfa domain proteins, such as I-mfa and HIC, through its SERTA domain, influencing its transcriptional activities and potentially playing a role in oncogenesis (Kusano2011Imfa). In the context of breast cancer, SERTAD3 is implicated in the development of tamoxifen resistance, mediated by the long non-coding RNA HNF1A-AS1 and the miR-363/HNF1A-AS1 axis, which affects the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway (Li2021Silencing). The regulatory interactions and pathways involving SERTAD3 highlight its significance in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions, particularly in cancer.

## Clinical Significance
SERTAD3 has been implicated in breast cancer, particularly in the context of tamoxifen resistance. The long non-coding RNA HNF1A-AS1 is known to increase the expression of SERTAD3 by sponging miR-363, which contributes to tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells. This resistance is mediated through the activation of the TGF-β/Smad pathway, a critical signaling pathway in cancer progression (Li2021Silencing). Silencing HNF1A-AS1, which leads to increased miR-363 expression and decreased SERTAD3 levels, has been shown to enhance the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen, both in vitro and in vivo (Li2021Silencing).

In addition to its role in breast cancer, SERTAD3 is involved in transcriptional regulation through its interaction with I-mfa domain proteins. These interactions can repress the transcriptional activities of SERTAD3, which is suggested to have oncogenic functions. The repression of SERTAD3 by I-mfa domain proteins may indicate a potential tumor suppressor role for these proteins, as they can negatively regulate the oncogenic functions of SERTAD3 (Kusano2011Imfa). This suggests that alterations in SERTAD3 expression or its interactions may contribute to cancer progression.

## Interactions
SERTAD3, a protein containing a SERTA domain, is known to interact with I-mfa domain proteins, such as I-mfa and HIC. These interactions occur through the SERTA domain and lead to the repression of SERTAD3's transcriptional activities. I-mfa co-localizes with SERTAD3 in the nucleus, suggesting that SERTAD3 may facilitate the nuclear translocation of I-mfa. This interaction is specific and has been confirmed through pull-down assays and immunofluorescence analysis (Kusano2011Imfa).

SERTAD3 is also involved in the E2F-dependent transcriptional network, where it stimulates transcriptional activity. However, this activity can be repressed by I-mfa, indicating a regulatory role for I-mfa in modulating SERTAD3's function (Kusano2011Imfa).

In the context of breast cancer, SERTAD3 expression is regulated by the long non-coding RNA HNF1A-AS1, which sponges microRNA-363. This regulation affects the TGF-β/Smad pathway, contributing to tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells. The interaction between SERTAD3 and the miR-363/HNF1A-AS1 axis highlights its role in cancer cell growth and drug resistance (Li2021Silencing).
