# TRIM21

## Overview
TRIM21 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 21, also known as Ro52, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. This protein is characterized by a RING domain, B-box domains, a coiled-coil region, and a B30.2 domain, and functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. TRIM21 plays a crucial role in the immune system by regulating protein turnover and immune signaling pathways, particularly through its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It is notable for its ability to bind to the Fc region of antibodies, facilitating the intracellular neutralization of antibody-coated viruses, thus extending the protective role of antibodies beyond extracellular environments. TRIM21 is expressed in various tissues, contributing to systemic immune defense and cellular homeostasis. Its dysfunction is implicated in autoimmune diseases, cancer, and metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Mallery2010Antibodies; Rhodes2007TRIM21; Jones2021TRIM21Ro52).

## Structure
TRIM21, also known as Ro52, is a protein characterized by a tripartite motif consisting of a RING domain, B-box domains, a coiled-coil region, and a B30.2 domain. The RING domain is involved in ubiquitination, functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is crucial for protein turnover and immune signaling (Rhodes2007TRIM21; Wallenhammar2017Solution). The B-box2 domain, spanning residues 86-130, features a ββαβ fold typical of the Zn2+-finger family, with a single Zn2+ binding site that stabilizes its structure (Wallenhammar2017Solution). This domain interacts with the RING domain, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions (Wallenhammar2017Solution).

The B30.2 domain adopts a beta sandwich structure related to the galectin fold, composed of layered anti-parallel beta sheets with variable helical loops, and is responsible for binding the Fc region of IgG (Rhodes2007TRIM21). The PRYSPRY domain within TRIM21 forms a globular fold with a distorted β-sandwich structure, comprising two antiparallel β-sheets, and is involved in binding to the Fc region of antibodies (James2007Structural). TRIM21 functions as a trimer, with the coiled-coil and B30.2 domains contributing to its oligomerization (Rhodes2007TRIM21).

## Function
TRIM21 is a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in the immune response within healthy human cells. It functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the degradation of proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. TRIM21 is involved in the regulation of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) by promoting its degradation, which affects the stability and activity of various IRF5 isoforms. This regulation is crucial for modulating immune responses, particularly in pathways activated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Lazzari2014TRIpartite).

In addition to its role in regulating IRF5, TRIM21 is a key player in intracellular immunity. It acts as a cytosolic receptor for antibodies, binding to the Fc region of antibody-coated viruses. This interaction targets the virus for proteasomal degradation, effectively neutralizing the virus within the cell and preventing viral replication. This mechanism extends the function of antibodies beyond extracellular environments, providing a last line of defense against viral infections (Mallery2010Antibodies).

TRIM21's activity is not limited to immune cells; it is expressed in various tissues, allowing it to contribute to systemic protection against viral infections and maintain cellular homeostasis (Rhodes2017TRIM21).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the TRIM21 gene, including mutations and changes in expression levels, are associated with various diseases. In autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), TRIM21 dysfunction is linked to dysregulated B-cell activity and increased autoantibody production. Anti-TRIM21 antibodies are significant in diagnosing pSS and are found in a substantial percentage of SLE patients (Jones2021TRIM21Ro52; Hsu2023The). In idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM), anti-TRIM21 antibodies are associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and are considered a predictive marker for disease severity and prognosis (Gong2024Roles).

In cancer, TRIM21 expression levels influence tumor progression. Downregulation of TRIM21 is linked to poor outcomes in cancers such as breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, where it acts as a tumor suppressor by reducing cell proliferation and increasing apoptosis (Jones2021TRIM21Ro52; Ding2015Downregulation). In contrast, overexpression of TRIM21 in glioma, thyroid, and pancreatic cancers is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes, including increased cell proliferation and drug resistance (Hsu2023The). In type 2 diabetes mellitus, reduced TRIM21 expression is linked to impaired hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism (Zhang2023TRIM21).

## Interactions
TRIM21 interacts with various proteins and plays a significant role in immune responses. It forms a stable 1:1 complex with antibodies by binding to the Fc region of immunoglobulins, including all four IgG subclasses, IgM, and IgA, though with varying affinities. This interaction is characterized by high binding affinity and is largely pH-independent (Foss2019TRIM21—From). TRIM21 competes with other proteins like Staphylococcus aureus protein A for binding to IgG, suggesting a steric hindrance mechanism (Rhodes2007TRIM21).

TRIM21 also interacts with DDX41, a sensor of intracellular DNA, through its PRYSPRY domain. This interaction leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of DDX41, thereby negatively regulating the innate immune response to intracellular DNA (Zhang2012The). The B-box2 domain of TRIM21 interacts with its RING domain, facilitating substrate ubiquitination and immune signaling (Wallenhammar2017Solution).

TRIM21's interaction with antibody-coated pathogens within the cytosol leads to their degradation, highlighting its role in intracellular immunity. This process involves TRIM21 autoubiquitination and possibly ubiquitin transfer to the viral particle (Jones2021TRIM21Ro52).
