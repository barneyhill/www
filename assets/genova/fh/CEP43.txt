# CEP43

## Overview
CEP43 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 43, a crucial component of the centrosome involved in various cellular processes. The protein plays a significant role in maintaining centrosome integrity and regulating microtubule dynamics, which are essential for proper cell division and chromosome segregation during mitosis (Popescu2023NMN). As a member of the centrosomal protein family, centrosomal protein 43 is implicated in centriole biogenesis and cell cycle progression, contributing to the structural integrity of cilia and cellular architecture (Mena2024ANKRD55). Disruptions in its function can lead to pathological conditions, such as deciliation observed in COVID-19 (AlegríaArcos2022Network). Furthermore, CEP43 has been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential as a genetic biomarker and therapeutic target (Matejcic2021Rare).

## Structure
CEP43, encoded by the CEP43 gene, is a centrosomal protein integral to centrosome function. The primary structure of CEP43 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that determine its functional properties. The secondary structure of CEP43 may include alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure refers to the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein, which is crucial for its interaction with other cellular components. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of protein subunits, which can be essential for its role in centrosome function.

Post-translational modifications of CEP43 can influence its activity and localization within the cell. These modifications may include phosphorylation, ubiquitination, or other chemical changes that regulate its function. Splice variants of the CEP43 gene can lead to different isoforms of the protein, potentially altering its interaction with other proteins and its role in cellular processes. These structural and functional variations underscore the complexity of CEP43's role in centrosome dynamics and its importance in maintaining cellular organization.

## Function
CEP43, or centrosomal protein 43, is a critical component of the centrosome, playing a significant role in maintaining centrosome integrity and function in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which are essential for proper cell division and the separation of chromosomes during mitosis (Popescu2023NMN). CEP43 is localized at the centrosome, where it contributes to the organization and anchoring of microtubules, impacting cell cycle progression and cellular architecture (Mena2024ANKRD55).

In addition to its role in cell division, CEP43 is implicated in centriole biogenesis and cell cycle progression control, as part of the CEP protein family. This protein family is crucial for the structural integrity of cilia, and disruptions in CEP43 interactions can lead to deciliation, as observed in certain pathological conditions like COVID-19 (AlegríaArcos2022Network). CEP43's interaction with other centrosomal proteins, such as those involved in spindle pole assembly, further underscores its importance in maintaining cellular functions related to the cell cycle and structural integrity (Yokoyama2023SART1).

## Clinical Significance
CEP43 has been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its role in cell cycle regulation and centrosome function. Alterations in CEP43 expression or mutations in the gene have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. A study identified CEP43 as one of the genes with a strong association with colorectal cancer risk, suggesting its potential as a genetic biomarker and therapeutic target for this disease (Matejcic2021Rare).

In the context of neurological disorders, CEP43 was included in a study analyzing brain-specific protein-protein interaction networks related to COVID-19. Although CEP43 did not show direct interactions in the brain, its inclusion in the study highlights its potential relevance in understanding the broader implications of COVID-19 on neurological health (Prasad2021Brain).

CEP43 has also been explored in the context of uterine leiomyosarcoma, where it was identified as part of a co-expression network with other genes involved in cancer-related pathways. This suggests that CEP43 may play a role in the progression of certain cancers, although specific diseases or conditions directly linked to CEP43 mutations were not detailed in the study (Rakic2023Integrated).

## Interactions
CEP43, also known as centrosomal protein 43, is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly within the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is part of the centrosomal protein family, playing a crucial role in centriole biogenesis and cell cycle progression control. In the human-SARS-CoV-2 protein-protein interaction network, CEP43 is identified as a significant protein based on its eigenvector centrality, indicating its importance in the network's topology (AlegríaArcos2022Network).

CEP43 interacts with the viral protein Nsp13, which is known to disrupt physiological interactions in the structure of cilia through centrosome binding, leading to deciliation. This interaction highlights the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 on cellular structures and functions (AlegríaArcos2022Network).

In the context of brain-specific interactions, CEP43 did not show any interactions, indicating a lack of identified physical interactions in the brain (Prasad2021Brain). Additionally, CEP43 is reported as downregulated in the brain in response to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting its involvement in broader network interactions influenced by viral infection (Estrada2020Fractional). However, specific details on its physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not provided in the available context.
