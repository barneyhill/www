# NEK5

## Overview
NEK5 is a gene that encodes the protein NIMA related kinase 5, a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. This kinase is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, centrosome integrity, and mitochondrial function. NEK5 plays a critical role in maintaining centrosome cohesion during cell division and is essential for proper mitotic progression. It also contributes to mitochondrial homeostasis by interacting with mitochondrial proteins and maintaining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity. The protein's kinase activity is crucial for these functions, highlighting its importance in cellular signaling pathways and genomic stability. NEK5's involvement in DNA metabolism and its interactions with proteins involved in DNA repair and apoptosis underscore its potential significance in cancer biology and other diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunction (Ferezin2021NEK5; Prosser2015Nek5; Melo2015Nek5).

## Structure
NEK5 is a member of the human NEK family of protein kinases, consisting of 708 amino acids. The protein features a catalytic domain at its amino-terminus and a regulatory domain at its carboxy-terminus (Melo‐Hanchuk2019NEK5). The regulatory domain, spanning amino acids 260-708, includes two coiled-coil regions crucial for protein-protein interactions (Melo‐Hanchuk2019NEK5). NEK5 also contains a DEAD box domain, which is involved in cellular processes such as mRNA processing and ribonucleoprotein complex rearrangement (Melo2015Nek5).

The kinase domain is located at the N-terminal, with an ATP-binding site at Lysine 33, and a caspase-3 cleavage site between amino acids 456 and 498 (Ferezin2021NEK5). NEK5 is a substrate for caspase-3, which cleaves it at the Asp438 site during apoptosis (Shimizu2013Nek5). The protein's structure includes a segment from amino acids 505-708, which was used to generate specific antibodies, indicating its importance in the protein's structure (Prosser2015Nek5).

NEK5 interacts with various proteins, including mitochondrial proteins like COX11 and MTX2, suggesting a role in mitochondrial-mediated processes (Melo2015Nek5). The protein's kinase activity is essential for maintaining mitochondrial mass and mtDNA integrity (Ferezin2021NEK5).

## Function
NEK5 (NIMA related kinase 5) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a crucial role in maintaining centrosome integrity and cohesion during cell division. It is involved in the recruitment of pericentriolar material (PCM) and microtubule nucleation during interphase, and it promotes centrosome linker disassembly during mitosis. The absence of NEK5 can lead to altered spindle geometry and retention of centrosome linker proteins, which hinders proper mitotic progression (Prosser2015Nek5).

NEK5 is also involved in mitochondrial functions and mtDNA maintenance. It interacts with mitochondrial proteins such as LonP1, and its kinase activity is essential for regulating mitochondrial functions and maintaining mtDNA integrity. NEK5's role in mitochondrial homeostasis includes protecting mtDNA from oxidative damage and regulating mitochondrial DNA repair mechanisms (Ferezin2021NEK5).

In addition to its roles in cell division and mitochondrial maintenance, NEK5 influences various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA metabolism, and cellular signaling pathways. It affects the phosphorylation of proteins involved in mitotic progression and DNA replication, highlighting its importance in cell cycle control and genomic stability (de2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance
NEK5 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. It is overexpressed in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia, particularly in Russian patients, and is considered a potential cancer biomarker (Peres2020Checking). In breast cancer, NEK5 promotes cell proliferation and is involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), although there is no statistical correlation between its mRNA expression and breast cancer survival (Nguyen2023NEK). High NEK5 expression is also observed in thyroid tissues, correlating with tumor size and metastasis (Peres2020Checking).

NEK5's role extends to mitochondrial function, where it interacts with mitochondrial proteins and affects mitochondrial respiration and cell survival. Overexpression of NEK5 can lead to reduced respiratory rates and increased cell survival under oxidative stress, suggesting a protective role against cell death (Melo2015Nek5). These interactions highlight NEK5's potential involvement in conditions related to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress.

Despite these associations, NEK5 remains one of the least studied kinases, and further research is needed to fully understand its clinical implications and potential as a therapeutic target (Nguyen2023NEK).

## Interactions
NEK5, a member of the NIMA-related kinase family, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. NEK5 interacts with topoisomerase IIβ (TOPIIβ), a key enzyme in DNA replication and repair. This interaction is particularly important in the DNA damage response, as demonstrated by increased interactions following etoposide treatment, a chemotherapeutic agent that induces DNA strand breaks (Melo‐Hanchuk2019NEK5).

NEK5 also interacts with several mitochondrial proteins, including COX11, MTX2, and BCLAF1. These interactions suggest NEK5's involvement in mitochondrial functions and cell viability. NEK5's interaction with BCLAF1, which is associated with DNA damage repair and apoptosis regulation, highlights its role in maintaining genomic stability (Melo‐Hanchuk2019NEK5; Melo2015Nek5).

In the mitochondrial context, NEK5 interacts with LonP1 and TFAM, proteins involved in mtDNA maintenance and mitochondrial homeostasis. The interaction with LonP1, a mitochondrial protease, is significant for mtDNA integrity, especially under oxidative stress conditions. NEK5's kinase activity is essential for these interactions, as it affects mtDNA maintenance and repair (Ferezin2021NEK5). These interactions position NEK5 as a crucial player in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA maintenance.
