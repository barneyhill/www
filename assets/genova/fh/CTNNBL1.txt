# CTNNBL1

## Overview
CTNNBL1 is a gene that encodes the protein catenin beta-like 1, which is a member of the armadillo family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its structural homology to β-catenin, despite lacking strong primary sequence homology, and is involved in various cellular processes, including RNA splicing and cell signaling (Jabbour2003Sequence; Yin2011Isolation). Catenin beta-like 1 is a nuclear protein that plays a crucial role in the spliceosome, a complex essential for pre-mRNA processing, and is involved in maintaining the stability and abundance of the Prp19 spliceosomal complex (van2015CTNNBL1). The protein's structure includes multiple armadillo repeats and a HEAT-like domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins within the spliceosome complex (Ganesh2013Structural). CTNNBL1 has been implicated in various diseases, including high-grade serous ovarian cancer and obesity, where its expression levels and genetic variations are associated with disease progression and risk factors (Liu2008Genomewide; Li2017Spliceosomeassociated).

## Structure
The CTNNBL1 protein is composed of 563 amino acids and exhibits structural homology to β-catenin and other armadillo family proteins, despite lacking strong primary sequence homology (Jabbour2003Sequence; Yin2011Isolation). Its secondary structure includes multiple armadillo repeats, which are characteristic of proteins involved in cadherin-mediated adhesion and transcription regulation (Ganesh2013Structural; Jabbour2003Sequence). The protein's tertiary structure features a superhelical coiled coil composed of α-helices stacked against each other, forming a solenoid with a concave electronegative groove (Ganesh2013Structural).

CTNNBL1 forms a dimer in physiological conditions, facilitated by the N-terminal capping region and the first four ARM repeats (Ahn2015Small). This dimerization is crucial for its role in the hPrp19/CDC5L complex, where it interacts with CDC5L to form a heterotetramer (Ahn2015Small). The protein contains several motifs, including a bipartite nuclear localization signal, a nuclear export signal, a leucine-isoleucine zipper, and potential phosphorylation sites, which may regulate its function (Jabbour2003Sequence; Yin2011Isolation). An alternatively spliced product, NYD-SP16, lacks several key regions, suggesting it may function outside the nucleus (Jabbour2003Sequence).

## Function
The CTNNBL1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in RNA splicing and cell signaling. It is a component of the spliceosome, a complex essential for pre-mRNA processing, and is involved in maintaining the stability and abundance of the Prp19 spliceosomal complex. CTNNBL1 facilitates the association of CWC15 with CDC5L, forming a trimeric complex crucial for spliceosome function. This interaction is necessary for maintaining normal levels of the Prp19 complex, which supports efficient splicing of messenger RNA (van2015CTNNBL1).

CTNNBL1 is a nuclear protein that binds nuclear localization signals in splice factors and the antibody diversifying enzyme AID. It is structurally unique, with a HEAT-like domain, a central armadillo domain, and a coiled-coil C-terminal domain. This structure allows CTNNBL1 to bind NLSs with high selectivity and affinity, particularly in essential spliceosome components (Ganesh2013Structural).

In terms of organismal outcomes, CTNNBL1 is crucial for cell viability and function. Mice lacking CTNNBL1 exhibit mid-gestation lethality, and CTNNBL1-deficient cells show delayed exit from quiescence, indicating its essential role in cell cycle regulation and development (Chandra2013Deficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the CTNNBL1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and obesity. In ovarian cancer, CTNNBL1 is significantly upregulated, particularly in HGSOC, compared to normal fallopian tube tissues. This overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation, invasion, and poor prognosis in patients. CTNNBL1 is primarily located in the cell nucleus and its expression correlates with age and omentum metastasis. High levels of CTNNBL1 are linked to reduced survival time in patients, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Li2017Spliceosomeassociated).

In the context of obesity, genome-wide association studies have identified CTNNBL1 as a novel gene associated with body mass index (BMI) and fat mass. Multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CTNNBL1, particularly rs6013029, are significantly associated with increased BMI and fat mass. Individuals homozygous for the rs6013029 T allele have a higher risk of obesity. The gene's structural similarity to b-catenin suggests a potential role in the Wnt/b-catenin-signaling pathway, which is involved in adipogenesis (Liu2008Genomewide).

## Interactions
CTNNBL1 is a protein that participates in several interactions with other proteins, particularly within the spliceosome complex. It is a component of the hPrp19/CDC5L complex, a non-snRNP spliceosome complex essential for spliceosome activation during pre-mRNA splicing. CTNNBL1 interacts with CDC5L and AD002 within this complex, forming a heterotetramer consisting of one CTNNBL1 dimer and one CDC5L dimer. This interaction is mediated by the positively charged NLS3-containing region of CDC5L binding to the negatively charged patch of CTNNBL1 (Ahn2015Small).

CTNNBL1 also binds nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in splice factors CDC5L and Prp31, as well as the antibody diversifying enzyme AID. This binding is distinct from its closest homologue, karyopherin-α, indicating a unique binding specificity (Ganesh2013Structural). The protein's structural resemblance to β-catenin suggests potential involvement in the Wnt-signaling pathway, although specific interactions in this context are not detailed (Liu2008Genomewide).

In cancer research, CTNNBL1 has been associated with cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis, particularly in colorectal cancer, where it may act upstream of or in parallel to β-catenin (Dong2017Detection).
