# USF3

## Overview
USF3 is a gene that encodes the protein upstream transcription factor family member 3, which functions as a transcription factor involved in various biological processes. This protein plays a critical role in bone biology by modulating the expression of genes such as WNT16, RANKL, and RUNX2, thereby influencing osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. USF3 is also implicated in cellular stress responses and energy production, particularly in tissues with high energy demands like the cerebellum and skeletal muscle. It is involved in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism, and its activity is crucial for cellular growth, differentiation, and response to environmental signals. Additionally, USF3 interacts with several transcription factors and is involved in pathways related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer progression, particularly in epithelial thyroid carcinoma (Ni2016Germline; Ye2020USF3modulates).

## Function
The USF3 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a significant role in bone biology and cellular processes. In the context of bone metabolism, USF3 is involved in modulating osteoporosis risk by targeting genes such as WNT16, RANKL, and RUNX2. It promotes osteogenesis by stimulating the transcription of WNT16 and RUNX2 and represses osteoclastogenesis by upregulating WNT16 transcription and downregulating RANKL transcription. This activity enhances osteoblast differentiation and suppresses osteoclastogenesis, contributing to bone formation and resorption processes (Ye2020USF3modulates).

USF3 is also implicated in cellular stress responses and energy production. It is involved in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism, as evidenced by its role in the endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response pathways. The gene's expression is highest in tissues with high energy demand, such as the cerebellum and skeletal muscle, and is relatively ubiquitous in other tissues (Ni2016Germline).

In healthy cells, USF3 is active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcription of target genes, impacting cellular growth, differentiation, and response to environmental signals (Ni2016Germline).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the USF3 gene have been implicated in the predisposition to various cancers, particularly epithelial thyroid carcinoma. The presence of compound heterozygous deletions in USF3, specifically involving poly-glutamine repeats, has been associated with both heritable and sporadic forms of this cancer. These deletions are linked to Cowden syndrome-like phenotypes, which include an increased risk of thyroid cancer, particularly papillary thyroid carcinoma (Ni2016Germline). The loss of USF3 expression is associated with the activation of the MAPK and possibly AKT pathways, which are significant in cancer development (Ni2016Germline).

USF3 dysfunction is also linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that enhances cancer cell invasiveness and resistance to apoptosis, contributing to cancer progression (Ni2016Germline). In addition to its role in cancer, USF3 has been identified as a susceptibility gene for osteoporosis. It influences bone metabolism by modulating the expression of genes like WNT16 and RANKL, which are crucial for bone formation and resorption. USF3 mutations can affect bone mineral density and fracture risk, highlighting its clinical significance in bone-related diseases (Ye2020USF3modulates).

## Interactions
USF3 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It is known to bind directly to an E-box element in the RUNX2 promoter, enhancing its transcriptional activity, which is crucial for osteogenesis (Ye2020USF3modulates). USF3 also interacts with transcription factors such as TWIST1, TCF12, TBX5, and TBX15, influencing the transcriptional activity of specific alleles like rs2908007, which is associated with osteoporosis risk (Ye2020USF3modulates). 

In the context of thyroid carcinoma, USF3 knockdown is linked to enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased cell migration, suggesting interactions with pathways involving MAPK and possibly AKT, although without direct RAS activation (Ni2016Germline). USF3's role in EMT is further supported by its association with decreased E-cadherin expression, a marker of EMT and cancer progression (Ni2016Germline).

USF3 also forms part of a complex network of protein interactions that regulate bone formation and resorption, interacting with transcription factors such as CREB1 and JUN, which suggests a complex regulatory mechanism in bone metabolism (Ye2020USF3modulates).
