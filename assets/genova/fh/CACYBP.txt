# CACYBP

## Overview
CACYBP, or calcyclin binding protein, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including protein dephosphorylation, ubiquitination, and cytoskeletal dynamics. The protein, also referred to as CacyBP/SIP, is characterized by its ability to interact with a range of proteins, including members of the S100 protein family, components of the ubiquitin ligase complex, and cytoskeletal proteins, thereby playing a crucial role in cell cycle regulation and gene expression (Schneider2010S100A6; Filipek2002CacyBPSIP). CacyBP/SIP functions as a chaperone and phosphatase within the Hsp90 chaperone system, influencing protein folding and stability (Góral2016Calcyclin). The protein's involvement in cancer is notable, with its expression levels serving as potential biomarkers for prognosis in various cancers, including breast, bladder, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Zheng2021Downregulation; Wang2010CacyBPSIP; Lian2019CACYBP). CacyBP/SIP's diverse roles in cellular processes and disease underscore its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions.

## Structure
The human CACYBP (calcyclin binding protein) is composed of 228 amino acid residues and has a molecular mass of 26.5 kDa, although it migrates at approximately 30 kDa in SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (TopolskaWoś2016CacyBPSIP). The protein consists of three structurally independent domains: the N-terminal domain (residues 1-77), the central CS domain (residues 78-178), and the C-terminal domain (residues 179-229) (TopolskaWoś2016CacyBPSIP). The N-terminal domain forms a helical hairpin, while the CS domain is a β-sheet sandwich, similar to domains found in CHORD-containing proteins (TopolskaWoś2016CacyBPSIP). The C-terminal domain is largely unstructured but can form helical fragments upon binding to S100A6 (TopolskaWoś2016CacyBPSIP).

CACYBP can dimerize, with the N-terminal domain serving as the dimerization domain, driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (TopolskaWoś2016CacyBPSIP). Small-angle X-ray scattering studies suggest an anti-parallel orientation of dimer subunits, with a compact core formed by the N-terminal and CS domains and flexible C-terminal tails extending away (TopolskaWoś2016CacyBPSIP). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and sumoylation, which affect its activity and localization (TopolskaWoś2016CacyBPSIP). The C-terminal domain contains the binding site for S100A6, located between residues 189 and 219, and this interaction is calcium-dependent (Schneider2010S100A6).

## Function
CACYBP, also known as calcyclin binding protein, plays a multifaceted role in cellular processes, including protein dephosphorylation, ubiquitination, and cytoskeletal dynamics. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenesis (Góral2016Calcyclin; TopolskaWoś2016CacyBPSIP). CACYBP functions as a chaperone, interacting with the Hsp90 chaperone machinery, where it binds to the middle domain of Hsp90 and exhibits chaperone properties by maintaining proteins in a folding-competent state (Góral2016Calcyclin). It also acts as a phosphatase for Hsp90, suggesting a regulatory role in the Hsp90 chaperone system (Góral2016Calcyclin).

CACYBP interacts with various proteins, including S100 proteins, components of E3 ubiquitin ligase, and cytoskeletal proteins, indicating its involvement in protein degradation pathways and cell cycle regulation (Schneider2010S100A6). It binds to tubulin and actin, suggesting a role in microtubule and microfilament organization, and may function as a scaffold protein, facilitating the assembly of multi-protein complexes involved in cytoskeletal dynamics (TopolskaWoś2016CacyBPSIP). CACYBP is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell proliferation and differentiation (TopolskaWoś2016CacyBPSIP).

## Clinical Significance
CACYBP (calcyclin binding protein) is implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with disease progression and prognosis. In breast cancer, CACYBP/SIP is overexpressed, correlating with poor cellular differentiation, lymph node invasion, and advanced clinicopathological staging. This upregulation is linked to increased recurrence, metastasis, and a shorter overall survival rate, suggesting its role as a biomarker for poor prognosis (Wang2010CacyBPSIP). In bladder cancer, CACYBP acts as an oncogene, with high expression levels negatively impacting overall survival. Knockdown of CACYBP in bladder cancer cells inhibits proliferation and migration, promoting apoptosis (Zheng2021Downregulation).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated CACYBP expression is associated with poor prognosis, promoting tumor progression by enhancing the cytoplasmic retention of the cell cycle inhibitor P27 Kip1 (Lian2019CACYBP). In contrast, CACYBP/SIP acts as a tumor suppressor in renal cell carcinoma, where its overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Sun2007Overexpressed). In pancreatic cancer, CACYBP/SIP is significantly upregulated, suggesting its involvement in malignancy and potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2008Expression). These findings highlight the complex role of CACYBP in cancer, where its expression and interactions can vary significantly across different tumor types.

## Interactions
CacyBP/SIP, also known as calcyclin-binding protein and Siah-1 interacting protein, engages in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its cellular functions. It was initially identified as a ligand for S100A6, a member of the S100 protein family, and interacts with other S100 proteins such as S100A1, S100A12, S100B, and S100P in a calcium-dependent manner (Schneider2010S100A6; Filipek2002CacyBPSIP). The binding to S100A6 involves the C-terminal domain of CacyBP/SIP, specifically between residues 189 and 219 (Schneider2010S100A6).

CacyBP/SIP also interacts with components of the ubiquitin ligase complex, including Siah-1 and Skp1. The interaction with Siah-1 occurs through a motif in the N-terminal domain, which is essential for forming a complex that influences β-catenin degradation (TopolskaWoś2016CacyBPSIP). Skp1 binds to the middle part of CacyBP/SIP, which is homologous to the CS domain found in other proteins (Schneider2010S100A6).

In addition to these interactions, CacyBP/SIP binds to cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin and actin. It directly binds to tubulin, forming globular assemblies, and to actin, promoting polymerization and filament bundle formation (TopolskaWoś2016CacyBPSIP; Schneider2010Tubulin). These interactions suggest a role in linking the actin and tubulin cytoskeletons (Schneider2010Tubulin).
