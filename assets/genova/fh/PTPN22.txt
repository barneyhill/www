# PTPN22

## Overview
PTPN22 is a gene that encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22, also known as lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase (LYP). This protein is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, which plays a critical role in cellular signaling by dephosphorylating tyrosine residues on target proteins. LYP is particularly important in the regulation of immune responses, acting as a negative regulator of T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathways. It modulates immune cell activation and cytokine production, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive immune activation (Armitage2021Influence; Yang2020PTPN22). Variants of the PTPN22 gene, such as the R620W polymorphism, have been implicated in the susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases, highlighting its significance in both adaptive and innate immunity (Menard2011The; Tizaoui2021The).

## Structure
PTPN22 encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase known as lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase (LYP), which plays a role in immune regulation. The primary structure of PTPN22 includes a catalytic domain and proline-rich regions, which are essential for its function. The secondary structure is characterized by the presence of alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of PTPN22 involves a compact fold that stabilizes the active site, crucial for its enzymatic activity. PTPN22 functions as a monomer and lacks a quaternary structure.

A notable feature of PTPN22 is the WPD-loop, which contains essential catalytic residues and is involved in the interaction with inhibitors such as NC1. This loop is critical for the enzyme's catalytic activity and is a target for allosteric inhibition, as demonstrated by the binding of NC1, which restricts its movement (Li2019Identification). Common post-translational modifications of PTPN22 include phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions within the cell. The unique LYP-specific insert in PTPN22 contributes to its selectivity and function, distinguishing it from other phosphatases (Li2019Identification).

## Function
The PTPN22 gene encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses, particularly in T cells. In healthy human cells, PTPN22 functions as a negative regulator of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling by dephosphorylating key signaling molecules such as Lck and ZAP70, which are essential for TCR signal transduction (Yang2020PTPN22). This regulation is vital for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive immune activation.

PTPN22 is also involved in the modulation of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, where it dampens BCR signaling and influences B cell tolerance checkpoints. The PTPN22 620W variant, a gain-of-function mutation, further blunts BCR signaling, allowing more autoreactive B cells to escape central tolerance and enter the periphery, potentially increasing the risk of autoimmune diseases (Armitage2021Influence).

In addition to its role in adaptive immunity, PTPN22 influences innate immune responses. It acts as a negative regulator of cytokine production in macrophages and affects signaling pathways in monocytes and dendritic cells, impacting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and cytokine production (Armitage2021Influence).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PTPN22 gene, particularly the R620W variant, are strongly associated with several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Menard2011The). This variant is a gain-of-function polymorphism that affects T and B cell receptor signaling, potentially disrupting immune tolerance and leading to the accumulation of autoreactive B cells (Menard2011The). In T1D, the R620W mutation results in decreased T cell receptor signaling and impaired removal of autoreactive B cells, contributing to autoimmunity (Sharp2015Genetic). In Crohn's disease, the mutation has an opposite effect, with reduced PTPN22 expression in intestinal tissues, affecting intracellular signaling and increasing the secretion of Th17-related inflammatory mediators (Sharp2015Genetic).

The PTPN22 gene also plays a role in regulating immune responses in myeloid cells, influencing cytokine production and macrophage function. Disease-associated mutations can enhance phagocytosis and modulate macrophage function, affecting processes like cytoskeleton rearrangement and migration (Tizaoui2021The). The PTPN22*W variant is protective against certain diseases like Crohn's disease but promotes others, such as SLE, by enhancing toll-like receptor signaling and IFN production (Tizaoui2021The). These genetic variations contribute to the genetic susceptibility of many autoimmune diseases, with differential effects on innate and adaptive immune responses (Tizaoui2021The).

## Interactions
PTPN22, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, is involved in several critical interactions that regulate immune signaling. It interacts with end-binding protein 1 (EB1) through its P1 domain, which is essential for binding. This interaction regulates the phosphorylation of EB1 at the Y247 site, influencing T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways. The interaction affects the expression of T cell activation markers such as CD25 and CD69, and the phosphorylation of signaling molecules like ZAP-70, LAT, and Erk, ultimately leading to the activation of NFAT transcription factors and IL-2 secretion (Zhang2018PTPN22).

PTPN22 also interacts with C-terminal Src kinase (CSK), a relationship modulated by the phosphorylation of PTPN22 at Serine 751. This phosphorylation enhances the interaction with CSK, preventing PTPN22 from being recruited to the plasma membrane where its substrates, LCK and ZAP70, are located. This interaction acts as a molecular rheostat for the inhibition of TCR signaling (Yang2020PTPN22).

Additionally, PTPN22 interacts with the NLRP3 inflammasome, where it dephosphorylates NLRP3 at Tyr861, controlling its activity. This interaction is crucial for physiological inflammasome activation, affecting IL-1β secretion and immune responses (Spalinger2023NLRP3).
