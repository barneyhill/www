# FAM3D

## Overview
FAM3D is a gene that encodes the protein FAM3 metabolism regulating signaling molecule D, which is part of the FAM3 gene family. This protein is primarily involved in maintaining colon homeostasis and plays a significant role in host defense mechanisms against inflammation-associated carcinogenesis. FAM3D is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the colon, where it contributes to the integrity of the colonic mucosa and regulates epithelial cell proliferation. Functionally, the protein acts as a chemotactic agonist for G-protein coupled receptors FPR1 and FPR2, implicating it in proinflammatory signaling pathways. Its interactions with these receptors are crucial for regulating phospholipase D activity and phosphatidic acid production, which are important for downstream signaling. The expression of FAM3D is notably higher in normal colon tissues compared to colorectal cancer tissues, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor. Alterations in FAM3D expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Nan2022DLGAP1AS2Mediated; Liang2020FAM3D).

## Function
FAM3D is a gene that encodes a protein involved in maintaining colon homeostasis and host defense against inflammation-associated carcinogenesis. It is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the colon, where it plays a crucial role in preserving the integrity of the colonic mucosa and regulating epithelial cell proliferation. FAM3D supports the production of antimicrobial peptides, which are essential for maintaining a balanced gut microbiome and protecting against pathogenic bacteria (Liang2020FAM3D).

The protein encoded by FAM3D is a host-derived chemotactic agonist for G-protein coupled receptors FPR1 and FPR2, indicating its involvement in proinflammatory signaling pathways (Liang2020FAM3D). In healthy cells, FAM3D is constitutively expressed in epithelial cells, especially in the villus and crypt regions of the colon, suggesting its role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the colonic epithelium (Liang2020FAM3D).

FAM3D's expression is higher in normal colon tissues compared to colorectal cancer tissues, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor. Its deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to colitis and cancer, highlighting its importance in protecting against inflammation-associated tumorigenesis (Liang2020FAM3D).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FAM3D gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions, particularly in the context of cancer and inflammatory diseases. In thyroid cancer, FAM3D mRNA expression is significantly upregulated in papillary carcinoma tissues compared to normal thyroid tissues. This upregulation is associated with shorter overall survival in patients, suggesting a potential prognostic value for FAM3D mRNA levels in thyroid cancer (Ma2020Identification).

In colorectal cancer, FAM3D expression is higher in normal colon tissues compared to cancerous tissues, indicating its role as an anti-cancer molecule. The deficiency of FAM3D in mice leads to impaired mucosal barrier function and increased susceptibility to colitis and carcinogenesis, highlighting its protective role against inflammation-associated cancer (Liang2020FAM3D).

FAM3D also plays a role in maintaining colon homeostasis and protecting against inflammation-associated carcinogenesis. Fam3D-deficient mice exhibit increased spontaneous colitis, global inflammation, and a higher incidence of cancer, suggesting that FAM3D is crucial for maintaining gut health and preventing cancer progression (Liang2020FAM3D). These findings underscore the clinical significance of FAM3D in cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
FAM3D, a member of the FAM3 gene family, is known to interact with formyl peptide receptors FPR1 and FPR2, which are Gαi protein-coupled receptors. These interactions have been confirmed through binding assays, demonstrating that FAM3D acts as a ligand for these receptors, with a higher affinity for FPR1 (Nan2022DLGAP1AS2Mediated). The binding of FAM3D to FPR1 and FPR2 plays a crucial role in regulating phospholipase D (PLD) activity and phosphatidic acid (PA) production, which are important for downstream signaling pathways (Nan2022DLGAP1AS2Mediated).

FAM3D is also involved in the regulation of chemoresistance in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. It acts as a downstream target of DLGAP1 antisense RNA 2 (D-AS2), mediating its effects on cell cycle progression and chemoresistance. The interaction between FAM3D and D-AS2 influences the transcriptional regulation of FAM3D, affecting its secretion and subsequent signaling activities (Nan2022DLGAP1AS2Mediated).

These interactions highlight the role of FAM3D in cellular signaling and its potential impact on cancer progression and treatment resistance.
