# RUNDC3B

## Overview
The RUNDC3B gene encodes the RUN domain containing 3B protein, which is a member of the RUN domain-containing protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a RUN domain, which is implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization. Although the precise biological functions of RUNDC3B are not fully elucidated, it is believed to play a role in intracellular signaling pathways. The RUNDC3B protein is involved in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which has been associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to fully understand the functional implications of RUNDC3B in human health and disease.
