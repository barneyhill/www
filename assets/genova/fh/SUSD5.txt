# SUSD5

## Overview
SUSD5 is a gene that encodes the protein sushi domain containing 5, which is characterized by the presence of sushi domains, also known as complement control protein (CCP) modules. These domains are typically involved in the regulation of immune responses, cell adhesion, and signaling pathways. The SUSD5 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in mediating protein-protein interactions. These interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring appropriate immune responses. Although the full spectrum of SUSD5's molecular activities is not completely understood, its involvement in cell adhesion and immune modulation suggests it plays a significant role in maintaining tissue integrity and organismal health.

## Structure


## Function
SUSD5 (sushi domain containing 5) encodes a protein that is involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in protein-protein interactions. The protein contains sushi domains, also known as complement control protein (CCP) modules, which are typically associated with the regulation of immune responses, cell adhesion, and signaling pathways. These domains facilitate interactions with other proteins, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and overall organismal health.

In healthy human cells, SUSD5 may play a crucial role in modulating the immune response. By participating in protein-protein interactions, it potentially influences the activity of immune cells, ensuring that the immune system responds appropriately to pathogens while avoiding excessive or misdirected responses that could lead to autoimmunity. Additionally, SUSD5's involvement in cell adhesion suggests it may help maintain the structural integrity of tissues by mediating the attachment of cells to each other or to the extracellular matrix.

The precise molecular activities of SUSD5 within the cell are not fully elucidated, but its presence in various cellular compartments suggests it may be active in multiple signaling pathways. This activity is essential for coordinating complex cellular functions that are critical for maintaining the health and stability of the organism.
