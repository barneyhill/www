# SAP18

## Overview
SAP18 is a gene that encodes the Sin3A associated protein 18, a crucial component of the Sin3A corepressor complex involved in transcriptional repression. The protein encoded by SAP18 functions primarily as an adaptor, facilitating interactions between the Sin3-HDAC complex and various transcription factors, thereby modulating chromatin structure and gene expression. Structurally, Sin3A associated protein 18 is characterized by a ubiquitin-like fold, which is essential for its role in protein-protein interactions and complex assembly (McCallum2006Structure; Singh2010Human). This protein is also a part of the apoptosis-and splicing-associated protein (ASAP) complex, indicating its involvement in RNA processing and splicing regulation (Singh2010Human). SAP18's interactions extend to various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, and its dysregulation has been implicated in cancer and viral oncogenesis (Ding2019Suppression; Grzenda2009Sin3:).

## Structure
SAP18 is characterized by a ubiquitin-like fold, which is crucial for its function in protein-protein interactions and complex assembly. This fold includes a β-grasp domain, a structural motif that is more conserved than its sequence, and is similar to other ubiquitin-related molecules like SUMO and Nedd8 (McCallum2006Structure; Singh2010Human). The SAP18 structure features a mostly antiparallel five-stranded β-sheet surrounding a central α-helix, with unique loop insertions that contribute to its flexibility and interaction capabilities (McCallum2006Structure; Singh2010Human).

The protein has chain extensions beyond the ubiquitin fold at the N and C termini, similar to proteins like SUMO and Elongin B (McCallum2006Structure). These structural features allow SAP18 to function as a protein-protein adapter, bridging transcription factors with the Sin3-HDAC complex, and facilitating transcriptional repression (McCallum2006Structure).

Mutations in key residues within the ubiquitin-like fold, such as Asp118 and Thr121, disrupt its structural integrity and impair its splicing regulatory activity, highlighting the importance of this fold for SAP18's function (Singh2010Human). The protein's interaction with other components of the ASAP complex, such as RNPS1 and Acinus, is essential for its role in splicing regulation (Singh2010Human).

## Function
SAP18 (Sin3A associated protein 18) is a component of the Sin3A corepressor complex, which plays a crucial role in transcriptional repression by modifying chromatin structure. It functions by interacting with histone deacetylases (HDACs), such as HDAC1, to enhance their enzymatic activity and stabilize their interaction with the Sin3 complex (Grzenda2009Sin3:). SAP18 acts as an adaptor protein, bridging interacting proteins and the Sin3/HDAC complex, thereby extending the flexibility and specificity of the complex to interface with DNA-binding transcriptional repressors and other regulatory proteins (Grzenda2009Sin3:).

In healthy cells, SAP18 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. It is active in the nucleus, where it assists in gene silencing by tethering the Sin3/HDAC complex to promoters through interactions with sequence-specific DNA binding proteins (Sheeba2007Chick). SAP18 is also part of the ASAP complex, which includes an RNA-binding protein and a caspase, suggesting a role in RNA processing (Grzenda2009Sin3:). The protein's interactions with other molecular machinery allow it to contribute to distinct regulatory roles, although the precise functions in non-cancerous contexts remain largely unknown (Grzenda2009Sin3:).

## Clinical Significance
SAP18, a component of the Sin3A corepressor complex, plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation, and its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases. In cancer, SAP18's interaction with the compound A671 has been shown to downregulate SIRT3, leading to apoptosis in certain cancer cells, including T-cell lymphoma and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (BCALL). This suggests that SAP18 expression levels could serve as a biomarker for responsiveness to A671 treatment (Gajendran2020A). The SAP18/SIRT3 regulatory axis is particularly relevant in hematopoietic malignancies, where alterations in SAP18 expression or its interaction with other proteins could impact cancer therapy outcomes (Gajendran2020A).

In the context of viral oncogenesis, SAP18 is involved in the regulation of endothelial cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. The viral FLICE-inhibitory protein (vFLIP) associated with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) promotes the degradation of SAP18 through the TRIM56-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, enhancing these processes. This interaction is crucial for the pro-angiogenic effects of vFLIP, suggesting that SAP18 downregulation plays a role in cancer progression related to viral infections (Ding2019Suppression). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SAP18 in cancer and viral oncogenesis.

## Interactions
SAP18 (Sin3A associated protein 18) is a component of the Sin3A corepressor complex, which plays a significant role in transcriptional repression. It interacts with various proteins, including histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, facilitating chromatin remodeling and gene silencing. SAP18 acts as a protein-protein adapter module, bridging the Sin3-HDAC complex to transcription factors such as Gli, GAGA, and Bicoid, which are involved in transcriptional repression (McCallum2006Structure).

SAP18 is also part of the apoptosis-and splicing-associated protein (ASAP) complex, interacting with RNPS1 and Acinus to modulate splicing regulation. Despite lacking typical splicing regulatory motifs, SAP18's ubiquitin-like fold allows it to assemble a nuclear speckle-localized splicing regulatory multiprotein complex (Singh2010Human).

In the context of cancer, SAP18 interacts with the compound A671, which stabilizes SAP18 and enhances its inhibitory effect on the SIN3 complex, leading to transcriptional suppression of SIRT3. This interaction is crucial for the anti-cancer effects of A671 in T-cell lymphoma and erythroleukemia (Gajendran2020A).

SAP18 also interacts with TRIM56, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which promotes its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction is significant in the context of KSHV infection, where SAP18 downregulation promotes endothelial cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis (Ding2019Suppression).
