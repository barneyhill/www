# PCDH18

## Overview
Protocadherin 18 (PCDH18) is a gene that encodes a member of the δ-protocadherin subfamily, which is part of the larger cadherin superfamily known for mediating cell-cell adhesion. The protein encoded by PCDH18, protocadherin-18, is characterized as a transmembrane protein with six extracellular cadherin repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. It plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including immune response modulation and neural development. In the immune system, protocadherin-18 functions as an inhibitory signaling receptor in CD8+ effector memory T cells, interacting with key signaling molecules to regulate T cell activity (VazquezCintron2012Protocadherin18). Additionally, it is involved in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, acting as a tumor suppressor in certain cancers such as colorectal cancer (Zhou2017PCDH18). The expression and function of PCDH18 are subject to regulation by epigenetic mechanisms, and its dysregulation has been implicated in the progression of various cancers (Hayashi2017Sporadic).

## Structure
Protocadherin 18 (PCDH18) is a member of the δ-protocadherin subfamily, characterized by its involvement in cell-cell adhesion. The primary structure of PCDH18 includes a sequence of amino acids that form a protein with six extracellular cadherin repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (Redies2005δProtocadherins:; Kubota2008Expression). The secondary structure likely consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of cadherin domains, although specific details are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure of PCDH18 involves the three-dimensional folding of its extracellular cadherin domains, which are stabilized by calcium ions, a common feature in the cadherin family (Harrison2020Familywide). The quaternary structure includes the formation of antiparallel trans dimers, which are stabilized by specific domain interactions and calcium ions (Harrison2020Familywide).

PCDH18 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may affect its stability and function (Harrison2020Familywide). The protein also contains conserved motifs in its cytoplasmic domain, such as CM1 and CM2, which are characteristic of the δ2-protocadherins (Redies2005δProtocadherins:). Splice variants of PCDH18 may exist, leading to different isoforms with distinct functional properties (Redies2005δProtocadherins:).

## Function
Protocadherin-18 (PCDH18) is a cell surface adhesion molecule primarily expressed in CD8+ effector memory T cells, where it plays a significant role in modulating immune responses. PCDH18 interacts with the kinase p56 lck, a critical component of the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, and this interaction is essential for its function as an inhibitory signaling receptor. This interaction leads to the inhibition of ZAP70 activation, resulting in defective cytokine secretion, cytolysis, and enhanced activation-induced cell death (AICD) in these T cells (VazquezCintron2012Protocadherin18).

In the context of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), PCDH18 expression is associated with the regulation of effector-phase functions, including the modulation of cell survival and cytokine production. Blocking PCDH18 can enhance T cell viability and recovery, suggesting its role in restraining T cell function, similar to other inhibitory receptors like PD-1 (Frey2017The). PCDH18 is also expressed in the embryonic brain, where it functions as a patterning receptor and localizes to the neuronal synapse, indicating its involvement in neural development and synaptic plasticity (Frey2017The).

## Clinical Significance
PCDH18 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and mutations. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PCDH18 expression is significantly lower in EpCAM-positive cells compared to EpCAM-negative ones. Although no mutations were detected in EpCAM-positive cell lines, somatic mutations in PCDH18 were found in 5.3% of HCC samples, with a higher frequency in EpCAM-positive cases. This suggests that PCDH18 suppression may contribute to the EpCAM-positive HCC phenotype, influencing cell proliferation and tumor behavior (Hayashi2017Sporadic).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), PCDH18 is frequently inactivated by promoter methylation, leading to its downregulation. This epigenetic alteration is associated with increased cell viability, colony formation, and migration, indicating that PCDH18 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. The methylation status of PCDH18 is significantly higher in CRC tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and its expression can be restored through demethylation treatment, which suppresses cancer cell growth and migration. PCDH18 is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and its inactivation may contribute to CRC progression (Zhou2017PCDH18).

PCDH18 also plays a role in immune regulation, acting as an inhibitory signaling receptor in CD8+ effector memory T cells, potentially affecting immune responses in cancer (VazquezCintron2012Protocadherin18).

## Interactions
PCDH18, a member of the protocadherin family, participates in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In the context of colorectal cancer, PCDH18 interacts with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction is suggested to negatively regulate the pathway, as suppression of PCDH18 leads to increased levels of active β-catenin and its nuclear accumulation (Zhou2017PCDH18).

In the immune system, PCDH18 acts as an inhibitory signaling receptor in CD8+ effector memory T cells. It interacts with the protein p56 lck, which is crucial for T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. This interaction results in a failure to activate ZAP70, leading to deficient effector phase function in activated memory cells (VazquezCintron2012Protocadherin18). PCDH18's role as an inhibitory receptor is further supported by its interaction with p56 lck in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, where it blocks Zap70 activation and abrogates lytic function (Frey2017The).

Structural studies have shown that PCDH18, as part of the δ-protocadherin family, primarily engages in homophilic interactions, although weak heterophilic interactions with other protocadherins like PCDH12 and PCDH17 have been observed (Harrison2020Familywide).
