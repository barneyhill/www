# FCN3

## Overview
The FCN3 gene encodes ficolin-3, a soluble pattern recognition molecule that plays a pivotal role in the innate immune system. Ficolin-3 is a multimeric protein that belongs to the ficolin family, characterized by its collagen-like and fibrinogen-like domains, which enable it to bind to specific carbohydrate structures on the surface of pathogens. This binding is crucial for the activation of the lectin pathway of the complement system, facilitating immune responses such as phagocytosis and inflammation (Garred2009The; MuntheFog2009Immunodeficiency). The FCN3 gene is expressed predominantly in the liver and lungs, with its protein product circulating in the serum at varying concentrations (Garred2009The). Mutations in FCN3, such as the +1637delC frameshift mutation, can lead to ficolin-3 deficiency, resulting in increased susceptibility to infections due to impaired complement activation (MuntheFog2009Immunodeficiency).

## Structure
Ficolin-3, encoded by the FCN3 gene, is a multimeric protein composed of 299 amino acids. Its structure includes an N-terminal domain with cysteine residues, a collagen-like domain with Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like binding (FBG) domain. The FBG domain is crucial for binding negatively charged carbohydrates, such as N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and plays a role in innate immunity (Garred2009The). Ficolin-3 forms higher-order oligomers composed of trimers linked by disulfide bonds, assembling into trimer-based hexamers to become functional (MuntheFog2009Immunodeficiency).

The protein shows a single band of 35 kDa under reducing conditions on SDS-PAGE analysis, indicating it exists as a large homo-polymer in serum (MuntheFog2008Characterization). Ficolin-3 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two transcript variants, with variant 2 lacking exon 4 compared to variant 1, leading to a shorter protein (MuntheFog2008Characterization). The protein is expressed in ciliated bronchial epithelial cells, bile duct epithelial cells, and hepatocytes, with higher expression levels in the lung compared to the liver (MuntheFog2008Characterization). A specific polymorphism, FCN3 + 1637delC, causes a reading frame shift, leading to a truncated protein and potential Ficolin-3 deficiency (MuntheFog2008Characterization).

## Function
Ficolin-3, encoded by the FCN3 gene, is a recognition molecule in the lectin pathway of the complement system, which is part of the innate immune response. It is primarily expressed in the liver and lung, with lower levels in other tissues such as the heart, kidney, spleen, pancreas, and placenta (Garred2009The). Ficolin-3 oligomerizes into trimer-based hexamers to form a functional molecule, which includes several domains: a signal peptide, an N-terminal cysteine-rich region, a collagen-like domain, a short linker region, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain (MuntheFog2009Immunodeficiency).

In healthy individuals, ficolin-3 is present in serum at varying concentrations, with a median of 25 to 27.5 μg per milliliter (Garred2009The; MuntheFog2009Immunodeficiency). It binds to acetylated compounds and sugars, facilitating the deposition of complement component C4, which is crucial for complement activation (MuntheFog2009Immunodeficiency). This process enhances phagocytosis and inflammation, contributing to the immune defense against pathogens (Garred2009The). Ficolin-3 also plays a role in the sequestration and removal of dying host cells, further supporting tissue homeostasis and immune function (MuntheFog2009Immunodeficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FCN3 gene, particularly the +1637delC frameshift mutation, lead to a deficiency in ficolin-3, a protein crucial for the lectin pathway of the complement system. This deficiency is associated with immunodeficiency, as evidenced by a homozygous patient who experienced recurrent infections and had undetectable serum levels of ficolin-3. The mutation results in impaired complement activation, which is essential for an effective immune response (MuntheFog2009Immunodeficiency).

The FCN3 +1637delC variant is rare, with a gene frequency of 0.01-0.02, and has a gene-dose-dependent effect on ficolin-3 serum levels. Homozygous individuals have no detectable ficolin-3, leading to increased susceptibility to infections and potentially other morbidities such as invasive necrotizing enterocolitis and perinatal infections (Bjarnadottir2016Frequency).

Alterations in FCN3 expression levels have also been linked to other conditions. For instance, high serum levels of ficolin-3 are associated with inflammation in diseases like diabetic retinopathy and rheumatic heart disease, suggesting a role in immune evasion by pathogens such as Streptococcus pyogenes (Gomaa2021The).

## Interactions
Ficolin-3, encoded by the FCN3 gene, is a recognition molecule in the lectin pathway of the complement system. It primarily interacts with mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs), specifically MASP-1 and MASP-2, to activate the complement system. These interactions are crucial for complement activation, which is a part of the innate immune response (Garred2009The; MuntheFog2009Immunodeficiency).

Ficolin-3 forms large multimeric structures that facilitate its interaction with cellular receptors. It is involved in binding to surface structures of microorganisms and acetylated compounds, which aids in the sequestration and removal of dying host cells (MuntheFog2009Immunodeficiency). The protein-protein interaction network analysis using STRING has identified potential interactions of FCN3 with neighboring genes such as MASP1, MASP2, MBL2, C1QA, C1R, CRP, and C2. These interactions are associated with complement activation, humoral immune response, clearance of apoptotic cells, phagocytosis, and immunoglobulin-mediated immune response (Sun2022Comprehensive).

A frameshift mutation in the FCN3 gene can lead to a deficiency in ficolin-3, affecting its ability to participate in complement activation, which underscores the importance of its interactions in immune function (MuntheFog2009Immunodeficiency).
