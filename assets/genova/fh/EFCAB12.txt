# EFCAB12

## Overview
EFCAB12 is a gene that encodes the EF-hand calcium binding domain 12 protein, which is categorized as a calcium-binding protein. This protein is characterized by the presence of an EF-hand motif, a structural domain that facilitates calcium ion binding, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling processes, particularly within the nervous system. The EF-hand calcium binding domain 12 protein is predominantly expressed in neuronal soma and synapses, implicating its involvement in neurodevelopmental processes and calcium-dependent pathways. While the specific functions of EFCAB12 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, its expression pattern suggests a significant role in modulating neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. Mutations in the EFCAB12 gene have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders and systemic anomalies, underscoring its potential clinical significance (Kelemen2021New; Khan2024Biallelic).

## Function
EFCAB12 is a calcium-binding protein that plays a role in cellular signaling processes, particularly in the brain. It is strongly expressed in the soma and synapse of neurons, indicating its involvement in neurodevelopmental processes (Khan2024Biallelic). The protein contains an EF-hand motif, a helix-loop-helix structural domain that binds calcium ions, which is crucial for various cellular functions such as neurotransmitter release and signal transduction (Kelemen2021New).

In the context of cellular biology, EFCAB12 is involved in calcium ion binding, a critical process for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. Calcium-binding proteins like EFCAB12 are essential for buffering calcium ions and regulating intracellular calcium levels, which are vital for processes such as synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability (Kelemen2021New). Although specific functions of EFCAB12 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its expression in the brain suggests a role in modulating calcium-dependent pathways that impact neurodevelopment and possibly other calcium-mediated cellular processes (Khan2024Biallelic).

In studies involving TFAM depletion in cancer cell lines, EFCAB12 was upregulated, but its knockdown did not significantly alter cell morphology or proliferation, suggesting that its role may be context-dependent and not directly involved in these processes under the conditions tested (Lee2017Transcriptomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EFCAB12 gene have been associated with several neurodevelopmental and systemic conditions. In a study involving Pakistani families, a homozygous variant in EFCAB12 was identified in a family with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The affected child exhibited mild to moderate ASD and progressive visual impairment, suggesting a potential link between EFCAB12 mutations and these conditions (Khan2024Biallelic). Another study found a loss-of-function variant in EFCAB12 in a patient with a unilateral kidney anomaly and extrarenal symptoms, including neurodevelopmental delay, epilepsy, and corpus callosum abnormalities, indicating that EFCAB12 mutations may contribute to broader neurodevelopmental issues and systemic anomalies (Khan2024Biallelic).

Additionally, a single nucleotide variant (SNV) in EFCAB12 was suggestively associated with large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke, a subtype of ischemic stroke. Although this association did not reach statistical significance after correction, it points to a potential link between EFCAB12 mutations and increased stroke risk (Söderholm2016Exome). These findings highlight the need for further research to confirm the clinical implications of EFCAB12 mutations and their role in various diseases.
