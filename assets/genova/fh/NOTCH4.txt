# NOTCH4

## Overview
NOTCH4 is a gene that encodes the protein notch receptor 4, a member of the Notch receptor family, which plays a pivotal role in cell signaling pathways. This transmembrane receptor is integral to processes such as angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, and vascular development. The NOTCH4 gene is characterized by its complex structure, including motifs like epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and Ankyrin repeats, which are crucial for its function in receptor-ligand interactions and intracellular signaling (Li1998Cloning; Sugaya1997Gene). The protein encoded by NOTCH4 is involved in regulating cell fate decisions, particularly in endothelial and hematopoietic cells, by modulating gene expression in response to extracellular signals (Leong2002Activated; Vercauteren2004Constitutively). Alterations in the NOTCH4 gene have been linked to various diseases, including systemic sclerosis and tuberculosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Fang2023Polymorphisms; Cardinale2016Association).

## Structure
The NOTCH4 protein is a member of the Notch receptor family and is characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of NOTCH4 includes 2003 amino acids, with significant motifs such as 29 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, 3 Notch/lin-12 repeats, a transmembrane region, 6 cdc10/Ankyrin repeats, and a PEST domain (Li1998Cloning; Sugaya1997Gene). The EGF-like repeats are involved in receptor-ligand interactions, while the cdc10/Ankyrin repeats and PEST domain are associated with cytoplasmic and nuclear functions (Li1998Cloning).

The secondary structure of NOTCH4 features beta-sheets within the EGF-like repeats, contributing to its extracellular domain's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a specific three-dimensional conformation, essential for its role as a cell surface receptor. The quaternary structure may involve interactions with ligands or other proteins, facilitating signal transduction.

Post-translational modifications of NOTCH4 include glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage, which are crucial for its activation and function. The gene also produces splice variant isoforms, such as NOTCH4(L) and NOTCH4(S), with the latter containing the entire coding sequence (Li1998Cloning). These isoforms may have distinct roles in cellular processes, including proliferation and differentiation (Li1998Cloning).

## Function
NOTCH4, a member of the Notch receptor family, plays a significant role in cell signaling pathways that regulate cell fate decisions, particularly in endothelial cells. It is primarily involved in angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation. Activated NOTCH4 inhibits endothelial sprouting and VEGF-induced angiogenesis by promoting β1-integrin-mediated adhesion to the extracellular matrix, specifically collagen. This increased adhesion is due to β1-integrins being in a high-affinity, active conformation, which inhibits endothelial cell migration through collagen (Leong2002Activated).

In the context of hematopoiesis, NOTCH4 is expressed in human marrow cells, particularly in primitive CD34+ CD38- cells. It plays a role in maintaining hematopoietic progenitor cells by inhibiting differentiation and promoting self-renewal. Overexpression of constitutively active NOTCH4 in these cells results in reduced colony formation and short-term proliferation, affecting erythroid and myelomonocytic lineages. This suggests that NOTCH4 signaling enhances the repopulating ability of hematopoietic cells and maintains progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state (Vercauteren2004Constitutively).

NOTCH4 is active in the cell membrane, where it interacts with ligands to influence gene expression, playing a crucial role in vascular development and homeostasis (Fukusumi2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NOTCH4 gene have been implicated in several diseases. A rare missense variant in the NOTCH4 gene has been associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc), a condition characterized by microvascular and immune dysfunction. This variant, identified in a family with a history of SSc, suggests an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern and may contribute to the disease's pathogenesis by affecting vascular integrity (Cardinale2016Association).

In tuberculosis (TB), polymorphisms in the NOTCH4 gene, such as rs422951 and rs206018, have been linked to susceptibility. The G allele of rs422951 is associated with a protective effect against TB, while the C allele of rs206018 correlates with increased NOTCH4 expression and disease severity (Fang2023Polymorphisms).

Altered NOTCH4 expression is also observed in Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), a congenital heart defect. In ToF patients, hypermethylation of the NOTCH4 promoter region leads to reduced gene expression, potentially contributing to the disease's development (Zhu2020Methylation). These findings highlight the gene's role in various pathologies through mutations, expression changes, and epigenetic modifications.

## Interactions
NOTCH4 interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. The Notch4 intracellular domain (NIC4) forms complexes with nucleolar proteins such as Nucleolin (NCL) and Nucleophosmin (NPM), which are crucial for its anti-apoptotic function in response to genotoxic stressors. These interactions are specific, as NIC4 does not form complexes with Fibrillarin (FBL) (Saini2020Nucleolar). NIC4's interaction with NCL is particularly important for its localization and function in the nucleolus, which is essential for protecting cells from genomic damage (Saini2020Nucleolar).

In the context of TGF-β signaling, NIC4 can bind to Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, with a higher affinity for Smad3. This interaction inhibits TGF-β signaling, affecting cellular responses such as growth inhibition in mammary epithelial cells (Sun2005Notch4). Notch4 also interacts with Elongin C, which regulates its activity by promoting polyubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome, thus modulating Notch4's transcriptional activity (Cummins2011Elongin).

In hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, Notch4 interacts with proteins involved in the ERK, JNK, and P38 MAPK signaling pathways, promoting cell proliferation and migration while inhibiting apoptosis (Guo2022Notch4). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of NOTCH4 in cellular processes and its potential impact on various diseases.
