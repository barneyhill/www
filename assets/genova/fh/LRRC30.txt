# LRRC30

## Overview
The LRRC30 gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat-containing 30 protein, which is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the LRRC30 protein may play a role in cellular signaling or structural organization. While the specific biological functions of the LRRC30 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes has been suggested. The gene has been associated with conditions such as autism, hypertension, and certain cancers, indicating its potential significance in human health and disease (Kim2022Lifestage; Zarrei2018De; wang2019comprehensive; Cody2018Chromosome).

## Clinical Significance
The LRRC30 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions through its genetic variations and expression alterations. Hemizygosity of LRRC30 has been associated with an increased risk of autism, suggesting its role as a polygenic risk factor in the condition. This association is supported by the observation of more frequent hemizygosity in individuals with autism compared to those without, although deletions and duplications of LRRC30 have also been found in healthy individuals, indicating that its impact may depend on interactions with other genetic or environmental factors (Cody2018Chromosome).

In the context of metabolic disorders, LRRC30 has been linked to hypertension, particularly in females, with significant associations found in genetic studies (Kim2022Lifestage). The gene's role in hypertension may be influenced by hormonal changes, such as those occurring during menopause.

LRRC30 has also been identified as a candidate biomarker for ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma prognosis, highlighting its potential involvement in cancer through dysregulated gene expression (wang2019comprehensive). Additionally, a de novo duplication involving LRRC30 has been observed in a case of hemiplegic cerebral palsy, although its pathogenic significance remains uncertain (Zarrei2018De).
