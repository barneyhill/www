# CFAP161

## Overview
CFAP161 is a gene that encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 161, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of motile cilia and flagella. This protein is primarily associated with the axoneme, the central structural component of cilia and flagella, and is involved in microtubule stabilization and ciliary A-tubule regulation (Beckers2021The). CFAP161 is expressed in tissues with motile cilia, regulated by the transcription factor FOXJ1, and interacts with proteins such as KIAA0556 to maintain ciliary structure (Beckers2021The). Despite its involvement in ciliary architecture, studies in model organisms like mice and Xenopus indicate that CFAP161 is not essential for motile ciliary function, suggesting potential roles beyond ciliary motility (Beckers2021The). The gene's location on chromosome 15q has been linked to Kartagener syndrome, a form of primary ciliary dyskinesia, although its direct clinical significance in humans requires further investigation (Beckers2021The).

## Function
CFAP161 (cilia and flagella associated protein 161) is a protein involved in the structure and function of motile cilia and flagella, which are essential for various cellular processes, including movement and fluid flow. In healthy human cells, CFAP161 is associated with the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, contributing to their stability and function (Beckers2021The). The protein is a target of the transcription factor FOXJ1, which regulates its expression in tissues with motile cilia (Beckers2021The).

CFAP161 localizes to specific regions within cilia, such as the basal bodies in Xenopus and the axoneme in mice, excluding the cilium tip (Beckers2021The). It interacts with other proteins involved in microtubule stabilization and ciliary A-tubule regulation, such as KIAA0556, indicating a role in maintaining ciliary structure (Beckers2021The). Despite its association with ciliary structures, studies in model organisms like mice and Xenopus suggest that CFAP161 is dispensable for motile ciliary function, as its disruption does not lead to significant cilia-related phenotypes (Beckers2021The). This indicates that CFAP161 may have roles beyond ciliary motility, potentially involving microtubule-related processes (Beckers2021The).

## Clinical Significance
CFAP161, also known as cilia and flagella associated protein 161, has been studied for its potential role in various conditions related to ciliary dysfunction. Despite its evolutionary conservation and expression in cells with motile cilia, studies in mice and Xenopus have shown that CFAP161 is dispensable for motile ciliary function, as no significant cilia-related phenotypes were observed when the gene was disrupted (Beckers2021The). This suggests that CFAP161 mutations may not directly lead to ciliary dysfunction in these models.

However, CFAP161 is located on chromosome 15q in the linkage region of Kartagener syndrome, a subtype of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), which is characterized by situs randomization, impaired mucociliary clearance, respiratory problems, and male infertility (Beckers2021The). In zebrafish, knockdown of CFAP161 led to ciliopathy phenotypes, including left-right asymmetry defects, although these were not observed in mouse and Xenopus models (Beckers2021The).

Additionally, prenatal exposure to phthalates has been associated with hypomethylation of CFAP161, which may have implications for reproductive health and conditions like PCD (Solomon2017Prenatal). Despite these associations, the direct clinical significance of CFAP161 mutations in humans remains to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
CFAP161 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cilia and flagella function. It is a component of motile cilia, co-localizing with acetylated-α-tubulin in tissues such as the nasal respiratory epithelium and spermatozoa flagellum (Beckers2021The). CFAP161 interacts with KIAA0556, also known as Katanin-interacting protein KATNIP, a basal body protein that stabilizes cytoplasmic microtubules and regulates ciliary A-tubule number. This interaction was validated using yeast two-hybrid analysis, suggesting a role for CFAP161 in microtubule organization or function (Beckers2021The).

In the context of sperm axonemes, CFAP161 is part of complexes that anchor Tektin filaments onto the tubulin wall, contributing to the structural stability of the doublet microtubule architecture. It mediates interactions between Tektin bundles and the tubulin wall, preventing the Tektin bundle from tearing apart under stress (Tai2023Incell). Despite these interactions, CFAP161 disruption in mice and Xenopus does not result in motile cilia-related phenotypes, suggesting potential genetic compensation mechanisms (Beckers2021The). There is no evidence of CFAP161 interacting with nucleic acids in the provided context.
