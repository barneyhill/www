# TBC1D3I

## Overview
TBC1D3I is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 3I, which is part of the TBC1 domain family. This family is characterized by the presence of a TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain, which is typically involved in the regulation of small GTPases, particularly those of the Rab family. Proteins in this family often function as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), playing crucial roles in intracellular trafficking and signal transduction pathways. The TBC1D3I protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including the modulation of endocytic pathways and the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. Its precise biological functions and mechanisms of action are subjects of ongoing research, with potential implications for understanding certain pathological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
