# CR2

## Overview
The CR2 gene encodes the complement receptor type 2 (CD21), a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system. This receptor is primarily expressed on mature B lymphocytes and follicular dendritic cells, where it functions as a key component in the modulation of B cell activation and antibody production. The CR2 protein is characterized by its structure, which includes multiple short consensus repeats (SCRs) that facilitate its interaction with complement fragments such as C3d. These interactions are crucial for the formation of the B cell coreceptor complex, which enhances the signaling capacity of the B cell receptor (BCR) and contributes to immune regulation and self-tolerance (Ahearn1989Structure; Erdei2009Expression). Additionally, CR2 is involved in interactions with viral proteins, such as the Epstein-Barr virus glycoprotein, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Erdei2021New; Sarrias2001Kinetic).

## Structure
The human complement receptor 2 (CR2), also known as complement C3d receptor 2 or CD21, is a Type I transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of approximately 145 kDa. It is composed of 15 or 16 short consensus repeats (SCRs), which are 60-70-amino-acid protein modules, followed by a 28-amino-acid transmembrane domain and a 34-amino-acid intracytoplasmic tail (Hannan2002Structure). The SCRs, also known as complement control protein repeats, form the majority of the CR2 structure and are crucial for ligand binding, particularly with C3d (Szakonyi2001Structure).

The CR2 protein's tertiary structure is characterized by a V-shaped conformation formed by the SCR domains, with a hydrophobic interface between SCR1 and SCR2 (van2011A). This structure facilitates the interaction with the globular C3d ligand, primarily involving SCR1 (van2011A). CR2 can dimerize through SCR1-SCR1 contacts, although it behaves as a monomer in solution (Szakonyi2001Structure).

CR2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which can affect its function and stability (Hannan2002Structure). Alternative splicing of the CR2 gene results in different isoforms, with variations in the number of SCRs, influencing its functional properties (Hannan2002Structure).

## Function
The CR2 gene encodes the complement receptor type 2 (CD21), a protein primarily expressed on mature B lymphocytes and follicular dendritic cells. In healthy human cells, CR2 plays a significant role in the immune system by binding to complement fragments such as C3d, which are covalently attached to antigens and immune complexes. This interaction is crucial for modulating B cell activation and antibody production (Ahearn1989Structure; Erdei2009Expression).

CR2 is involved in the formation of the B cell coreceptor complex, which includes CD19 and CD81, and is essential for lowering the threshold for B cell activation by the antigen receptor. This complex enhances the signaling capacity of the B cell receptor (BCR), promoting antigen processing and presentation, and stabilizing the BCR in lipid rafts (Erdei2009Expression). CR2 also plays a role in targeting immune complexes to germinal centers in secondary lymphoid organs, which is vital for the development of a natural antibody repertoire and germinal center formation (Erdei2009Expression).

In addition to its role in B cell activation, CR2 is involved in maintaining peripheral B cell tolerance by suppressing the response of autoreactive B lymphocytes, thereby contributing to immune regulation and self-tolerance (Kovács2021Revisiting).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CR2 gene have been implicated in several autoimmune diseases, notably systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In these conditions, CR2 expression on B cells is significantly reduced, correlating negatively with disease activity indices such as the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and the RA Disease Activity Score (DAS28). This reduction in CR2 expression is associated with increased severity of symptoms, suggesting that insufficient CR2 expression may contribute to the onset of B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases (Erdei2021New).

In the context of SLE, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the Cr2 gene in mice introduces a novel glycosylation site, resulting in higher molecular weight proteins. This polymorphism is located in the C3d binding domain, reducing ligand binding and receptor-mediated cell signaling, which may contribute to the development of SLE by affecting the loss of tolerance to chromatin (Boackle2001Cr2).

CR2 also plays a role in maintaining peripheral B cell tolerance. Its interaction with other molecules, such as CD19 and CD81, and its potential to inhibit TLR9-induced B cell activation, highlight its involvement in autoimmune disease pathogenesis (Erdei2021New).

## Interactions
Complement receptor 2 (CR2), also known as CD21, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. CR2 primarily interacts with the complement component C3d, forming a complex that is crucial for B cell activation. This interaction is characterized by hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces, with the SCR1-SCR2 domain of CR2 being essential for high-affinity binding to C3d (Hannan2002Structure; Szakonyi2001Structure). The CR2-C3d interface involves significant shape complementarity and a buried surface area of 1400 Å², with main-chain atoms playing a crucial role (Szakonyi2001Structure).

CR2 also interacts with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) glycoprotein gp350/220, following a simple 1:1 binding model, and competes with C3d for binding sites on CR2 (Sarrias2001Kinetic). Additionally, CR2 binds to CD23 and IFN-α, with overlapping but non-identical sites within the SCR1-2 domain (Hannan2002Structure).

CR2 can bind to various DNA fragments, including viral, bacterial, and mammalian DNA, in a dose-dependent manner. This interaction suggests that CR2 may act as a receptor for DNA, potentially playing a role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (Asokan2013Human).
