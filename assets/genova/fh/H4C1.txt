# H4C1

## Overview
H4C1 is a gene that encodes the protein H4 clustered histone 1, a core component of the nucleosome, which is essential for the structural organization of chromatin within the cell nucleus. As a member of the histone H4 family, this protein plays a pivotal role in DNA packaging, facilitating the compaction of DNA into chromatin fibers, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression. The protein is involved in key cellular processes such as DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation, which are vital for cell cycle progression and genomic integrity. H4 clustered histone 1 is subject to various post-translational modifications, including acetylation and methylation, which influence chromatin structure and function, thereby impacting gene expression and cellular responses to environmental signals (Lukauskas2024Decoding; Klaas2021Thrombospondin4).

## Function
H4C1 encodes histone H4, a core component of the nucleosome, which is essential for DNA packaging within the nucleus. Histone H4 plays a critical role in the structural organization of chromatin, facilitating the compaction of DNA into chromatin fibers. This compaction is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression. Histone H4 is involved in several key molecular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation. These processes are vital for cell cycle progression and the maintenance of genomic integrity (Klaas2021Thrombospondin4).

In the context of cell biology, histone H4 is integral to the formation of nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin. Each nucleosome consists of a segment of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer, which includes two molecules each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. This structure not only compacts DNA but also plays a role in regulating access to genetic information, thereby influencing gene expression patterns. The dynamic modification of histone H4, through processes such as acetylation and methylation, is a key mechanism by which cells regulate chromatin structure and function, impacting processes like cell differentiation and response to environmental signals (Klaas2021Thrombospondin4).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
H4C1, a member of the histone H4 family, plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and function by participating in various protein interactions. It is involved in the formation of nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin, by interacting with DNA to facilitate chromatin compaction and regulation. H4C1 is part of multiprotein complexes, such as the nucleosome, where it interacts with other histone proteins to maintain chromatin integrity and influence gene expression (Lukauskas2024Decoding).

H4C1 also interacts with histone-modifying enzymes, which can alter its post-translational modifications, affecting chromatin dynamics and gene regulation. The protein is known to undergo various post-translational modifications, including acetylation, which can influence its interaction with chromatin remodelers and other regulatory proteins. For instance, the CHRAC chromatin remodeling complex shows a preference for binding to acetylated H4, highlighting the role of H4C1 acetylation in recruiting specific protein complexes to chromatin (Lukauskas2024Decoding).

Additionally, H4C1 is involved in the recruitment of chromatin readers, such as the INO80 complex, which is stimulated by acetylation of H4 along with other histone modifications. These interactions underscore the importance of H4C1 in modulating chromatin states and regulating access to genetic information (Lukauskas2024Decoding).
