# DLX5

## Overview
The DLX5 gene encodes the distal-less homeobox 5 protein, a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of developmental processes, particularly in craniofacial, limb, and bone development. As a member of the homeobox gene family, DLX5 is involved in the differentiation and maturation of osteoblasts, as well as in chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, which are critical for bone and cartilage formation (Levi2022DLX; Tan2021DLX). The protein functions by interacting with other transcription factors and binding to DNA to regulate gene expression, including the activation of osteoblast-specific genes and modulation of the BMP signaling pathway (Levi2022DLX). Mutations or dysregulation of DLX5 are linked to developmental disorders such as split-hand/split-foot malformation and various cancers, where it can act as an oncogene (Wang2014Exome; Tan2021DLX).

## Function
The DLX5 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in various developmental processes in healthy human cells. It is heavily involved in craniofacial development, limb formation, and bone development. DLX5 is crucial for osteoblast maturation, which is essential for bone formation, and is strongly expressed in less mature osteoblasts, indicating its role in stimulating osteoblastic differentiation (Tan2021DLX). It acts as a transcriptional activator of Runx2, a key factor in bone development, by binding to its promoter and enhancer regions, and can activate osteoblast-specific genes independently of Runx2 (Levi2022DLX). DLX5 is also a direct target of the BMP signaling pathway, which is essential for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, and it regulates the Runx2 gene, directing mesenchymal cells towards the osteoblastic lineage (Levi2022DLX).

In addition to its role in bone development, DLX5 is involved in chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, which are important for cartilage development (Tan2021DLX). It is expressed in proliferating chondroblasts and is required for chondrocyte hypertrophy, functioning autonomously in this process (Zhu2009Dlx5). Disruption of DLX5 function can lead to developmental abnormalities, such as split-hand/split-foot malformation and craniofacial defects (Tan2021DLX).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the DLX5 gene are associated with several developmental disorders and cancers. One significant condition linked to DLX5 mutations is split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHFM), a congenital limb deformity characterized by missing central digits and claw-like distal extremities. Mutations such as a heterozygous missense mutation (p.Q186H) in DLX5 have been identified in families with autosomal-dominant SHFM, affecting the gene's transcriptional activity and leading to limb malformations (Wang2014Exome). The DLX5 gene is also implicated in craniofacial abnormalities and bone development issues, with its disruption leading to conditions like exencephaly and macrodactyly (Tan2021DLX).

In cancer, DLX5 acts as an oncogene in various types, including T-cell lymphomas, where its overexpression leads to thymic lymphomas through activation of Notch, Akt, and Wnt pathways (Tan2021DLX). DLX5 is also overexpressed in ovarian and non-small cell lung cancers, promoting tumor proliferation and metastasis, and is considered a marker of poor prognosis in these cancers (Tan2021DLX). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), hypermethylation of DLX5 is associated with poorer outcomes, suggesting a tumor-suppressing role in these conditions (Tan2021DLX).

## Interactions
DLX5, a transcription factor, engages in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in various biological processes. DLX5 interacts with the MSX1 homeoprotein through their respective homeodomains, forming complexes that are essential for their biochemical activities. This interaction is mediated by the homeodomain, which is crucial for DLX5's ability to bind DNA and interact with other proteins (Yang1998An). 

DLX5 also participates in heterodimerization with MSX proteins, such as MSX1 and MSX2. These interactions result in functional antagonism, where the transcriptional activities of DLX5 and MSX proteins are reciprocally inhibited. The dimerization of these proteins is mutually exclusive with DNA binding, meaning that when they form dimers, they cannot bind to DNA (Zhang1997Heterodimerization). 

In the context of cancer, DLX5 binds to the promoters of genes like MYC and IRS2, enhancing their expression and promoting cell proliferation. This interaction is significant in ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, where DLX5 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis (Tan2021DLX). Additionally, DLX5 binds to regulatory elements of the Notch1 and Notch3 genes, influencing their expression in thymic lymphomas (Tan2021DLX).
