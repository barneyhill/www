# FOXE1

## Overview
FOXE1, or forkhead box E1, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the forkhead/winged-helix family, characterized by a distinct forkhead DNA-binding domain. The protein product, also referred to as FOXE1, plays a pivotal role in thyroid development and function, acting as a transcriptional activator for thyroid-specific genes. It is crucial for the migration and survival of thyrocyte precursors during early thyroid organogenesis and is involved in regulating the expression of genes essential for thyroid hormone synthesis. FOXE1's activity is not limited to the thyroid; it is also expressed in other tissues such as the thymus and oropharyngeal epithelium, where it contributes to tissue homeostasis and organogenesis. The gene's mutations and polymorphisms have been linked to various thyroid-related disorders and developmental anomalies, including nonmedullary thyroid cancer and congenital hypothyroidism (Tomaz2012FOXE1; MorilloBernal2020FOXE1; Castanet2010Spectrum).

## Structure
FOXE1, also known as forkhead box E1, is a transcription factor characterized by a forkhead or winged-helix DNA-binding domain. This domain typically consists of approximately 110 amino acids that form a helix-turn-helix structure, which is crucial for its role in binding to DNA and regulating gene expression. The forkhead domain is a defining feature of the FOXE1 protein, contributing to its function in thyroid development and function.

The primary structure of FOXE1 includes the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein, with the forkhead domain being a significant component. The secondary structure is characterized by the helix-turn-helix motif within the forkhead domain, which facilitates its interaction with DNA. The tertiary structure of FOXE1 is likely influenced by the folding of the forkhead domain, allowing it to maintain its functional conformation necessary for DNA binding.

Post-translational modifications and splice variants may influence the activity and stability of FOXE1, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. These modifications could potentially affect the protein's function and its role in thyroid development. The presence of splice variant isoforms suggests that FOXE1 may have multiple forms with potentially distinct functions or regulatory mechanisms.

## Function
FOXE1, also known as thyroid transcription factor-2, is a crucial transcription factor involved in the development and function of the thyroid gland. It is part of the forkhead/winged-helix family and plays a significant role in thyroid organogenesis, particularly in the migration and survival of thyrocyte precursors during early thyroid development (MorilloBernal2020FOXE1; Castanet2010Spectrum). In healthy human cells, FOXE1 acts as a transcriptional activator for thyroid-specific genes such as thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin, which are essential for thyroid function (MorilloBernal2020FOXE1; Pereira2014Identification).

FOXE1 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to regulate the transcription of target genes, impacting processes like organogenesis and tissue homeostasis (Katoh2013Cancer). The gene's expression is maintained throughout development and into adulthood in various tissues, including the thyroid gland, thymus, and oropharyngeal epithelium (Castanet2010Spectrum). FOXE1 is also involved in mediating cellular responses to external stimuli, such as thyroid-stimulating hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1, which are crucial for maintaining the differentiated state of the thyroid gland (MorilloBernal2020FOXE1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the FOXE1 gene are associated with several thyroid-related conditions and developmental anomalies. Variants in FOXE1 have been linked to an increased risk of nonmedullary thyroid cancer (NMTC), including papillary, follicular, poorly differentiated, and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. Notably, the polymorphisms rs965513 and rs1867277 are significantly associated with increased thyroid cancer risk (Landa2009The; Tomaz2012FOXE1). The rs1867277 variant affects the binding of transcription factors USF1 and USF2, influencing FOXE1 expression and contributing to papillary thyroid carcinoma susceptibility (Landa2009The).

FOXE1 is also implicated in congenital hypothyroidism and thyroid dysgenesis. The 14/14-Ala genotype is protective against congenital hypothyroidism but increases the risk for thyroid dysgenesis (Tomaz2012FOXE1). The gene's polyalanine tract length variations are associated with thyroid dysgenesis and familial thyroid hemiagenesis, suggesting a role in these conditions (Szczepanek2011FOXE1).

FOXE1 mutations are linked to Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome, characterized by athyroidal hypothyroidism, spiky hair, choanal atresia, cleft palate, and bifid epiglottis (Szczepanek2011FOXE1). The gene's involvement in craniofacial development is further evidenced by its association with orofacial clefts, such as cleft lip and palate (Lammer2016Genetic).

## Interactions
FOXE1, a transcription factor, is known to interact with the ETS factor ELK1, forming a complex that co-regulates the TERT gene in thyroid cells. This interaction is significant for the transcriptional activation of thyroid-relevant genes such as TERT and TPO. The physical association between FOXE1 and ELK1 has been validated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments and mammalian two-hybrid assays, which demonstrated that the C-terminus of FOXE1 binds to ELK1, enhancing transactivation of a reporter gene (Bullock2016Thyroid). 

The interaction between FOXE1 and ELK1 is influenced by MEK/ERK signaling, as MEK inhibition disrupts their interaction, reducing TERT and TPO promoter activity. This suggests that phosphorylation of ELK1 is crucial for its interaction with FOXE1 (Bullock2016Thyroid). 

FOXE1 also interacts with the ZEB1 promoter, regulating its transcriptional activity. This interaction was confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, indicating that FOXE1 directly binds to the ZEB1 promoter, influencing cell migration and invasion in thyroid cancer cells (MorilloBernal2020FOXE1).
