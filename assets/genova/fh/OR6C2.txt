# OR6C2

## Overview
The OR6C2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 6 subfamily C member 2, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as a transmembrane receptor involved in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory system. As part of the extensive olfactory receptor family, OR6C2 plays a critical role in the sensory perception of smell by binding specific odor molecules and initiating neuronal responses that contribute to olfactory cognition and behavior. The gene's expression in the olfactory epithelium underscores its importance in the olfactory transduction pathway, which is essential for processing external stimuli and facilitating sensory perception (Fernández2014Copy; liu2008characterization; Bussiman2020Genomewide).

## Function
The OR6C2 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR6C2 is active in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (liu2008characterization).

In healthy human cells, OR6C2 plays a significant role in sensory perception and cognition, particularly related to olfactory functions. It is involved in the olfactory transduction pathway, which is crucial for processing external stimuli and sensory perception (Bussiman2020Genomewide). Functional Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses have shown that OR6C2 is associated with neurological system processes, sensory perception, and cognition, indicating its involvement in the neurological pathways that process external stimuli (Fernández2014Copy).

The olfactory receptor family, including OR6C2, is known for its role in signal transduction to olfactory neurons, which is essential for the recognition of a wide range of molecules, potentially impacting organismal behavior and adaptation (liu2008characterization).
