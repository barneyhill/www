# FBXO39

## Overview
FBXO39 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 39, a member of the F-box protein family, which is characterized by an F-box motif. This motif is crucial for the protein's role in the Skp-cullin-F-box (SCF) complex, a type of E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. The F-box protein 39 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and immune responses, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Aberrant expression of FBXO39 has been associated with several cancer types, notably osteosarcoma, where it appears to promote tumor progression by influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis (Zheng2018Knockdown). Understanding the function and regulation of FBXO39 could provide insights into its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Clinical Significance
FBXO39 is implicated in the progression of osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer. Research indicates that FBXO39 is highly expressed in U-2OS osteosarcoma cells compared to other osteosarcoma cell lines. Knockdown of FBXO39 using lentivirus-mediated shRNA transfection results in a significant reduction in cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis in these cells. This suggests that FBXO39 may play a crucial role in osteosarcoma progression and could serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Zheng2018Knockdown).

FBXO39's relevance in cancer is further supported by its abnormal expression in various cancer types and its high serum levels in colon cancer patients, indicating a potential role in cancer biology beyond osteosarcoma (Zheng2018Knockdown). Although the specific mechanisms by which FBXO39 contributes to these conditions are not fully understood, its involvement in the Skp-cullin-F-box (SCF) complex, a type of E3 ubiquitin ligase, suggests it may influence cell cycle regulation and immune responses, which are critical in cancer development and progression (Zheng2018Knockdown). Further research is needed to elucidate the full clinical implications of FBXO39 in cancer and other diseases.
