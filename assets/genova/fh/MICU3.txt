# MICU3

## Overview
MICU3 is a gene that encodes the protein mitochondrial calcium uptake family member 3, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of calcium ion uptake into mitochondria, a process essential for cellular energy production and metabolic regulation. MICU3 is characterized by its unique structure, including two EF-hand domains and a mitochondrial targeting signal, which facilitate its role in calcium binding and mitochondrial localization (Patron2018MICU3). Unlike its paralogs MICU1 and MICU2, MICU3 contains an additional 50 amino acid domain, contributing to its specific functional properties (Patron2018MICU3). The protein forms heterodimers with MICU1, but not with MICU2, indicating a selective interaction that is crucial for its function in neurons and other tissues with high energy demands (Patron2018MICU3; Murphy2021Regulation). MICU3's role in enhancing mitochondrial calcium uptake is vital for maintaining cellular energy balance and preventing mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly in tissues such as skeletal muscle and the heart (Puente2020MICU3; Yang2021MICU3).

## Structure
MICU3 is a protein involved in mitochondrial calcium uptake, characterized by its unique molecular structure. The primary structure of MICU3 includes a sequence of amino acids that form two EF-hand domains, which are common in calcium-binding proteins (Patron2018MICU3). These domains are crucial for its function in enhancing mitochondrial calcium uptake (Patron2018MICU3). MICU3 also contains a mitochondrial targeting signal, which directs the protein to the mitochondria (Patron2018MICU3).

A distinctive feature of MICU3 is an additional 50 amino acid domain located centrally within the protein, which is not found in its paralogs MICU1 and MICU2 (Patron2018MICU3). The tertiary structure of MICU3, while not fully detailed, is suggested to be similar to MICU2, with both proteins sharing a similar three-dimensional structure (Xing2019Dimerization).

In terms of quaternary structure, MICU3 forms heterodimers with MICU1 through a disulfide bond involving cysteine 515 in MICU3 and cysteine 465 in MICU1. This interaction is essential for the formation of MICU1/MICU3 heterodimers, which are expressed in neurons alongside MICU1/MICU2 heterodimers (Patron2018MICU3). MICU3 does not form dimers with MICU2, indicating a specific interaction with MICU1 (Patron2018MICU3).

## Function
MICU3 is a protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial calcium uptake, playing a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis within mitochondria. It is part of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, which facilitates the entry of calcium ions into the mitochondria, a process essential for cellular energy production and metabolism (Alevriadou2021Molecular). MICU3 is primarily active in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and enhances MCU-mediated calcium uptake, which is vital for mitochondrial function and cellular health (Yang2021MICU3).

In healthy cells, MICU3 contributes to the regulation of mitochondrial calcium levels, influencing processes such as ATP production and the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential. This regulation is important for preventing oxidative stress and apoptosis, as excessive calcium uptake can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction (Yang2021MICU3). MICU3's role in enhancing calcium uptake is particularly significant in tissues with high energy demands, such as skeletal muscle and neuronal tissues, where it supports cellular differentiation and function (Murphy2021Regulation; Yang2021MICU3).

Overall, MICU3 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy balance, contributing to the health and function of various tissues in the body.

## Interactions
MICU3 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial calcium uptake and interacts with other proteins within the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex. It is known to form a face-to-face dimer in the presence of calcium, similar to MICU1, which facilitates calcium uptake. In the absence of calcium, MICU3 forms a back-to-back dimer, akin to MICU2, which is associated with an inhibitory role in calcium uptake (Xing2019Dimerization).

MICU3 interacts with MICU1 but does not form a complex with MICU2. This interaction is facilitated by conserved residues such as Glu256, Met445, and Arg460 in MICU3, which are crucial for the formation of MICU1-MICU3 heterodimers (Wu2019The). The interaction between MICU3 and MICU1 is suggested to occur through disulfide bonds, although MICU3 does not interact with MICU2 in a similar manner (Wu2020The).

In cardiac tissue, MICU3 plays a specific role in regulating mitochondrial calcium uptake, with a higher MICU3/MCU ratio observed in the heart compared to the liver. This suggests a specialized function in cardiac physiology, potentially influencing calcium homeostasis and protecting against cardiac dysfunction (Puente2020MICU3).
