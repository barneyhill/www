# POLR1G

## Overview
POLR1G is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase I subunit G, a critical component of the RNA polymerase I complex. This protein is categorized as an RNA catalytic protein and plays a pivotal role in the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) within the nucleolus, a process essential for ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. The activity of RNA polymerase I subunit G is vital for cell growth and proliferation, as it supports the production of rRNA, which forms the core of ribosomes. This function is particularly important in rapidly dividing cells, where there is a high demand for protein synthesis. POLR1G's involvement in these fundamental cellular processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and contributing to organismal development and health (LagunasRangel2022Ribosomal; Yin2023Common; Zheng2021Interactome).

## Structure


## Function
POLR1G encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase I, which is essential for the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the nucleolus. This transcription process is a critical step in ribosome biogenesis, as rRNA forms the structural and functional core of ribosomes, which are responsible for protein synthesis in cells. By facilitating the production of rRNA, POLR1G plays a significant role in cell growth and proliferation, impacting various cellular and organismal functions. The activity of POLR1G in the nucleolus underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting the high demand for protein synthesis, particularly in rapidly dividing cells. This function is crucial for normal cellular operations and overall organismal development, as it ensures that cells have the necessary components to produce proteins efficiently. The role of POLR1G in these fundamental processes highlights its importance in both cellular biology and the broader context of organismal health and growth.

## Interactions
POLR1G, a subunit of RNA polymerase I, is involved in the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). It is part of the RNA polymerase I complex, which is essential for rRNA synthesis. The interactions of POLR1G within this complex are crucial for its assembly and function. Although specific interactions of POLR1G with proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available excerpts, it is known to be a component of the larger RNA polymerase I machinery, which includes other subunits like POLR1A and POLR1B (LagunasRangel2022Ribosomal).

In the context of SARS-CoV-2, POLR1G was identified as one of the high-confidence protein interactions with the nucleocapsid protein of the virus, suggesting a potential role in viral replication processes. This interaction highlights the importance of POLR1G in RNA processes, as it is categorized as an RNA catalytic protein involved in the positive regulation of gene expression (Zheng2021Interactome).

In studies related to lung cancer, POLR1G has been investigated for its interactions with the pro-inflammatory gene IL1B and other genes, indicating its involvement in genetic interactions that may influence cancer risk (Yin2023Common). However, specific details of these interactions are not provided in the excerpts.
