# NAV1

## Overview
The NAV1 gene encodes the protein neuron navigator 1, which is a critical component in the development and function of the nervous system. Neuron navigator 1 is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, specifically functioning as a microtubule plus-end tracking protein (+TIP). This protein is integral to the organization of the cytoskeleton, interacting with both microtubules and actin filaments to facilitate neuronal development and axonal guidance. It plays a pivotal role in processes such as neurite outgrowth, cortical neuron migration, and the orientation of leading processes, which are essential for the proper formation of the neocortex in mammals. Neuron navigator 1's interactions with other proteins, such as Trio, further underscore its importance in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and responding to extracellular signals during neuronal morphogenesis (Powers2023The).

## Function
The NAV1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in neuronal development and axonal guidance. In healthy human cells, NAV1 is involved in cytoskeletal organization, particularly by interacting with microtubules and actin filaments. It functions as a microtubule plus-end tracking protein (+TIP), which helps in reorganizing the cytoskeleton and facilitating interactions with microtubule end-binding proteins through SxIP motifs (Powers2023The). NAV1 is essential for proper directional neurite outgrowth in response to extracellular cues, such as the attractant netrin, and is involved in cortical neuron migration and leading process orientation, which are critical for establishing the layered structure of the neocortex in mammals (Powers2023The).

Subcellularly, NAV1 localizes to microtubule plus ends and is enriched in distal ends of neurites, growth cones, and branch points, indicating its role in axon guidance and neurite development (Powers2023The). It also interacts with Trio, a guanine exchange factor, to regulate actin dynamics and promote neurite outgrowth (Powers2023The). These functions highlight NAV1's role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and responding to extracellular cues during neuron development, contributing to the morphogenesis of tissues, particularly in the nervous system (Powers2023The).
