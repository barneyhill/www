# POLR2L

## Overview
The POLR2L gene encodes a small, highly conserved protein subunit known as hRPB7.6, which is integral to the function of human RNA polymerases I, II, and III. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor subunit, playing a critical role in the transcription of DNA into RNA, a fundamental process in gene expression. The hRPB7.6 subunit is essential for the assembly and stability of the RNA polymerase complexes, contributing to the synthesis of various types of RNA, including messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Its conservation across eukaryotic and archaeal species underscores its importance in the transcriptional machinery. POLR2L's involvement in transcriptional regulation is crucial for maintaining normal cellular processes, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Acker1996The; Muste2023Deregulations).

## Structure
The POLR2L gene encodes a subunit of human RNA polymerases I, II, and III, known as hRPB7.6, which is a 7.6-kDa protein. This subunit is homologous to the yeast ABC10b subunit, encoded by the RPB10 gene, and is characterized by conserved motifs derived from yeast ABC10b, specifically the sequences 10-CGKVVGDKWE-19 and 45-CCRRMILTHV-54 (Acker1996The). These motifs are crucial for the protein's function and were used to design primers for amplifying sequences from cDNAs prepared from HeLa cell RNA (Acker1996The).

The hRPB7.6 subunit is involved in forming the core complex of RNA polymerases, contributing to the quaternary structure of these enzymes. It is one of the shared subunits among the three RNA polymerase complexes, highlighting its essential role in transcription (Muste2023Deregulations). The protein's structure includes a zinc-binding domain, which is crucial for its structural stability and function, although specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context. The exact N-terminus of the subunit could not be unambiguously identified due to the lack of an in-frame stop codon in the cDNA sequence, suggesting that the actual N-terminus might be missing from the cloned cDNAs (Acker1996The).

## Function
The POLR2L gene encodes a 7.6-kDa subunit of human RNA polymerases II, I, and III, known as hRPB7.6. This subunit is involved in the transcription of DNA into RNA, a fundamental process in gene expression regulation. In healthy human cells, POLR2L plays a crucial role in synthesizing messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and small nuclear RNA (snRNA), which are essential for protein synthesis and various cellular functions (Acker1996The).

The hRPB7.6 subunit is highly conserved across eukaryotic and archaeal species, indicating its essential role in the transcriptional machinery. It is similar to the yeast counterpart ABC10b, suggesting that it may be shared by all three classes of human nuclear RNA polymerases. This conservation highlights its importance in the fundamental catalytic events of transcription and its interaction with cofactors within the transcriptional apparatus (Acker1996The).

POLR2L is active in the nucleus, where transcription occurs, and its function is critical for maintaining normal cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and response to environmental signals. The proper functioning of POLR2L is vital for the regulation of gene expression, impacting overall organismal health and development (Acker1996The).

## Clinical Significance
The POLR2L gene, encoding a subunit shared by RNA polymerases I, II, and III, has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In gastric cancer, POLR2L is significantly upregulated and associated with resistance to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin, suggesting a role in treatment resistance (Muste2023Deregulations). In hepatocellular carcinoma, POLR2L promotes cell proliferation, enhancing tumor growth and metastasis, particularly to the lungs. This indicates its involvement in cancer progression and invasion (Muste2023Deregulations). The gene is also overexpressed in lung and colorectal cancers, highlighting its potential role in tumorigenesis across multiple cancer types (Muste2023Deregulations).

The upregulation of POLR2L in these cancers suggests that it may contribute to increased cancer cell proliferation and survival, as well as enhanced metastatic potential. These findings underscore the importance of POLR2L as a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic intervention. The gene's role in promoting resistance to chemotherapy further emphasizes its clinical significance in the management of cancer (Muste2023Deregulations).

## Interactions
POLR2L is a subunit of RNA polymerase II, which is responsible for transcribing messenger RNA (mRNA) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in eukaryotic organisms. It is also a component of RNA polymerases I and III. POLR2L interacts with other subunits within these polymerase complexes, contributing to the assembly and stability of the transcription machinery. The subunit is encoded by the POLR2L gene and is shared among all three polymerase complexes (Pol I, II, and III), being encoded by the gene POLR2L (Muste2023Deregulations).

In the context of cancer, POLR2L has been identified as one of the hub genes significantly upregulated in various cancers, including gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. Its upregulation is associated with promoting cell proliferation and survival, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, and it has been linked to cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer (Muste2023Deregulations).

While specific protein interactions involving POLR2L are not detailed in the provided context, its role as a subunit of RNA polymerase II suggests it participates in the complex network of protein interactions necessary for the transcription process. These interactions are crucial for the proper assembly and function of the polymerase complexes.
