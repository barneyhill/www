1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). These second messengers subsequently regulate various processes affecting cell growth, differentiation, and gene expression. This enzyme is regulated by small monomeric GTPases of the Ras and Rho families and by heterotrimeric G proteins. In addition to its phospholipase C catalytic activity, this enzyme has an N-terminal domain with guanine nucleotide exchange (GEF) activity. Mutations in this gene cause early-onset nephrotic syndrome; characterized by proteinuria, edema, and diffuse mesangial sclerosis or focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.[provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009].", "symbol": "PLCE1", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1424797"}, "unigene": "Hs.655033", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "Q9P212", "TrEMBL": ["A0A8I5KXT2", "B7ZM61", "A0A6Q8PHP9", "A0A6Q8PGT4", "A0A8I5KQ92", "A0A8I5KV08", "A0A7I2PPM5", "A0A6Q8PH04", "A0A6Q8PHN3", "A0A8I5KVG7", "A0A6Q8PFG0"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "PLCE1"}}
