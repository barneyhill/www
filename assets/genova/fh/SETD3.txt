# SETD3

## Overview
SETD3 is a gene that encodes the protein SET domain containing 3, actin N3(tau)-histidine methyltransferase, which is a member of the methyltransferase enzyme family. This protein is primarily recognized for its role in the post-translational modification of actin, specifically methylating the histidine 73 residue on β-actin, a modification crucial for the stability and integrity of actin filaments (Kwiatkowski2018SETD3). The SETD3 protein is characterized by its unique structural domains, including a SET domain responsible for its methyltransferase activity, and a Rubisco LSMT substrate-binding domain (Zheng2020Molecular). Beyond its structural role in the cytoskeleton, SETD3 is involved in various cellular processes such as muscle contraction, transcription regulation, and DNA repair (Shu2021The; Chia2024Functional). Additionally, SETD3 has been implicated in the replication of enteroviruses and in the progression of several cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor growth and patient prognosis (Hassan2020SETD3; Peters2022Structurefunction).

## Structure
SETD3 is a protein characterized by its unique structure, which includes a SET domain at the N-terminal lobe and a Rubisco LSMT substrate-binding domain at the C-terminal lobe. The SET domain is responsible for the protein's methyltransferase activity and consists of three discrete β-sheets and a bundle of α helices (Zheng2020Molecular). The Rubisco LSMT domain contains seven α helices and a pair of β-strands (Zheng2020Molecular). 

The SETD3 protein adopts a V-shaped architecture, comprising N-SET, SET, iSET, and C-SET domains. The SET domain has a canonical fold with twelve β strands arranged into four anti-parallel β sheets and one parallel β sheet (Guo2018Structural). The AdoHcy binding pocket is located between the SET and C-SET domains, with specific interactions involving Glu104 and Phe327 (Guo2018Structural). 

SETD3 specifically methylates histidine residues, such as His73 of actin, rather than lysine, due to its shallower substrate recognition groove (Shu2021The). Key residues like Asn256, Asp274, and Tyr313 form hydrogen bonds with the His73 imidazole ring, contributing to its specificity for histidine (Shu2021The). The protein's structure and specific interactions facilitate its role as an actin-specific histidine methyltransferase.

## Function
The SETD3 gene encodes a protein that functions as an actin-specific histidine N-methyltransferase, primarily active in the cytoplasm of healthy human cells. This enzyme is responsible for the methylation of the histidine 73 (H73) residue on β-actin, a post-translational modification crucial for the stability of actin filaments. The methylation of H73 by SETD3 stabilizes actin filaments, preventing their depolymerization, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton (Kwiatkowski2018SETD3).

SETD3's activity is vital for various cellular processes, including cell growth, division, and motility. The absence of SETD3 leads to increased depolymerization of actin filaments, resulting in a loss of cytoskeletal integrity and a shift towards a glycolytic phenotype, as indicated by increased lactate production (Kwiatkowski2018SETD3). This enzyme also plays a role in muscle contraction and cellular responses to mechanical stress, highlighting its importance in muscle differentiation and function (Shu2021The).

SETD3 is also involved in transcription regulation and DNA replication or repair, interacting with proteins such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the transcription factor FoxM1 (Chia2024Functional).

## Clinical Significance
SETD3 is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels influencing prognosis and tumor progression. In colon cancer, SETD3 positively regulates DNA-damage-induced apoptosis through a p53-dependent pathway, and its low expression is associated with poor survival outcomes (AbaevSchneiderman2019SETD3). In breast cancer, high SETD3 expression is linked to better relapse-free survival in ER-positive and Luminal A-type tumors, but correlates with poor outcomes in triple-negative and p53-mutated tumors (Hassan2020SETD3). SETD3 also affects the viability and invasiveness of aggressive breast cancer cells by influencing cytoskeletal function (Hassan2020SETD3).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SETD3 promotes tumor growth by enhancing PLK1 expression, and its stability is regulated by the deubiquitinase USP27, which protects it from degradation (Cheng2022SETD3; Zou2022Stabilization). Knockdown of SETD3 or USP27 reduces cell proliferation and tumor growth, highlighting the importance of the USP27-SETD3 axis in liver cancer progression (Zou2022Stabilization).

SETD3's role in cancer is complex, as it can act as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the cancer type and genetic context (Shu2021The).

## Interactions
SETD3 interacts with several proteins and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is an essential host factor for the replication of enteroviruses, interacting specifically with the viral protease 2A. This interaction is critical for enterovirus replication, as SETD3 stabilizes the 2A protease, potentially enhancing its function in viral RNA replication (Peters2022Structurefunction). The 2A protease binds to SETD3 at two distinct interfaces, one in the SET domain and another in the RSB domain, with a strong binding affinity (Peters2022Structurefunction). This interaction disrupts the SETD3-actin complex, as 2A competes with actin for binding to SETD3, inhibiting its methyltransferase activity (Gao2024The).

SETD3 also interacts with the transcription factor FoxM1, binding and methylating it at the chromatin level. This interaction negatively regulates VEGF expression under hypoxic conditions, as SETD3 and FoxM1 dissociate from the VEGF promoter, leading to increased VEGF transcription (Cohn2016Chromatin). These interactions highlight SETD3's role in both viral replication and gene expression regulation.
