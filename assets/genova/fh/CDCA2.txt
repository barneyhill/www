# CDCA2

## Overview
CDCA2, or cell division cycle associated 2, is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly during cell division. The protein, also known as Repo-Man, is a key player in chromatin remodeling and the regulation of the cell cycle. It functions by targeting protein phosphatase 1 gamma (PP1γ) to chromatin, facilitating the dephosphorylation of histone H3, which is essential for the reformation of the nuclear envelope and the maintenance of genomic stability during mitosis (Wang2021CDCA2; Zhang2020CDCA2). CDCA2 is implicated in the regulation of the G1/S phase transition and DNA damage response, highlighting its role in ensuring proper cell cycle progression and genomic integrity (Shi2017CDCA2; Feng2019CDCA2). Aberrations in CDCA2 expression have been associated with various cancers, suggesting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Tang2022Increased; Zhang2020CDCA2).

## Structure


## Function
CDCA2, also known as cell division cycle associated 2, is a nuclear protein that plays a crucial role in cell division and chromatin remodeling. It is particularly involved in the reformation of the nuclear envelope and the dephosphorylation of histone H3 during anaphase, processes essential for maintaining chromosome architecture and genomic stability during cell cycle progression (Wang2021CDCA2; Zhang2020CDCA2). CDCA2 targets protein phosphatase 1 gamma (PP1γ) to chromatin, facilitating the dephosphorylation of histones, which is critical for the transition from mitosis to interphase (Feng2019CDCA2).

In healthy cells, CDCA2 is active in the nucleus, where it regulates the G1/S phase transition of the cell cycle by modulating the expression of key cell cycle regulators such as Cyclin D1 (CCND1) (Feng2019CDCA2). This regulation ensures proper cell cycle progression and prevents genomic instability. CDCA2's interaction with PP1γ is also vital for DNA damage responses, contributing to the maintenance of genomic integrity (Wang2021CDCA2). These molecular activities highlight CDCA2's essential role in cell biology, particularly in processes that ensure accurate cell division and chromosomal stability.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDCA2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), prostate cancer (PCa), oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and colorectal cancer (CRC). In HCC, CDCA2 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, advanced tumor stages, and increased expression of immune checkpoints such as PD-L1, PD-L2, and CTLA4. This suggests that CDCA2 may contribute to immune evasion in HCC (Tang2022Increased). In PCa, CDCA2 overexpression correlates with higher Gleason Scores and poor prognosis. Knockdown of CDCA2 in PCa cells reduces proliferation and increases apoptosis, indicating its role in tumor growth (Zhang2020CDCA2). In OSCC, CDCA2 overexpression prevents G1 phase arrest and apoptosis, promoting tumor progression. Its knockdown enhances sensitivity to cisplatin treatment by activating the DNA damage response (Uchida2013Overexpression). In CRC, CDCA2 is linked to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth, primarily through the activation of the AKT/CCND1 pathway (Feng2019CDCA2). These findings suggest that CDCA2 acts as an oncogene in multiple cancer types, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
CDCA2, also known as Repo-Man, is a nuclear protein that primarily interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), specifically the PP1γ isoform. This interaction is crucial for targeting PP1 to chromatin, where it plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and the dephosphorylation of histone H3 during mitosis. This process is essential for maintaining chromosome architecture and regulating the DNA damage response (Shi2017CDCA2; Zhang2020CDCA2).

In lung adenocarcinoma, CDCA2's interaction with PP1 is important for the dephosphorylation of histone H3, which is necessary for cell cycle progression, particularly the G1/S transition. This interaction also influences the expression of cyclin E1 (CCNE1), a gene related to the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Shi2017CDCA2).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, CDCA2 recruits PP1 to chromatin, affecting the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) signaling pathway, which is involved in the DNA damage response. This interaction can influence the phosphorylation of ATM kinase, impacting the p53-MDM2 interaction and leading to cell cycle arrest (Xing2021Integrate).

CDCA2's interactions extend to the regulation of the p53 signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma, where its silencing leads to increased levels of p53 and its downstream targets, suggesting a role in inhibiting apoptosis (Yu2021Identification).
