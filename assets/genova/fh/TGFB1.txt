# TGFB1

## Overview
The TGFB1 gene encodes the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) protein, a crucial member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily of cytokines. TGF-β1 is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune responses. It is synthesized as a latent precursor that requires activation to exert its biological effects. The mature TGF-β1 protein functions primarily through serine-threonine kinase transmembrane receptors, initiating signaling cascades that involve Smad proteins and other pathways, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular behavior (Kajdaniuk2013Transforming; Derynck2019Specificity). The TGFB1 gene is implicated in various pathological conditions, including Camurati-Engelmann disease and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Stanilova2018Transforming; Janssens2005CamuratiEngelmann).

## Structure
The transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) protein is a multifunctional cytokine involved in various cellular processes. Its primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain derived from a 390-amino-acid pre-pro-TGF-β1, which includes a signal peptide and a propeptide region. The mature TGF-β1 is a 112-amino-acid chain formed through proteolytic cleavage at specific sites, such as the dibasic Arg-Arg sequence (Gentry1988Molecular).

The secondary structure of TGFB1 includes beta sheets and alpha helices, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure is characterized by a cystine knot motif, which is crucial for its biological activity. The quaternary structure of TGFB1 is a homodimer, with two polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds, forming a stable and active configuration (Sha1991Identification).

Post-translational modifications of TGFB1 include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are important for its secretion and activity. The pro region of the precursor plays a significant role in the proper folding and secretion of the mature protein, forming a latent complex that is biologically inactive until activated by specific conditions (Gentry1988Molecular; Sha1991Identification).

## Function
Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a critical role in regulating various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in controlling apoptosis, balancing cell replication and death, and is essential for tissue regeneration and repair. TGFB1 influences the proliferation of different cell types depending on their origin; it generally stimulates mesenchymal cells like fibroblasts and osteoblasts, while inhibiting epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells. It acts as a potent inhibitor of hepatocyte proliferation, contributing to the maintenance of liver mass (Kajdaniuk2013Transforming).

TGFB1 is also involved in wound healing by promoting fibroblast migration and extracellular matrix protein synthesis. It has immunomodulatory effects, suppressing immune responses by inhibiting the proliferation and activity of immune cells, and is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis. In the absence of TGFB1, mice develop severe inflammatory responses, indicating its critical role in preventing excessive immune activation (Kajdaniuk2013Transforming).

At the molecular level, TGFB1 interacts with its receptors, TGFbRI, TGFbRII, and TGFbRIII, to initiate a signal transduction cascade that influences gene transcription. This involves the phosphorylation of Smad proteins, which are crucial for transmitting signals to the nucleus and regulating TGFb-dependent gene expression (Kajdaniuk2013Transforming).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TGFB1 gene are associated with several diseases, most notably Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED), a rare autosomal dominant bone dysplasia. CED is characterized by cortical thickening of the diaphyses of long bones, leading to symptoms such as bone pain, waddling gait, and muscle weakness. The disease is linked to mutations in exon 4 of the TGFB1 gene, which affect the latency-associated peptide, resulting in increased TGF-β1 activity and subsequent bone abnormalities (Wallace2004Marked; Janssens2005CamuratiEngelmann). 

The R218H mutation, a common variant in CED, leads to an arginine to histidine substitution, which has been identified in multiple families worldwide (CamposXavier2001Phenotypic; Park2009The). 

Alterations in TGFB1 expression levels are also implicated in other conditions. In cystic fibrosis, variations in the TGFB1 gene influence lung disease progression and severity, with certain alleles linked to increased fibrotic response (Corvol2008Genetic). Additionally, TGFB1 polymorphisms are associated with colorectal cancer development, with specific genotypes linked to increased cancer risk and progression (Stanilova2018Transforming). 

Overall, TGFB1 mutations and expression alterations play significant roles in the pathogenesis of various diseases, highlighting the gene's clinical significance.

## Interactions
TGFB1 interacts with various proteins and plays a crucial role in multiple cellular processes. It is secreted as a latent complex and requires activation to release the mature ligand. This activation is mediated by integrins such as αvβ1, αvβ6, and αvβ8, which induce conformational changes to release active TGFB1 (Derynck2019Specificity). The actin cytoskeleton also facilitates TGFB1 activation through integrins, particularly αvβ6, which is dependent on cytoskeletal tension (Melchionna2021Actin).

TGFB1 signals through serine-threonine kinase transmembrane receptors, phosphorylating SMAD proteins, specifically SMAD2 and SMAD3, which then regulate transcription of target genes (Shuttleworth2018The). The interaction with SMAD3 is particularly significant in processes like myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis (Shuttleworth2018The).

TGFB1 also interacts with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as decorin and biglycan, which sequester TGFB1 in the ECM, preventing receptor activation (Derynck2019Specificity). Additionally, TGFB1 can activate non-Smad pathways, including the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and JAK-STAT pathways, influencing cell survival, proliferation, and migration (Derynck2019Specificity). These interactions highlight the complexity and versatility of TGFB1 signaling in cellular regulation.
