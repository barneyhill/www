# AP1AR

## Overview
AP1AR is a gene that encodes the adaptor related protein complex 1 associated regulatory protein, which is involved in intracellular transport processes. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the AP-1 complex, a key component in vesicle-mediated transport. The AP1AR protein is primarily associated with clathrin-coated vesicles, facilitating the trafficking of proteins between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. This function is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis, ensuring proper protein sorting, and supporting various cellular functions such as cell signaling and membrane dynamics. The precise regulation of these processes by AP1AR is essential for the correct delivery of proteins to their designated cellular locations, thereby contributing to the overall health and functionality of the cell (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function
AP1AR, or adaptor related protein complex 1 associated regulatory protein, plays a significant role in the regulation of the AP-1 complex, which is crucial for vesicle-mediated transport within cells. This protein is associated with clathrin-coated vesicles, which are essential for the trafficking of proteins between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. By facilitating this transport, AP1AR contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein sorting. These processes are vital for cell signaling and membrane dynamics, impacting various cellular functions and organismal outcomes. The activity of AP1AR in these pathways ensures that proteins are correctly sorted and delivered to their appropriate destinations within the cell, which is essential for the proper functioning of cellular processes and overall cellular health.
