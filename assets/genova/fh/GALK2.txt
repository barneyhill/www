# GALK2

## Overview
GALK2, or N-acetylgalactosamine kinase, is a gene that encodes the enzyme galactokinase 2, a member of the GHMP kinase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the salvage pathway for N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), a critical component in the metabolism and recycling of complex carbohydrates. Galactokinase 2 is characterized by its specificity for GalNAc over galactose, distinguishing it from the related enzyme encoded by the GALK1 gene. The enzyme plays a significant role in glycosylation processes, particularly in the formation of mucin-type O-glycans, by converting GalNAc into GalNAc 1-phosphate, which is subsequently used in glycosylation (Agnew2009Mechanistic; Thoden2005The). The structural features of GALK2, including its conserved ATP-binding domain and unique active site residues, facilitate its enzymatic function and substrate specificity (Agnew2009Mechanistic; Huang2013Role).

## Structure
GALK2, or N-acetylgalactosamine kinase, is a member of the GHMP kinase family, which is characterized by a conserved ATP-binding domain. The primary structure of GALK2 includes specific amino acid residues that contribute to its unique substrate specificity. In the active site, threonine and glycine residues accommodate the N-acetyl group of N-acetylgalactosamine, distinguishing it from galactokinase 1 (GALK1), which has bulkier methionine and cysteine residues (Agnew2009Mechanistic).

The secondary structure of GALK2 consists of a mix of α-helices and β-sheets, forming a typical GHMP kinase fold. This fold includes two globular domains that create a central cleft for MgATP binding (Huang2013Role). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of these domains, which is crucial for its enzymatic function. The active site of GALK2 features a loop from Thr-184 to Gly-186 and an important Asp-190 residue, which is likely crucial for the enzyme's catalytic mechanism (Agnew2009Mechanistic).

There is no specific information on the quaternary structure of GALK2 or its post-translational modifications in the provided context. Additionally, details on splice variant isoforms are not available in the context.

## Function
The GALK2 gene encodes the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine kinase, which plays a crucial role in the salvage pathway for the reutilization of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) derived from the degradation of complex carbohydrates. This enzyme is part of the GHMP kinase family and is primarily active in the cytoplasm of human cells (Agnew2009Mechanistic; Thoden2005The). GALK2 exhibits a high specificity for GalNAc over galactose, which distinguishes it from the galactokinase encoded by the GALK1 gene. This specificity is significant for recycling GalNAc, a component of complex carbohydrates, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient carbohydrate utilization (Thoden2005The).

GALK2 is also involved in glycosylation processes, particularly in the formation of mucin-type O-glycans. It converts salvaged GalNAc into GalNAc 1-phosphate, which is then transformed into its UDP form, essential for glycosylation (Termini2017HEK293T). The enzyme's activity is characterized by an ordered ternary complex mechanism, where ATP is the first substrate to bind, highlighting its role in intermediary metabolism (Agnew2009Mechanistic). GALK2's function is vital for the proper glycosylation of proteins, impacting various cellular and organismal processes (Termini2017HEK293T).
