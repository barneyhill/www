# DEGS2

## Overview
The DEGS2 gene encodes the enzyme delta 4-desaturase, sphingolipid 2, which is a member of the desaturase/hydroxylase superfamily. This bi-functional enzyme plays a critical role in sphingolipid metabolism by acting as both a sphingolipid delta(4)-desaturase and a sphingolipid C4-hydroxylase. It is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is involved in the biosynthesis of phytosphingolipids, essential components of the plasma membrane in animals. The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of cellular membranes, particularly in the brain, where it contributes to the formation of sphingomyelin in the myelin sheath of nerve cell axons. DEGS2 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including schizophrenia, colorectal cancer, and sudden cardiac arrest, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Ohi2015DEGS2; Guo2021M6A).

## Function
The DEGS2 gene encodes a bi-functional enzyme that acts as both a sphingolipid delta(4)-desaturase and a sphingolipid C4-hydroxylase. This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of phytosphingolipids, which are essential components of the plasma membrane in all animals. Phytosphingolipids consist of a sphingoid base, such as phytosphingosine, which is a minor base in mammalian cells. Phytoceramide, a derivative of phytosphingosine, serves as a backbone for complex sphingolipids. The DEGS2 gene plays a role in maintaining the ceramide structure by varying hydroxylation and desaturation in the sphingoid base (Ohi2015DEGS2).

DEGS2 is part of the desaturase/hydroxylase superfamily and has sphingolipid dihydroceramide hydroxylase activity, which is crucial for the metabolism of sphingolipids, particularly in the brain. Sphingomyelin, a type of sphingolipid, is found in the myelin sheath of nerve cell axons and plays roles in signal transduction and cell apoptosis (Ohi2015DEGS2). The enzyme is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells, where it catalyzes the introduction of a double bond into dihydroceramide, converting it into desaturated ceramide, a process crucial for maintaining membrane structure and function (Karsai2018Aberrant).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DEGS2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In schizophrenia, DEGS2 polymorphisms, particularly rs3783332, are associated with cognitive impairments. Carriers of the risk-associated minor allele of this SNP exhibit lower DEGS2 expression, which is linked to greater cognitive deficits. This association is consistent across various psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, although the differences in DEGS2 expression are not statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons (Ohi2015DEGS2).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), DEGS2 is involved in m6A-regulated carcinogenesis. The gene's expression is significantly elevated in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues, and its m6A methylation status affects its stability and translation. Altered DEGS2 expression promotes CRC cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis, suggesting its role as an oncogene in CRC. The m6A modification of DEGS2 mRNA is crucial for its regulation, with decreased m6A levels leading to increased DEGS2 expression and enhanced tumorigenic properties (Guo2021M6A).

DEGS2 has also been associated with sudden cardiac arrest in patients with coronary artery disease. A nonsynonymous SNP, rs7157599, in DEGS2 is linked to this condition, although the functional impact of this variant is predicted to be benign (Aouizerat2011GWAS).
