and tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated sodium channel subunit. This protein is found primarily in cardiac muscle and is responsible for the initial upstroke of the action potential in an electrocardiogram. Defects in this gene have been associated with long QT syndrome type 3 (LQT3), atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, and Brugada syndrome 1, all autosomal dominant cardiac diseases. Alternative splicing results in several transcript variants encoding different isoforms.
