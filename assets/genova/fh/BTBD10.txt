# BTBD10

## Overview
BTBD10 is a gene that encodes the BTB domain-containing 10 protein, which plays a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of Akt phosphorylation. The BTBD10 protein is characterized by the presence of a BTB/POZ domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and is crucial for transcription regulation and chromatin structure (Chen2004Molecular). This protein is predominantly located in the nucleus, suggesting its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Chen2004Molecular). Functionally, BTBD10 acts as an activator of Akt by inhibiting its dephosphorylation, thereby promoting cell survival and growth, especially in motor neurons (Nawa2012Reduced). The protein's interaction with Akt proteins enhances phosphorylation at key sites necessary for cell survival signaling pathways (Nawa2008A). BTBD10's expression is ubiquitous in human tissues, with notable implications in diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), glioma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression levels are altered, affecting disease progression and prognosis (Furuta2013Reduced; Li2022BTBD10).

## Structure
The BTBD10 gene encodes a protein that is 475 amino acids long with a molecular weight of 51.7 kD. The primary structure of the BTBD10 protein includes a BTB/POZ domain, a conserved region found in other BTB proteins, spanning amino acid residues 142 to 272 (Chen2004Molecular). This domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and is crucial for transcription regulation and chromatin structure (Chen2004Molecular). 

The BTBD10 protein is predicted to be located in the nucleus, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Chen2004Molecular). Subcellular localization studies using GFP fusion protein have confirmed its nuclear localization (Chen2004Molecular). 

In terms of quaternary structure, the BTB domains of KCTD family proteins, including BTBD10, are noted for their versatility in oligomeric organization. While they often form pentamers, for BTBD10, unstable or unreliable pentameric states are predicted, suggesting it may operate in nonpentameric states (Esposito2022Alphafold). The interactions between the BTB and CTD domains of adjacent chains in BTBD10 generate an open multimer, but the reliability of this structure requires experimental validation (Esposito2022Alphafold).

## Function
BTBD10 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of Akt phosphorylation, which is essential for cell survival and growth. The BTBD10 protein functions as an activator of Akt by inhibiting its dephosphorylation mediated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), thereby maintaining Akt in its phosphorylated, active form. This activation is crucial for promoting cell survival, especially in motor neurons, by preventing apoptosis and supporting cell adhesion and proliferation (Nawa2008A; Nawa2012Reduced).

In healthy human cells, BTBD10 is ubiquitously expressed, with high levels in the adult brain, testis, and small intestine, and lower levels in other tissues such as the heart, lung, liver, and kidney. The protein is located in the nucleus of certain cell lines, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Chen2004Molecular). BTBD10's interaction with Akt proteins enhances phosphorylation at key sites, such as Thr 308 and Ser 473, which are necessary for Akt activation and subsequent cell survival signaling pathways (Nawa2008A). This regulatory function of BTBD10 is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing neuronal death, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Nawa2012Reduced).

## Clinical Significance
BTBD10 has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), reduced expression of BTBD10 is associated with motor neuron death. This reduction is linked to the presence of pathological markers such as Golgi apparatus fragmentation and phosphorylated TAR-DNA-binding protein 43 (pTDP-43) aggregates in sporadic ALS patients. The downregulation of BTBD10 may contribute to ALS pathogenesis by impairing Akt-mediated prosurvival signaling, leading to motor neuron death (Furuta2013Reduced; Nawa2012Reduced).

In glioma, BTBD10 is significantly down-regulated compared to normal brain tissues. This downregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis, suggesting that BTBD10 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its reduced expression in glioma tissues, particularly in high-grade gliomas, indicates a potential role in glioma tumorigenesis (Chen2004Molecular; Liu2022BTBD10).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), BTBD10 is overexpressed and correlates with poor prognosis. High levels of BTBD10 are linked to immune evasion and adverse outcomes, making it a potential target for immunotherapy in HCC (Li2022BTBD10).

## Interactions
BTBD10 is known to interact with the Akt family of proteins, including Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3. It was identified as an Akt3-interacting protein through yeast two-hybrid screening and binds to all Akt isoforms in vitro. The interaction involves the PH domain and the catalytic domain of Akt3, with the BTB/POZ domain of BTBD10 playing a crucial role in this binding (Nawa2008A). BTBD10 enhances Akt phosphorylation by inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation, thereby maintaining higher phosphorylation levels of Akt at Thr 308 and Ser 473, which are essential for Akt activation (Nawa2008A).

BTBD10 also interacts with the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2AC), suppressing its activity and preventing the dephosphorylation of Akt. This interaction was confirmed through GST-pulldown assays and immunoblot analysis (Nawa2008A). While BTBD10 binds to both PP1A and PP2AC, its effect on Akt phosphorylation is specifically linked to PP2AC (Nawa2008A). These interactions suggest that BTBD10 acts as a regulator of Akt signaling pathways, influencing cell survival and proliferation. There is no evidence from the provided context that BTBD10 interacts directly with nucleic acids.
