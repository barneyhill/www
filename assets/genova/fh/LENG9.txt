# LENG9

## Overview
LENG9 is a gene that encodes the protein leukocyte receptor cluster member 9, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a receptor and is primarily expressed in leukocytes, where it plays a role in immune response modulation. The LENG9 gene is located on a specific region of the human genome and is part of a larger cluster of genes that are involved in immune system regulation. The protein encoded by LENG9 is implicated in signaling pathways that influence cell communication and immune cell activation, contributing to the body's defense mechanisms. Understanding the function and interactions of leukocyte receptor cluster member 9 is crucial for elucidating its role in health and disease, particularly in conditions related to immune system dysfunction.
