# TMEM120A

## Overview
TMEM120A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 120A, also known as TACAN, which is a nuclear envelope transmembrane protein. This protein is characterized by its homo-dimeric structure, with each protomer comprising six transmembrane helices and a coiled coil domain. TMEM120A is primarily expressed in adipose tissue and plays a crucial role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism. It is involved in the regulation of lipid droplet accumulation and the spatial organization of the genome within adipocytes, influencing gene expression related to fat metabolism. Although initially proposed to function as a mechanosensitive ion channel, electrophysiological studies have not confirmed this role. TMEM120A interacts with various proteins, including lamin A and STING, suggesting its involvement in maintaining nuclear structure and potentially in antiviral responses. Mutations or altered expression of TMEM120A have been associated with metabolic disorders, such as familial partial lipodystrophy type 2, highlighting its clinical significance in metabolic regulation (Batrakou2015TMEM120A; Xue2021TMEM120A; Czapiewski2022Genomic).

## Structure
TMEM120A, also known as TACAN, is a protein that forms a homo-dimeric assembly, with each protomer containing six transmembrane helices (H1-H6) and a coiled coil domain (CCD) formed by the N-terminal cytosolic regions (Ke2021CryoEM). The dimeric assembly is stabilized by interactions in both the CCD and transmembrane domain (TMD), with specific residues contributing to the interface interaction (Ke2021CryoEM). The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of TMEM120A reveals a transmembrane globular domain formed of six helices and an intracellular domain formed of two helices (Chen2021CryoEM). 

The protein shares structural similarities with ELOVL7, a fatty acid elongase, suggesting a potential functional relationship (Ke2021CryoEM). Cholesterols are identified at the flank of each subunit, and a single point mutation at the key residue Met207 significantly increases surface tension-activated currents (Chen2021CryoEM). The structure of TMEM120A in a closed state was determined at a resolution of 3.66 Å, providing insights into its molecular assembly and potential mechanosensitive properties (Chen2021CryoEM). The protein's interaction with PKD2 through its transmembrane domains S1 and S6 is significant in the context of diseases like ADPKD (Liu2022Regulation).

## Function
TMEM120A, also known as TACAN, is a nuclear envelope transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism. It is primarily expressed in adipose tissue and is crucial for the proper function of adipocytes. TMEM120A is involved in the regulation of lipid droplet accumulation during adipocyte differentiation, and its knockdown results in defects in this process (Batrakou2015TMEM120A). The protein is also implicated in the spatial organization of the genome within adipocytes, influencing the positioning and expression of genes involved in fat metabolism (Czapiewski2022Genomic).

Structurally, TMEM120A forms a tightly packed dimer with a CoA-binding site, resembling elongase enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism, such as the ELOVL family. This structural similarity suggests a potential enzymatic role in lipid metabolism, although its exact function in human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Xue2021TMEM120A). TMEM120A's involvement in mechanosensation has been proposed, but electrophysiological studies have not confirmed it as a mechanosensitive channel (Xue2021TMEM120A). The protein's activity in the nuclear membrane and its interaction with lamin A support its role in maintaining nuclear structure and function (Czapiewski2022Genomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the TMEM120A gene have been linked to several metabolic disorders. TMEM120A disruption in mice leads to a condition resembling human familial partial lipodystrophy type 2 (FPLD2), characterized by insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, although without hyperlipidemia and hepatic steatosis (Czapiewski2022Genomic). The gene's deficiency affects lipid metabolism by mispositioning genes and enhancers, which suppresses lipid metabolism genes and induces myogenic gene expression, contributing to lipodystrophy (Czapiewski2022Genomic). 

In humans, TMEM120A expression is lower in the adipose tissue of obese individuals, with more pronounced effects in women, suggesting a role in adiposity spectrum disorders (Czapiewski2022Genomic). The gene is also implicated in the regulation of miRNA loci positioning during adipogenesis, affecting miRNAs associated with fatty acid metabolism and type 2 diabetes (Czapiewski2022Genomic). 

Additionally, TMEM120A has been studied for its potential role as a mechanically sensitive ion channel, though its exact function remains unclear. Its knockout in mice reduces mechanosensitivity and behavioral responses to mechanical pain, indicating a possible role in mechanical pain sensing (Kang2024Transmembrane).

## Interactions
TMEM120A, also known as TACAN, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It has been shown to interact with STING, promoting its translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, which suggests a potential antiviral function (Chen2023To). TMEM120A also interacts with lamin A, a component of the nuclear envelope, which is implicated in the organization of genomic loci. This interaction is significant in the context of adipocyte differentiation and lipodystrophy, as TMEM120A disruption leads to mispositioning of genomic loci and altered gene expression related to fat metabolism (Czapiewski2022Genomic).

The protein forms a tightly packed dimer, with extensive dimerization interactions mediated by its coiled-coil domain and transmembrane domain. These interactions are primarily through Van der Waals contacts, indicating a stable dimeric structure (Xue2021TMEM120A). TMEM120A's interaction with coenzyme A (CoASH) is also notable, as it binds CoASH within a deep cavity in its transmembrane domain, which may influence its function in lipid metabolism (Rong2021TMEM120A). These interactions highlight TMEM120A's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential impact on metabolic regulation.
