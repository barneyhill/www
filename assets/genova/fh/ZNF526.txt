# ZNF526

## Overview
ZNF526 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 526, a transcription factor characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding and regulation of gene expression. This protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis and mitochondrial function, which are essential for protein synthesis and energy metabolism, particularly in neural tissues. ZNF526 has been implicated in the regulation of genes involved in these pathways, and its activity is crucial for normal brain development and function. Mutations in ZNF526 have been associated with non-syndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability and breast cancer, highlighting its clinical significance. The protein's interaction with other transcription factors, such as PRKRIR, suggests its involvement in complex regulatory networks that may have evolved specifically in primates (Zhang2018A; abbasi2012identification).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZNF526 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. ZNF526 is implicated in non-syndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability (NS-ARID). Mutations such as p.R459Q and p.Q539H affect the DNA-binding capacity of the protein, potentially disrupting transcriptional regulation and contributing to intellectual disability. These mutations have been observed in patients from consanguineous Iranian families, highlighting the gene's role in brain development and cognitive function (abbasi2012identification).

ZNF526 is also associated with breast cancer. A missense variant, rs3810151, located within the ZNF526 gene, has been identified as significantly associated with breast cancer susceptibility. This variant results in a valine to alanine amino acid change, which slightly affects ZNF526 expression. The gene is upregulated in breast cancer samples, suggesting a role in breast tumorigenesis. Functional analyses indicate that ZNF526 is crucial for the survival of breast cancer cells, with its expression linked to poor prognosis (Zhang2018A).

Additionally, ZNF526 mutations have been identified in families with dysmorphology syndromes, although the specific clinical manifestations linked to these genetic alterations are not well understood (Shaheen2016Accelerating).

## Interactions
ZNF526 is a zinc finger protein that primarily functions as a transcription factor, binding to DNA and regulating gene expression. It has been shown to interact with PRKRIR, a transcription factor involved in protein kinase regulation. This interaction was identified using mass spectrometry in Hela cells, suggesting a role in primate-specific functions and evolutionary history (abbasi2012identification).

ZNF526 is involved in binding near transcription start sites and is implicated in processes such as ribosome biogenesis and mitochondrial function, which are crucial for protein synthesis and energy metabolism, particularly in the brain (abbasi2012identification). The protein's ability to bind DNA was confirmed through ChIP-seq technology, which identified 2476 peaks for the wild-type ZNF526, indicating its potential role as a repressor or activator of gene expression (abbasi2012identification).

Mutations in ZNF526, such as R459Q and Q539R, have been shown to affect its DNA-binding capacity, leading to altered gene expression patterns. These mutations disrupt the protein's ability to bind DNA specifically, suggesting a loss of function (abbasi2012identification).
