# SEC23A

## Overview
SEC23A is a gene that encodes the SEC23 homolog A, a critical component of the coat protein complex II (COPII) involved in vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. The SEC23A protein is categorized as a component of the COPII coat complex, playing a pivotal role in the formation and function of transport vesicles. It interacts with other proteins such as SEC24, Sar1, and ULK1, facilitating processes like membrane deformation and vesicle size determination. SEC23A is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is involved in autophagy, a process that helps cells adapt to stress conditions. Mutations in the SEC23A gene are linked to cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia (CLSD), a genetic disorder characterized by skeletal and craniofacial abnormalities, highlighting its clinical significance (Gan2017ULK1; Sun2022Sec23a; Bi2002Structure).

## Structure
The SEC23A protein is a component of the COPII vesicle coat complex, which is crucial for vesicle transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. The molecular structure of SEC23A includes several distinct domains: a β-barrel, a zinc finger, an α/β vWA or 'trunk' domain, an all-helical region, and a carboxy-terminal domain resembling a gelsolin module (Bi2002Structure). The β-barrel is formed from approximately 180 residues and is constructed from two apposed sheets, while the zinc-finger domains are located at the periphery of the complex, contributing to the basic inner surface (Bi2002Structure).

The tertiary structure of SEC23A involves the folding of these domains into a three-dimensional shape, facilitating its interaction with other proteins in the COPII complex. SEC23A forms a heterodimer with Sec24, and this complex interacts with Sar1, playing a role in membrane deformation and vesicle size determination (Bi2002Structure). The quaternary structure is characterized by its interaction with other COPII components, such as Sec24 and Sar1, forming a pre-budding complex essential for vesicle formation (Bi2002Structure).

Post-translational modifications and splice variants may influence SEC23A's function and localization, although specific details on these aspects are not provided in the context.

## Function
SEC23A is a critical component of the coat protein complex II (COPII), which is essential for the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. This process is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient protein export. SEC23A functions as part of the COPII coat, facilitating the formation of vesicles that carry proteins through the secretory pathway (Sun2022Sec23a).

In healthy human cells, SEC23A plays a significant role in protein and lipid transport, impacting the sorting and trafficking of proteins. It is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other COPII components to ensure proper vesicle formation and function. This activity is crucial for the maintenance of cellular processes and overall organismal health (Cheng2023SEC23A).

SEC23A is also involved in autophagy, a cellular process that helps cells adapt to stress conditions. It interacts with proteins like ULK1, which phosphorylates SEC23A, affecting its role in ER-to-Golgi traffic during autophagy. This interaction highlights SEC23A's involvement in regulating cellular responses to nutrient deprivation and stress, further underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis (Gan2017ULK1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SEC23A gene are associated with cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia (CLSD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by late-closing fontanels, skeletal defects, facial dysmorphism, and sutural cataracts. CLSD can be inherited in both autosomal recessive (AR-CLSD) and autosomal dominant (AD-CLSD) patterns. In AR-CLSD, patients often present with congenital cataracts, developmental retardation, and craniofacial abnormalities, while AD-CLSD may include unique neuropsychiatric features such as intellectual disability and motor tics (Minale2024First; Lu2020Consequences; Wang2023Novel).

The SEC23A gene encodes a component of the COPII complex, crucial for vesicle formation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Pathogenic variants in SEC23A impair vesicle formation, leading to the accumulation of secretory material and triggering endoplasmic reticulum stress, which contributes to the CLSD phenotype (Minale2024First). In mice, SEC23A deficiency results in embryonic lethality and developmental abnormalities, such as neural tube defects and exencephaly, due to impaired collagen secretion (Zhu2015Neural).

Alterations in SEC23A expression have also been implicated in medullary thyroid carcinoma, where decreased SEC23A expression, mediated by miR-375, enhances the efficacy of the cancer treatment drug vandetanib (Lassalle2016MicroRNA375SEC23A).

## Interactions
SEC23A, a component of the COPII vesicle coat, interacts with several proteins to facilitate vesicle transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. It forms a complex with SEC24, SEC13, and SEC31, which are essential for the assembly of the COPII coat (Bi2002Structure). SEC23A specifically interacts with Sar1, a small GTPase, through hydrophobic and polar interactions. This interaction is crucial for GTP hydrolysis and coat disassembly, with SEC23A acting as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Sar1 (Bi2002Structure).

SEC23A also interacts with ULK1, which phosphorylates SEC23A at serine 207 and threonine 405. This phosphorylation weakens the interaction between SEC23A and SEC31A, particularly during autophagy induced by amino acid starvation (Gan2017ULK1). The interaction with SEC31A is further modulated by specific mutations at these phosphorylation sites, affecting ER-to-Golgi traffic (Gan2017ULK1).

In gastric cancer cells, SEC23A interacts with Annexin A2 (ANXA2), promoting its localization to the plasma membrane and enhancing autophagy, which is crucial for ER stress resistance (Cheng2023SEC23A). Additionally, SEC23A interacts with Myotubularin 2 (MTM2) in Arabidopsis, negatively regulating autophagy at ER exit sites (Li2024Myotubularin).
