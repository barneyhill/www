# BRICD5

## Overview
BRICD5 is a gene that encodes the protein BRICHOS domain containing 5, which is part of the BRICHOS domain family. This protein family is known for its involvement in various cellular processes, including protein folding and aggregation prevention. The BRICHOS domain containing 5 protein is implicated in several biological pathways, particularly those related to cancer progression and immune response modulation. Research has highlighted its potential role as a biomarker in lung and pancreatic cancers, where its expression and methylation status may influence disease risk and prognosis (Zhao2021Epigenomewide; Gao2022Interplay). The gene's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in understanding cancer biology and developing targeted therapeutic strategies.

## Clinical Significance
BRICD5 has been implicated in various diseases through its altered expression and potential role in cancer. In the context of lung cancer, BRICD5 is associated with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that are linked to lung cancer risk. These associations are not primarily driven by smoking history, suggesting that BRICD5 may play a role in lung cancer development independent of smoking-related factors (Zhao2021Epigenomewide). The study by Zhao et al. highlights the potential of BRICD5 as a biomarker for lung cancer risk stratification, indicating that variations in its methylation may reflect genetic susceptibility to lung cancer or result from other environmental risk factors (Zhao2021Epigenomewide).

In pancreatic cancer, BRICD5 is included in a prognostic model based on RNA modification writers. This model, known as the WM_Score, correlates with worse prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients, suggesting that BRICD5 may be involved in pathways related to cancer progression and immune suppression (Gao2022Interplay). These findings underscore the clinical significance of BRICD5 in cancer, although specific diseases or conditions directly associated with mutations or expression level changes in BRICD5 are not detailed in the available studies.
