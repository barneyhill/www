# TBCCD1

## Overview
TBCCD1 is a gene that encodes the protein TBCC domain containing 1, which plays a pivotal role in cellular architecture and function. This protein is primarily involved in the organization and stabilization of microtubules (MTs) and is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of centriole appendages and anchoring motile cilia basal bodies in human cells. TBCC domain containing 1 is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein due to its involvement in centrosome positioning, cilia assembly, and cell division. It localizes at centrioles, particularly at their proximal and distal regions, and is essential for the correct positioning and orientation of basal bodies at the plasma membrane, which is critical for ciliogenesis. The protein interacts with a network of other proteins associated with centriole and cilium assembly, contributing to the structural organization and function of centrioles (Carmona2023The).

## Function
The TBCCD1 gene encodes a protein that is crucial for maintaining centriole appendages and anchoring motile cilia basal bodies in healthy human cells. TBCCD1 is involved in several cellular processes, including centrosome positioning, cilia assembly, cell division, and microtubule (MT) organization. It plays a significant role in the maintenance of the distal and subdistal appendages of the mother centriole, which are essential for MT anchoring and stability (Carmona2023The).

TBCCD1 localizes at both centrioles, particularly at the proximal and distal regions, and is involved in the organization of the MT network. Its depletion leads to centrosome mispositioning and loss of MT aster organization, affecting cell morphology and function (Carmona2023The). TBCCD1 is also essential for the correct positioning, orientation, and anchoring of basal bodies at the plasma membrane, which is critical for ciliogenesis (Carmona2023The).

The protein interacts with a network of proteins associated with centriole and cilium assembly, contributing to the structural organization and function of centrioles. TBCCD1's role in MT anchoring and organization is supported by its ability to recruit proteins involved in these processes, highlighting its importance in centrosome function and cellular architecture (Carmona2023The).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TBCCD1 is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with proteins such as CEP170 and Ninein, which are important for microtubule (MT) anchoring at the centrosome. These interactions are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the distal and subdistal appendages of the mother centriole, impacting MT organization and stability (Carmona2023The). TBCCD1 also interacts with CEP350, a protein involved in the assembly of distal appendages and MT anchoring, suggesting a role in stabilizing these structures (Carmona2023The).

The protein is part of a complex network that includes interactions with proteins such as CEP162, OFD1, PCM1, RPGRIP1L, and SSX2IP, which are associated with cilium assembly and organization (Carmona2023The). TBCCD1's proximity interactome is enriched in centrosomal, cytoskeletal, and ciliary proteins, indicating its involvement in a broad range of cellular functions related to the centrosome and cilia (Carmona2023The).

In Trypanosoma brucei, TBCCD1 is associated with the microtubule barrels of mature and pro-basal bodies, indicating its role in cytoskeletal filament formation (André2013Tubulinbinding).
