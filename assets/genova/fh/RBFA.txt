# RBFA

## Overview
The RBFA gene encodes the ribosome-binding factor A, a mitochondrial RNA-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in the maturation of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (mt-SSU). This protein is characterized by its RNA-binding 'KH' domains, which facilitate interactions with the 12S rRNA, particularly near the 3' terminal region, aiding in the dimethylation of adenines essential for ribosomal function (Rozanska2017The). Although structurally related to bacterial RbfA proteins, the human RBFA protein is larger and contains unique N- and C-terminal extensions, suggesting evolutionary divergence and potentially distinct functional roles (Rozanska2017The). Despite its critical involvement in ribosome biogenesis, RBFA depletion does not immediately impact mitochondrial translation or oxidative phosphorylation, although it does result in a cellular growth defect, the underlying mechanisms of which remain to be elucidated (Rozanska2017The).

## Structure
The human RBFA protein is structurally related to its bacterial counterparts but is significantly larger, consisting of 343 amino acids with a molecular mass of 38 kDa (Rozanska2017The). The protein contains RNA-binding 'KH' domains, which are located in the central portion of the protein, spanning amino acids 88-198. These domains exhibit a type II KH domain fold, characterized by three helices and three β-strands (Rozanska2017The). The KH domains are known for their ability to mediate both protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions (Huang2003Solution).

The human RBFA protein has substantial N- and C-terminal extensions beyond the KH domains, which are not present in bacterial RbfA proteins. These extensions may confer additional or different functions compared to the bacterial protein, suggesting evolutionary divergence in function (Rozanska2017The). The protein is associated with the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (mt-SSU) and has been confirmed as a mitochondrial protein through western blot analysis (Rozanska2017The). The RNA-binding capacity of RBFA is retained, with a preference for binding to the 12S rRNA, particularly near the 3' terminal region, which is consistent with its role in ribosomal RNA processing (Rozanska2017The).

## Function
The human ribosome-binding factor A (RBFA) is a mitochondrial RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in the maturation of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically the small ribosomal subunit (mt-SSU). RBFA is predominantly localized in mitochondria, where it binds to the 12S rRNA, particularly at the 3' terminal region, facilitating its maturation (Rozanska2017The). It promotes the dimethylation of tandem adenines in helix h45 of the 12S rRNA, a modification essential for the proper assembly and function of the mt-SSU (Rozanska2017The). This dimethylation is not directly performed by RBFA but is facilitated by its binding, which exposes the adenines for methylation (Rozanska2017The).

RBFA's role extends to ensuring the quality control of ribosome biogenesis, as it helps in the proper modification of 12S rRNA, which is necessary for the association of the small and large ribosomal subunits to form a functional monosome (Rozanska2017The). Despite its critical role in ribosome maturation, RBFA depletion does not immediately affect mitochondrial translation or oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity, although it does lead to a cellular growth defect, the cause of which remains unclear (Rozanska2017The).

## Interactions
The human RNA-binding protein RBFA is primarily associated with the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (mt-SSU), where it binds almost exclusively to the 12S rRNA, particularly near the 3' terminal region. This interaction is mediated by its KH domains, which are structurally similar to those found in bacterial RBFA proteins, despite low sequence identity (Rozanska2017The). RBFA's binding to the mt-SSU facilitates the dimethylation of tandem adenines in helix h45 of the 12S rRNA, promoting structural rearrangements that make these adenines more accessible for methylation. Although RBFA is not directly responsible for the methyltransferase activity, its presence is crucial for the final stages of 12S rRNA maturation (Rozanska2017The).

RBFA also interacts with other proteins during ribosome biogenesis. It is known to interact with ERAL1, which binds to helix 45 prior to RBFA during the assembly of the mt-SSU. This interaction sequence suggests a coordinated role in ribosome maturation, ensuring the quality of ribosomal subunits (Rozanska2017The). These interactions highlight RBFA's significant role in mitochondrial ribosome maturation and its potential differences in function compared to its bacterial counterparts.
