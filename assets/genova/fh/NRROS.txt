# NRROS

## Overview
The NRROS gene, also known as Lrrc33, encodes the negative regulator of reactive oxygen species, a leucine-rich repeat-containing transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in immune regulation. This protein is primarily expressed in myeloid cells and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it interacts with the NOX2 complex, a key component of the NADPH oxidase system responsible for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. By facilitating the degradation of NOX2 through the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, NRROS helps maintain a balance in ROS levels, which is crucial for effective pathogen defense while preventing excessive tissue damage during inflammatory responses (Noubade2014NRROS). Additionally, NRROS is involved in the processing and activation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, influencing Toll-like receptor signaling and microglial function, thereby underscoring its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and immune regulation (Smith2020Biallelic).

## Structure
The NRROS protein, also known as the negative regulator of reactive oxygen species, is characterized by a specific molecular structure that includes several key domains. It contains a signal sequence, 21 putative leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain (Noubade2014NRROS). The LRR domains are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, which may be crucial for its function in regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. NRROS is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it interacts with the NOX2 monomer, a component of the NADPH oxidase complex, facilitating its degradation through the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (Noubade2014NRROS).

The protein's interaction with NOX2 suggests a role in maintaining the stability and degradation of this complex, although specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of NRROS are not provided in the available context. The study does not mention any post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of NRROS. The focus is primarily on its functional domains and their role in ROS regulation (Noubade2014NRROS).

## Function
The NRROS gene, also known as Lrrc33, encodes a protein that functions as a negative regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in phagocytes, which are crucial components of the immune system. In healthy human cells, NRROS is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a significant role in controlling ROS levels during inflammatory responses (Noubade2014NRROS).

NRROS interacts with the NOX2 complex, a key component in ROS production, facilitating the degradation of NOX2 through the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This interaction is essential for maintaining a balance in ROS production, ensuring that ROS levels are sufficient for effective pathogen defense while preventing excessive tissue damage (Noubade2014NRROS).

In NRROS-deficient cells, there is an increase in ROS production, which enhances bactericidal activity but can also lead to oxidative tissue damage. This suggests that NRROS is crucial for modulating ROS levels to prevent damage during immune responses (Noubade2014NRROS). The regulation of ROS by NRROS is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing inflammation and tissue injury (Noubade2014NRROS).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NRROS gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. NRROS plays a critical role in regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis. Deficiency in NRROS leads to increased ROS production, enhancing the bactericidal activity of phagocytes against pathogens such as E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. However, this heightened ROS production can also result in oxidative tissue damage, contributing to the development of severe autoimmune conditions like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Noubade2014NRROS).

NRROS interacts with the NOX2 complex, a key component in ROS production, by facilitating the degradation of NOX2 through the ER-associated degradation pathway. This interaction is crucial for preventing excessive ROS accumulation and subsequent tissue damage. In NRROS-deficient cells, increased stability and accumulation of NOX2 and p22 phox proteins lead to dysregulated ROS levels, which may influence the pathogenesis of diseases where ROS are implicated, such as autoimmune disorders (Noubade2014NRROS). These findings suggest that targeting the NRROS-NOX2 pathway could offer therapeutic potential for modulating ROS production in various diseases characterized by oxidative stress and immune dysregulation.

## Interactions
NRROS, a leucine-rich repeat-containing transmembrane protein, is primarily expressed in myeloid cells and plays a significant role in regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. It interacts with NOX2, a component of the NADPH oxidase complex, facilitating its degradation through the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This interaction is crucial for controlling ROS levels during inflammatory responses (Noubade2014NRROS).

NRROS also interacts with several molecular chaperones and ERAD pathway mediators, including calnexin, UGGT, HYOU1, and EDEM1. These interactions suggest a role for NRROS in protein biosynthesis and ER quality control, particularly in the degradation of NOX2 monomers (Noubade2018Proteomic). Calnexin is identified as a high-confidence interactor, indicating a significant role in the NRROS interactome (Noubade2018Proteomic).

In addition to its role in ROS regulation, NRROS is involved in the processing and activation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β through interactions with its latent complex, influencing Toll-like receptor signaling and microglial function within the central nervous system (Smith2020Biallelic). These interactions highlight NRROS's multifaceted role in immune regulation and cellular homeostasis.
