# GPR18

## Overview
GPR18 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 18, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including immune response regulation, cellular migration, and reproductive functions. GPR18 is activated by endogenous ligands such as N-arachidonoyl glycine (NAGly) and Resolvin D2 (RvD2), which modulate intracellular signaling pathways. The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the immune system, central nervous system, and reproductive organs, where it plays roles in inflammation resolution, neuroprotection, and sperm motility. GPR18's interactions with other proteins, particularly within the endocannabinoid system, and its involvement in disease processes such as cancer, inflammation, and neurodegeneration, highlight its potential as a therapeutic target (ReyesResina2018Molecular; Morales2020Therapeutic; McHugh2012GPR18).

## Structure
GPR18 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane helices, a common feature of class A, rhodopsin-like GPCRs (Neumann2020Computational). The primary structure of GPR18 includes specific residues that play crucial roles in its function, such as R3.50 and S6.33, which form a weak 'ionic lock' that is important for G protein activation (Morales2020Therapeutic; Sotudeh2019Towards). The secondary structure involves transmembrane helices, with TMH6 being particularly important for transitioning between inactive and active states (Sotudeh2019Towards).

The tertiary structure of GPR18 includes a sodium-binding pocket formed by residues N40 1.50, D68 2.50, and D282 7.49, which is significant for its function (Michalik2022Structure). The receptor also features a toggle switch involving residues F6.48, M7.42, H6.52, and Y3.35, which undergoes conformational changes upon ligand binding, leading to receptor activation (Sotudeh2019Towards). The presence of bulky residues I3.46 and I6.37 above the ionic lock contributes to the receptor's high basal activity (Sotudeh2019Towards).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may affect the receptor's function and localization, although specific modifications for GPR18 are not detailed in the provided context. The receptor's structure and interactions are crucial for understanding its role in physiological processes and potential therapeutic applications.

## Function
GPR18 is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes, including immune response regulation, cellular migration, and reproductive functions. It is highly expressed in human sperm, where it plays a crucial role in sperm motility and fertilization by reorganizing actin filaments and inducing acrosomal exocytosis (Flegel2016Characterization). In the immune system, GPR18 is expressed in lymphocytes and is implicated in microglial-neuronal communication, potentially influencing microglial migration and phenotypic changes (McHugh2012GPR18). 

GPR18 is activated by endogenous ligands such as N-arachidonoyl glycine (NAGly) and Resolvin D2 (RvD2), which influence intracellular signaling pathways, including the inhibition of cAMP production and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ (Morales2020Therapeutic). The receptor is involved in the resolution of inflammation by promoting macrophage efferocytosis and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (Morales2020Therapeutic). 

In the central nervous system, GPR18 is expressed in microglial cells, where it modulates cell migration and cytokine production, potentially impacting neurodegenerative diseases (Morales2020Therapeutic). Its role in corneal epithelial cells includes promoting chemotaxis and proliferation, contributing to wound healing (Murataeva2019Evidence).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the GPR18 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In cancer, GPR18 plays a complex role; it may act as a protective factor in certain cancers like hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer, but is overexpressed in melanoma metastases, where its blockade enhances apoptosis (Morales2020Therapeutic; Li2022Therapeutic). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, higher GPR18 expression is associated with better prognosis, suggesting a protective role against cancer progression (Mattoscio2022Gene).

GPR18 is also implicated in inflammatory conditions. Low expression levels in septic patients correlate with increased severity and poorer prognosis, indicating its potential as a marker for sepsis outcomes (Morales2020Therapeutic). In metabolic disorders, GPR18 expression is linked to reduced hypothalamic inflammation and improved glucose tolerance, suggesting a role in obesity and type 2 diabetes (RamírezOrozco2019Potential).

In the central nervous system, GPR18 influences microglial migration and cytokine production, potentially affecting neurodegenerative diseases (McHugh2010Narachidonoyl). Dysregulation of GPR18-mediated microglial migration can lead to excessive pro-inflammatory responses, contributing to conditions like multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (ÖzArslan2024Exploring).

## Interactions
GPR18, a G protein-coupled receptor, is known to interact with other proteins, particularly within the context of the endocannabinoid system. It forms heteroreceptor complexes with the cannabinoid CB2 receptor, but not with the CB1 receptor. This interaction is characterized by negative cross-talk and cross-antagonism, where the activation of one receptor can reduce the signaling of the other, and the response of one receptor can be blocked by a selective antagonist of the partner receptor (ReyesResina2018Molecular). 

In microglial cells, GPR18 and CB2 receptor complexes have been shown to influence signaling pathways such as cAMP and MAPK. The presence of these complexes suggests a role in modulating neurodegenerative processes, as observed in models of Alzheimer's disease (ReyesResina2018Molecular). 

GPR18 also interacts with endogenous ligands like N-arachidonoyl glycine (NAGly), which can activate the receptor and mediate neuroprotective effects. This interaction is particularly significant in the context of neuroprotection against HIV-1 Tat-induced neurodegeneration, where GPR18 activity is crucial for the protective effects of FAAH inhibition (Hermes2021GPR18). These interactions highlight GPR18's potential as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases.
