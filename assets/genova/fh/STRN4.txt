# STRN4

## Overview
STRN4 is a gene that encodes the protein striatin 4, a member of the striatin family of scaffold proteins. Striatin 4 is characterized by its involvement in the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex, which plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways, including the Hippo pathway. This protein is integral to the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue homeostasis, acting as a positive regulator of the YAP protein, a key effector in the Hippo pathway (Seo2020MAP4K). Striatin 4 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it is essential for maintaining dendritic spine morphology and synaptic function through its interaction with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (Lin2017Determination). The gene's expression and function are implicated in various cancers and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in both oncogenic processes and neurodevelopmental conditions (Li2023Cellular; Lin2017Determination).

## Structure
STRN4, also known as zinedin, is a member of the striatin family of proteins, which are characterized by several conserved domains that facilitate their role as scaffolding proteins. The primary structure of STRN4 includes a caveolin-binding domain, a coiled-coil domain, a Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain, and a tryptophan-aspartate (WD)-repeat domain (Lin2017Determination; Hwang2014STRIPAK). These domains are crucial for the protein's interaction capabilities and structural stability.

The coiled-coil domain is essential for oligomerization, which is necessary for binding to protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (Hwang2014STRIPAK). The WD-repeat domain forms β-propeller structures that facilitate interactions with various proteins, including Mob3 and CCT/TRiC chaperonin proteins, and is implicated in estrogen receptor signaling (Hwang2014STRIPAK).

STRN4 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and plays a role in maintaining dendritic spine morphology, particularly mushroom spines, through its interaction with PP2A (Lin2017Determination). The local expression of STRN4 is regulated by NMDA receptor activation, which is crucial for spine maturation (Lin2017Determination). The protein's involvement in forming STRIPAK complexes highlights its role in organizing signaling pathways and influencing cellular processes such as cell cycle control and apoptosis (Hwang2014STRIPAK).

## Function
STRN4 (striatin 4) is a scaffold protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling and structural organization within healthy human cells. It is a component of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex, which is involved in the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for controlling organ size by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. STRN4 modulates the MAP4K-LATS1/2 kinase cascade, acting as a positive regulator of YAP, a downstream effector in the Hippo pathway, thereby maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell growth (Seo2020MAP4K).

In neurons, STRN4 is involved in the regulation of dendritic spine morphology, particularly in maintaining mushroom-shaped spines through its interaction with the phosphatase PP2A. This interaction is essential for proper synaptic function and cognitive processes, as STRN4 expression is dependent on NMDA receptor activity and is enriched in mushroom spines (Lin2017Determination). STRN4's role in these processes highlights its importance in both cellular signaling and structural maintenance, contributing to the overall homeostasis and functionality of cells in the human body.

## Clinical Significance
The STRN4 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in the STRIPAK complex, which influences key signaling pathways. In pancreatic cancer, STRN4 expression is linked to reduced cell growth and spreading, and its knockdown increases sensitivity to gemcitabine, a chemotherapy drug (Li2023Cellular). In colorectal cancer, STRN4 knockdown affects cell cycle progression and apoptosis, reducing cell proliferation. MicroRNA-873, a good prognostic indicator, restrains STRN4 expression, inhibiting cancer progression (Li2023Cellular). In endometrial cancer, high STRN4 expression correlates with YAP activation, suggesting its role as an oncogenic factor (Seo2020MAP4K).

STRN4 is also involved in neurological conditions. It plays a role in dendritic spine morphology, and its dysfunction may contribute to altered neuronal connectivity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Lin2017Determination). STRN4 mRNA is a putative cargo of FMRP, and its dysregulation could lead to immature spine phenotypes in ASD (Lin2017Determination).

Overall, alterations in STRN4 expression or its interactions can significantly impact cancer progression and neurological disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
STRN4, also known as striatin 4, is a scaffold protein that participates in various protein interactions, primarily as a component of the STRIPAK complex. This complex includes protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and multiple kinases, such as MINK1, TNIK, and MAP4K4, which are involved in tumor suppression or progression (Lin2017Determination; Wong2014Silencing). STRN4 acts as a regulatory subunit for PP2A, influencing its activity and substrate specificity, which is crucial for maintaining dendritic spine morphology (Lin2017Determination).

STRN4 interacts with MAP4Ks, except for MAP4K5, and plays a critical role in mediating the inhibition of MAP4Ks by the STRIPAK complex, thereby regulating the Hippo pathway. This interaction is essential for the activation of YAP, a downstream effector, and is facilitated by the C-terminal WD repeat region of STRN4 (Seo2020MAP4K). STRN4's interaction with MAP4Ks suggests its role as an adaptor, recruiting STRIPAK to inhibit MAP4Ks, which affects the activation of YAP/TAZ, key effectors in the Hippo pathway (Seo2020MAP4K).

In neurons, STRN4 is expressed in dendritic spines and interacts with PP2A to maintain spine morphology, which is crucial for normal cognitive function and is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (Lin2017Determination).
