# BORCS7

## Overview
BORCS7 is a gene that encodes the protein BLOC-1 related complex subunit 7, which is a critical component of the BORC (BLOC-one-related complex). This protein is involved in the regulation of lysosomal positioning and movement within cells, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as autophagy and endosomal trafficking. As a part of the BORC complex, BLOC-1 related complex subunit 7 facilitates the kinesin-dependent transport of lysosomes along microtubules, ensuring their proper distribution and function within the cell. This transport is essential for the fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes, a key step in maintaining autophagic flux. Additionally, BORCS7 is implicated in immune regulation through its involvement in TLR7 signaling pathways. The gene's expression and function have been linked to various clinical conditions, including schizophrenia, autoimmune diseases like lupus, and cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric disorders (Hartwig2017Neurodevelopmental; Mishra2023Endosome; Jia2017BORC).

## Function
BORCS7, a component of the BORC complex, plays a crucial role in lysosome positioning and movement within cells. It is involved in the regulation of lysosomal transport along microtubules, which is essential for various cellular processes such as autophagy and endocytosis (Jia2017BORC). BORCS7 facilitates the kinesin-dependent movement of lysosomes toward the cell periphery, enabling their encounter and fusion with autophagosomes, a critical step in the autophagic process (Jia2017BORC). This movement is independent of MTORC1 signaling changes and is crucial for maintaining autophagic flux by promoting the fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes (Jia2017BORC).

In addition to its role in autophagy, BORCS7 is involved in endosomal trafficking, particularly in the context of TLR7 signaling and immune regulation. The BORC-Arl8b complex, which includes BORCS7, is essential for the proper fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes, thereby regulating TLR7 turnover and preventing its accumulation, which could lead to dysregulated immune responses (Mishra2023Endosome). BORCS7 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with lysosomal membranes, where it contributes to the proper positioning and function of lysosomes in healthy human cells (Mishra2023Endosome).

## Clinical Significance
BORCS7 is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in lysosomal positioning and cellular transport processes. Alterations in BORCS7 expression or function have been associated with schizophrenia, as it is located at a principal genetic risk locus for the disorder. A polymorphism in this region increases BORCS7 expression, suggesting its involvement in schizophrenia pathogenesis (Hartwig2017Neurodevelopmental).

BORCS7 is also linked to autoimmune diseases, particularly lupus. Mutations or deletions in BORC subunits, including BORCS7, lead to enhanced TLR7 signaling, a driver of autoimmune conditions. This dysregulation results in unrestrained TLR7 activity, contributing to lupus development (Mishra2023Endosome).

In the context of cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric disorders, BORCS7 is identified as a genome-wide risk gene for conditions such as major depressive disorder (MDD), stroke, and coronary artery disease (CAD). Genetic studies suggest that BORCS7 may influence dopaminergic function, which is relevant to both MDD and stroke (Zhang2021Shared).

Overall, BORCS7's involvement in these conditions highlights its clinical significance in both neurodevelopmental and autoimmune disorders, as well as its potential impact on cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric health.

## Interactions
BORCS7, a subunit of the BORC complex, is involved in lysosome positioning and movement. It is part of a hetero-octameric complex that includes other subunits such as BORCS5, BORCS6, BORCS8, KXD1, and shares components like SNAPIN, BLOC1S1, and BLOC1S2 with the BLOC-1 complex (Hartwig2017Neurodevelopmental). The BORC complex interacts with the small GTPase ARL8, which is crucial for coupling lysosomes to kinesin motors, facilitating their transport within cells (De2024Messenger). This interaction is essential for the movement of lysosome-related vesicles, particularly in neurons, where it supports axonal transport and mitochondrial homeostasis (De2024Messenger).

While specific physical interactions of BORCS7 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided excerpts, BORCS7 is implied to be part of the BORC complex that interacts with ARL8 and PLEKHM2 to mediate lysosomal transport (De2024Messenger). The BORC complex also plays a role in autophagosome-lysosome fusion, independent of MTORC1 signaling, and is involved in the kinesin-dependent movement of lysosomes (Jia2017BORC).
