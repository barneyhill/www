# FBXO47

## Overview
FBXO47 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 47, a member of the F-box protein family, which is characterized by an F-box motif that mediates protein-protein interactions. This protein is a crucial component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in the regulation of protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. F-box protein 47 plays a significant role in maintaining centromere integrity and stability during meiosis, particularly in the context of chromosome synapsis and double-strand break repair. It interacts with key proteins such as CENP-C and HORMAD1 to ensure proper centromere function and genomic stability. The gene's function is primarily nuclear, and its activity is essential for the progression of meiosis, with implications for male fertility and potential associations with genetic disorders (Zhuang2024The; Ma2024FBXO47).

## Function
FBXO47 is a crucial component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a significant role in maintaining centromere integrity and stability during meiosis. In healthy cells, FBXO47 is localized at the centromeres of chromosomes, where it is involved in centromere pairing and synaptic stability. It interacts with CENP-C, a key protein for centromere function, to stabilize centromeres, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Ma2024FBXO47). FBXO47 also regulates the ubiquitination of SKP1, another component of the SCF complex, thereby maintaining its expression and ensuring proper centromere pairing and progression through meiosis (Ma2024FBXO47).

FBXO47 is involved in the regulation of HORMAD1, promoting its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for proper chromosome synapsis and double-strand break (DSB) repair. In the absence of FBXO47, HORMAD1 remains on chromosomes longer than normal, leading to defective DSB repair and unpaired centromeres, which can result in cell death (Ma2024FBXO47). The protein's activity is primarily nuclear, where it contributes to genomic stability by regulating key proteins involved in chromosome pairing and repair during meiosis (Ma2024FBXO47).

## Clinical Significance
FBXO47 is implicated in the regulation of telomere-inner nuclear envelope integration during spermatogenesis. In mice, knockout of the Fbxo47 gene results in reduced testes weight and the presence of abnormal spermatocyte-like cells in seminiferous tubules. These cells are arrested at a late-zygotene stage, characterized by incomplete chromosomal synapsis and impaired DNA double-strand repair. The knockout spermatocytes fail to attach to the nuclear envelope due to disrupted interactions with telomere restriction fragments TRF2 and TRF1, which are decreased in expression in the knockout testis. This disruption indicates that FBXO47 is crucial for telomere function during the bouquet stage of meiosis. The absence of XY bodies in knockout spermatocytes further suggests its role in the formation of XY bodies, highlighting its importance in meiosis and potential implications in male infertility (Zhuang2024The).

In a study investigating genetic associations with multiple system atrophy (MSA) in a Chinese population, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in FBXO47, rs78523330, was analyzed. However, no significant differences in genotype distributions or minor allele frequency were found between MSA patients and healthy controls, suggesting that this SNP does not confer a significant risk for MSA in this population (Gu2018Analysis).

## Interactions
FBXO47, also known as F-box protein 47, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in meiosis. It is a component of the centromeric SCF (SKP1-Cullin-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it interacts with SKP1 to ensure proper centromere pairing and chromosome synapsis during meiosis in mouse spermatocytes (Ma2024FBXO47). This interaction is essential for maintaining centromere stability and proper synapsis, as FBXO47 stabilizes SKP1 by reducing its ubiquitination (Ma2024FBXO47).

FBXO47 also interacts with HORMAD1, a protein involved in chromosome synapsis and double-strand break (DSB) formation. It promotes the degradation of HORMAD1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for proper chromosome synapsis and DSB repair (Ma2024FBXO47). Additionally, FBXO47 has been shown to interact with CENP-C, a key component of centromeres, suggesting a role in centromere stabilization (Ma2024FBXO47).

Despite these interactions, some studies have reported discrepancies regarding FBXO47's association with the SCF complex, as certain experiments failed to detect SKP1 in FBXO47 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that FBXO47 may function independently of the SCF complex in some contexts (Tanno2021FBXO47).
