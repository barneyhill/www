# PKDREJ

## Overview
The PKDREJ gene encodes a protein known as the polycystin family receptor for egg jelly, which is a member of the polycystin family and functions as a receptor. This protein is primarily expressed in the testes and plays a crucial role in sperm-egg interactions during fertilization. Structurally, the PKDREJ protein is characterized by its complex architecture, including multiple domains such as a receptor for egg jelly (REJ) module, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) proteolytic site domain, and a polycystin-1, lipoxygenase, alpha-toxin (PLAT) domain, which suggest its involvement in the acrosome reaction, a key event in fertilization (Butscheid2006Polycystic; Hughes1999Identification). The protein is predicted to have an integral membrane structure with 11 transmembrane regions, indicating its role as a transmembrane receptor (Hughes1999Identification). PKDREJ interacts with polycystin-2 family members and modulates G protein signaling, highlighting its significance in sperm physiology and fertilization processes (Sutton2006Functional). Despite its critical role in reproduction, PKDREJ has not been associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), distinguishing it from other polycystin family members (Veldhuisen1999Genes).

## Structure
The PKDREJ protein is a member of the polycystin family and is characterized by a complex molecular structure. It consists of 2253 amino acids in humans, with a calculated unglycosylated molecular mass of 255 kDa (Hughes1999Identification). The protein includes a cleavable signal peptide, a receptor for egg jelly (REJ) module, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) proteolytic site domain (GPS), and a polycystin-1, lipoxygenase, alpha-toxin (PLAT) domain (Butscheid2006Polycystic). The REJ module, which is approximately 1000 amino acids long, is homologous to a region in the sea urchin suREJ protein and is involved in the acrosome reaction during fertilization (Hughes1999Identification).

The PKDREJ protein is predicted to have an integral membrane structure with 11 transmembrane regions, the last six of which are homologous to those in polycystin-2 (Hughes1999Identification). It also contains a large extracellular N-terminal domain with leucine-rich repeats, a C-lectin-like domain, tandem PKD repeats, and a latrophilin domain (Sutton2006Functional). The protein's structure suggests it may function as a cation channel, similar to mucolipins, a subfamily of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels (Butscheid2006Polycystic).

## Function
The PKDREJ gene encodes a protein that is part of the polycystin-1 family, which is involved in sperm-egg interactions during fertilization. PKDREJ is specifically expressed in the testes and localizes to the acrosomal region of spermatozoa, suggesting its role in the acrosome reaction, a critical exocytotic event necessary for fertilization (Hamm2007Evidence; Sutton2006Functional). The protein is thought to modulate G protein signaling and interacts with members of the polycystin-2 family, indicating its involvement in regulating sperm physiology and the acrosome reaction (Sutton2006Functional).

PKDREJ is believed to function as a sperm surface receptor for egg zona pellucida glycoproteins, which are crucial for sperm-egg recognition and the acrosome reaction (Hamm2007Evidence). The protein's architecture includes regions that may mediate membrane attachment, supporting its role in cellular interactions (Hamm2007Evidence). In humans, PKDREJ has undergone adaptive evolution, with specific codons showing signs of positive selection, suggesting its importance in maintaining interactions with rapidly evolving egg-coat proteins (Hamm2007Evidence). Despite its critical role, the specific functional characteristics of PKDREJ in sperm signal transduction remain not fully reported (Sutton2006Functional).

## Clinical Significance
The PKDREJ gene, located on chromosome 22, encodes a protein that is homologous to polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, and is primarily expressed in the testis. Despite its homology to these proteins, PKDREJ has not been linked to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in studied families, suggesting it is not responsible for this condition (Veldhuisen1999Genes). 

Research indicates that PKDREJ may play a role in sperm function and fertilization, potentially affecting fertility if its function is disrupted. Male mice with a targeted mutation in the Pkdrej allele exhibit reduced reproductive success due to delayed sperm capacitation, although they remain fertile (Hofherr2010TRPP). This suggests that alterations in PKDREJ expression or function could impact male fertility, although specific diseases or conditions resulting from such alterations have not been directly identified (Sutton2006Functional).

In a study of a family with keratoconus, PKDREJ was detected under an autosomal recessive model with uncertain significance, but it was not expressed in normal human corneal fibroblasts, and no significant differences were found in its associated genes between affected and normal cells. This suggests PKDREJ is not the pathogenic gene in this context (Hao2020Multilevel).

## Interactions
PKDREJ, a member of the polycystin family, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in sperm physiology. It interacts with polycystin-2 proteins, specifically PKD2 and PKD2L1, which are expressed in the testis. These interactions suggest a physiological relevance, potentially influencing processes such as the acrosome reaction, a critical event in fertilization (Sutton2006Functional). PKDREJ also modulates G protein signaling pathways, enhancing G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel currents when coexpressed with GIRK1 and GIRK4 in HEK-293 cells. This indicates that PKDREJ can interact with G protein signaling pathways, similar to PKD1 (Sutton2006Functional).

Additionally, PKDREJ affects the inactivation kinetics of TRPC5 channels, although it does not alter the peak inward current or activation kinetics. This interaction suggests a role in modulating ion channel activity, potentially through G protein-mediated pathways (Sutton2006Functional). The localization of PKDREJ in the acrosomal region of sperm and its interactions with TRPC channels further support its involvement in the acrosome reaction and sperm-egg interactions (Sutton2006Functional).
