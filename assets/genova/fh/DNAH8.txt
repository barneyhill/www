# DNAH8

## Overview
DNAH8 is a gene that encodes the protein dynein axonemal heavy chain 8, which is a critical component of the axonemal dynein complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the motility of cilia and flagella, structures essential for various physiological processes such as respiratory function and sperm motility (Maiti2000Identification). As a motor protein, dynein axonemal heavy chain 8 is involved in generating the mechanical force necessary for the beating of cilia and flagella, facilitating their movement (Maiti2000Identification). The expression of DNAH8 is predominantly observed in ciliated tissues, including the trachea and testis, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal ciliary function (Maiti2000Identification). Mutations in DNAH8 have been associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by impaired ciliary movement, leading to clinical manifestations such as chronic respiratory infections and reduced fertility (Liu2019DNAH11).

## Function
DNAH8 (dynein axonemal heavy chain 8) is a component of the axonemal dynein complex, which is essential for the motility of cilia and flagella. This protein is involved in generating the force required for the beating of cilia and flagella, which is crucial for various physiological processes, including respiratory function and sperm motility (Maiti2000Identification). The axonemal dynein complex, where DNAH8 is active, is located in the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, and is responsible for their movement (Maiti2000Identification).

In healthy human cells, DNAH8 is expressed in ciliated tissues such as the trachea and testis, but not in non-ciliated tissues like the adult heart (Maiti2000Identification). The protein's function is linked to the motility of cilia, which is vital for clearing mucus and debris from the respiratory tract and for the movement of sperm, impacting fertility (Maiti2000Identification). While specific functional details of DNAH8 in healthy cells are not extensively detailed, its role in ciliary motility suggests its importance in maintaining normal physiological functions related to cilia and flagella (Maiti2000Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAH8 gene have been implicated in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by defects in the structure and function of cilia. This condition can lead to chronic respiratory tract infections, reduced fertility, and other symptoms due to impaired ciliary movement. In a study involving patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) and heterotaxy syndrome, potential disease-causing heterozygous variants in DNAH8 were identified, suggesting a possible association between DNAH8 mutations and these conditions, particularly in the context of ciliary dysfunction (Liu2019DNAH11). 

The study found that patients with CHD, heterotaxy, and ciliary dysfunction had a significantly higher mutation rate in DNAH8 compared to those with normal ciliary function, indicating that DNAH8 mutations may contribute to the development of these syndromes (Liu2019DNAH11). However, the clinical significance of DNAH8 mutations in PCD remains uncertain, as some variants are classified as having uncertain significance (Pîrlog2024Primary). Despite this uncertainty, the presence of DNAH8 mutations in patients with PCD highlights the complexity of diagnosing the disorder and the need for comprehensive genetic analysis (BazRedón2021Implementation).
