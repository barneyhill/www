# NFE2L2

## Overview
The NFE2L2 gene encodes the Nrf2 protein, a critical transcription factor involved in the cellular defense against oxidative stress. Nrf2, categorized as a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, plays a pivotal role in regulating the expression of genes that maintain cellular redox homeostasis and protect against oxidative damage. The protein is characterized by several conserved domains that facilitate its interaction with other proteins and DNA, enabling it to modulate the expression of a wide array of genes involved in antioxidant responses, metabolism, and proteostasis (Hayes2014The; Canning2015Structural). Nrf2's activity is tightly regulated through interactions with the Keap1 protein, which targets it for degradation under non-stress conditions. However, upon oxidative stress, Nrf2 is released from Keap1, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and activate the transcription of antioxidant response elements (AREs) (Han2018Phosphorylation). The gene's significance extends to various clinical contexts, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, where its dysregulation can have profound effects on disease progression and treatment outcomes (von2014Genetic; SánchezOrtega2021Role).

## Structure
The NFE2L2 gene encodes the Nrf2 protein, a transcription factor involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress. Nrf2 is 605 amino acids long and contains several highly conserved regions known as Nrf2-ECH homology (Neh) domains. These include the Neh1 domain, which contains the Cap'n'Collar (CNC) basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, facilitating DNA binding and heterodimerization with small Maf proteins (Canning2015Structural). The Neh2 domain is crucial for regulation, containing two degrons, the DLG and ETGE motifs, which interact with Keap1, leading to Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation under normal conditions (Canning2015Structural; Fukutomi2014Kinetic).

The ETGE motif binds with high affinity to the Kelch domain of Keap1, forming a β-turn conformation, while the DLG motif binds with weaker affinity and includes an N-terminal helix and two short 3_10 helices (Canning2015Structural). The Neh6 domain contains redox-independent degrons targeted by the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP, regulated by glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphorylation (Canning2015Structural). The Neh3-5 domains are involved in transactivation, and the Neh7 domain interacts with the retinoic X receptor α to repress Nrf2 (Canning2015Structural). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, influence Nrf2's stability and activity (Huppke2017Activating). The protein's structure is further complicated by alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms (Huppke2017Activating).

## Function
The NFE2L2 gene encodes the transcription factor NRF2, which plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative stress. NRF2 regulates the expression of over 200 genes involved in cytoprotection, lipid metabolism, and gene transcription (Hayes2014The). It is a key player in the cellular redox balance, influencing the expression of antioxidant response elements (AREs) and genes that combat oxidative stress, such as those involved in the glutathione and thioredoxin antioxidant systems (Hayes2014The).

NRF2 is involved in the regulation of proteasomal activity and autophagy, processes essential for the removal of damaged proteins and organelles. It enhances the cell's ability to degrade proteins by regulating the expression of proteasome subunits and activators and induces the expression of p62/SQSTM1, a cargo receptor involved in autophagy (Hayes2014The). NRF2 also modulates chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) by regulating the expression of LAMP2A, a lysosomal receptor essential for CMA, thereby contributing to proteostasis and redox homeostasis (Pajares2018Transcription).

In terms of metabolism, NRF2 influences intermediary metabolism and mitochondrial function by regulating key metabolic genes and enzymes, affecting the synthesis of carbohydrates, nucleic acids, lipids, and amino acids (Hayes2014The). It also plays a role in mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control, impacting mitochondrial redox homeostasis and energy metabolism (Ryoo2018Regulatory).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NFE2L2 gene, which encodes the transcription factor NRF2, have significant clinical implications. In Parkinson's disease (PD), certain NFE2L2 gene variants, including specific haplotypes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are associated with a decreased risk and delayed onset of the disease. These genetic variations may influence PD pathogenesis by affecting oxidative stress response mechanisms (von2014Genetic).

In cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mutations in NFE2L2 and its regulator KEAP1 lead to constitutive activation of NRF2. This activation is linked to increased cancer cell survival, proliferation, and resistance to chemotherapy. Such mutations are common in NSCLC subtypes and are associated with poor clinical outcomes (SánchezOrtega2021Role). The dual role of NRF2 in cancer, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, complicates its clinical significance (Menegon2016The).

Activating de novo mutations in NFE2L2 can cause a multisystem disorder characterized by developmental delays, immunodeficiency, and neurological symptoms. These mutations disrupt normal NRF2-KEAP1 interactions, leading to chronic NRF2 activation and misregulation of gene expression (Huppke2017Activating).

## Interactions
NFE2L2, also known as NRF2, is a transcription factor that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate cellular responses to oxidative stress. One of its primary interactions is with KEAP1, which inhibits NFE2L2 by targeting it for degradation under normal conditions. Upon oxidative stress, NFE2L2 dissociates from KEAP1, translocates to the nucleus, and binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in DNA, activating the expression of antioxidant genes (Wang2020PatientDerived; Han2018Phosphorylation).

NFE2L2 also interacts with other proteins such as DJ-1, which stabilizes NFE2L2 by disrupting its interaction with KEAP1, enhancing its nuclear accumulation and activity (Ryoo2018Regulatory). In the context of primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells, NFE2L2 interacts with STAT3, forming a positive regulatory circuit that promotes cell survival by controlling pathways like MTOR and MAPK3/1. This interaction is crucial for the expression of pro-survival molecules and antioxidant enzymes (Arena2023NFE2L2).

NFE2L2 is also involved in regulating autophagy-related genes, interacting with proteins like MAFK and BACH1, which bind to AREs. This interaction is significant in neurodegenerative diseases, where NFE2L2 modulates the expression of genes involved in protein clearance (Pajares2016Transcription).
