# BOD1L1

## Overview
BOD1L1, or biorientation of chromosomes in cell division 1 like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of chromosome alignment during cell division. The protein encoded by BOD1L1 plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by ensuring proper chromosome segregation, which is essential for normal cell cycle progression. It is categorized as a regulatory protein that interacts with various cellular complexes to facilitate DNA repair and replication processes. The gene's significance is underscored by its involvement in several pathological conditions, including glaucoma and myeloproliferative neoplasms, where mutations can lead to genomic instability and disease progression (Guo2017Megakaryocytes; Gao2022Wholeexome).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BOD1L1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma, a nonsynonymous variant in BOD1L1 has been significantly associated with elevated IOP in white individuals, suggesting a potential role in the genetic predisposition to glaucoma. This variant has a minor allele frequency of 0.011% and is linked to the use of antiglaucoma preparations, indicating its clinical significance in glaucoma management (Gao2022Wholeexome; Gao2022Wholeexomea).

In myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), BOD1L1 is frequently mutated, with mutations found in 6 out of 12 patients studied. The loss of BOD1L1 is associated with compromised repair of replication forks, leading to genome instability. This instability can facilitate the acquisition of additional mutations, contributing to the abnormal nuclear morphology of megakaryocytes and the fibrotic progression observed in MPNs (Guo2017Megakaryocytes).

BOD1L1 also interacts with the SET1A complex, which is involved in cell survival and cancer pathogenesis. Alterations in these interactions may affect cellular metabolism and viability, potentially contributing to cancer development (Wang2017A).
