# SGK2

## Overview
SGK2, or serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 2, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase, which is part of the AGC kinase family. The SGK2 protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including ion transport and channel regulation, by modulating the activity of ion channels and transporters in epithelial tissues such as the kidney, liver, and pancreas (Lang2006(Patho)physiological page 0 of 12). It is involved in the regulation of autophagy and lysosomal function, contributing to cellular homeostasis (Ranzuglia2020Serum). SGK2 interacts with several proteins, influencing their stability and localization, which is vital for cell cycle progression and other cellular functions (Pennington2021SGK2). Clinically, SGK2 has been implicated in cancer, particularly in epithelial ovarian cancer and prostate cancer, where it affects chemotherapy sensitivity and metastasis, respectively (Ranzuglia2020Serum; Cheng2023SGK2). These attributes make SGK2 a significant focus of research for potential therapeutic interventions.

## Structure
SGK2, a member of the AGC kinase family, is a serine/threonine protein kinase with a primary structure that includes a kinase domain crucial for its enzymatic activity. The kinase domain shares approximately 80% sequence identity with other SGK isoforms, such as SGK1 and SGK3, and is 54% identical to protein kinase B (PKB) (KOBAYASHI1999Characterization). SGK2 has two splice variants, SGK2α and SGK2β, with molecular masses of 41.1 kDa and 47.6 kDa, respectively. These variants differ in their N-terminal regions, with SGK2β having an additional 60 amino acids (KOBAYASHI1999Characterization).

The secondary structure of SGK2 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of protein kinases, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its function, stabilized by interactions within the kinase domain. SGK2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are essential for its activation and function. Phosphorylation by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is a key regulatory mechanism (KOBAYASHI1999Characterization). The quaternary structure is not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
SGK2 (serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in various cellular processes, particularly in ion transport and channel regulation. SGK2 is expressed abundantly in epithelial tissues such as the kidney, liver, and pancreas, and it is active in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of cells (Lang2006(Patho)physiological page 0 of 12). It plays a significant role in regulating ion channels and transporters, enhancing the activity and surface abundance of channels like the Cl- channel ClC2 and the cardiac voltage-gated Na+ channel SCN5A by inhibiting Nedd4-2, which reduces protein clearance from the cell membrane (Lang2006(Patho)physiological page 4 of 12).

SGK2 also modulates the activity of the Na+-K+-ATPase, crucial for maintaining ion gradients across the cell membrane, and upregulates the K+ channel complex KCNE1/KCNQ1, which is expressed in tissues such as the heart and kidney (Lang2006(Patho)physiological page 4 of 12). These activities suggest that SGK2 is vital for ion transport and channel regulation in healthy cells. Additionally, SGK2 is implicated in the regulation of autophagy and lysosomal function, maintaining lysosomal activity and autophagic flux, which are essential for cellular homeostasis (Ranzuglia2020Serum).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SGK2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, notably epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and prostate cancer (PCa). In EOC, SGK2 is identified as a key modulator of platinum drug sensitivity. Inhibition of SGK2 increases sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy by blocking autophagy, a survival mechanism used by cancer cells under treatment stress. This suggests that targeting SGK2 could enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy in EOC and potentially other cancers (Ranzuglia2020Serum).

In prostate cancer, SGK2 is associated with metastasis by inhibiting ferroptosis, a form of cell death. SGK2 upregulates GPX4, which prevents ferroptosis, thereby enhancing the metastatic potential of cancer cells. Knockdown of SGK2 increases ferroptosis, suggesting that SGK2's role in inhibiting this process contributes to cancer progression. This highlights SGK2 as a potential therapeutic target for preventing metastasis in prostate cancer (Cheng2023SGK2).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of SGK2 in cancer, suggesting that it could be a target for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating drug resistance and metastasis.

## Interactions
SGK2 (serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 2) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. SGK2 phosphorylates the oncoprotein PTOV1 at serine residues S36 and S53, which is essential for PTOV1's binding to the 14-3-3 protein. This interaction is crucial for the stability and cytosolic localization of PTOV1, preventing its nuclear accumulation and degradation via the proteasome (Pennington2021SGK2). The phosphorylation by SGK2 and subsequent binding to 14-3-3 sequesters PTOV1 in the cytosol, promoting the expression of cJun, a factor involved in cell cycle progression (Pennington2021SGK2).

SGK2 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1, which regulates PTOV1 stability by promoting its degradation when PTOV1 is not bound to 14-3-3 (Pennington2021SGK2). In addition to its role in PTOV1 regulation, SGK2 has been identified as a kinase that can modulate phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions, such as disrupting the interaction between spliceosomal proteins AAR2 and PRPF8 (Jehle2022A). These interactions highlight SGK2's involvement in complex regulatory networks that control protein localization, stability, and function.
