# AIMP2

## Overview
AIMP2, or aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex interacting multifunctional protein 2, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein, also referred to as p38, is a critical component of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC), where it functions primarily as a scaffold protein, ensuring the proper assembly and stability of the complex. This role is essential for the efficient synthesis of proteins, as the MSC facilitates the charging of tRNA molecules, a key step in translating genetic information into proteins. Beyond its structural role, AIMP2 is involved in several signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis, acting as a tumor suppressor by interacting with proteins such as p53 and TRAF2. The protein's interactions extend to neurodegenerative processes, where it influences the aggregation of α-synuclein, a protein implicated in Parkinson's disease. Alterations in the AIMP2 gene, including the expression of its splice variant AIMP2-DX2, have been associated with various cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Choi2011CancerAssociated; Choi2009AIMP2; Ham2020Amyloidlike).

## Structure
AIMP2 is a protein composed of 320 amino acids, functioning as a scaffold within the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC). Its structure includes several distinct regions and domains. The N-terminal region (1-45) binds to lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KRS) and lacks a regular secondary structure (Kim2016Oncogenic). The region from 46-114 contains a heptad repeat forming a coiled-coil structure for interaction with AIMP1 (Kim2016Oncogenic). The C-terminal region of AIMP2 contains a glutathione S-transferase (GST) domain, which is divided into GST-N and GST-C subdomains. The GST-N subdomain comprises a 5-stranded beta-sheet and three alpha-helices, while the GST-C subdomain consists of five alpha-helices (Kim2016Oncogenic).

AIMP2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at serine 156, which is crucial for its nuclear localization and interaction dynamics within the MSC (Kim2016Oncogenic; Hahn2019The). AIMP2 also has a splice variant known as AIMP2-DX2, which lacks exon 2 and is implicated in cancer development by interfering with the tumor-suppressive functions of the full-length protein (Choi2011CancerAssociated; Kim2024Identification). This variant includes an N-terminal flexible region and a GST domain, similar to the full-length protein (Kim2024Identification).

## Function
AIMP2, also known as p38, is a crucial component of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) in human cells, playing a significant role in protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis. It acts as a scaffolding protein essential for the assembly and stability of the MSC, which includes several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and auxiliary factors (Park2010Aminoacyl‐tRNA). AIMP2 is involved in the primary function of protein synthesis by facilitating the proper charging of tRNA molecules, which is vital for translating genetic information into functional proteins (Shukla2017Homozygosity).

Beyond its role in protein synthesis, AIMP2 is involved in various signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. It translocates to the nucleus upon TGFβ stimulation to downregulate the FUSE-binding protein, thereby suppressing c-myc transcription and arresting cell proliferation (Park2010Aminoacyl‐tRNA). AIMP2 also interacts with p53 in response to DNA damage, protecting it from degradation and promoting apoptosis (Choi2009AIMP2). In the context of TNFα signaling, AIMP2 enhances apoptosis by facilitating the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of TRAF2 (Choi2009AIMP2). These activities underscore AIMP2's role as a tumor suppressor and its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AIMP2 gene are associated with several diseases, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers. In neurodevelopmental disorders, mutations in AIMP2 have been linked to conditions characterized by microcephaly, seizures, and spastic quadriparesis. These mutations can lead to severe neurodevelopmental alterations similar to those caused by other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase mutations (Shukla2017Homozygosity; Mazaheri2022Case). A specific nonsense variant in AIMP2 has been associated with a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder, suggesting a founder effect in certain populations (Shukla2017Homozygosity).

In cancer, the AIMP2 splice variant AIMP2-DX2 is implicated in tumorigenesis. This variant results from exon 2 skipping and compromises the tumor-suppressive activity of AIMP2 by interfering with p53, a crucial tumor suppressor protein. AIMP2-DX2 is associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia and lung cancer, and its expression ratio with AIMP2 is considered a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and drug sensitivity (Choi2011CancerAssociated; Jo2013Rapid; Ku2020Singlecell). In Parkinson's disease, AIMP2 is involved in the aggregation of α-synuclein, contributing to the formation of Lewy-like inclusions and dopaminergic toxicity (Ham2020Amyloidlike).

## Interactions
AIMP2, also known as aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex interacting multifunctional protein 2, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. AIMP2 interacts with α-synuclein, a protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases, accelerating its aggregation into amyloid-like structures. This interaction is specific, as AIMP2 aggregates bind α-synuclein monomers but not amyloid beta monomers or oligomers (Ham2020Amyloidlike). AIMP2 also plays a role in the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of TRAF2, a key component in TNFα signaling, by facilitating the association of c-IAP1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, with TRAF2 (Choi2009AIMP2).

In response to DNA damage, AIMP2 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, preventing its degradation by MDM2-mediated ubiquitination, thereby promoting apoptosis (Kim2013Protein–Protein). AIMP2 also interacts with the far upstream element binding protein 1 (FBP1), promoting its degradation through ubiquitination, which affects cell cycle regulation (Kim2013Protein–Protein). These interactions highlight AIMP2's role in modulating apoptotic pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis.
