# KDM1A

## Overview
KDM1A, also known as lysine demethylase 1A, is a gene that encodes a flavin-dependent amine oxidase enzyme involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The protein product of KDM1A, lysine demethylase 1A, is a histone demethylase that specifically targets mono- and dimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me1/2), playing a critical role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Foster2010Lysine-Specific). As a component of various protein complexes, including the CoREST and NuRD complexes, KDM1A integrates demethylase and deacetylase activities, contributing to transcriptional repression (Marabelli2016The; Wang2009LSD1). The enzyme is implicated in numerous cellular processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and development, and is essential for maintaining the balance of gene expression in both normal physiology and disease states (Lambrot2015The; Ambrosio2018Histone). KDM1A's dysregulation is associated with various cancers and neurological disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Ismail2018KDM1A; Maes2015KDM1).

## Structure
KDM1A, also known as lysine demethylase 1A, is a flavin-dependent amine oxidase with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of KDM1A consists of 852 amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain (Burg2015KDM1). The secondary structure includes several domains, such as the SWIRM domain, which is a bundle of α-helices, and the amine oxidase domain (AOD), which contains a Rossmann fold for FAD binding and a substrate-binding lobe (Burg2016LysineSpecific; Burg2015KDM1).

The tertiary structure of KDM1A features a folded 3D conformation with distinct domains, including the SWIRM domain, the AOD, and a tower domain composed of two antiparallel α-helices forming a coiled coil (Burg2016LysineSpecific). The tower domain is crucial for associating with the corepressor CoREST, which enhances the demethylase activity of KDM1A (Burg2015KDM1).

KDM1A functions as a homodimer, representing its quaternary structure, and interacts with various nuclear factors and non-coding RNAs (Marabelli2016The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, may regulate its activity and interactions (Marabelli2016The). Additionally, splice variants of KDM1A have been identified, which may lead to different isoforms with distinct functions (Marabelli2016The).

## Function
KDM1A, also known as lysine demethylase 1A, is a crucial enzyme involved in the regulation of gene expression through its role in histone modification. It specifically demethylates mono- and dimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me1/2), which are markers of active transcription, thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene expression (Foster2010Lysine-Specific). KDM1A functions as part of a complex with CoREST and histone deacetylases (HDACs), which repress transcription by deacetylating histone tails, maintaining the stability of CoREST and associated HDAC activity (Foster2010Lysine-Specific).

In healthy human cells, KDM1A is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and development. It plays a significant role in embryonic development, as its loss leads to aberrant expression of genes involved in development, such as brachyury, Hoxb7, and Hoxd8 (Foster2010Lysine-Specific). KDM1A is also essential for the maintenance and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells, which are crucial for spermatogenesis (Lambrot2015The). Additionally, KDM1A is involved in regulating autophagy, a cellular degradation process, by modulating the expression of key players involved in signaling and autophagosome formation (Ambrosio2018Histone).

## Clinical Significance
The KDM1A gene, also known as lysine demethylase 1A, plays a significant role in various cancers and neurological conditions due to its involvement in epigenetic regulation. In prostate cancer, overexpression of KDM1A is linked to aggressive, hormone-refractory forms and poor clinical outcomes, acting as both a corepressor and coactivator influencing androgen receptor activity (Maes2015KDM1). In breast cancer, KDM1A is frequently overexpressed, correlating with higher tumor grade, invasiveness, and poorer survival rates. Inhibitors of KDM1A can enhance the efficacy of anti-estrogen therapies and restore sensitivity in resistant breast cancer cells (Maes2015KDM1). 

In neuroblastoma, high KDM1A expression is associated with poor prognosis, and its inhibition can promote cell differentiation and inhibit proliferation (Maes2015KDM1). KDM1A is also overexpressed in medulloblastoma, where it contributes to tumor aggressiveness and resistance to apoptosis. Targeting KDM1A with specific inhibitors has shown promise in reducing tumorigenic properties in medulloblastoma (Pajtler2013The). 

In lung cancer, elevated KDM1A levels are linked to shorter survival in non-small-cell lung cancer patients, and its inhibition suppresses cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Maes2015KDM1). KDM1A's role in glioblastoma involves transcriptional repression of genes promoting cancer stem cell self-renewal and tumor progression (Ismail2018KDM1A).

## Interactions
KDM1A, also known as LSD1, is a histone demethylase that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It is a component of the NuRD complex, where it interacts with MTA proteins (MTA1, MTA2, MTA3) through its Tower domain. This interaction is crucial for demethylating nucleosomal substrates, particularly H3K4, and is involved in transcriptional repression (Wang2009LSD1).

KDM1A also forms a complex with CoREST and histone deacetylases HDAC1/2, integrating demethylase and deacetylase activities. This complex is essential for nucleosome demethylation and transcriptional repression (Pilotto2015Interplay; Marabelli2016The). The interaction with CoREST is facilitated by the SANT2 domain, which is crucial for DNA binding and efficient demethylation (Yang2006Structural).

KDM1A interacts with non-coding RNAs such as HOTAIR and TERRA, which influence its role in gene regulation and DNA-damage response at telomeres (Marabelli2016The). Additionally, phosphorylation of KDM1A can modulate its interaction with CoREST and HDAC1/2, affecting its transcriptional repression capabilities (Toffolo2013Phosphorylation).
