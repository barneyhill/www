# ACOT12

## Overview
ACOT12 is a gene that encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA thioesterase 12, which is a crucial component of lipid metabolism. This enzyme belongs to the acyl-CoA thioesterase family and is characterized by its type-II classification, featuring a tandem hotdog fold structure and a C-terminal START domain. The protein plays a significant role in hydrolyzing acetyl-CoA into acetate and CoA, thereby regulating cytosolic acetyl-CoA levels essential for fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis (Horibata2013Enzymatic). ACOT12 is predominantly expressed in the liver and is involved in maintaining metabolic homeostasis by modulating the intracellular CoA pool (Park2021Loss). The enzyme's activity is intricately regulated by interactions with lipids and nucleotides, linking its function to cellular energy status and lipid metabolism (Kirkby2010Functional). Additionally, ACOT12 is implicated in cholesterol homeostasis and has been associated with various metabolic disorders, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (Lu2019ACOT12Dependent; Park2021Loss).

## Structure
ACOT12 is a type-II acyl-CoA thioesterase characterized by a tandem hotdog fold structure at the N-terminus and a C-terminal START domain. The hotdog fold consists of a 5-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet surrounding a five-turn alpha-helix, with an additional C-terminal alpha-helix, forming a structure common in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic species (Kirkby2010Functional). The START domain is involved in lipid binding and intracellular functions, playing a crucial role in the regulation of ACOT12 activity by phosphatidic acid (PA) (Horibata2013Enzymatic).

The quaternary structure of ACOT12 involves ATP-dependent oligomerization, forming tetramers and dimers. The wild-type ACOT12 forms tetramers, while a variant can form both dimers and tetramers. The START domain is important for proper tetramer formation after dimer formation (Horibata2013Enzymatic). The enzyme's activity is regulated by ATP and inhibited by ADP, suggesting a role in energy metabolism (Kirkby2010Functional).

ACOT12 shares 51% sequence identity with ACOT11, indicating evolutionary divergence within the ACOT family (Brocker2010Evolutionary). Specific details on post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ACOT12, also known as acyl-CoA thioesterase 12, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing acetyl-CoA into acetate and CoA. This activity is essential for regulating cytosolic acetyl-CoA levels, which are crucial for fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis (Horibata2013Enzymatic). ACOT12 is primarily expressed in the liver, with lower levels in the kidney and intestine, and is involved in maintaining metabolic homeostasis by modulating the intracellular CoA pool (Park2021Loss).

The enzyme's activity is regulated by its interaction with lipids such as phosphatidic acid (PA) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which inhibit its function in a noncompetitive manner (Horibata2013Enzymatic). ACOT12 is allosterically activated by ATP and inhibited by ADP, linking its activity to cellular energy status. When energy levels are high, ACOT12 is activated to prevent unnecessary energy production by hydrolyzing acetyl-CoA, whereas low energy levels lead to its inactivation, allowing acetyl-CoA to enter the citric acid cycle (Kirkby2010Functional).

ACOT12 also interacts with proteins involved in cholesterol trafficking, such as VPS33A, indicating its role in cholesterol homeostasis and vesicle-mediated cholesterol transport within cells (Park2021Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ACOT12 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In HCC, down-regulation of ACOT12 is associated with increased metastasis and poor prognosis. This is due to its role in regulating acetyl-CoA levels, which affects histone acetylation and the expression of genes like TWIST2, a key factor in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis (Lu2019ACOT12Dependent). ACOT12 overexpression has been shown to suppress HCC metastasis by reducing TWIST2 expression and promoting E-cadherin expression, thereby inhibiting EMT (Lu2019ACOT12Dependent).

In NAFLD, ACOT12 deficiency leads to increased hepatic acetyl-CoA levels, stimulating lipid and cholesterol synthesis, which contributes to the disease's progression. This deficiency also affects cholesterol trafficking, leading to its accumulation in the liver. ACOT12 interacts with proteins involved in cholesterol trafficking, such as VPS33A, and its absence disrupts normal cholesterol transport pathways (Park2021Loss). These findings suggest that ACOT12 plays a critical role in maintaining lipid homeostasis, and its dysregulation can lead to significant metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
ACOT12, or acyl-CoA thioesterase 12, is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in lipid metabolism and cellular processes. One of the key interactions of ACOT12 is with vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 33A (VPS33A), a component of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex. This interaction is crucial for vesicle-mediated cholesterol trafficking and the lysosomal degradation of cholesterol in hepatocytes. ACOT12 colocalizes with VPS33A-positive structures and partially with lysosomes, indicating its involvement in the endosome-lysosome pathway (Park2021Loss).

ACOT12 also interacts with phosphatidic acid (PA) in a noncompetitive manner, suggesting an allosteric interaction distinct from the acetyl-CoA binding site. This interaction does not disrupt the oligomeric state of ACOT12, indicating that the THIO domain is essential for its oligomerization (Horibata2013Enzymatic). These interactions highlight ACOT12's role in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism, impacting processes such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis through epigenetic mechanisms (Lu2019ACOT12Dependent; Park2021Loss).
