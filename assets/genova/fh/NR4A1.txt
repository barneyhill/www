# NR4A1

## Overview
NR4A1, also known as Nur77, is a gene that encodes the nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1, a type of nuclear receptor. This protein functions as a ligand-independent transcription factor and plays a pivotal role in regulating various cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. NR4A1 is rapidly induced by environmental stimuli and acts as an immediate-early response gene, influencing metabolic pathways such as glucose and lipid homeostasis, as well as immune and nervous system functions (Safe2016Nuclear; Zhao2010NR4A; Jeanneteau2018The). The protein's activity is primarily nuclear, but it can translocate to the cytoplasm under certain conditions, affecting mitochondrial function and apoptosis (Jeanneteau2018The). NR4A1's involvement in various diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cancer, and neurological disorders, underscores its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2023The; Montarolo2016Altered; HUANG2014NR4A1).

## Structure
NR4A1, also known as Nur77, is a nuclear receptor with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of NR4A1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which includes a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a ligand-binding domain (LBD) (Jiang2020Structural). The secondary structure of NR4A1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the formation of these domains. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, allowing it to interact with DNA and other proteins effectively. The DBD of NR4A1 binds independently to DNA, with specific contacts formed by the N-terminal helix H1 and extensive interactions by the C-terminal extension (Jiang2020Structural).

NR4A1 can function as a monomer or form homodimers and heterodimers, representing its quaternary structure. It binds to NGFI-B response elements (NBRE) as a monomer and to Nur-responsive elements (NurREs) as homodimers or heterodimers (Jiang2020Structural). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate its activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The existence of splice variant isoforms of NR4A1 is suggested, potentially leading to different functional roles, but specific isoforms are not described in the context.

## Function
NR4A1, also known as Nur77, is a nuclear receptor that functions as a ligand-independent transcription factor involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, NR4A1 plays a critical role in regulating differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. It is rapidly induced by environmental cues and acts as an immediate-early response gene (Zhao2010NR4A). NR4A1 is involved in the transcriptional control of metabolism, influencing glucose and lipid homeostasis, adipogenesis, and energy balance. It is expressed in the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, where it regulates gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and insulin sensitivity (Safe2016Nuclear; Zhao2010NR4A).

In the immune system, NR4A1 is crucial for T-cell development, particularly in the differentiation and fate determination of T-cells in the thymus. It is implicated in clonal deletion and the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Treg), influencing the expression of proapoptotic factors and Treg signature genes (Fassett2012Nuclear). In the nervous system, NR4A1 adjusts mitochondrial function and synapse number in response to stress, playing a role in maintaining neuronal health and behavioral flexibility (Jeanneteau2018The). NR4A1's activity is primarily nuclear, but it can translocate to the cytoplasm under certain conditions, affecting mitochondrial function and apoptosis (Jeanneteau2018The).

## Clinical Significance
The NR4A1 gene, also known as Nur77, is implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. In type 2 diabetes (T2D), NR4A1 expression is increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, correlating with inflammation and diabetes-related parameters such as HOMA-IR and TNF-α levels (HUANG2014NR4A1). In cancer, NR4A1 exhibits both pro-oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles depending on the context. It is overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer and associated with poor survival, while in papillary thyroid cancer, it promotes oncogenic protein expression, contributing to poor outcomes (Wang2023The; Jiang2022NR4A1). Conversely, in colon adenocarcinoma, high NR4A1 expression is linked to better prognosis (Li2023NR4A1).

NR4A1 is also involved in neurological conditions. It is downregulated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia patients, potentially influenced by antipsychotic treatment and age (Corley2016Transcriptomic). In tardive dyskinesia, NR4A1 polymorphisms are associated with increased risk and severity of the condition (Novak2010Association). In neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, NR4A1 expression is altered, suggesting a role in disease pathogenesis (Montarolo2016Altered).

## Interactions
NR4A1, also known as Nur77, is a nuclear receptor that participates in various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, influencing multiple cellular processes. It interacts with the apolipoprotein A-IV (ApoA-IV) in the nucleus of HepG2 and HEK-293 cells, where this interaction is involved in the repression of gluconeogenic genes such as G6Pase and PEPCK. This interaction is confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, which show that NR4A1 and ApoA-IV colocalize near the RORE sequence in the G6Pase promoter, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Li2015Interaction).

NR4A1 also interacts with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bcl-B, converting them from anti-apoptotic to pro-apoptotic phenotypes. This interaction affects cell survival and autophagy, as demonstrated by increased caspase activity and changes in autophagy markers like LC3-II levels (Godoi2016Orphan). The interaction involves a novel binding site on Bcl-B, distinct from the BH3 domain, and is crucial for modulating apoptosis and autophagy (Godoi2016Orphan).

NR4A1 can also form heterodimers with RXRα, influencing its transcriptional activity and cellular localization. This interaction is stimulus- and cell type-specific, highlighting NR4A1's role as a molecular 'chameleon' in various cellular contexts (Kurakula2014NR4A).
