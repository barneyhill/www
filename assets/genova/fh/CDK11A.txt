# CDK11A

## Overview
CDK11A is a gene that encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase 11A (CDK11A), a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in critical cellular processes such as transcription, RNA processing, and cell cycle regulation. The CDK11A protein exists in multiple isoforms, primarily CDK11 p110 and CDK11 p58, which are generated through alternative splicing. These isoforms have distinct roles, with CDK11 p110 participating in RNA transcription and splicing, while CDK11 p58 is crucial for mitotic processes during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Loyer2020Roles; Malumbres2014Cyclin-dependent). CDK11A interacts with L-type cyclins and various transcription and splicing factors, underscoring its multifaceted role in cellular function (Loyer2020Roles). The gene's expression and activity are implicated in several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Ahmed2019CDK11; Loyer2020Roles).

## Structure
CDK11A is a serine/threonine protein kinase encoded by the CDC2L2 gene, located on human chromosome 1 band p36.3. The protein is composed of an N-terminal regulatory region and a C-terminal catalytic domain responsible for its kinase activity (Zhou2016The). The N-terminal region contains multiple nuclear localization signals, a 14-3-3 consensus site, and caspase cleavage sites (Loyer2020Roles). CDK11A also features an arginine/glutamic acid-rich domain (RE domain) and a poly-glutamic acid domain (poly-E domain) in the center, which are associated with RNA processing factors and cytoskeletal interactions, respectively (Zhou2016The).

CDK11A exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the two predominant forms being CDK11 p110 and CDK11 p58. CDK11 p110 is a larger isoform involved in RNA transcription and splicing, while CDK11 p58 is specific to the G2/M phases of the cell cycle and is involved in mitosis (Loyer2020Roles; Malumbres2014Cyclin-dependent). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is crucial for its activation and function (Malumbres2014Cyclin-dependent). CDK11A interacts with L-type cyclins, particularly Cyclins L1 and L2, which are involved in transcription and pre-mRNA processing (Loyer2020Roles).

## Function
CDK11A, a cyclin-dependent kinase, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including transcription, RNA processing, and cell cycle regulation. In healthy human cells, CDK11A is involved in coordinating transcription and RNA processing, particularly alternative splicing, by interacting with L-type cyclins (Malumbres2014Cyclin-dependent). The CDK11 p110 isoform, a product of the CDK11A gene, localizes within nuclear speckles and associates with splicing factors and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). It is involved in RNAPII-dependent transcription and pre-mRNA processing, directly phosphorylating the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII (Loyer2020Roles).

CDK11A is also crucial for mitotic processes. The CDK11 p58 isoform is specifically expressed during the G2-M phase and is essential for centriole duplication, spindle dynamics, and sister chromatid cohesion at centromeres during mitosis (Malumbres2014Cyclin-dependent). Additionally, CDK11A is involved in autophagy regulation, necessary for autophagic flux and cargo digestion, maintaining cellular homeostasis (Wilkinson2011The). The protein's activity is observed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing cellular proliferation and survival (Ahmed2019CDK11).

## Clinical Significance
CDK11A (cyclin-dependent kinase 11A) is implicated in several cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation and RNA processing. In melanoma, particularly in BRAF and NRAS mutant cell lines, high CDK11A mRNA expression is associated with poor prognosis. The downregulation of CDK11A in these melanoma cells leads to reduced cell survival and disrupted cell cycle function, suggesting its critical role in melanoma cell proliferation and survival (Ahmed2019CDK11). 

In breast cancer, CDK11A expression is crucial for cell proliferation. Its downregulation results in reduced cell viability and tumor growth, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Loyer2020Roles). CDK11A is also highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissues, with immunohistochemistry showing significantly higher expression in TNBC compared to normal breast tissues (Kren2015Preclinical). 

Alterations in CDK11A expression are linked to poor clinical outcomes in various cancers, including osteosarcoma and ovarian cancer, where high expression correlates with worse survival outcomes (Loyer2020Roles). These findings highlight the potential of CDK11A as a target for cancer therapy, particularly in cancers with limited treatment options and high resistance rates (Ahmed2019CDK11).

## Interactions
CDK11A, a cyclin-dependent kinase, is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in transcription regulation and RNA processing. CDK11A interacts with cyclins L1 and L2, which are essential for activating the CDK11 p110 isoform, forming complexes that regulate pre-mRNA splicing (Loyer2020Roles). It also associates with splicing factors such as RNPS1 and 9G8, and transcription elongation factors like ELL2, TFIIS, and the SSRP1 and SPT16 subunits of FACT, as well as the Rap30 and Rap74 subunits of TFIIF (Loyer2020Roles). These interactions suggest CDK11A's involvement in transcription and RNA processing.

CDK11A is part of a broader network of interactions within the CMGC kinase group, interacting with CKII subunits, RNA-binding proteins, zinc finger proteins, and importin subunits, indicating its role in transcription regulation and nuclear transport (Varjosalo2013The). The CDK11 p110/Cyclins L complex phosphorylates 9G8 to promote pre-mRNA splicing, highlighting its functional significance in RNA processing (Loyer2020Roles). These interactions underscore CDK11A's multifaceted role in cellular processes, particularly in transcription and RNA splicing.
