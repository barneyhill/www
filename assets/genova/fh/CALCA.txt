# CALCA

## Overview
The CALCA gene encodes the precursor proteins for calcitonin and α-calcitonin gene-related peptide (α-CGRP), which are involved in distinct physiological processes. Calcitonin, a hormone primarily produced by thyroid C cells, plays a crucial role in bone metabolism by inhibiting osteoclast activity, thereby reducing blood calcium levels. In contrast, α-CGRP, a neuropeptide, is synthesized in the peripheral and central nervous systems and functions as a potent vasodilator, regulating vascular tone and contributing to neuromuscular transmission. The gene's ability to produce these proteins through alternative splicing highlights its functional versatility, with calcitonin being significant in calcium and phosphorus metabolism, and α-CGRP playing a role in cardiovascular regulation and bone formation (Camacho2013Measurement; Marasco2022The; Huebner2008The).

## Structure
The CALCA gene encodes proteins through alternative splicing, resulting in the production of calcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide 1 (CGRP1). In thyroid C cells, the skipping of exon 4 leads to an mRNA variant that includes exons 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, encoding calcitonin. In neurons, exon 4 is included, and exons 5 and 6 are excluded, resulting in CGRP1 (Marasco2022The). The primary structure of CGRP includes a 37-amino acid sequence with specific domains: a ringlike structure held by a disulfide bridge, an α helix crucial for high-affinity binding, a β or γ-twist, and a COOH terminus with two turn regions forming a binding epitope (Russell2014Calcitonin).

The CALCA gene also undergoes post-translational modifications, which may include glycosylation and phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context. The gene's alternative splicing results in distinct isoforms with different functions, exemplifying the complexity and functional diversity generated by this process (Marasco2022The). The CALCA gene's polymorphisms can potentially alter the secondary structure of its propeptides, affecting their function and post-translational processing (Buervenich2001Identification).

## Function
The CALCA gene encodes the precursor protein for calcitonin and α-calcitonin gene-related peptide (α-CGRP), which are involved in distinct physiological processes. Calcitonin is primarily produced by thyroidal C cells and plays a significant role in bone metabolism by inhibiting bone resorption. It acts on osteoclasts, which express high levels of the calcitonin receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor, thereby reducing blood calcium levels (Huebner2008The). In healthy human cells, calcitonin is involved in calcium and phosphorus metabolism, reducing blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclast activity in bones and renal tubular reabsorption (Camacho2013Measurement).

α-CGRP, a neuropeptide, is involved in regulating vascular tone and acts as a potent vasodilator. It is synthesized in the peripheral and central nervous systems and is released from peripheral endings of sensory nerves. α-CGRP facilitates vasodilation, acetylcholine release, and neuromuscular transmission, and it has a trophic effect on acetylcholine receptor synthesis (Camacho2013Measurement; Maggi1995Tachykinins). In bone formation, α-CGRP has a direct osteoanabolic effect on osteoblasts, as these cells express the calcitonin receptor-like receptor, which binds α-CGRP (Huebner2008The). These proteins are active in the thyroid gland and nervous system, respectively, contributing to their roles in bone metabolism and cardiovascular regulation.

## Clinical Significance
The CALCA gene, which encodes calcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide alpha (αCGRP), is implicated in several diseases due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In the context of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (ptOA), the CALCA gene plays a significant role in disease progression. The PCT/CT transcript of CALCA is protective against cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone loss, while αCGRP is involved in osteophyte formation. Deficiency in these transcripts can lead to aggravated cartilage damage and altered bone architecture in ptOA (Jiang2024Transcriptdependent).

In neurological disorders, polymorphisms in the CALCA gene have been investigated for associations with conditions such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and manic depression. Although no significant associations were found with Parkinson's or schizophrenia, a 16-bp microdeletion in the CALCA gene was observed in a family with multiple cases of unipolar or bipolar depressive disorder, suggesting a potential link (Buervenich2001Identification).

The CALCA gene is also associated with migraine, where αCGRP acts as a potent vasodilator involved in neurogenic inflammation. Elevated levels of CGRP have been observed during migraine attacks, and CGRP receptor antagonists have been effective in alleviating symptoms (Sutherland2013Association).

## Interactions
The CALCA gene encodes the precursor protein for calcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). CGRP is known to interact with the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CALCRL) and receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) to form functional receptor complexes. These interactions are crucial for CGRP's role in cardiovascular and nervous system functions. Specifically, CGRP interacts with the amylin receptor RAMP2 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) glial cells, suggesting a novel interaction in this context (Wangzhou2021A).

The interaction between CGRP and RAMPs, such as RAMP1, RAMP2, and RAMP3, modulates the pharmacology and biology of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These interactions affect receptor trafficking and ligand selectivity, with RAMPs altering the conformation of CALCRL's transmembrane and intracellular loops, influencing its signaling profile (Kotliar2022Elucidating). Structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy have shown that RAMPs affect the orientation and dynamics of the extracellular domain of CALCRL, impacting ligand binding and GPCR-G protein interactions (Kotliar2022Elucidating). These interactions are significant for understanding the role of CGRP in physiological processes and for drug discovery targeting GPCR-RAMP complexes.
