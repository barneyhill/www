# ZNF135

## Overview
ZNF135 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 135, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for its role as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding, allowing it to regulate gene expression by interacting with specific DNA sequences. Zinc finger protein 135 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it functions as a transcriptional repressor, influencing various cellular processes such as cell differentiation and development. The gene is notably expressed in the human brain, suggesting its involvement in neurological functions and development. Mutations in ZNF135 have been linked to neurological disorders and developmental abnormalities, underscoring its importance in normal brain function. Additionally, ZNF135 has been implicated in cancer biology, where its epigenetic silencing through hypermethylation is associated with tumor progression, particularly in advanced stages of colorectal cancer (Raghuram2017Assessment; Raghavendran2020Stagedifferentiated; Muthamilselvan2022Stagedifferentiated; Loza2023Epigenetic).

## Function
ZNF135, or zinc finger protein 135, is a member of the zinc finger protein family, characterized by zinc finger motifs that enable DNA binding. These proteins typically function as transcription factors, regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. ZNF135 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell by modulating the transcription of target genes. This modulation plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development (Raghuram2017Assessment).

In healthy human cells, ZNF135 is implicated in transcriptional repression, as it encodes a putative transcriptional repressor protein. The protein's function is likely linked to its ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression, which is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and development. The presence of a zinc finger region suggests its involvement in these processes, although the specific molecular mechanisms and target genes remain to be fully elucidated (Raghuram2017Assessment).

ZNF135 is expressed in the human brain, indicating its potential role in neurological functions. Mutations in this gene, such as those resulting in a premature stop codon, can disrupt its function and are associated with neurological and developmental symptoms, highlighting its importance in normal brain development and function (Raghuram2017Assessment).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZNF135 gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders and cancers. A study by Raghuram et al. identified a homozygous mutation in ZNF135 in a patient with neurological and developmental symptoms. This mutation results in a premature stop codon, likely disrupting the Zn2+ finger region and abrogating the gene's function, which is suggested to be responsible for the patient's symptoms (Raghuram2017Assessment).

In the context of cancer, ZNF135 has been associated with tumor suppression. Studies have shown that ZNF135 is often hypermethylated in certain cancers, leading to its epigenetic silencing. This hypermethylation is a key feature in stage IV colorectal cancer, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for advanced cancer stages (Raghavendran2020Stagedifferentiated; Muthamilselvan2022Stagedifferentiated). Additionally, ZNF135's expression levels have been linked to survival probabilities in various cancer types. Higher expression levels are associated with better survival in some cancers, while lower levels correlate with better outcomes in others, indicating cancer-specific effects (Loza2023Epigenetic).

Overall, the clinical significance of ZNF135 lies in its potential role in neurological disorders and as a tumor suppressor gene, with its expression and methylation status serving as important factors in disease progression and prognosis.
