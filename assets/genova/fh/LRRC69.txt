# LRRC69

## Overview
The LRRC69 gene encodes the protein leucine rich repeat containing 69, which is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that LRRC69 may play a role in various cellular processes through such interactions. While the specific biological functions of the LRRC69 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in critical pathways has been suggested by its association with several clinical conditions, including male infertility and colorectal cancer. The gene's expression and potential regulatory roles in these diseases underscore its importance as a subject of ongoing research (yazdani2018integrated; Mahajan2024A; Kikas2023Microdeletions).

## Clinical Significance
The LRRC69 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly in male infertility and colorectal cancer. A recurrent partial deletion of the LRRC69 gene has been associated with spermatogenic failure (SPGF) in men. This deletion, which removes four exons of an alternative transcript, was identified in patients with SPGF, including cases of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). The prevalence of this deletion was significantly higher in SPGF cases compared to the general population, suggesting a potential role of LRRC69 in male infertility (Kikas2023Microdeletions).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), LRRC69 has been identified as a key driver gene associated with disease progression. The gene exhibits amplification and up-regulated expression in CRC, contributing to its role as a prognostic biomarker. Studies have shown that LRRC69, along with other genes, can predict patient outcomes and survival times, highlighting its potential clinical value in CRC management (Mahajan2024A).

Additionally, LRRC69 has been linked to plasma triglyceride levels through a metabolomic causal network, suggesting a role in cardiovascular disease. The gene's involvement in these pathways indicates its potential impact on triglyceride regulation and cardiovascular health (yazdani2018integrated).
