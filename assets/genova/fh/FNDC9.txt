# FNDC9

## Overview
FNDC9, or fibronectin type III domain containing 9, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is part of the fibronectin type III domain-containing family. This protein is primarily involved in cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and signaling, playing a crucial role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and signal transduction pathways (Daudon2022Irisin). FNDC9 is typically localized in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it facilitates cellular interactions and communication, thereby influencing tissue development and maintenance. Although the specific molecular activities of FNDC9 in human cells are not extensively documented, its functional similarities with other fibronectin type III domain proteins suggest its involvement in essential cellular and developmental processes. The gene has been studied in various contexts, including its potential implications in cancer progression and other diseases (de2015DNA; Giwa2020Identification).

## Function
FNDC9, or fibronectin type III domain containing 9, is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. As a member of the fibronectin type III domain-containing family, FNDC9 is involved in regulating the organization of the actin-containing cytoskeleton and signal transduction, which are crucial for maintaining cellular structure and communication (Daudon2022Irisin). These processes are essential for tissue development, cell proliferation, and migration, suggesting that FNDC9 contributes to the structural integrity and maintenance of tissues.

The protein is typically active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it facilitates cellular interactions and signaling pathways. This localization allows FNDC9 to impact cellular communication and structural integrity, influencing tissue development and maintenance (Daudon2022Irisin). While specific details about FNDC9's molecular activities in human cells are not extensively documented, its association with the fibronectin type III domain family implies that it shares functional similarities with other proteins in this group, which are known to be involved in critical cellular and developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
FNDC9 is implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of high-risk neuroblastoma, FNDC9 is downregulated, which may promote tumor invasion and metastasis. This suggests a role in cancer progression, particularly in neuroblastoma, although specific diseases directly associated with FNDC9 mutations are not detailed (Giwa2020Identification).

In pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), differential methylation of CpG sites associated with FNDC9 has been linked to metastatic disease. Two CpG sites in FNDC9 showed differential methylation patterns, with hazard ratios indicating a potential connection to PPGL malignancy. These methylation markers could serve as diagnostic and prognostic tools in PPGL (de2015DNA).

In a study involving a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14), FNDC9 was significantly downregulated, although its specific functional role in the cerebellum remains unclear. The study primarily focused on other genes, leaving the implications of FNDC9 downregulation in SCA14 uncertain (Mezey2022Transcriptome).

A synonymous variant in FNDC9 was identified in a study of a large Italian family with high plasma levels of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor. However, this variant was not highlighted as deleterious, and no specific diseases were associated with it in this context (Spena2023Genetic).
