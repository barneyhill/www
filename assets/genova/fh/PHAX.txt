# PHAX

## Overview
PHAX (phosphorylated adaptor for RNA export) is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the nuclear export of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) in metazoans. The PHAX protein functions as an export adaptor, facilitating the transport of U snRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which is essential for the assembly of spliceosomal complexes. It is characterized by a conserved RNA-binding domain (PHAX-RBD) that interacts with RNA in a sequence-unspecific manner, and its activity is regulated by phosphorylation. PHAX is also involved in the transcription and nuclear export of histone mRNAs, playing a role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by influencing the expression of histone variant H2AX. The protein's interactions with other components of the RNA export machinery, such as the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) and the export receptor CRM1/Xpo1, underscore its importance in RNA processing and gene expression regulation (Kitao2008A; SEGREF2001The; Mourão2010Structure; Ohno2000PHAX).

## Structure
The PHAX protein, crucial for the nuclear export of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) in metazoans, contains a conserved RNA-binding domain (PHAX-RBD) essential for its function. This domain is part of the RNA_GG_bind domain family and is characterized by a specific sequence motif. The PHAX-RBD binds single-stranded RNA with micromolar affinity, primarily interacting with the sugar-phosphate backbone of the RNA (Mourão2010Structure).

Structurally, the human PHAX-RBD is monomeric and adopts a structured form upon RNA binding. In its RNA-bound state, the domain forms a globular structure with five alpha-helices, with the RNA-binding site involving residues in helix a4 and the loop connecting helices a3 and a4 (Mourão2010Structure). The structure is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, including those involving Phe289 (Mourão2010Structure).

The PHAX protein also contains nuclear localization signals (NLSs) necessary for its recycling back to the nucleus after export (SEGREF2001The). Phosphorylation of PHAX is crucial for the formation of the export complex, although it is not required for precomplex formation (SEGREF2001The). The RNA-binding domain's activity is not significantly affected by its phosphorylation state (SEGREF2001The).

## Function
PHAX (phosphorylated adaptor for RNA export) is a critical protein involved in the nuclear export of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) in human cells. It functions as an export adaptor, facilitating the transport of U snRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, a process essential for the assembly of spliceosomal complexes (Kitao2008A; Ohno2000PHAX). PHAX is phosphorylated in the nucleus by CK2 kinase, which is crucial for its role in forming export complexes. This phosphorylation is reversed in the cytoplasm by PP2A phosphatase, allowing the disassembly of the export complex and maintaining the directionality of RNA transport (Kitao2008A).

In addition to its role in RNA export, PHAX is involved in the transcription and nuclear export of histone mRNAs, including H2AX, which is vital for the DNA damage response (DDR). Knockdown of PHAX results in reduced H2AX mRNA levels, impairing the cell's ability to repair DNA damage efficiently (Machitani2020The). PHAX's activity is specific to certain RNA species, highlighting its specialized role in RNA processing and gene expression regulation (Machitani2020The).

## Clinical Significance
The PHAX gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in RNA transport and histone expression. Alterations in PHAX expression can affect the DNA damage response (DDR) by reducing the expression of the histone variant H2AX, which is crucial for DDR. Knockdown of PHAX leads to decreased H2AX mRNA levels, resulting in a shortage of γH2AX, a phosphorylated form essential for DDR. This deficiency impairs DNA repair mechanisms, including homologous-dependent repair (HDR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), increasing cellular sensitivity to DNA damage and potentially compromising genome stability (Machitani2020The).

In addition, deletions encompassing the PHAX gene on chromosome 5q23 have been associated with a syndromic form of Pierre Robin sequence (PRS), characterized by congenital anomalies such as cleft palate, micrognathia, and glossoptosis. Although no direct mutations in PHAX were found in PRS cases, haploinsufficiency due to these deletions may contribute to the phenotype (Ansari2014A). These findings suggest that PHAX plays a significant role in maintaining genomic integrity and that its dysregulation may be linked to developmental disorders and impaired DNA repair processes.

## Interactions
PHAX, the phosphorylated adaptor for RNA export, is integral to the transport of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids. It forms part of a complex that includes U snRNA, the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), the export receptor CRM1/Xpo1, and RanGTP. PHAX directly interacts with RNA, CBC, and Xpo1, serving as a scaffold for assembling U snRNA export complexes (SEGREF2001The). The RNA-binding domain of PHAX is evolutionarily conserved and essential for U snRNA export, binding RNA in a sequence-unspecific and phosphorylation-independent manner (SEGREF2001The).

PHAX's interaction with CBC is distinct from its RNA-binding domain and nuclear localization signals (NLSs), allowing it to bind CBC efficiently. However, this interaction is weak without other export complex components (SEGREF2001The). The RNA-binding domain of PHAX interacts with various RNA oligonucleotides, forming a defined tertiary structure upon binding. Key residues involved in RNA recognition include Leu290, Leu274, Gly287, and others, which interact with the ribose and bases of the RNA (Mourão2010Structure). These interactions are crucial for the proper localization and function of snRNAs within the cell.
