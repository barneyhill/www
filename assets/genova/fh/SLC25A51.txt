# SLC25A51

## Overview
SLC25A51 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 51, a mitochondrial carrier protein integral to the transport of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) into the mitochondria. This protein is a member of the solute carrier family 25 (SLC25), which is characterized by its role in transporting various metabolites across the mitochondrial membrane. SLC25A51 is distinguished by its pseudo-tri-symmetrical pore structure, comprising six transmembrane helices that facilitate the import of NAD+ into the mitochondrial matrix, a process essential for cellular respiration and energy metabolism (Goyal2022Dynamics; Ziegler2021Welcome). The protein's function is critical for maintaining mitochondrial NAD+ levels, supporting the electron transport chain, and enabling oxidative phosphorylation, thereby playing a vital role in cellular energy homeostasis (Girardi2020Epistasisdriven). SLC25A51's expression is widespread across various human tissues, underscoring its importance in cellular metabolism and its potential implications in diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia and other cancers (Lu2022SLC25A51; Ziegler2021Welcome).

## Structure
The SLC25A51 protein is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF), characterized by a pseudo-tri-symmetrical pore structure typical of this family. It consists of three tandemly repeated domains, each containing two transmembrane helices connected by a short matrix helix parallel to the matrix membrane (Goyal2022Dynamics; Ziegler2021Welcome). The protein's structure includes six transmembrane helices, forming a central pore that facilitates the transport of NAD+ into the mitochondrial matrix (Goyal2022Dynamics; Ziegler2021Welcome).

SLC25A51 displays distinct structural variations compared to other SLC25 family members. It lacks several charged residues in its signature motif, resulting in fewer salt bridges, which are crucial for the matrix and cytoplasmic gates (Ziegler2021Welcome). The protein also lacks the cardiolipin-binding motif 1 but retains other motifs such as the GXXXG motif and cardiolipin-binding motif 2 (Ziegler2021Welcome). Cardiolipin binding occurs at three distinct sites on the protein, influencing its activity (Goyal2022Dynamics).

The binding of NAD+ is facilitated by electrostatic interactions, particularly involving residues E132 and E139, which are crucial for the transport process (Goyal2022Dynamics). The protein's structure is stabilized by specific hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions, which are essential for its function in mitochondrial NAD+ import (Goyal2022Dynamics).

## Function
SLC25A51 is a mitochondrial carrier protein that plays a crucial role in the transport of NAD+ into mitochondria, a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production in human cells. This protein is a member of the solute carrier family 25 (SLC25), specifically involved in the mitochondrial NAD+ transport, which is vital for cellular respiration and energy metabolism (Girardi2020Epistasisdriven; Ziegler2021Welcome).

The transport of NAD+ by SLC25A51 supports the mitochondrial electron transport chain, facilitating oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis, which are critical for cellular energy homeostasis (Girardi2020Epistasisdriven). SLC25A51 is expressed across various human tissues, with notable expression in the testis, breast, bone marrow, parathyroid gland, and adipose tissues, indicating its widespread importance in cellular metabolism (Ziegler2021Welcome).

In SLC25A51-deficient cells, there is a significant depletion of mitochondrial NAD+, leading to impaired mitochondrial respiration and altered metabolic pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and fatty acid oxidation (Ziegler2021Welcome; Girardi2020Epistasisdriven). This highlights the protein's essential role in maintaining mitochondrial NAD+ levels and supporting overall cellular metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
The SLC25A51 gene is clinically significant in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Its expression levels are upregulated in leukemic cells, and higher expression correlates with poorer patient outcomes. SLC25A51 is crucial for importing oxidized NAD+ into the mitochondrial matrix, supporting oxidative metabolism, which is heavily relied upon by AML cells. Depleting SLC25A51 in AML cells leads to increased apoptosis and prolonged survival in xenograft models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. The loss of SLC25A51 shifts metabolic flux away from oxidative pathways, making AML cells more sensitive to glutamine deprivation and glutaminase inhibitors like CB-839 (Lu2022SLC25A51).

Beyond AML, high levels of SLC25A51 have been implicated in other cancers, such as ovarian cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it promotes cancer progression through SIRT5 activation (Lu2022SLC25A51). In secondary renal amyloidosis, SLC25A51 protein levels are elevated in patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Gupta2021Differential). These findings indicate that SLC25A51's altered expression or interactions can significantly impact disease progression and patient outcomes in various conditions.

## Interactions
SLC25A51, a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, is involved in mitochondrial NAD+ import and interacts with various proteins and molecules to perform its function. It has been shown to interact with cardiolipin, a phospholipid essential for its activity. Cardiolipin binds to three specific sites on SLC25A51, and these interactions are crucial for the protein's function, as mutations that disrupt these interactions result in loss of activity (Goyal2022Dynamics).

The protein also forms a stable salt bridge between residues E139 and K236, which is necessary for its activity. Disruption of this salt bridge impairs the protein's ability to increase mitochondrial NAD+ levels (Goyal2022Dynamics). SLC25A51 interacts with NAD+ through electrostatic interactions, particularly involving the nicotinamide ring of NAD+ and specific residues like E132 and E139 within the protein's pore. These interactions are essential for the transport process, as they disrupt a matrix gate formed by a salt-bridge interaction (Goyal2022Dynamics).

SLC25A51 also shows genetic interactions with other mitochondrial transporters, such as SLC25A3, and has negative interactions with SLC2A1/GLUT1, indicating its role in cellular energetics and metabolism (Girardi2020Epistasisdriven).
