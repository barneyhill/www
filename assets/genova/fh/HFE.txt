# HFE

## Overview
The HFE gene encodes the homeostatic iron regulator protein, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of iron metabolism. This protein is structurally homologous to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and is involved in modulating the interaction with the transferrin receptor (TfR1), thereby influencing iron uptake and maintaining systemic iron homeostasis (Feder1998The; Bennett2000Crystal). The HFE protein forms a complex with beta-2 microglobulin (β2M), which is essential for its stability and function. Mutations in the HFE gene, such as C282Y and H63D, are associated with hereditary hemochromatosis, a genetic disorder characterized by excessive iron accumulation in the body, leading to various clinical complications (Waheed1997Hereditary; Barton2015HFE). Understanding the structure and function of the HFE protein is crucial for elucidating its role in iron homeostasis and the pathogenesis of related disorders.

## Structure
The HFE protein is a 348-residue type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is homologous to class I MHC molecules (Bennett2000Crystal). Its primary structure includes notable mutations such as Cys260Tyr and His41Asp, which are significant in hereditary hemochromatosis (Lebrón1998Crystal). The secondary structure of HFE resembles that of class I MHC molecules, featuring an α1-α2 superdomain that forms a platform of an eight-stranded antiparallel β-sheet topped by two α-helices (Lebrón1998Crystal; Bennett2000Crystal). 

The tertiary structure of HFE includes the α3 domain and β2-microglobulin (β2m), with a narrower and shallower peptide-binding groove compared to classical MHC molecules, which explains its lack of peptide binding (Drakesmith2000The; Bennett2000Crystal). The quaternary structure involves HFE binding to the transferrin receptor (TfR) to form a complex with twofold symmetry, where one HFE molecule contacts each chain of the TfR homodimer (Bennett2000Crystal). 

HFE undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, and forms soluble HFE/β2m heterodimers when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Lebrón1998Crystal). The protein's structure is further stabilized by disulfide bonds, such as between Cys-260 and Cys-203 (Lebrón1998Crystal).

## Function
The HFE gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of iron metabolism in healthy human cells. The HFE protein is homologous to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins and interacts with the transferrin receptor (TfR) to modulate iron uptake. This interaction decreases the affinity of TfR for iron-loaded transferrin, thereby regulating iron absorption and maintaining systemic iron homeostasis (Drakesmith2000The; Feder1998The; Barton2015HFE).

In healthy cells, the HFE protein forms a complex with beta-2 microglobulin (β2M), which is essential for its stability and cell surface expression. This complex is involved in modulating the function of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), enhancing its recycling rate and increasing its steady-state level at the cell surface, which facilitates the uptake of transferrin-bound iron (Waheed2002Regulation).

The HFE protein is expressed in various tissues, including gastric epithelial cells, macrophages, and liver cells, and is involved in iron transport and regulation. Its proper function is essential for preventing iron overload conditions such as hereditary hemochromatosis, characterized by excessive iron accumulation (Bennett2000Crystal; Barton2015HFE).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HFE gene are primarily associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive iron absorption and accumulation in the body. The most common mutation linked to HH is C282Y, which disrupts the HFE protein's ability to bind to β2-microglobulin, preventing its proper cell surface expression and interaction with the transferrin receptor (TfR). This disruption leads to increased iron absorption and deposition in tissues, resulting in conditions such as liver cirrhosis, diabetes, and heart disease (Waheed1997Hereditary; Feder1998The).

Another mutation, H63D, is also associated with HH, particularly in compound heterozygous individuals with one C282Y allele. This mutation affects the HFE protein's ability to modulate iron uptake, contributing to iron overload (Barton2015HFE; Lyon2001Hereditary). The S65C mutation, although less common, can also result in mild iron overload, especially when combined with other mutations (Barton2015HFE).

These mutations lead to increased transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels, which are diagnostic markers for HH. Genetic testing for these mutations is crucial for diagnosing HH and differentiating it from other iron overload conditions (Lyon2001Hereditary).

## Interactions
The HFE protein interacts with the transferrin receptor (TfR1) to regulate iron uptake. This interaction is crucial for iron homeostasis, as HFE forms a stable complex with TfR1, which decreases the receptor's affinity for transferrin, the iron-carrying protein (Feder1998The). The interaction involves specific regions of the HFE protein, including the α1 and α2 helices, which form a binding interface with TfR1 characterized by intermolecular hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (Bennett2000Crystal). 

Mutations in the HFE gene, such as C282Y and H63D, affect its interaction with TfR1. The C282Y mutation disrupts the HFE-TfR1 interaction, preventing the formation of the complex and allowing high-affinity transferrin binding to the uncomplexed TfR1 (Feder1998The). The H63D mutation, while allowing interaction with TfR1, does not increase the transferrin-binding affinity (Feder1998The).

HFE also interacts with other proteins involved in iron metabolism, such as transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) and hemojuvelin (HJV). These interactions form a membrane-associated protein complex important for the regulation of hepcidin, a key hormone in iron metabolism (D’Alessio2012The). The interaction with TfR2 and HJV is non-competitive, whereas the interaction with TfR1 is competitive (D’Alessio2012The).
