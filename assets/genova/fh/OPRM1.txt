# OPRM1

## Overview
The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), a critical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the modulation of pain, reward, and addictive behaviors. MOR is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, where it interacts with endogenous opioids such as endorphins and enkephalins, as well as exogenous opioids like morphine, to mediate analgesic and euphoric effects (Knapman2014Cellular; Ravindranathan2009Functional). The receptor's structure is characterized by seven transmembrane helices, typical of GPCRs, and its function is modulated by post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and palmitoylation, which influence receptor dimerization and signaling (Zheng2012Palmitoylation; Convertino2015μOpioid). Genetic variations in OPRM1, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, can significantly impact receptor function and individual responses to opioids, with implications for pain management and addiction treatment (Shabalina2008Expansion; Walter2013µOpioid).

## Structure
The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. The primary structure of MOR consists of a sequence of amino acids forming seven transmembrane (7-TM) helices, characteristic of GPCRs (Cuitavi2021The; Convertino2015μOpioid). The secondary structure includes these alpha-helical transmembrane domains, which are crucial for the receptor's function (Convertino2015μOpioid).

The tertiary structure of MOR involves the folding of these helices into a functional receptor capable of binding ligands and interacting with G proteins. The receptor's quaternary structure may involve homodimerization, which is stabilized by palmitoylation and cholesterol interactions (Zheng2012Palmitoylation).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and palmitoylation are essential for MOR's proper functioning and membrane localization. Glycosylation occurs at specific asparagine residues, while palmitoylation involves the addition of a palmitate group to a cysteine residue, facilitating receptor dimerization (Cuitavi2021The).

OPRM1 undergoes extensive alternative splicing, resulting in over 30 splice variants. These variants include the traditional 7-TM domain structure and a 6-TM domain structure, with the latter implicated in opioid-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance (Cuitavi2021The; Convertino2015μOpioid).

## Function
The OPRM1 gene encodes the μ-opioid receptor, a critical component in modulating various physiological processes in humans, including nociception, analgesia, reward, and stress responses (Knapman2014Cellular). This receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that primarily interacts with endogenous opioids like endorphins and enkephalins, as well as exogenous opioids such as morphine (Ravindranathan2009Functional). Upon activation, the μ-opioid receptor couples with heterotrimeric G proteins, particularly the Gαi/o subunits, leading to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, reduced cAMP levels, and subsequent modulation of ion channels (Knapman2014Cellular).

The receptor's function is significantly influenced by its ability to form homodimers, a process stabilized by palmitoylation and cholesterol interactions. These modifications are crucial for effective G protein coupling and receptor signaling (Zheng2012Palmitoylation). The receptor is predominantly active in the central nervous system, where it plays a role in pain modulation, mood regulation, and addictive behaviors (Ravindranathan2009Functional). Variations in the OPRM1 gene, such as non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms, can alter receptor function, impacting individual responses to opioids and potentially influencing clinical outcomes (Knapman2014Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the OPRM1 gene, which encodes the μ-opioid receptor, have significant clinical implications, particularly in pain management and addiction. The 118A>G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is one of the most studied variants. It results in a receptor with altered N-glycosylation, leading to reduced signaling efficiency and lower receptor expression. This variant is associated with higher opioid dosing requirements in peri- and postoperative settings, although its clinical impact is considered small (Walter2013µOpioid). 

The rs563649 SNP, located in a newly identified exon 13, is linked to higher pain sensitivity and decreased analgesic response to opioids, suggesting it codes for a low-efficiency receptor variant (Shabalina2008Expansion). This SNP is part of a haplotype associated with increased pain sensitivity and substance dependency (Shabalina2008Expansion).

Other variants, such as the R181C and L85I, affect receptor signaling and internalization, potentially influencing opioid responsiveness and tolerance (Ravindranathan2009Functional). These genetic variations in OPRM1 contribute to individual differences in pain perception, opioid efficacy, and susceptibility to addiction.

## Interactions
The OPRM1 gene encodes the μ-opioid receptor, which interacts with various proteins to modulate signaling pathways. FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) directly interacts with OPRM1, particularly at the Pro 353 residue in the receptor's C-terminal tail. This interaction modulates receptor phosphorylation and protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) activation, influencing the receptor's response to agonists like morphine and etorphine (Qiu2013FK506Binding). FKBP12's association with OPRM1 decreases agonist-induced phosphorylation at Ser 375, affecting PKCε activation and recruitment to the receptor complex (Qiu2013FK506Binding).

Cholesterol also plays a crucial role in OPRM1 function by stabilizing receptor structures and facilitating receptor and G protein coupling. Cholesterol is essential for maintaining membrane nanodomains that support receptor oligomerization and function (Gahbauer2016Membrane-Mediated). Palmitoylation of OPRM1 at C3.55(170) enhances receptor homodimerization and G protein coupling, with cholesterol association being critical for these processes. This interaction is necessary for effective receptor signaling and is supported by computational models and experimental data (Zheng2012Palmitoylation).
