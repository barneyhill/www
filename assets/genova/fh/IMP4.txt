# IMP4

## Overview
The IMP4 gene encodes the IMP U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein 4, a protein that plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis. This protein is a component of the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, which is essential for the maturation of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a key component of the small ribosomal subunit. The IMP4 protein contains a σ70-like RNA binding motif and a coiled-coil region, which are crucial for its interactions with other proteins, such as hImp3 and hMpp10, within the snoRNP complex (Granneman2003The). These interactions facilitate the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) within the nucleolus, contributing to the assembly and function of ribosomes (Zhao2019Sas10). Additionally, IMP4 has been implicated in telomere function, as it can bind to single-stranded telomeric DNA, highlighting its multifaceted role in RNA metabolism (Hsieh2007The).

## Structure
The human IMP4 protein is encoded by a cDNA that reveals an amino acid sequence identical to a previously described putative human Imp4p homolog. The predicted molecular mass of hImp4 is 33.7 kDa. It contains a σ70-like RNA binding motif and a coiled-coil region, as well as an Imp4 domain identified through Interproscan (Granneman2003The). The σ70-like motif is crucial for binding to hMpp10, and amino acid substitutions in this motif and the Imp4 domain reduce binding efficiency, highlighting their importance in protein interactions (Granneman2003The).

The hImp4 protein localizes to the nucleoli and interacts with the human U3 snoRNP complex, suggesting a role in ribosomal RNA maturation (Granneman2003The). It forms a ternary complex with hImp3 and hMpp10, which is essential for the maturation of 18S rRNA, a component of the ribosomal small subunit (Zhao2019Sas10). The complex is associated with the U3 snoRNA, which guides the cleavage of the 35S pre-rRNA (Zhao2019Sas10). The Brix domain of Imp4p, a homolog, is involved in RNA binding, suggesting that similar domains in hImp4 may contribute to its function (Hsieh2007The).

## Function
The IMP4 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, which plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis. In healthy human cells, the IMP4 protein is involved in the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) within the nucleolus, specifically contributing to the maturation of 18S rRNA, a key component of the small ribosomal subunit (Granneman2003The; Zhao2019Sas10). 

IMP4, along with hImp3 and hMpp10, forms a ternary complex that interacts with U3 snoRNA in 60-80S ribonucleoprotein complexes. This interaction is essential for the proper folding and processing of pre-rRNA, which is necessary for the assembly and function of ribosomes (Granneman2003The). The protein localizes to the nucleoli, and its interaction with hMpp10 is crucial for its nucleolar localization, which is important for its function in ribosome biogenesis (Granneman2003The).

The IMP4 protein contains an s70-like RNA binding domain, which is important for its role in RNA processing. This domain facilitates the protein's interaction with other components of the ribonucleoprotein complex, contributing to the assembly and function of the ribosomal RNA processing machinery in human cells (Granneman2003The).

## Interactions
The human IMP4 protein is a component of the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, which plays a crucial role in the maturation of 18S rRNA. IMP4 interacts with other proteins such as IMP3 and MPP10, forming a ternary complex that associates with the U3 snoRNA in larger ribonucleoprotein complexes, sedimenting at 60-80S in glycerol gradients (Granneman2003The). This complex is essential for the early cleavage steps in pre-rRNA processing, necessary for forming the small ribosomal subunit RNA (18S rRNA) (Granneman2003The).

IMP4 also interacts with single-stranded telomeric DNA, similar to its yeast counterpart Imp4p. This interaction is part of its dual role in RNA metabolism and telomere function, as it binds to single-stranded telomeric DNA and U3 snoRNA (Hsieh2007The). The Brix domain of IMP4 is involved in binding to U3 snoRNA, and the protein is capable of binding to other RNA species, which is crucial for its role in RNA processing (Hsieh2007The). The s70-like motif within IMP4 is essential for its interaction with MPP10, highlighting its role in forming stable protein complexes necessary for ribosome biogenesis (Gallagher2004Twohybrid).
