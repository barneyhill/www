# FANCD2

## Overview
FANCD2 is a gene that encodes the FA complementation group D2 protein, a pivotal component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway. This protein is integral to the maintenance of genomic stability, primarily through its role in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks and double-strand breaks. The FA complementation group D2 protein functions as part of the ID complex, in association with FANCI, and is characterized by its α solenoid structure and unique Tower domain, which are essential for DNA interaction and repair processes (Liang2016The; Joo2011Structure). Activation of the protein through monoubiquitination is crucial for its recruitment to DNA damage sites, where it collaborates with other repair proteins such as BRCA2 and RAD51 (Nepal2017FANCD2; Hussain2004Direct). Beyond its nuclear functions, the FA complementation group D2 protein also plays a role in mitochondrial homeostasis, underscoring its multifaceted importance in cellular health (Zhang2017Fancd2). Mutations in the FANCD2 gene are linked to Fanconi anemia and increased cancer susceptibility, highlighting its clinical significance (Nepal2017FANCD2; Mantere2017Case-control).

## Structure
The FANCD2 protein is a crucial component of the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway, forming a complex with FANCI known as the ID complex. The structure of this complex has been elucidated at a resolution of 3.4 Å, revealing that both FANCD2 and FANCI predominantly consist of α helices arranged in antiparallel pairs, forming α solenoids. Each protein contains four distinct α solenoid segments, with additional helical domains (HD1 and HD2) interspersed between some solenoids (Joo2011Structure).

The ID complex has a trough-like shape with a highly positive electrostatic potential interior, which facilitates binding to both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA. The monoubiquitination sites of FANCD2 (K559) and FANCI (K522) are located within the ID interface in solvent-accessible tunnels, suggesting a role in stabilizing the complex upon DNA damage-induced phosphorylation and monoubiquitination (Joo2011Structure).

FANCD2 also features a novel Tower domain, which is essential for interacting with DNA structures that mimic a replication fork arrested at an interstrand crosslink (ICL). This domain is crucial for the recruitment of the FANCD2-FANCI complex to ICLs and is implicated in disease-causing mutations in Fanconi anemia patients (Liang2016The). Monoubiquitination of FANCD2 is a critical post-translational modification necessary for its function in DNA repair (Nepal2017FANCD2).

## Function
The FANCD2 gene encodes a protein that is a central component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. FANCD2 is involved in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks and double-strand breaks, processes essential for preventing chromosomal abnormalities. The protein is activated through monoubiquitination, a modification necessary for its recruitment to sites of DNA damage, where it forms nuclear foci and interacts with other DNA repair proteins such as BRCA2, RAD51, and PCNA (Nepal2017FANCD2; Fan2009A; Hussain2004Direct).

FANCD2 plays a significant role in the homologous recombination repair process and is involved in the regulation of replication fork stability, ensuring proper DNA replication and cell cycle progression. It is also implicated in the ATM signaling pathway, contributing to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage (Nepal2017FANCD2; MoesSosnowska2019Clinical).

Beyond its nuclear functions, FANCD2 has a non-canonical role in mitochondrial function. It localizes to mitochondria and interacts with components of the mitochondrial nucleoid complex, influencing mitochondrial biosynthesis and homeostasis (Zhang2017Fancd2). These activities highlight FANCD2's importance in preserving genomic integrity and cellular health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FANCD2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which is crucial for DNA damage repair. Fanconi anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital abnormalities, and a predisposition to cancers, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and squamous cell carcinoma (Nepal2017FANCD2; Smetsers2012Heterozygote). 

A specific mutation, Leu153Ser, in the FANCD2 gene has been linked to severe chemotherapy toxicity in pediatric patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). This mutation results in reduced levels of the FANCD2 protein, leading to chromosomal instability and increased sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, which can exacerbate chemotherapy side effects (Borriello2006A).

FANCD2 mutations are also implicated in hereditary breast cancer susceptibility. The c.2715 + 1G > A mutation has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in certain populations, suggesting its role as a moderate risk allele for the disease (Mantere2017Case-control). These mutations can lead to genomic instability, contributing to cancer progression (Nepal2017FANCD2).

## Interactions
FANCD2 is a crucial protein in the DNA damage response pathways, interacting with several other proteins to facilitate DNA repair. It directly interacts with BRCA2, specifically at the C-terminal region of BRCA2, which is significant for its role in DNA repair processes. This interaction is independent of DNA damage and occurs naturally during the S-phase of the cell cycle (Hussain2004Direct). FANCD2 also forms a complex with FANCG, XRCC3, and BRCA2, known as the D1-D2-G-X3 complex, which is involved in homologous recombination repair. The formation of this complex is dependent on the phosphorylation of FANCG at serine 7 (Wilson2008FANCG).

FANCD2 interacts with FOXO3a in response to oxidative stress, a process that requires FANCD2 monoubiquitination. This interaction is specific to oxidative stress conditions and is not observed with other genotoxic agents (Li2010Oxidative). Additionally, FANCD2 is part of the mitochondrial nucleoid complex, interacting with proteins such as Atad3 and Tufm, which are essential for mitochondrial function (Zhang2017Fancd2). These interactions highlight FANCD2's multifaceted role in maintaining genomic and mitochondrial integrity.
